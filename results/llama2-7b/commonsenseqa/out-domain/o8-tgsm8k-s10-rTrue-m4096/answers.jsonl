To save costs, the car manufacturer places the fuel pump approximately in the center of the fuel tank so that the rectangular prism in which the pump is located has the same area as the rectangular prism into which the tank would otherwise have fit. Express as an ordered pair, $<R^2,0>$, the fraction of the weight of the original car which is now within the rectangular prism containing the car's fuel pump?\nOutput: Since there are 50% of total weight within the tank, 1/2 the tank volume must be used to store fuel. Since the entire mass of the tank can be considered a single box with a rectangular prism shape, so the volume represents the area of the rectangle. So (1/2)*(width*length) = volume\nThis simplifies to (width*length)/2 = volume, which equals R = (width) + length. This means the rectangle is of size R, and volume = area*height = 4*R = volume. We see that 4/2 = 2, or the amount of mass in the original tank which now occupies the rectangular box around the pump. In other words, half of the fuel is found in the box around the pump, as opposed to the original tank.\n\nInput:In a town, there are $156$ shops, restaurants, and cafes, but $100$ of them are bakeries.

I'm also charged a 5% tax. Every week, I spend $205 at the register. How much do I pay in tax each week?\nOutput: One day of purchases has one hour of time spent at checkout. So it'd be $205 * 0.5 = <<205*0.5=102>>102. Then add the 5% tax so we have $102 * 0.05 = <<102*0.05=5.1>>5.1 So my total is $102 + 5.1 = <<102+5.1=107.1>>107.1\nMy weekly total is $107.1 * 7 = <<7*107.1=754.7>>754.7\nMy weekly tax is $754.7 - $102 = <<754.7-102=652.7>>652.7\nSo the total weekly tax is 652.7.\nSo my total groceries + tax come out to $107.7 in weekly.\nSo the final total for the question is 107.7\n\nInput: At noon, the sun is halfway between zenith and the horizon.

Ponds are small and covered in ice.  The world is full of large bodies of water which are either saltwater (seas) or freshwater (ponds).  Ponds may contain fish, but seas contain other animals that are unable to breathe air.  Ponds have no tides, while seas have very strong tides.\nOutput: A pond is a natural body of water (usually) shallow enough that sunlight can reach the bottom.  A sea is larger than a pond and usually has lots more water (volume).  Most ponds end up filling with ice and being filled with water from the sea during the winter, but not all ponds freeze over completely and some retain fish under the ice.  Seas are always salty.  Ponds contain fish, but seawater does not contain fresh water fish.  The tides in the sea occur once a day and are much stronger (a tide is a predictable rise and fall in the level of the sea caused by the gravitational forces of the moon and sun.)\nSo the final answer here is Salt Water", "answer": "B: not noticeable"}

The tailor only wants to tell the man how much he likes his suit after he wears it himself. However, the tailer can give two reasons he likes the suit to narrow down the choices.\nSo either the tailor likes the suit a lot and has chosen the low price or he likes the suit a little and has chosen the high price. Either way, the tailor cannot make more money by telling him the price the man chose.\nBecause he likes the suit, the tailor will tell him the number he chose in the suit he wears.\nSo the three prices are 0, -24, and -201 (which, after rounding down, is close to -200).\nHowever, we are not positive where the man will choose to place the tailor, so neither of these two prices is the greatest possible cost.\nThere are six more values where the tailor likes each suit -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2.\nThey are the same as the three possible values after rounding down -25, -201, and -20.\nIf the cost was not rounded down, it would be -25, -126, and -129.\nSo the question reduces to: what is the greatest possible cost with a rounded down $50 number?\nIf a man is going to spend $50, he will only spend $50 on a suit, and he is going to be a man who is not in love with his suit.\nSo the greatest", "answer": "D: learn"}

The next morning it travels from Q to R also without turning. R is 100 miles northwest of P.  What is the distance from P to S such that the car is in the same location in the morning as it was in the evening the day before?\nOutput: The day before the car traveled from P to Q without any turning.  It traveled 100 miles in one direction and then it returned to its starting location P which was 100 miles away from Q.\nThe next morning the car travels from Q to and returns to to the same location of p without any turning.\n\nIn this situation distance is calculated by a straight line.  Using straight line for calculating distance between points P and Q we get distance as 100 miles.\nThe distance between the two points R and S is calculated using straight line.\nThe distance between R and S is 100*2 = <<100*2=200>>20\nAfter reaching point S which is 100 m away from P, the car turns 180 degree west to get to its evening home location.\nThe total distance travelled is 100 + 200 + 180 = <<100+200+180=480>> 480 miles\n\nSo the final answer 480", "answer": "D: attractive appearance"}

For it to be 6 feet lower at the end of the day than at the start of the, day would be 6/6 = 1, for r to equate to 1.\nIf r = 1 and r = 72, then we have the equation r = 1/72 or r = 72.\nAnd once we divide both sides by 1, we have 72/1 = 72\nAfter 24 hours, the water would have risen by 72 inches.

How long does it take to drive 100 miles?\nOutput: Every 10 miles travelled, the car slows down 10 times which is 10/10 = <<10/10=1>>1 mile every 10 miles.\nSo for every 100 miles, the car slows by 100/1 = <<100/1=100>> 100 miles.\nThe car therefore goes 100/5 = <<100*5=20>>27 times slower for every miles.\nSo it takes the car 10000/27 = <<10000*27", "answer": "E: larger house"}

Each of the tasks will take him 3 1/2 hours as he is currently operating at 75% capacity. If Adam spends 8 hours in the gym as he usually does after work, how many hours will he be able to get done throughout the day?\nOutput: Given 6 tasks that take 3 1/4 hours each, at 75% the total number of hours it will take to complete the work is 6 * 3 1/8 hours = <<6*3/8=10>>10 hours.  This means Adam can finish all of his tasks today before the end of his workday. That leaves 20 hours total.\nAdam typically spends 8 hours a day working out, so this leaves 12 hours.  If we add that to the 10 hours, we get 22 hours.\nSo the answer is B.\n\nInput: I went grocery shopping yesterday, but I forgot to write down everything I bought.

If the number of goals scored in 15 matches accounted for 90%, 217 players scored a goal last season. If 82 of them played on the same team, how many goals scored by the players on the same team in at least half of the matches lasts season?\nOutput:\nIf the number of goals scored by the players of the same team in 15 matches is 82*1/2(90/100), it means they scored 41 goals in the respective matches.\nThe number of goals is the total number of the goals scored by the players. We know that the total amount of goals scored in a match does not necessarily have to be positive, so the number of goals for all players minus the goals scored in the matches where they played cannot be more than 41. This means that they scored exactly 41 goals in matches.\nThe sum of the number of goals scored between 0 and positive 41 is more than 41, so there are more than 41 goals in total.\nIf 82 of them all played in matches where there were more than 41 scored goals and 8 of them in any matches where there were less than 41 goals, then 41*(81+8+1)=568 is the number of goals scored among these 82 players, and 41*82=3264 is the number of all the goals scored among all the players.\n\nTherefore, 3264-568=2696 the number of goals played in the specific matches by the players on the team was the number of goals scored.\n\n\nInput: There were 813 students in the class. 20% of them were girls. 72% of the students were boys.

We need to dump the remaining water after adding 7 more gallons.\nWhat is the new level of water?\nOutput: New level of water = 2 x (1/2) + 7, which equals 9 gallons.\nTherefore, new level of water = 9 gallons.  \nNote: We can simply solve this equation without a calculator (see Step 3 in the answer below) because half of 9 gallons is 4.5 gallons.\nSo the finalanswer is 9 gallons.  We have two solutions, either add one more gallon or add two more gallons.\nBecause either of these solutions (1 gallon vs 2 gallons) will also result in the tank being half full, these two solutions are equally likely.\n\nSolution 1:  In the equation above, if we remove the 5 from the 9 gallons, we are left with a value of 9 - 5 = 4 gallons.\nThere are two ways to get to 4 gallons: we could add 1 gallon or 2 gallons.\nTo get to 4 gallon, we only need one of these values to be true.\nWe know how much total water we need to add (7), so we now see that we have enough water to account for that.\nTherefore, the final solution is to add 1 gallon.\nSo the final solution is adding one more gallon.\n\nSolution\n2: Remove the 5 from the equation to get the following:\n9 gallon less 5 = remaining", "answer": "B: museum"}

Choices:  B: Pop Rock  C: Country D: Heavy metal E: Techno\nOutput:  A: Instruments, D: Singing\n\n\n## Solution\nIn each questions, there is a table or a formula given at the top of the page. The first question involves multiplication.\n#Multiplication\nFirst we would need to convert the table into a 2 dimensional array of 'rows', and 'columns'. In my case I created a variable named 'array'. If you were trying to solve this on paper, this would be 'array[2][5]'. Using the same logic, the final answer is '50'.\n#Instructions\nIn these questions, we use multiplication. Our code begins with 2 for loops, a for index, a for rows, and a for columns. The for rows works on the upper array (as we need an 'index') and the for columns works on the lower array.\n#Multiply by 2\nNow we use a simple multiply (in our case multiply by 2) to multiply the arrays.\n#Sum\nThe sum is the same as the multiple, as our for is indexed on the 'for columns'.\n#Store sum\nThe variable'sum', contains what I store the'sum' as.\n#Subtract 1\nTo subtract 1, the sum 'numberOfRocks', is stored in that location, and subtract 1.\n#Loop and store\nThese are simply 2 for loops in one, where we both add and store 'numberOfRocksByStoneSize' in the numberOfRocksByStillSize array.\n#Divide and store\nTo do division in python 3, all you need to do is store the output of the integer / 1 on the left of the '/' symbol and the result on the right of the '/' symbol.\n#Multiplicate and store\nNow we need to add the number of numberOfRocksByDietType each time the loop runs and multiply the sum by 2.\n#Output\nThe output of the program would have the same result at any time before executing the program.", "answer": "B: oxygen"}

How much does it cost to test for one disease 400 times a day?\nOutput: A: $3.20. 98% accurate would mean that 98% of the false positives (people who do NOT have the disease) would be caught, while 98% of those with the disease had a true positive, which costs $20 to test. 99.4% accurate would mean that if the first 494 tests were false positives of people who DID NOT have the disease, those 494 people would come back with a negative test, 99.4%, which leaves only 0.6% of people with the disease who would return a positive test. If 400 tests are taken a day, then after the first 493 tests return a negative, the final 0.6% is the last 6 people. This costs $20 * 6 = $120.  This method costs less than the others.    B: $52, because a 98% accurate test will have a total of 1 positive out of all the test results (including false positives). So if there is one positive, that means there was 1 out 496 tests, not counting the positives. This comes out to $20 * (496 - 1) = $20 * 495 = $9,900.  Thus, if it costs $9,90 per test, it would cost $495 * 400 = $9,940 to test for the disease 400 days a year\n\nInput: What is the maximum value of the function f(x) = 0.015^(x + 6) + 0.2^(x + 9) - 0.009^(x + 11) + 33, assuming that all values are between", "answer": "A: injuries"}

How could this be considered safe?\nInput:Horses are far heavier than automobiles, and are much more dangerous when involved in accidents. How could horse wrecks possibly be as common as car wrecks given these differences?\nInput:This advertisement indicates that people believed their cars to be extremely safe, even when involved in accidents small enough to warrant a description such as \"fender-bender\". How could they be so convinced that their vehicles were safe, when crashes were as common as they are today?\nOutput: A more likely explanation to me is the advertisement is describing the car as being as safe as the passenger inside the car.\nIf I'm in a car weighing 2000 lbs and my passenger weighs 180 lbs, that would mean my car is twice as safe as I am.\nThis would make the car as safe as the passenger.\nTherefore, I'd probably be as safe as my car.\nIf I crash my car with a car of the same weight it would be twice as likely to cause a bad crash and twice as likely to cause an injury considering my weight is twice as big.\nThe passenger on the other hand will not be hurt as bad as me due to their smaller size.\nTherefore to be safe in a crash you should be the lightest person in the car.\nAll this means is smaller and lighter people on average have less injuries after an accident.\nThis advertisement describes someone who had a minor accident and was not hurt.\nA minor accident doesn't involve a vehicle of 2000 pounds moving and crashing into something.\nTherefore, a passenger who weighs about 180 lbm will have some sort of protection against some amount of force given by the car if they were to survive.\nTherefore you have to ask yourself what do people think that will protect them when they're not injured.\nThe answer is they think a", "answer": "A: pass water"}

But to damage a 50 ton house, 1000+ damage must be done per crash.  To determine how many crashes would be necessary, take 15*900 = <<15.900= 14500>>14500 truck crashes and multiply by 1000 = <<14500.999=1449990>>14499,900 crashes.  For some reason, the system doesn\u2019t count 1449900, but 1449666,0!\nBut the total number of truck crashes (14500) times the damage a crash can do to the house is 1450,000 + 50,001 = <<145,000+50,002=1450999>>1450,999, the correct answer as it does not count zero.\nSo the final answers is 15*6*10^6\n\n---\n<hr><h2>\n## Chess\n\nInput: How high would a king be, if he was jumping on a field.

A load of 3,000 pounds that is evenly distributed across the two will cause the acceleration to decrease from 3.0 g to 1.5 g. Which of the following statements most accurately compares the rates of change of x to 2x. Choices: A. the rate of change of x to x is half that of the rate of change of 2x to 2x. B. the rate of change does not change. C. the rate of change will be doubled. D. the rate of change is four times that of 2x. E. the rate of change would be one-eighth the rate of change of the 2x.\nOutput: The answer here is option B. The acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time and is a vector quantity. The change in acceleration is the difference in the acceleration vectors and the rate of change of acceleration to acceleration will be the same as the acceleration vectors themselves: since 3 * g = 2 * g (2g being the force and g being the acceleration caused by weight over a point - 3g being the force and the 6 g of weight over the front of a car) and 6 * g = 12 * 0.33 = 4 * 0.66 * g (The acceleration in this case the force over the mass with respect to time).

Option B and A both have the same area of 786 square inches and would not give you 1 square leftover. Option E has 56 square inches which is the same area as 3x13 squares, and if you had the leftover space you wouldn't put 25 1 x 2 squares to take up that much space.

Seahorses are very unique in their appearance, size/shape, behavior, and much more. There are currently 44 known species of seahorses, out of which 30 are considered the best sea horse and 14 species are the worst sea horse of all.\nOur research has revealed that some of these species of sea horse are called pipehorses, leafy seahorse, tiger (leatherback) seahorses, frogfish, and more. While all seahorses are in the same genus, these species differ in their appearances and biology. The pipehorses have thin bodies but very long tubular tails, while frogfishes have paddle-shaped tails and are yellow with black spots and pimples. All of the species of seahorsem differ in their biology, so you must be cautious when approaching a new species of seahorse.\n\nSo the final answer that we found was A.\n\nInput:Treasure hunters in the 1980's believed that there was a sunken ship off the coast of New Hampshire named the \"Nancy Bell\", or possibly a ship of the same name.

I had to combine them in order to get enough toppings together. I mixed 1/3 of sauce and 3/4 of cheese together. Then, I used half of that mixture for the toppings. How many slices of cheese were used in total?\nOutput: We can first convert both sauce and cheese into slices, and then the number of slices of each from the 1/3 and the 3/4.\nTo start, we have 2/3 and 3/4, which can be converted into: <<2/3=8/21, 3/4=20/12>>\nNow, if 1/3 and 3:4 are converted into 8/21 and 20/12, those two combinations can then be added to get 8/21 + 20/13:\n  << 8/21+ 20/14 = 20/31>>\nThe rest of the pizza is 1/2, which can be converted to 1/3 and then added after the 20/33 from the topping.  <<1/3+20/33 = 20/11>>\nThe final answer needs to subtract 20/1 in order to get the final answer. <<20/12-20/11=4>>\nSo the final answer for this question is 4\n\n Input: Tom and Sally used to be in primary school together.

It is 7.48 miles to the top of the hill from where you live.  Assuming a constant speed and traffic, how quickly does your car climb the hill?\nOutput:Due to traffic, let's assume you travel at a constant speed 55mph, where:\n55mph/34mph = <<55mph/4= 13.63>>13.63 miles per hour up the hill.\nThat's a climb time of 1 * 13.6 = <<1*13.6=16.2>>16.2 hours\nSince cars can't run constantly 24/7, we need to account for the time spent at work (8 hours), and in sleep (6 hours) for a total of 14.2 hours/day.\nIf we multiply the hill climbing speed by the number of hill hours, we get 16.2*24 == <<16.2*1=36>>37.4\nSo in total, the car takes 37 hours, 1 minute to climb the hill\nSo the final answer Is 37.4\n\nInput:In your neighborhood, kids often set up lemonade stands.

{"idx": 627, "text": "For a shadow to appear, the light source must be brighter than the object that is blocking the light source, which would be the object that casts the shadow. This rule states that the light source must be bright enough to \u201clight up\u201d the surface being blocked by the shadow, or have light reflected off the object's surface, which is why the shadow always appear closest to the light source.\nBecause of this rule, shadows will never appear underneath something (on a bridge or building) or on the ground (light from the moon).\nSunset is an example of a moment in which the light source is not reflecting off the sun but is directly reaching the ground and is also an example of a time in which a shadow will not appear since the ground is already very dark when the sun is setting.\nThe sun is the light source that creates shadows. The objects casting the shadows must be blocking the sunlight directly above them for the shadows to appear on the ground underneath. If the angle of the sun and the object casting the shadow are at opposite angles, there would be an outline but no shadow since no light would reach the ground.\nSunsets and other shadows on the ground are also a good example of this rule: shadows on the ground can only form at night when the light source is not shining down.\nAnimal eyes reflect light that is reflecting off whatever the animal is standing on. For example, if an animal is standing on grass in the day or night, its eyes would appear brighter. However, if the animal was underground, its eyes wouldn't have light to be reflecting so they would appear dark.\nThe brightest color in the sky during sunrise and sunset is a result of the light reflecting off of the sun, which is the opposite of a shadow since a shadow is usually on the ground and blocks light.\nBecause of these two examples, the right answer would not be \u201cground\u201d or \u201cunder the sun\u201d, as these are where shadows would appear, because shadows would be lightened or appear darker. The right answer must be \u201cbridge\u201d because the light source is reflecting off of the bridge and it is only reflecting if the light is brighter than what it is reflecting against. This is an example of why the shadows were only visible on the bridge.\nSo the final option is B.\n\nInput: Two trains started", "answer": "D: ground"}

What is the earliest time the bus pass the depot?\nOutput: First, the bus arrives at the depot at 9 pm, which is 16 miles. Since the bus is at the depot, the bus must be 16 miles away from the depot.\nSo the bus is on the way to the stop from the depot, the cost is $2 for the bus and $5.\nThe amount of money it takes to get from the depot to a bus stop is $2 + $5 = <<2+5=7>>7\nBecause the bus is 16 miles away plus the $7 of the bus to get to the bus stop, the bus will make it to the bus stop at mid-night, which is 24 hours.\nThe bus stop is 1 mile away from the final bus stop.\nSo the final stop makes it at mid-night, minus 16 hours which equals 6am.\nSo the early time for the final stop is 6 am early or 6pm.\nSo, when the bus arrives at midnight, the bus will take 24 hours for it to take $7 to arrive at the bus-stop.

A second rocket ship took 6 weeks to arrive at the Moon. These rockets were launched separately from the surface of the Earth.  Two astronauts were on both rockets. How many astronauts visited the moon in total?\nOutput: The first rocket left at T=0, and the second rocket left at T = 1.  Both rockets took roughly the same amount of time to get to the moon (4 weeks for the first, and 6 weeks for the second).  Let T = x represent the time it took for both rockets to get to the moon.  This is the same as saying T = x + (1- x).  This is a linear equation, so we can solve it by plotting points and finding its slope, and then finding a zero.  At T=0, x=1, and at T=1, x=0.  To find the slope, we need to find the change in x, \u2206x.  Therefore,\n\u2206x = (1-0)/(0-0).\nNow let's solve that equation for x.  We know x = 1 - (\u2206x/\u03b4)(x).\nWe will solve for x first.\n\nTo solve this equation, we need to divide both sides by delta (\u03b4), 3x - 8\nSubtracting both sides by \u2206x, we are left with 3x - 3x\nDivision both sides of by 3x leaves us with 1\nDividing both sides of by x leaves us with 3\nTherefore, T = 3.\n\nSo the correct answer for the question is 3\n\nInput: Jack spent 45% of his paycheck on groceries.

A week after they fill it with water, the PH level is 6.8. When the scientists filled the aquarium with water, it was 8.0; what was the PH level 2 days before the PH was 6.8?\nOutput: The PH was 8 2 days earlier with 50% of water change rate  - 1 day PH change. To answer this question, let a day correspond to the natural number from 1 to 8. We have to use algebra to solve this. We can write the equation: Let PH = 8 Then, 8 = PH = PH-1 + 1/2 * changeRate. Rearrange to solve for PH changeRate using algebra, we get changeRate = 63/8 + 16/2 = 50/1\nHence PH changeRate = 50% and the answer is 8 - 50/1 = 1.  The PH level is 1.\nThe PH level of the aquarium is not 6.8 because the PH level is only changed 1 day earlier!\n\nInput: A farmer's chicken eggs have a rate of 1000/72 = <<1000/60>>60 eggs/dozen.

If it is really that, then for sure there will be ridicules about the company from the investors and prospective investors since it is not what the company said they will do\nThe answer for B is in order to get investors to invest in it.  The company will say it can make an easy product and to attract the investors the company will show that it can easily make it.  Even if it doesn't make an easy product but the investors don't know that because the company told them it does make an easy product.

How long did Toni take to travel to the stop?\nOutput: Two friends leave at the same time in morning every day.\n\nTherefore Toni travel the same time as Jill which means that her travelling time is also 3hr.\nThe only difference in the timings is the time taken by Jill to reach the stop. Her time at the stop has been taken care of by Toni.\n\nThis problem can easily be solved by assuming that time is the only factor that Toni needs to travel and the remaining part of it is already taken care by Jill.\nSo, 3hr - 14min = 2hr 46min\nTheir travelling time is total 4hr\nSo the answer is  -2hr 46mins", "answer": "D: table"}

The brains contain the knowledge one needs to learn magic.  Only the head of a human is delicious to her, so she will not eat the limbs.\nUnfortunately, every day in the north, evil vampires hunt down humans in order to drink their blood.  The witch can live for 100 years, and so can the vampires, so if a witch was bitten by a vampire, she will become one as well.\nThe witch has 20 heads, but she can only keep them for 30 days, and then they will rot.  She also has a vampire-slaying stick. She has a house in the south-west, which requires a 5-second walk.  Every day in the south-west she has 5 seconds of life to spare.  Every day in any other direction, she spends any unused 5-second blocks healing herself.  If at any time her health falls below 0, she dies.  On each round of the game, in addition to the 30 days she has with her heads, she also has 20 minutes.\nOutput: If she was in north-west she would take 5 seconds out of the 5-second block and spend them healing (that means she is completely fine because she takes out the maximum block size from the block).\nThen she puts her health in the health bar.

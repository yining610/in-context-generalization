Math and dancing are not social sciences, so we can eliminate choices C and E. <n><n>Step 3: Although geography and religion are part of social sciences, the question indicates that "his favorite subject was what".

Choices:  A: united states B: mexico C: countryside D: atlas E: oceans<n><n>### Response:		20% 2015-2-10 22:00:07 11.5<n>### Rationales:Step 1: We can recognize that there are two possibilities mentioned -- "map" and "atlas." We can infer that those two represent things that we can use to find our way. <n><n>Step2: The question doesn't specify either specific type of map, "map" or "atlas." In addition, "countries" is an incorrect answer because countryside refers to the area around towns or villages, rather than referring to countries. <n><n>Step3: "United States" is also incorrect because "united states" is the name of the country, rather than the name of the state or geographical region that would fit in the countryside. Only "Mexico" is a country. <n><n>Step4: "Oceans" is not a geographical region, so it cannot be the correct answer. <n><n>Step5: Both "map" and "street" refer to finding one's way. "GPS" refers to a system that helps motorists find their way. "Map" and "street" are both physical locations that can be accessed on foot, by traveling by car, etc. "GPS" is a system (of "global positioning") that is used by travelers who either don't know how their path will look or wish to avoid certain features in their environment. <n><n>Step6: The question doesn'thaveany information that would allow us to narrow the choice to "maps" or "street." Therefore, the correct answer is "highway and street GPS services."<n>Answer: D: highway and street GPS Services<n><n>### Input : The man's house was not much but very comfortable and he liked to stay where his mother?

"Where he used

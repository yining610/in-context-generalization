No more than 1 inch of water will have been added.\n\nB is incorrect. New York is a part of U.S.A, not in Louisiana.\n\nC is incorrect. A forest is not necessarily located in or near salt or freshwater marshes.\n\nD is correct. Louisiana is a coastal state in the U.S.A and Cajun is a culture (ethnicity) of the Louisiana region.

Let's break it down:\n1. What do you mean when you say *On the left*?\n2. What do you mean by *the store is called shop'N more*?\n\nThe answer is based off of the way people interpret things. If someone is traveling and they say they are going \"right\" or are \"over here, what does it mean? It means the opposite. So if they say \"left\", they meant right.\n\nTo help explain this better, let's talk about some other ways people refer to things:\nIf you ask someone about their hair color and they say \"chocolate brown\", that means they are not blonde, they are not black, nor are they light brown.

Therefore I have already given gifts and now going on a date with the intended receiver is not possible.\n\nC: cleaning house  \n\nCleaning house could refer to cleaning the given gifts before giving it to the receiver. \nAlso it could refer to cleaning up the house so that it looks attractive.  \nTherefore, this option is closest to giving a gift.\n\nD: preparing food\nThis could refer to preparing food as per what the receiver will like. However, this option is not applicable since the receiver will not receive the gifts and so the giving person do not care for their reaction to the prepared food.\n\nE: writing down notes\nThe writer had mentioned that \"I like giving gifts\" but she does not care for people receiving their gifts.

{"text": "Answer the following multiple choice question\n\n### Instructions:\nInput: What would not go on a piggy bank? Choices: \n\nA:  money B:  gems C:  treasures D:  flowers  E:  toys\nRationales:\n\nStep 1: Analyse the question, which is about what wouldn't go on a piggie bank\nStep 2: Start with eliminating incorrect choices.\n\nStep 3: Analyse individual choices.\n\nStep a:  A: money.  A piggy bank is a container for saving money and is probably not the best option for saving these things.  So, this option doesn\u2019t fit with the question.\nStep b:  B: gems.   This is jewels and not money, so B can be eliminated. C: treasures.  This has to do with objects of intrinsic value, but there is no reason to think a piggie bank would be used for this use case. So, C can be eliminating. \nStep c:  D: flowers.  Again, they aren't valuable enough to go in a piggie bank. So, D can be eliminating and we have 4 choice left. \n\nStep 4: The remaining choices are analyzed.\nStep a: E: toys.  This is an entertainment thing. It's unlikely to go into a piggie bank, and it makes more sense to put it under C, not E. so E can be eliminated\nStep b:  F: food.  Since food goes inside your body it would be a bad idea to put it in a piggie-bank.\nStep c:  G: spam cans.  These cans are for food and not money, so it's not useful to save it in a piggy-bank.\nStep d:  H: eggs.  These could go in a piggy bank, but eggs are probably best eaten rather than saved in a container.\n\nStep 5: We\u2019re left with 3 choices, so use elimination.\nStep a: A = money.

Choices: A: British B: United Bates C: F.C. D: British army E: Arm E\n\n## Rationales\n\n1. First step is to determine the person we are trying to answer for.\n\n1. Based on the question, it could be a man or woman. We don't know either way.\n\n1. We also don't know if it's anyone famous.\n\n1. Thus the only given info about the person is that they fought for the British army.\n\n1. Starting with A: ____.\n\n1. A: British - This makes little sense because it's British as in a resident of Britain or England and not the name for a British person.\n\n1. Also, if we consider it as a last name, it doesn't make sense that it would come after the given name of \"the person who fought for the British army\". \n\n1. Hence it's not the answer.\n\n1. Next, go to Choice B: United Bates.\n\n1. This seems like a really weird answer. United Bates?\n\n1. It also is probably not the name of someone who fought for the British.\n\n1. Now, we go through Choices C and D: F.C. and British army.\n\n2. Choice C: F.C.: F.C. is an acronym that means Football Club(s). It is not the identity or name of any person that fought for Britian'sf army, so it is impossible to be the answer.\n\n2. Also, the sentence structure in Choice D: British army is incorrect.\n\n2.

{"text": "Input: Where is likely to have a boat? Choices:  B: harbor C: river D: beach E: home\n\n### Rationales:\n\n1. Looking at the first response: B: harbor. The question is looking for a location that is likely to be a boat. Thus, if our goal is to find a place where a boat will likely be, our first choice should be a place where many boats are located. And that place can only be a harbor.\n\n1. Looking closely at the question, we can eliminate all the other options.\n\n2. D can't be the answer because a house isn't made of a boat (even if it's made of plastic, which actually would float, it wouldn't be a boat). It wouldn't make sense to ask Where would you find a boat? and ask about your house or the dollhouse.\n\n3. C is unlikely because beaches are typically places where boats aren't present - they're actually mostly places to swim, rest, beach and eat near the water. \n\n4. E, which is a home, can be eliminated with the same reasoning as with D.\n\n5. So, you'll find a boat in a harbor.\nAnswer: B. harbor\n\n### Input where would a spike possibly be shoved into? Choices: \n\nAnswer: C. A tree\n\n### Rationale\nLooking at the question, we have only six possible answers. Any of the six would make sense based on a question like this, but not all of the options are actually logical. If you stick with the original wording, and focus on shoving, you'll end up with the correct answer. \n\nWe look for places where spikes are inserted with force, or shoved in. We can rule out D, because a doll would not have a spike. We can rule out E because a person wouldn't put a spike through his or her hair. \n\nSo what could actually have a spike pushed into it? Trees are a good choice -- we use spikes to put up signs, or shove them into tree trunks for security reasons. So the answer is C: tree.\n\n## Input Who was first on stage when it was hot?

{"text": "Answer the following sentence pair questions.\n\n### Answer:\nInput: Sentence: \"I'm not going to leave.\" -> Question: \"Do you want to break up?\" Sentence: \"This is my last dollar.\" -> Question: \"Where did you buy this?\" Output: True\nRationales: In the sentence given, \"I'm not leaving,\" it may sound like someone wants to stay away from their partner or keep a healthy distance. Yet, it was made clear there that she was stating a fact, which meant she was not considering leaving. Therefore, \"I'm no leaving\" does not indicate a feeling or desire to stay away.\n\nOn the other hand, the sentence \"this is my last dollar\" is a true statement. It's simply saying the money in that bill is the last of what this person has. \n\nIn both scenarios, if someone says the given sentences, they could be questioned about a break up or where they bought money.\n\nTherefore, for a matching statement,  \"I'm not goin to leave.\" is false, and \"This is my last dollars,\" is true. Therefore, the matching statement \"I'm not leave\" is false, and the matching statement \"this is my last dollars\" is true.\n\nAnswer:True\n\n### Answer.\n\nInput: Sentence pair(s): \nSentence: \"I've never ridden in a helicopter before.\"\n\nQuestion: \"So what's stopping you from learning this now?\" \n\nSentence: \u201cI\u2019ll never be able to do this because I don\u2019t have the skills and talent.\u201d\n\nQuestion: \u201cHow long have you been trying to do this?\u201d \n\nOutput: True.\n\nRationale: The question \u201cSo, what's stopping you\u201d can be asked if the person has never taken a helicopter ride before or is not ready to do it. This implies there is something that\u2019s holding them back from exploring something new, like a helicopter ride.\n\nThen, the question \u201cHow long have you felt like this?\u201d. This line of questioning is only relevant if the statement says \u201cI\u2019ve never ridden in helicopter before, but I'm ready to try\u201d.\n\nBoth statements are true or false, so the questioning that follows must reflect", "answer": "C: happiness"}

In this case, the logical deduction is that the weather would have to occur \"here\" \u2014 wherever that place may be \u2014 in order for the people to be able to say something like \"the weather was beautiful.\"\n\nFinally, eliminate other explanations based on understanding the logic of the statement. Since the weather had to occur somewhere, it could not occur at \"B\" (happiness), \"C\" (change quickly), \"E\" (surprise us) or \"A\" (be beautiful). Thus, the answer is logical and \"here\" could only be option \"D\" (occur here).\n\n### Input-  Who is wearing a coat that can be found in fashion magazine pages? Choices:  -A: the cat B: the dog C: the lion D: the fox E: the mouse\n\n### Response- The correct answer is D. \n\nGive the context of the passage first.\n\n\nGiven the statement being analyzed, \"Who is \u2026\n\nStep 1: Make a logical deduction based upon the information on the given statements. In this case, logical deduction is made on the basis of understanding the fact that the animal mentioned in the statement is \u2026\n\nStep2 Eliminate answers based on the deduction made previously. Since we have logical deduction that coat can be found in Fashion magazine pages, there is no option left for cat, the dog and the lion. So the correct answer is fox.", "answer": "A: look beautiful"}

Response2 : Do I have a unique ability?\n\n\n### Rationale:Analysis Step 1: Understanding the question.\nThe question is asking if I am a person, what ability do I have that is unique among people.\n\nStep 2:\nEvaluation:\nLooking at the given options:\nA: Cross street - Crossing a street can be classified as being able to take some actions to accomplish a task, but in most cases, I would not describe crossing a street as being a unique ability. \nB: Stand upright - Standing upright comes fairly easily for most people and is not considered a unique ability in most cases. While there are people who have difficulty with standing upright, in most cases, for a healthy adult, standing upright is not hard and would not be viewed as being a unique ability for that activity.\nC: Speak Chinese - This is only a unique ability for those who are Chinese and thus would not be considered a unique ability for all people.\nD: Speak spanish - This is only a language, not a unique ability, as many people can already speak Spanish.\nE: Further education - This is a broad statement not related to a particular ability that can be performed by all people.\nStep 3\nAfter the analysis of Step 2, it becomes apparent that choices A, B, C and E are definitely not the answer choices for this question. That leaves us with choice D: Speak Chinese and A: Cross street.\nStep 4\nBased on the analysis above, the unique ability is D: Speak Chinese, as most other people cannot or choose not to speak Chinese.\nAnswer: D, Speak Chinese  \nAs for the ability, the closest ability is crossing streets, although not all people would be able to accomplish it easily or consider that ability to be unique. But that still leaves us with at minimum a response of \"What do you mean by: if I am a person?\" followed by answer \"Do I have a unique ability?\"\n\n### Input : Why were cars sold to farms?

Companionable: can refer to a relationship between two people or a relationship or connection between an object and someone.\n4. Likely: would refer to someone who is thinking of this person.

You can have love for a person, like your mom for example, but would never have love for the mom or love for the person or for the mom.\nThis could mean that one cannot love for a tv.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n1.  An answer has a description and a feeling. If the feelings is more specific then it is more likely to be the answer. For Example, if the feeling is detachment, then the answer can be detachment. This is because detachment is a specific feeling that is more accurate and descriptive.\n2. Another option is to see which answer you can make and which is impossible to make. To make an answer, you have to describe it. Because you cannot describe every situation where the feelings might apply, you have to see what can be done and what cannot be done. For example, this situation can be described like this: A girl loves her boyfriend, but she can still feel detachement or a feeling of \"I love you but I need to be married to someone else.\"\n\n### Explanation\nThis person can feel different emotions due to the different types of love the question asks for.

{"text": "Reasoning\nInput:The person knew the policeman was after him,...\n1. We are given information by the person who knows the police was after him, so first of all we should think about what they will do, and we can eliminate options B: catch cold and E: hunt for fruit.\n\nOption B: catch cold. This option is describing the action of a police officer after catching a criminal that has done something wrong.\n\nOption E: hunt for fruits. This option is describing a criminal who is going to do something illegal or bad, so we cannot choose this option.\n\n2. Next, we need to analyze the actions from the police which are the choice in this question: A: the sun, B: prepare to go,... \n\nOption A: The sun. According to the question, the person knows that the police is after him, so when a person feels pressured or threatened, they can do things to make the problem go away. The first thing that comes to a criminal's mind is to escape. If a criminal wants to get away from the police and also doesn't have a weapon, one way to escape is to hide. You can hide in crowds, or you can hide in nature and take the path that no one takes. If the person didn't want to hide themself the best way to do it is to use the power which is most important in the universe, which is the power of the sun. So, this means that at night, the sun does not have much power, so the criminal would choose to go to bed. In such a situation, the criminal cannot catch the police. So for this reason, we can pick choice B and we can see that the reasoning is \"the sun\". \nAnswer: B: prepare to go\n### Instructions: What did the person's mother say while he looked at the calendar?

There are multiple meanings for the word 'race' when referring to humans. Races could be defined by a shared gene pool or heritage.\n3. Therefore, it is best to avoid the word 'race.' Instead, let's use a different concept that can express the same idea.\n4. In this context, we can understand the race based on their genetic similarity\n5. Evaluate each choice:\n A: Finger- To eliminate this option B: own family - This is not a shared gene pool, but rather a shared bloodline and a shared environment in one's family group. Hence it cannot be considered race.\n C: Good health - Although this may be a shared characteristic between people, it does not refer to shared genetic characteristics, so it cannot be considered race in this context.\n D: Friends- Same as C\n E: People- This choice is an option for the person with brown skin to identify as their race, but cannot be used to answer the question.\n6.

This is why when we build paved roads, we need to start with dry soils because if the soils are already wet, they will become solidified and we will have less traction.\n- Option B: Solids cannot melt but they do evaporate, so it is possible to use Option B to eliminate choices.\n- Option D: When it is hot outside, the ground also gets warm. But Option D is a feeling and not a state.\n- Option E: If the ground gets wet from the rain or the dew, the ground could feel cold, but it only means that we can step on the ground and it's not freezing. This also would not make our skin rash. Therefore, Option E cannot be the correct option as the question is referring to skin rashes which can't happen from normal wetness.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe question is referring to options that could be happening near you when the ground is getting wet.\n\nFirst, we eliminate Option A: solidifying. This is the possibility that the ground becomes hard when it rains. This is an incorrect option because the question is not asking about states of soil texture but instead the possibility of states that happen near us when we are feeling wetness from the ground.\n\nNext, we look at Option B: melting. This option is not applicable because the ground can never melt. If the condition of the ground is getting wet, then at most it may evaporate.\n\nOption C: getting cold was already removed from the list of possibilities because this is a feeling and not an actual state.\n\nBy the end of our eliminating steps, we are left with Option D: feeling cold. This is what could be happening around us when the ground is wet. Then we eliminate Option E: skin rash. Skin rash is a feeling and not what is happening around us when the soil texture is getting wet.\nThat leaves us as follows:\n\nOption D: Feeling cold\n\nAnswer: Option: D: Feeling", "answer": "B: melting"}

{"text": "Input:  Which of the following best describes a city planning to have a tourist-friendly environment? Choices:  (A) Improved infrastructure (B) Enforcement of regulations (C) Restructuring a land use plan (D) Promoting businesses (E) Increasing funding to attract new industries\nRationales:\n1. First let\u2019s quickly understand the statement of the question which is asking what is the city trying to do. Increasing funding and promoting businesses isn\u2019t what the city is trying to do so these can be omitted, now let\u2019s have a look at the remaining options.\n2. Improved infrastructure - This does not seem like an option which will make the tourist-friendly. While it will of course attract tourists to some degree it isn\u2019t very likely that improved infrastructure will make a tourist-friendlier environment.\n3. Enforcement of regulation - Again enforcing regulations isn\u2019t what the question is asking about, however we can say this is a very necessary step in the process of improving your infrastructure which isn\u2019t necessarily the case. So enforcement is not an option.\n4. Restructuring a land-use plan - This option is essentially a step required to improve the infrastructure which is again needed to have a better tourist-friendly atmosphere.\n5. Promoting businesses - Now this option is really what the question is asking, the question asks to consider what the city is trying, the options are to increase funding to attract industries or promote businesses.\n\n6. As we can see both options attract businesses, which are promising but in the end what matters is that whether the city is going to attract tourists or businesses that ultimately attract more people to the city and make it more tourist-friendly, if funding to attract industires is not increasing funding to the tourist-friendliness in it then promoting business is not the best choice because it will be just as if city is trying to promote itself as a business hub not considering its tourist-friendlinest atmosphere. (A) Improving the infrastructure seems like something really good but it again isn\u2019t what the tourist-friendlier atmosphere is all about so it can be ruled out. (C) Restructured land-use plan is a step required", "answer": "A: supermarket"}

{"text": "Step 1: Analyse the question, which is looking for the essential need to have before purchasing a product.\nStep 2a: Look at the first word, \"you\", and ask yourself whether it refers to a person or something inanimate, as some questions can either be answered by the subject or by an object/thing. In this case, our subject is a person, so the statement is about what a person needs before purchasing a product, which can be represented as a set of actions.\nStep 2b: Ask yourself if the action before purchase refers to an activity or an inaction. As we already know our subject is active, the statement refers to an activity, so the action needs to be completed.\nStep 2c: Check that the action is not one of the choices given in the question or part of them. We find that the choice for \"time\" is missing the action, which is to work or take time to earn money.\nStep 2d: Check that the action (earning money) is not part of an object. \"Spending money\" is an action and is the object.\nStep 3a: Apply eliminations to narrow the choices.\nStep 3b: We can eliminate \"time\" as the earning of it is needed first, even before getting a spending money. We can eliminate \"spending money\" as it is the object and not an action.\nStep 3c: We can eliminate \"need\" as need is only required to buy.\nStep 4b: We can eliminate the choice \"desire\" as the statement has a word which means \"to desire\" as a verb, and it is not allowed to have any vowel twice. We also observe that it is not the object but the subject, which is a person, as we already ruled out a lack of \"need\" for the choice \"needs\" and the first word of the sentence must be completed by a noun.\nStep 4c: We can eliminate the action \"time\" again as we already eliminated it.\nStep 4d: We can eliminate \"money\" as it is not the action but the object.\nStep: Step 4e: We can eliminate \"to buy\" as it is a verb and we already found the action.\nStep 5a: Putting all together, the answer is B \"spending money.\"\n\n##", "answer": "C: money"}

Notice keywords such as \"home\" and \"I was comfortable\" and \"I had a crippling [feeling] of going where.\" This will tell you what the statement is about. In this case, it talks about someone who's had an experience in their home but may experience a fear of going where.\n2. Question/statement: \"I was comfortable. But I had a cripping fear of going where?\" \nThe problem statement is split at the point when the question is asked. Specifically, the feeling I had of going where is in relation to when I was comfortable at home. In essence, the fear of going where is in contrast to the feeling of being at home.\n3. Feeling: We know the feeling is comfort from the problem statement. \n4. Context: We know the feeling of fear is related to the where because the problem statement talks about the contrast between the where and the feeling. \n\n5. Evaluation: If the feeling is of comfort then the place of comfort must be the context. \n\n6. Context: The statement describes home, which is the context of comfort and also the context of fear. \nThe context of the statement is home because there is a contrast between the place (home) and the feeling (fear). From this, we know the feeling of comfort must be contrasted against the where (home) to be considered comfortable, meaning the where is \"outside.\"\n\n7.

Since we said that casino was a place to go to in the last sentence.\n\nIn A, the place theatres were mentioned which is a place you go for entertainment. But the question is I am going to casino, not theatres. So, the answer here is not A.\n\nIn B, the fairgrounds are a place you go to for entertainment. But casino was the correct answer as we are going somewhere. It is like theatre is not the place you are going to, so, you can't say you are going to the theatre, i.e casinos.

From this, playfulness would be an appropriate choice for \"what are they likely to seek?\"\n\n### Inputs:Where is the first thing that you are likely to see in a home? Choises:  A: bathroom B: kitchen C: livingroom D: hall E: bedroom\n\n### Response\n```\n> The first thing one usually sees in a home is the front entrance.\n```\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n> In a home, the kitchen is located in what room? Choices: A: living room B: bathroom C: bedroom D: hall E living room\n> When you enter a home, the first thing you are likely to see is the front entrance. By definition, a bedroom is a private room designed for sleeping and/or rest for its inhabitants. It typically includes things such as a bed, nightstand, closet, and possibly a dresser. Therefore, this room is not likely part of what you see first. The same can be said for the dining room, located in a home\u2019s second room, the hall. The main purpose of a hall is to serve as a passageway for moving from one part of a building to another. The kitchen, however, is a shared space where multiple members of a household come together to cook, eat and talk. Because it is shared space, it is likely you are going to see the kitchen first when entering the home. Therefore, the best choice would be option B: bathroom, a place where you\u2019re likely to see a toilet. \n```\n\n## Task-6\n\n>  I would say that C: bedroom\n\nInput: What will you need to be eligible for a job?

But it can also be associated with mental or emotional pain or strain.\nB: Happiness - Happiness is an emotional state, not what the person suffered when reading the letter. Plus, it would be unlikely for someone to be suffering an internal emotion and be happy at the same time.\nC: Realization - Here the word'read' is used, which implies that the person was reading letters one by one. If this is about realizing something, then the word reading is incorrect. Also, the sentence about suffering begins with word 'as' which implies that they suffered as they were doing something. So, realization is out.\nD: Understanding - This does not fit the context or the way the sentence is phrased. The letter was extremely small, and it was because of this that the person began to suffer. It was not because of this that the he began to suffer. So, this choice does not fit the context.\nE: Happiness - This choice means the person suffered happiness when each letter was read. Again this does not fit the context, because there is already a question about suffering while reading letters, so the context already has a suffering statement, so we don't need another one at the end.\n\nHence, A: Strain fits the context the best", "answer": "A: strain"}

{"text": "Drugs can cause mental distortion, alter conscious perceptions, and impair the mind and/or body. So, drugs can affect one's IQ, cause illness, or lead to accidents.\n\n### Rationales:\nDrugs that impair cognitive function such as stimulants and depressants can lead to lowered IQ because they cause chemical imbalances in the brain over time and may impair memories. Drugs such as opiates and opioids are known to cause depressive effects in the user, resulting in cognitive impairment and impotence.\n\nSome drugs, such as marijuana, may lead to dizziness, hallucinations, and impaired motor function, leading to accidents and even hospitalization. Cocaine and methamphetamine addiction can lead to addiction, psychosis, and paranoia, which can cause a wide range of mental issues such as memory loss, emotional disorders, and even suicidal thoughts.\n\nOverall, the word drug is very broad and can have various meanings. However, the general understanding is that it is a substance that affects the person who ingests it and can have both beneficial and detrimental effects. Some examples of drugs that are legal include caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine, while many have negative effects on health and are classified as illegal. In terms of health, drugs can often be harmful over time, and their impact can vary from mild to life-altering. It's important to educate oneself about the potential risks and benefits of each type of drug and understand their possible effects on one's mental and physical well-being before choosing to use any of them.", "answer": "E: cause accidents"}

She\u2019s currently without a coat\n3. She doesn\u2019t need one\n\nSince she does not need a coat in the up coming season, we can eliminate choice g: She's cold and can't make up her mind about whether or not she needs a new coat. This is not describing her since she knows whether or not she needs to go get a coat.\n\nNext, choice b: She needs a coat for up coming season but she only has one coat, is not describing her because she does not have a coat for the up coming season.\n\nNext, elimination of choice a: She needs a coat is not describing her because he already has her coat.\n\nChoice d: She prefers wool could be describing her because she has already picked out the type of coat she wants. However, she doesn't prefer one over the other, and her option 3: she doesn't need one, would better fit that description.\n\nChoice h: She's cold but cannot decide on whether she needs a coat, is not describing the story because she did decide whether she needed a coat for the up-coming season. \n\nNow we are left with choices f: She needs to go somewhere to be warm, and c: She doesn't know if she needs a coat, both of these choices would describe her.

Choices:  A : emotions B: anxiety C : knowlege D: information E: stress\nRational: Step 1: Understand the question. It is asking what exactly the students would get from listening.\nStep 2. Understand the process: The teacher can give examples to the students to support the statement, which will aid the students in listening to her words. Knowledge, as the answer choice A, is not gained by listening. This is because of the following reasons:\nWhen a person or teacher gives information, such as facts, it does not involve emotional or mental processing. It just requires that you pay attention and listen to it. This is what A is asking for.\nBecause listening does use emotions, the emotional state of the listener changes as a result of actively processing the information being listened to.\nThis is what B, anxiety, describes. Listening creates anxiety because the listeners process what they are listening to.\nKnowledge, or C, can be gained from listening, but it is not the primary knowledge gained through this kind of listening.

{"text": "Suicide. An individual does not typically consume cyanide directly, as it is lethal and extremely toxic.

But it would be an attempt, not a definitive conclusion.\n\n### Answer: C: Sadness \n\n### Instructions :Answer the question posed.\n\n### Input :The best type of water is the best choice if you get injured or cut. Choices: A: water and salt B: salted water C: distilled water D: mineral water E: potable water\n\n### Response : Distilled water. When you get hurt or cut, it's best to use water as a cleansing agent, since it has no contaminants like salt or minerals that can cause complications. Distilled water is completely pure water that is free of salts, ions or minerals. It is also sterile, since it is free of microbes and bacteria. Thus, it is the best option for cleansing wounds.\n\n### Rationales: 1) Reasoning:\nTh understanding of the phrase \"best type of water\" and that the question is about \"injured or cut,\" it is likely that the question is referring to cleansing after a trauma, such as a cut or an injury. It's common practice to cleanse a wound with water, as opposed to salt water or mineral water, which would introduce additional complications and cause issues. For example, it could cause bleeding to slow down or stop, which could increase the risk of infections. So, it's best not to use salted water or mineral water.\n\nRationales 2) Reasoning\nA: \"water and salt\" may work, but it's preferable not to use this combination because the water could slow down the blood flow, increasing the risk of infection or other complications. The wound may not be cleansed sufficiently if salt water is used.\n\nB: The phrase \"water and salt\" is likely not talking about salt water itself as an agent, but rather a solution of \"water and salt.\" Salt can be added to water, but this doesn't necessarily involve salted water per se", "answer": "A: suicide"}

It would, therefore, be a strange placement for a dining table.\n\nFurthermore, when people arrange papers on a desk, they typically place all the papers in order. It would make no sense to put a dining table on their desk, especially when the purpose of the desk is to organize papers.  A dining room is more likely to have a dining table than a park because it is a place designed specifically for dining or socializing. A formal dining room may require a specific type of table, such as a rectangular table with chairs. Lastly, the placement of a dine-in table would not make sense in a house, as it is not a dedicated dining room.\n\nTherefore, the correct response is A: cafeterias.\n\n### Answer:", "answer": "E: house"}

Looking at option A. Stress - This doesn't fit with someone likely going in to a grocery store or market. The person is likely relaxed or happy.\n3. We see that the person is going to place in a market. This means it's possible they are making a purchase, so the person is going to spend money.\n5. Next, let's look at option E. Walking - Yes, this describes a typical activity in a market, but this is not the activity that is specifically mentioned in the question.\nStep 2.1: Let's now look at the remaining options:\n1. Option B: Food - Someone might stop in to buy some groceries for food, but food in and of itself is not specifically part of the activity of someone going into a market to buy food. So let's eliminate this one.\n2. Option C: That You - This might pertain to someone who is going in and out of a market to make purchases for others. However, the question only asks for the most likely activity of someone going to a market.\nStep3.1: That leaves us with two options: option D: Spending Money and option E: Walking. Both are reasonable possibilities for someone going into a market, so we can proceed.\nOption D: Spending money - This is most likely because someone going in to a market is likely to buy something and spending money is the most likely activity to accomplish this.\nOption E: Walking - This is also likely; someone making purchases might need to walk out and around to accomplish these purchases.\nStep3.2: Based on our analysis, the most likely activity is buying food (D). This means the final answer is: D: Spending Mone\nAnswer: D: Spending money\n\n### Input The following question contains four statements, each", "answer": "C: that you"}

Bassoons also have a different tone from the woodwinds used in symphonies.

The question asks where a printer could be used. In order to achieve the correct answer, it should be used by, at least, thousands of people.\n\nLet us then, go ahead to eliminate the answers that cannot be used by at least thousands of people.\n(i) School: There are only limited number of people allowed to use the printer in a school. The number of people is not as vast as used by thousands of people.\nTherefore, we eliminate answer A: school B: Home The number of people is relatively higher than people in a specific school but too low, compared to thousands of people. Therefore, we eliminate answer B: Home office C: People store: A people store can be a shop that sells printers or it is where people can use printers.\nWhile we are not sure a people store can be used by thousands of printers, we can eliminate these kinds of stores because it may not be able to support the number of people required.\nD: Print shop Although the number of people in a print shop can be high, the total number of people might not be as vast as at least thousands of others.\nFor now, I don't know enough about how people use a print shop to determine whether it can support thousands of users, so I'll keep an open mind about it E: Newspaper office. The total number of people that can use the newspapers is the number of people allowed in the newspaper office.\nIt seems, the newspapers office cannot accommodate thousands of people.

A fabric store sells fabric material that can be taken to a sewing tailor to get made into clothes. 2. The answer will be either B or C. These are the two options which best fit  what we know: Fabric is cut at a tailor shop, which is a place where you do get clothes and curtains. So the answer is either B or C. \n3. Now, it's time to test each of the choices individually and see which one stands out. To test each: \n4. A) Clothes: Clothes already exist and tailors only fit them on a person. You can't get cloth out of a tailor. \n5. B) Curtains: Curtains are an item you might get at a tailor.  But curtains can be ordered and cut to an individual's measurements at a shop. So, this could also work. 6. C) Curtains: The first choice was curtains so this should be eliminated. 7. D) Sandwich: Sandwiches are made with bread, not fabric. They are an item you can get at a grocery store, not a tailor shop. So, this choice is eliminated. 8. E) Jar: This sounds like a jar of peanut butter - or maybe something for storing peanut butter. It could apply to a fabric store, but the question specifically notes that we're looking of the answer to this question would be to say where the fabric is cut to order. 9.

Likewise, rest is a long-term solution and a healthy option, but you will still feel more tired when you wake up. This problem also applies to antioxidants.

{"text": "In olden times, bloodletting was used to treat medical conditions. Leeches were typically used in bloodletting procedures. Leeches are used nowadays in surgical procedures such as coronary bypass that involve the removal of fats and toxins within the body by drawing blood. An old time doctor might have tried to accomplish bloodletting to cure different disease such as arthritis or gout. However, this treatment has since been classified as \"bloodletting.\" It involves making small cuts and drawing blood through tubes. While this method was once used to prevent disease, it is now only used in rare circumstances. Leeches were often used to \"let blood\" as a form of treatment. So, they would be used to let blood, not as a means of blood-letting. This is why the answer is E: let blood.\n\nAnswer: E: let blood", "answer": "E: let blood"}

A clerk typically has to do a lot of work, including dealing with customers, completing transactions, and filling in for a manager when the manager is absent.\nStep 2b) In addition, clerk would refer to someone who works in an office as an administrative assistant. The clerk is a person whose job involves receiving things from customers and putting them in envelopes or drawers in an office. A clerk would be able to do a lot of things, including managing the money of the company. So, what does the clerk do? According to the clerk's job, he/she will place the check in an envelope or somewhere in the drawer because the clerk wants to deposit money in his/her office.\nStep 3) Evaluate the options:\n\n A: Cash register -- This is like a machine with buttons and buttons that allow you to pay when you go to a store to buy things. A cashier who works at an office also puts checks in envelopes or registers. So, a clerk working in an office or a manager of a restaurant puts checks into registers.

{"text": "A person can suffer injuries due to reckless driving. Injuries can be accidental. The definition of a reckless driver is: a driver who drives in a way that is very risky or not careful. The most important thing to note from this definition is that it is usually unintended. When someone is reckless on the road, they do so without the intention of causing harm, but often end up doing so because they are paying less attention or not taking precautions. As a result, an accident often occurs. If we look at the list of drivers who are reckless, they are either: 1) not paying attention at the moment OR 2) are not taking the necessary precautions to avoid an accident. \n### A: Reckless drivers are usually very dangerous drivers. Reckless drivers are at a higher risk of causing accidents, because they don't pay attention or are not taking the necessary caution to prevent an accident from happening. Reckless drivers can be anyone of any age group. However, reckless drivers are most often found in drivers between 25- 34 years of age. These are individuals who are usually in the middle phase of their careers and are working to establish a higher status in society, often having a lot of responsibilities on their hands at work as well as at home. The biggest challenge faced by reckless drivers is that even if they are willing to change their habits, there are no external measures to remind/remind/ remind them of their driving carelessness.\n### B: Fatigue can cause accidents but it is not the cause of accidents, it is a driver who is fatigued. Fatigue is a result of a bad driver. A good driver knows when to make an error and understands that he needs to rest during the day. This means that he does not have to be reminded to take a rest because he is already aware that resting is much more important to him than making an error. Fatigue does not cause accidents, it is reckless drivers who are responsible for accidents.\n### C: Traffic jams are caused by drivers who are not paying attention or taking the necessary precaution to avoid an accident. So traffic jams are caused when reckless drivers are out and about.\n### D: Tiredness is not the reason people have accidents", "answer": "A: injuries"}
{"text": "Ferrets are typically kept in pairs, and their favorite spot is on their owner's lap. They also like lying in a cozy nest such as a purse. Though petting zoos might also have ferrets, it seems unlikely that they would get as much attention as they would at home. Thus, since the question asks \" _where_ are ferrets mostly found\", the best choice is B: _sick bay_ (medical/veterinarian facility) as this would be the place if they needed medical attention.\n\n### Input/Response Rational\n\nAnalysis:\n\nInput:  A: trouper leg\nResponse: Choice A: Trouper leg is not a place where ferrets are usually found.\n\nAnalysis: \n\nInput:  B: sick bay\nResponse: Choice B: sick bay could refer to a medical facility for sick ferrets or other animals.

The context is that the worker is tasked to perform a specific job and has access to the equipment needed, but needs to select and maintain it in order to successfully complete the job.\n\n### Choices:\n\nA: _Tighten and clean the wrench._\nInput: B: _Loosen the screw._\n\n### Contextual/Pragmatic Rationale\n\nChoice A seems to suggest that the worker is to loosen the screw which is already loose. So, this is not a feasible option.\n\nChoice B seems to suggest that the wrench is to be tightened, but the screw is already tightened, meaning that the screw would likely not loosen in the first place.\n\n### Relevance Statement/Explanation: \nIn the context of the example problem, option A, the worker who has the pliers should tighten the screw if it is loose. However, when we looked at all the choices and what the question asked us to find, we saw that none of them were specific enough to be relevant to the answer.\n\n### Answer Statement/Explanaton", "answer": "D: petting zoo"}

{"text": "The correct answer is door: A. According to the question, \"the new kitten hadn'T gotten used to what the owned kept in most rooms\". The answer can be found in the sentence 'The owner kept the bedroom door closed'\nThe door is referring to the door to the bedroom that belonged to the new kitten as he didn't know what the owner kept in the room (for example, his belongings). Therefore we can determine the answer to the question. The door is closed and the owner has decided to leave it that way for the new kitten to adjust to.

So, if it's late at night, a man is not getting out of bed to go to his bedroom, so carpeting in that room wouldn't be useful.\nOptions C and D are similar to B because they refer to areas of a home where someone would, logically, not be getting out of bed. So, carpeting in these areas would not solve the main problem mentioned in the question.\nOption E also doesn't make sense. Carpeting in the gym is not likely the man's problem. On the other hand, carpeting in Istanbul might solve the problem he faces with his cold tile, but in this case the man doesn't own any homes in Istanbul. In other words, carpeting the gym or Istanbul doesn't solve any problem he might have.\nOption A however, seems to make sense in this situation.

So, it is not excluded.\n\nD. the BODY, the BODY is another part of the body and is not excluded. The word BODY doesn't include the arm and so it is excluded.\n\nE. the ROAD, this is an additional answer to the \"take the hit\" question. If a person is the one \"taking the hit\" then the question does not include a road, but if we are referring to the BODY of the person then the road could be used to absorb the force of a blow.\n\nAt this point we should only have two options left, which are C. the TORSO AND D. the BODY\nWe should assume that we are referring to the body as the object and not as the one \"taking a hit\". At this point there are only two options that are eligible: the TORSO and the BODY. The TORSO is part the body (a lower half) and is less likely \"to take the hit\" than the BODY which includes the head, neck, arms, legs and all other parts of the body.\nSo the BODY is the best choice", "answer": "C: torso"}

Choices:  The entrance is steep. The sidewalks may not be wide enough The parking lot is narrow. It's a long, steep distance from the car.

A ramp at the same location would not be required if this were a level entrance. Because the entrance is located on an incline that is more vertical than horizontal, a ramp is necessary as an entrance and the slope does not play a part in determining the need to construct a ramp.\n\n### Input The family was tired at the end of a busy travel day, so they chose to eat the pizza for dinner.

This is also called an exclusive contract, which means that the model isn't free to sign other contracts while under this representation.\n* Acting - A model wears different outfits to fit the brand or show of a business.\n* Marketing and sales - Clients or brands may need models in sales events or other marketing materials.\n* Printing - If the model is a success, some brands will ask them to photograph with their products or in different sets to add these images to brochures or catalogs. \n* Modeling agencies - These are modeling agencies that collect a commission (around 5-20%) to manage the model and market them.

The statement says that if you had a pizza \"it could be better described...\" This is different from simply describing it to be something. It is saying that there are different possible descriptions that go beyond the ones mentioned, implying that a certain word is missing from the list.\n2. Now that we've identified that the request is asking for words that are not there, we can evaluate the choices given.\n3. There are 4 obvious words missing from the choices and are not there: rotten, crisp, dried-up, rotting. These words match the word 'could be better described as'.\n4. Based on the evaluation above, the answers we are looking for should be words which we would not typically associate with a pizza. However, a pizza, even a fresh one, could be frozen, stale, leftover, or moldy.\n5. So, the best choice for the answers is B: Frozen and D: moldy. \n6.

{"text": "Input: Why might someone want to be drinking beer among the given choices?\n\n\nSo the question is asking why certain people might prefer to drink beer. Hence the person asking this question doesn't care why people would be arrested or sober, as those are not reasons specific to drinking beer. \n\nTherefore, the person asking this question must be trying to buy beer, not getting arrested or being sober. Thus, we can eliminate the choices B: problems and C: sober, as these are reasons that have nothing to do with a person's motivations to drink beer. \n \nNext, looking at options A: get arrested, B: problems, and E: pleasure, of these three only B: problems can be motivation to drink beer. People drink beer when they want to relax and socialize, not when they have a problem. Therefore, B: problems can be eliminated as one of the reason to buy beer. \nThat leaves us with either A: get arrested or  E: pleasure. E: pleasure is not a reason to buy beer because although it includes drinking beer, the person being asked is focused on why a person would buy beer, not drink beer. So we can eliminate E: pleasure as the answer to our question. \nWe are left with A: get arrested. According to this choice, a person would want to buy beer to get arrested.\nIt is not logical because if a person would get arrested for buying beer, then he doesn't want to be buying it.\nThat means A: get arrested is incorrect. So the answer is option C: sober. \n\nAnswer: C: sober\n\n### Input2:  How about an argument that would make someone want to be buing beer again?\nInput: After buying beer, how about an argument that would want to be drunk again?\n\n### Response2:\nInput: After drinking beer, how about a reason that would want to be buying drink beer again? \n\nInput: How about drinking beer after buying beer? \n\n\nThe phrasing of the question is different from the last one.

Therefore, we should focus on what activities happen at each of the choices. Here are what are happening in each of the choices: A: Work. In this case, it is unlikely that you'll want to enjoy someone's company at work. It's also not allowed, unless you're dating your coworker.\n B: Office. If the office is someone's place of work, it's a place outside of your personal space. It's also uncommon for someone to go into another person's office for fun or to enjoy their company. Instead, they might go into another person' s office to seek advice or conduct meetings, but not to enjoy company.\n C: Friend's house. It's much more likely to enjoy another's company in their house or home as it is your personal space. It is also much more common, depending on the type of relationship you hold with your friend, to just have a private, entertaining conversation or activity inside another person's home.\n D: Workplace.

{"text": "1. Reasoning:\nThe question asks who was the head of the yelling person, meaning the person is in a position of authority over the other person. Looking at the options,\n2. Option B: Foot - This can't be the answer, as the question requires the person who is shouting to be the head, not the foot.\n3. Option C: Subordinate - This can't fit the question either. If someone is shouting at their subordinate, that means they are shouting upwards, which would make them the lower person and not the higher person.\n4. That leaves us with options A - owner, D - base and E - point.\n5. Option A: Owner - An owner is not necessarily the person in charge.\n6. Option D: base - Here, base or foundation means the location or setting where something exists or takes place. It may refer to the person in charge, but it may also refer to the person yelling. They seem to be using the terms in a more general sense, so it's not clear who the person yelling may refer to.\n7. The answer is E: point on the map. The head of the branch is the person in charge, so they are the head.\n\nAnswer: E: Point on the map\n\n### Input and Response:\nYou\u2019re the chef for the chef in charge.

{"text": "A: tennis racket - This is an essential tool for playing tennis that is required to play the sport. It is not a skill or a requirement that makes a person good at playing tennis. It therefore can't be the answer to this question.\nB: Skill - This refers to the ability to play the game or accomplish a task. Although a requirement in some ways to play the game, it wouldn't be the sole thing stopping someone from playing the sport. Therefore, it's not the most correct answer.\nC: Competition - This refers to competing or striving to win, which is a common aspect of the sport. This is a requirement to play but it doesn't directly say anything about whether the person is good at playing tennis.\nD: tennis court - There is definitely a tennis court required to play tennis, but it's actually not all that important in how you play tennis. It doesn't make you good at the sport.\nE: legs - Having legs is something that is necessary to play the game, but again, it doesn't define if someone's good or bad at playing tennis. E would definitely not be the correct answer.\n\nSo the correct answer is the one which is not present. The thing that is not present (which means it is the correct choice) is a tennis racket.\nSo the choice is (A) tennis racket and the answer to this is (A) tennis rattle.\n\n### Input :When would you stop if the person is 20 years old walking?

{"text": "Input: The skin was cut while choppoing onions, where is that skin likely to be cut?\n\n1. Start by understanding what the question is asking.\n2. We are asked where the skin was cut while chopped onions.\n3. This suggests the skin was not cut on the onions themselves.\n4. It got cut somewhere else, either in the kitchen or on the person cutting the onions.\n5. So, our choices are limited to where the kitchen is positioned in relation to the person cutting the onion.\n6. Eliminating choices:\n7. A: Chopping onions by itself is not an activity of good health, so exclude this choice.\n8. B: No onions were chopped with a finger, which also eliminates this choice.\n9. C: No chopped onions contain flesh, so this choice cannot be correct.\n10. D: No skin had a chance to be cut in a person's body, nor can \"body\" be used to talk about family. So, this choice is irrelevant.\n11. E: The answer is not within the question, so exclude it.\n12. Finally, the only choice left is C: meat.

You could possibly find a bee in the United States, though.\n\nB: Sky - This could not be an option because bees do not typically fly in the sky, but instead, on the earth below them. Also, they're not generally found that high up in the atmosphere.\n\nC: Court - Similarly with the choice of a sky, this is a type of place or building. Bees are more likely to be on the ground or around plants. \n\nD: Field- A field is a type of land that's generally cleared of trees and planted for agricultural use. Though this is where one might find plants, bees would be unlikely to do so.\n\nE: orchad - Orchards are cultivated or planted sections of land. Bees don't live there or visit often, so the orchard wouldn't be a good choice.\n\nStep 3: Based on the evaluation, the choice that most fits the question is A-united states.

Plants under the genus Ficus have many interesting qualities that make them popular indoor house plants. The Ficus genus consists of more than 2,500 species of trees, shrubs, vines, and epiphytes. They commonly grow in shaded areas and require proper watering.\n\nThe Ficus genus is one of the easiest to care for house plants. They are fast-growing, require little pruning, and are tolerant of low light conditions. They do bloom, but not as a ficus elastica benghalensis, which is a hardwood bangalorean ficus tree commonly called the Rubber Ficus.\n\nHere is how Ficus Benjamina responds to various conditions:\n\n* Plant position \u2013 Ficus Benjaminas need a bright location in the home. They will tolerate low light, but this will cause them to lose leaves and grow poorly.\n* Watering \u2013 Water sparingly in winter and more regularly in summer.\n* Leaf fall \u2013 They are known for falling leaves, mainly when transplanting, but also following leaf drop in colder weather.\n* Fertilizing \u2013 Feed once a month.\n\nAccording to Plant Care Today, the ficus plant is one of the most popular house plants used as a potted plant indoors. They respond well to bright indirect light, high humidity level, and moist but well-drained, slightly acid, soil.\n\nFicus plants will not grow when planted", "answer": "E: apartment"}

These are known as perennial plants. Examples include:\n- Alfalfa\n- Blueberries\n- Cabbages\n- Fruits and Vegetables\n- Leeks\n- Raspberries\n- Rosemary\n\nFor every season, growers must cultivate some seeds (or \u201cseed crops\u201d) from year to year so that they can have a plentiful harvest the next season. Examples of seed crops include:\n- Alfard\n- Asparagus\n- Black Eyed Peas\n- Burdocks\n- Collards\n- Cowpeas\n- Flax\n- Garbanzo Beans\n- Gooseberries\n- Mustards\n- Turnips\n- Wax Beans\n\nPlants and seeds that require a long growing season (and cannot handle multiple winters), are only planted once and never used again. These are called \u201craised corn\u201d crops (also known in scientific terms as \u201cannual plants\u201d). Examples of this type of plant include:\n- Corn\n- Rye\n- Soybeans\n- Wheat\n\nAlthough growers should only plant raised corn once, they can replant it in a \u201cgreen manure\u201d method after harvest. This planting technique, known as a \u201cgreen manure\u201d, is useful for building soil quality.

In this case, the holiday decorations are the goal.\n\nFrom here we can quickly eliminate three choices: loft, trash, and box because they aren't relevant to our search for a proper answer.\n\nThe other three options give us some things to consider in comparing them with one another and the final answer.\nCloset: a closet is something you put/store your clothes in. We are looking to find the holiday decorations however, not clothes!\nAttic: although the attic can be considered \"up where\", it's not as specific as the phrase \"up where I found __\". \n\nWe can combine these hints and answer B. That leaves us with A, C, and D because D and C sound very similar however if you read them closely, D sounds a bit different than C. Let's see if it sounds different.\n\nLet\u2019s take D for a test drive: D = (He was looking for the... and found...)\n\u201c... and\u201d creates a transition from one thought to another. This also causes us to add a pause in the sentence as well, making D sound more drawn out. You can hear it for yourself by speaking D out loud. \n\nThis gives us a chance to cross D off our list.\n\nThat leaves us with D and C. D has similar syllables and sounds because it adds a transition and a pause to its sentence. Although C is similar in tone, it has syllables that flow nicely and do not require those extra words of transition and pause.

The most obvious nonsense option is one would never sell apples to buy an apple pie, so F is out immediately.\n\nNext, we should remove any options that do not directly involve a pie at all:\n\n2.

E.g. yard, garden. If it's not mentioned, then the option doesn't match.\n4. The choices \"keep things in\" and \"store\" both can mean to have things that will be stored so c and d cannot be chosen as the answer\n5. That leaves us with b and a.

{"text": "Answer the following multiple choice question\n\n### Rationale:\n1. We first start by understanding the question: What might Sarah's patient be if she found a second heart?\n\n2. The second heart might belong to a human patient, which means they would be a human being.\n\n3. Next we can eliminate some of our answers based on our understanding of what this means.\n\n4. Option A: istanbul is the name of a Turkish city. It's not what Sarah's patient could be if they have a second heart.\n\n5. Option B: animal is not what Sarah's patent patient might be given a second heart.\n6. Option C: antique shop can't have a second heart, so this can't be an accurate answer.\n\n7. Option D: human being is the answer. Since the second heart Sarah found belonged to a human, it makes sense that her patient is a human being. \n\nAnswer: D: human being\n\n### Input:\"What do you have?\" \"I have a bottle of milk.\" said the customer. Answer: D: A bottle of milk.\n\n### Rationales: We start with an understanding of the question: What does the customer have?\n\n1. We can look at the given response to eliminate some choices: The customer said, \"I have a bottled of milk.\" This tells us that the customer is holding a bottle of milk, which we can eliminate because we don't need to use imagination.\n\n2. Thus, the best answer is A: A bottle of Milk. Milk is the only item the customer said they have.\n\nThe answer is A: milk\n\n### Input:`Do you have one?\" \"I have one.\" said Peter.

Choices:  C: A mother B: A father C: Yourself  D: A grandparent E: Your aunt\n\n### Response\nA gift is something given to a person to express care, respect, or affection. The word \"gift\" can be used either for material objects or non-material things such as time, effort, or attention. For example, a mother might give her child a teddy bear on his birthday, and a father might give his son tickets to a baseball game. The question asks us what type of person would be a recipient of such gifts.\n\n###\nInput: How do you play a card game? Choices:  a: one by one b: face to face c: two against one d: face to face e: one by one face to face\nRationales:\nLooking at the given choices, we see two different ways of playing a card game:\na: One by one - In a game like poker, the cards are dealt one at a time to each player. This is a face-to-face game, with each player getting a turn to play at same time.\nb: Face to face - This is a two-player version of the game where each player takes turns playing, and each player can see the other player's cards. In this case, the game is played face to face, with the cards visible to both players.\nc: Two against one - Here, there are two players and one player can have an advantage (possibly because they know all the cards). This is a face to face game as well, but the odds of winning are not equal for both players.\nd: Face to face - Again, this is a two-player game, but it's face to face with the other player.\n\nSo, the answer will be the face to face where in each turn player deals their cards face to face and can even see the other's.\n\nAnswer: B: face to face\n\n### Input :Why are you buying a bag?

{"text": "Count\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Demonstration: Input: What is illegal to do when playing cards on a casino? Choice: A: winning B: dealer C: deal dealing cards D: helping E: counting\nRationales: To begin, the question asks what is _illegal_ to do. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the _illegality_ of something refers to \"an act or omission that is prohibited or outlawed in a jurisdiction or by a specific authority.\" The question asks about cards, so we know the jurisdiction is a casino and the specific authority refers to the dealer.\n\nThen, looking at the choices, option A: winning, does not match the conditions in the statement provided in the question. We know the question asks about doing a _specific_ act, so, clearly, winning is not illegal in a casino if it is playing on a table game, such as blackjack in a casino.\n\nOption B: dealer, does not match the situation because it's not the dealer that is making the illegal action.\n\nOption C: dealing cards refers to players dealing the cards. Players can usually only deal one particular card at a time. The dealer does not sit at the table dealing cards, or even shuffle them. For each hand of blackjack, the dealer does not deal the cards. Players do.\n \nThe only choice that remains, and the choice that matches the conditions in the statement is option D: counting.\n\nTo count cards is legal in casinos, but it is illegal to count cards \"while playing a game in any casino,\" that is playing with money or a wager.\n\nIn conclusion, the only choice that matches the conditions of a casino is option D: counting cards.\n\nAnswer: D: counting-cards\n\n### Demostration:Input: Choose three: a book, a phone, and your best friend \nChoices: 1)C 2)D 3)E 4)B Choice: B\nChoices: 5)A 6)E 7)A 8)D Answer: B Your best friend is more important than a book and a phone.\n\n### What is the point of showing your gratitude for a compl", "answer": "C: count"}

Moving on to B, people are typically not nervous when walking on the street and it doesn't match the context of a salesman selling products.

{"text": "#### Analysis\nIn the given question, it is clear that all the seats are filled in the vehicle. This rules out option C. Option B and option D are invalid options since they do not have a relation to the question. Option E is an outdated format and it is not relevant today. Thus, we are left with options A and B.\n#### Reasoning\nNow, we have to determine how we can eliminate our remaining options with the provided information.\n\n\nLooking at option A: the roof. This option is out of the question in the context of the given information. It is because all the seats in the vehicle are filled. So, the roof of the vehicle would probably also be filled up completely if the shopping bags needed to be placed on the roof.\n\nOption B: storage cabinet. This option can be eliminated using the given information since shopping bags can be fit in storage cabinets (if needed). Thus, we can eliminate B. \n\nThe next remaining option is C: the car trunk.\nCars typically have trunks that can store shopping bags. So, this is a viable option.\n\nComparing option C: the car truck with option D: the home.\nIt is safe to assume that both homes and trunks are capable of storing shopping bags. Thus, the choice has to be eliminated on the basis of the given information.\n\nNow, the only choices that remain is B: storage cabinet and C: the car trunks.\nThey both seem viable options, so we have to find the distinguishing feature between them.\n\nLooking closely at option B, it does have a roof and its size is unspecified. The option can be extended towards the roof for additional storage.

{"text": "### Analysis of the problem:\n\nAs seen in the image, the question involves finding an activity that someone can do to begin a change in society. From this question, we can understand that the question is asking us to identify a particular activity that this person can do to begin making a change in society.\n\nFirst, we can start by eliminating some of the options that are not relevant. Among the options given, some are about doing activities to change society, while others are about changing oneself. This allows us to eliminate the following options:\nE: Change clothes - This is about changing ones wardrobe, not society.\n\nA: riots - Not all riots are necessarily about changing one's society.\n\nC: Change yourself - This focuses more on changing yourself, which is not the focus of the question.\n\nD: social activism - A social activist strives to make social change, but that does not have to involve starting within the individual directly.\n\nNext, we can use the remaining options to determine the correct answer. The question does not specify the kind of change that the person may be aiming to make. So, we cannot use the change's nature as a hint.\n\nHowever, looking closely at the wording makes it clear that the change can be about anything. There is no limit to the type of change that the person is attempting to make, so this gives us a hint that our answer will need to be very general. For example, we cannot try to guess that the change must be about improving education, or increasing charity donation, or some other activity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer choices will need to be as general as possible to encompass any type of change. \n\n### Analysis:\n\nFirst, let us go through and analyze the options for the best guess/predictive value:\n\n(a) Change your clothes. - We can be sure that this is not the correct answer because: \n\nAs mentioned earlier, change your clothes doesn't have a high predictive value.

Based on the analysis, we can eliminate choice: D: school child. This is not a parental duty and can be eliminated. Also, it should be noted that the questions only pertains to the parents primary duty.\n\n3. Therefore, we move on to choice: D: happiness of a child. This is a state of well-being and is more of a desire than a duty. It can be eliminated. Moreover, it is not mentioned or implied directly that the happiness is primary for parents duty to parent. Therefore, we can eliminate this option.\n\n4. Next, we can eliminate choice C: care for children. This is not something parents are doing to a child, but one for them: care for a child in addition to duties that involve the child. We can eliminate it.\n\n5. Next, we can also eliminate choice E: control children. This is not a duty of parents to control their children and also not mentioned as something that is the primary duty. So, it can be eliminated. That leaves us with options: A & B.\n\n6. A: The main duty of parents to children is to provide shelter/sheltering, education and food along with other support, such as medical support, etc. These are all duties, and provide to the child in addition to the duty.\n\n7. However, parents primary duty to a child is to shelter or provide shelter to the child and this should include all other duties, such as education, food, safety, medical support, clothing, etc. These are also duties that parents do towards their child as their primary duty.\n\n8. This includes duties that parents provide to a child because they need to survive. Duties that parents provide to a living child that are not necessities of life like education, and freedom can only be considered as secondary duties. Thus, shelter should also includes these secondary duties such as freedom to study.\n\n9. By understanding the childs primary duty to survive this primary duty, all other duties, that are secondary duties, the parent provides to their child cannot exist.\n\n10.

{"text": "You are probably thinking to yourself, \"How many choices do I have here, where should the graveyard be built?\"\n\nThe answer is, \"All five.\"\n\nThat's because the question is \"was important to build,\" which means the graveyard itself doesn't matter as much as it's important for _where_ it should be built.\n\nFor instance, it's important that a graveyard is always set apart from other places, such as residential areas, churches, sports stadiums, and so on. That means the graveyard needs to be on land that's not used for anything else. \n\nSimilarly, in a small town the cemetery might be on city-owned land or church property, whereas in a big city it might be on out-of-the-way land where it's less likely to be disturbed by development.\n\nAnd lastly, in a town where a cemetery already exists, new graves might be buried on undeveloped or vacant land back from the cemetery. The important point here is _where_ the graveyard is built is as important as it being _built._\n\nNow let's take a look at each choice.\n\n**A: arlington** - Arlington is the former home to Robert E. Lee and was the starting point for the military service of his sons. It was also the site of President Kennedy's funeral. The graveyard's importance to Lee and Kennedy's legacies would be commemorated by the graveyard's location in Arlington.\n\n**B: church property** - Some graveyards are on church property, either to be near a church, like in a village, or because a church owned the land when a graveyard was established. For historical importance it makes sense for the graveyard and church to be close. Though it's not necessary and certainly not the most important point.\n\n**C: out back** - Out back, in this context, likely means the area where there are rows of graves facing away from the main entrance. This is not the most desirable location in a graveyard. Still, it's possible and a choice on the list.\n\n**D: every town** - Every town likely has a graveyard, but that doesn't mean it's the", "answer": "D: every town"}

This means that our hypothetical human can only look down when they are in a curve or circle.\n\nFurther, based on our understanding of \"orbit\",\nwe can eliminate some of the given choices:\n\n* A: Nearest house - based on our analysis of the word \"nearest\", this choice means\nthat our human is looking for their nearest house, but a \"house\" does not travel around Earth.\n\n*B: Workplace - this choice has the same issue - a \"workplace\" is an area or space where a person performs their job.\nBut a workplace does not travel around Earth\n\n*C: Surface of earth - This is another option that is based entirely on the human looking down.\nThe human would be looking at the surface of Earth, or a nearby place on the surface of Earth,\nand the question makes absolutely no sense if their feet are on the surface of Earth.\nSo, the answer is E: his feet as in he is missing or longing to be back on Earth's surface with his feet.\n\nAnswer: E: His feet\n\n### Instructions:\n\nProvide either a multiple-choice or written response explanation.\n\nNote: You should either give a multiple-choice or a written response answer.\nAnswering both will have a penalty of -1\n\nInput: For his birthday, a man from his family asked him for money.

A is also an incorrect answer because his place has nothing to do with shoes. He may be in a garden or an office, though.\nB: The department store: The choice mentions that he left his muddy shoess at the entryway, so he would have been somewhere in the building for this action to take place. To be in a department store doesn't make sense if he would be stuck in the entryway, which is rarely a section of the store, and is usually a doorway to the rest of the store.\nC: The school: Schools have their own gardens which students might use in their breaks. Also, he could be stuck indoors waiting for a class to start. Both sound more possible than the other option.\nD: The office building: An office building is a location where offices are. This place contains people who work, but it has no relation to shoes.\nE: The house: The house is where people live. It could be a shoes-friendly place, but its mention doesn't help the context.\nThe correct answer here is C, so Sam is probably in the garden.\n\nAnswer: C: The garden.\n\n**Cleanup:**\n\nThis task is asking where a particular person might be if they were to be in specified locations.

{"text": "It can lead to water retention, which is a condition of having excess fluid in the body that can lead to various health issues such as hypertension and kidney damage. It can also cause bloating and make clothes feel tight and uncomfortable.\n\n### Support:\nWhen excessive weight is gained as a result of the long-term consumption of beer, one of the most common concerns is water retention, also known as oedema or fluid retention.\n\nDuring the night, the body normally releases a hormone called antidiuretic hormone or ADH. This hormone signals the kidneys to reabsorb all of the water that is excreted during the day. This prevents us from waking up to go to the bathroom every two hours during the night and prevents dehydration. Therefore, ADH ensures we have the right amount of water in our body throughout the day and night.\n\nBut, overconsumption of alcohol affects our kidneys. The high amounts of fluids being consumed overwhelm the cells in the kidneys, causing them to malfunction. The result is that the body can't reabsorb all the water, causing the kidneys to release ADH.\n\nWhen this hormone levels rise, the body retains more fluid. This leads to the retention of fluids in the tissues and organs. This condition is called 'water retention' or oedema, which is the result of long term consumption of beer.\n\nWater retention can cause the following issues and problems:\n\n- Hyperglycemia", "answer": "E: harmful"}

{"text": "If we have a forgiving attitude towards someone, then that person receives absolution (the act or state of being forgiven). Reasoning:\nAbsolution typically involves the provision of forgiveness or release, typically through a forgiving or absolving ritual.\nA forgiving attitude can be described as an individual's stance of giving up or letting go of anger, grudges, resentment, and the desire for revenge. This attitude involves the forgiveness itself, rather than the actual forgiving rituals or acts.\nSo, choosing the word \"absolution\" makes more sense than all of the other options.\nA: redemption: In Christian religion, redemption refers to the deliverance of a person or individuals from sin and condemnation. Since the question is asking about a forgiving attitude, not a religious deliverance, A cannot be the best choice\nB: isolation: This is not what a person receives through a forgiving attitude. It is the attitude, not the result\nC: absolution: As mentioned above, absolution is the act or state of being absolved (forgiven).

Choices:  C: a consumer D: an online shopper E: A: someone who shops while on a laptop B: a purchaser F: a mobile app user\nRationales: There are four categories below to answer this question. Each category represents a stage in the process of shopping. The question is asking which individual does not go through each step. \nLooking at the categories:\nA: someone who shops on a laptop - This is not just an individual as a laptop is not a person. Also, this is more of a category of people, not an individual.\nB: a purchaser - A purchaser would be an individual, but they could go through the whole process of shopping.\n\nE: A: Someone who shops while on their laptop - This individual would have to have their laptop handy while shopping or they must bring the laptop from home to do their shopping on it. So, this would fit with an online shopper that uses their mobile or PC as they shop.\n\nC: A consumer - This refers to people who buy and consume goods and services without being involved in the process of production.

{"text": "I can agree that the answer is B, aquariums, for a couple of reasons.\n\nFirst, a lake can be shallow, but so can a swimming pool or a river. In my estimation, an aquarium would most likely be the option that is shallow because that\u2019s how it would have to be to house fish in a reasonable amount of space.\nAquariums aren\u2019t just big buckets \u2013 they\u2019re vessels that house specific ecosystems. The fish, if they exist in a community, would all require a certain amount of surface space, which would also equate to how shallow an aquarium would have to be.\n\nMy point is that I can see why people might think that lake\u2019s are shallow, but aquariums would probably actually be a little bit smaller if you\u2019re looking to keep as many fish as possible.\n\nAnswer: B: aquariums\n\n### Input::Where would you go to see if the light switch is on or off?

Though hospitals have patients and ill people, people don't typically contract illnesses in hospitals, because they have access to health care. Plus, it's where people come for help, not to get sick. Hence, choice A is incorrect.\nOption B: head. This is not a body part or a description of a person, but a description of a thought or idea. Therefore, it doesn't fit the question here, so it can be eliminated. Additionally, this description of a person would be rare to contract or catch an illness because the state of being a head is rarely temporary. It's permanent. So, eliminating it for that reason helps.\nOption C: sick person. This is describing a person and not a type of person or body part. So, it can be eliminated as an option.\nOption D: elderly person. Although elderly people do experience illnesses, they aren't the only ones, so choice D cannot be the answer. Furthermore, it's not a temporary state either.

The other answer choices don't work because they aren't types of cities or they don't match the geographic features that are specified in the question.\n\nSo, the answer is D: coastal city.\n\nAnswer: D: coastal city\n\n### Instructions:Select the correct choice below.\n\n### Input:\"Where would you find a pet store that is located in a mall\"?

{"text": "\"He was eating lunch but rushed because he looked at his watch\"\n\nIn the instruction, the words \"BUT\" and \"THEN\" are in capitalized bold letters. A reader should know that these words imply that the first part of the sentence has been finished and a second part is following. This makes it clear that the man was eating luch, but then he rushed after he looked at his watch. So, the choice that best matches the instruction has to do with the man finding his watch. As rushing is a feeling, not a fact, we cannot choose \"B\" gain weight.\n\nNext, option \"D\", bad breath, is out because gaining weight is a side effect of eating. Bad breath, however, is only a symptom and not the cause, so we cannot choose \"D\".\n\n\"He rushed because he looked like he was late and also it meant he was going to stay late at work\"\nBecause the man was finishing work for a long time, there is no reason for him to rush. The man must have felt that he was late for some other appointment, and he was rushing to leave the job in order to make it on time. This is because of the second part of the sentence that reads \"he was gaining\". The man thought that he was late for something, so he rushed and then ended up staying late at work. \n\n### Solution\n\n#### Instruction:Answer the questions.\n \n#### Demonstration:The man was eaning lunch, but ruched when he looked at his clock, wny did he rush?

The word while is used to introduce a compound subject or a coordinating conjunction followed by a relative pronoun in the form of a question. \n\nSo the question is asking about the placement of an advertising while reading the news.\n\nStep 2: Eliminating irrelevant options: \n\nA: television -This isn't about what you can see an advertising while you're reading a news.

Eliminate Choice A: gain  weight - This choice is clearly inappropriate in the context of the passage.\nStep 3. Evaluate Choice E: expand - Expand is synonymous with grow or develop, which would be a positive connotation and does not fit with the description of her endeavors.\nStep 4. Choice B: make larger is also eliminated as it cannot be what Jamie did since she tried to decrease her waist size, not increase it.\nStep 5. Choice C: dispare is also eliminated as the word \"disparate\" means to be different or distinct and contradicts the \"reduced\" description of Jamie's waist.\nStep 6. Choice D: augment - Augment can refer to making something bigger or creating something new, which are positive actions and do not fit with Jamie's negative attempts to reduce her waist.\nStep7. Choice C: maked larger - \"Maked\" is an incorrect spelling of the word \"made\".

Choices:\n> A: project manager B: senior designer C: software developer E: accountant\n\nReasoning:\n\nIf you have a list of projects, the person you would choose to finish in time would depend on their experience, skills, and how available they are.\nThe project manager works with a project, the software developer works with software and a few other items, and the accountant handles accounting or money.\n\n### Choices are all incorrect except for Choice E, the accountant.\n\n### Rationale:\n\nThe question asks for someone who the person could choose to work with that would be able to finish the project in time.\n\nOne must look at why the accountant would fit the best for the project. If for a project you need someone to do the finances or deal with money, accounting would be most important to the project.\n\n### The rationale given here is incorrect and this is how the answer should change.\n\nAccounts is the person who handles money within a person company. Therefore, the accountant (C) should not be chosen because of this reason. The choice is between manager or software developer, both of which cannot finish a project in time.\n### Instead:\n\n* The project manager (A) works with the project while the software developer would need to learn how to work with the project.\n* The software developer (B) would need to learn how complete the project in time while the project manager has a lot of experience working on such projects and knows the required steps to achieve success.

However, money itself may be subjective, and the desire to attain money could be separate from the desire to shop.\n\n### Options C and D: Time and credit - Time is a factor that can influence the need to acquire products at a specific time, but again it is not the main driver behind one's buying behaviors. Credit on the other hand, can affect one's spending capability, but it does not represent an emotional attachment to buying habits.\n\n### Thus, if money is a possible influence, it would be indirect and not the key driver.

It is possible that Sam said something like 'you won't get me to call me Bob,' but a better explanation would be 'you won't be getting me to call you Bob any time soon,' instead of 'I won't be calling you ever.'

Choices: A: spending time with family B: baking C: going shopping D: getting presents E: working\n\n### Response\nThe correct answer is choice A: spending time as family.\n\n### Explanation\n1. When a question states that a certain action is likely to be performed in a certain context, the best choice is a single action that most people would take in that situation.\nFor example, the correct choice for Christmas Day is spending time with family, because it's the activity that most people would choose to perform when they're at home with their families on Christmas Day.\n2. Avoiding long lists of actions is particularly important when eliminating incorrect choices.\nBy removing certain types of options, such as those that contain two or more actions, we are able to quickly and easily identify the true answer.\n3. Here, when looking for an answer, it's most likely to be the only action on Christmas Day that could reasonably lead to someone getting presents.\nIn contrast, getting presents on Christmas Day is not as likely to occur.\nMoreover, there are other questions on the test that include activities that result in receiving presents as answers, so you'll still be able to use this strategy effectively even if it's not relevant this time.\n4. Another key thing to remember is that the actual time of the day that someone does an activity is not as important as whether or not they perform that specific activity on a particular occasion or not.\n5. So, Christmas Day is likely to be filled with spending time with family because it's the only thing most people do on that day.\n6. The other choices are irrelevant, so they can be eliminated first.\n7. In addition, Christmas Day is a day when family gathers together, so there is no need for people to buy gifts for each other before the Day.\nOn Christmas Day, people want to spend time with their families and get presents, not buy them before the Day.\n###\n\nTo be updated...\n\n## See also\n* Critical thinking\n* Data-Interpretation\n* Reading Comprehension - Multiple Choice Questions\n* Reading Comprehensio Questions on Vocabulary\n*", "answer": "C: study"}

Choices:  G: painting B: graffiti C: billboard E: artist D: sculpture\n\n### Response\nRationales: Start by understating the question: What kind of work appears on the walls?\nThen, looking at all the choices, we first know B and D are out. B is graffiti, which is illegal, and graffiti would never appear on walls that an artist owns, since it's illegal. And D is a sculpture, which does not normally appear on the walls.\n\nLikely, only A and E are options. A painting is something created by an artist and hung on the walls. E is an artist.

Therefore, based on that criteria, we can eliminate the homes that are in economically distressed area, have only dirt as yard, etc.\n\nNow that we've gotten rid of many of the bad choices, we're left with good homes in well-off neighborhoods.

Answer A:healing and A: amputated. \nStep 4: If A is healing, then the wound could also be amputated. Otherwise, it's not. If A is amputated, then the wound won't heal. Therefore,A: healing and A: amputation do not fit the question well. If A is healing is healing means a person would regain full use of the missing part of the body. But if someone cuts their hand, then the person won't be able to regain full use in the injured area. Therefore A can't be the answer choice. If A is amputation, then the wound has been cut and removed, permanently or temporarily. But again, this is not compatible with the question. The wound that's cut is a hand as opposed to a finger.\n2. In addition,A: healing,A: amputated, andA: gangrene doesn't fit. A: gangrenous refers to a wound that has rotted and become infected, which cannot be cured easily. This term doesn't match with this question, either. In this case, the wound will typically be healed by first removing dead tissue.\n3. Now we turn to B. It's unlikely that if one cuts their hand, it will get amputated as a result.

{"text": "B - Home\n\n### Instructions\nWrite a response that appropriately addresses the request above.\n\nInput: Where would the person go to get information about their current health status? Choices:  a: home  b: family c: nursing home d: hospital e: internet\nRationales: Look at the choices.\nHome\nYour home is your space. This would work, but this is not relevant to the question since the question is not asking about your home.\nInternet\nSearching the internet about one's current health status is a possibility, but since the question is asking about where to get health information in-person, the internet is not one of the valid options.\nFamily. A family member who's knowledgeable about health can provide information about one's health as well, but for the following reasons, family is not the right answer:\n\n1. The question is very specific and states that the person is trying to get information in-person, not via family or another relative. It's very likely that the person is not trying to get health information from a family member.\n2. Family members may be unreliable as sources of information, especially if they're a close relative such as a parent or spouse who may try to avoid giving correct/negative answers to any questions related to one's health.\n3. It's likely to be a busy home, which wouldn't be good for asking lengthy questions and waiting for extended periods for the response.\n\nNursing home: This seems like a strong option, but it's very likely that it's not the nursing home one is looking for if trying to find health-related information, especially if the person doesn't know anyone. This would also be inconvenient and perhaps, overcrowded, if the person is looking for one-on-one information.\nHospital. The hospital is more appropriate since it's a centralized location where one can easily visit to get health-related information.\nAnswer: D.

The question is how much will you have at the end. The initial price of $1000 has been reduced by one fifth after 1 year. Thus, the five year mark will be $550.

A child that is getting punished by their teacher would likely be either crying because of the punishment or running away from the teacher.

{"text": "You have to first identify what question is being asked. The choices ask us to determine which place has the greatest number of customers but the question asks for a place to maximize number of customers.\n\nThe choices given are: Idaho, a shopping mall, a big city, in town, and New York.\n\nWe must determine which of these places has the most customers. We begin by looking at each place and determining what it does and where it takes place.\n\nIdaho is a state and is not a place but a geographic location. We must eliminate that, leaving us with a shopping mall.\n\nShopping malls attract a large number of customers. Most stores are present and shoppers are more likely to spend large amounts of money. A common place for a shopping mall is a city.\n\nA city might attract the largest number of customers but we are not asked to select that for the question. Instead, we must find a place where the most customers are found. A big city has too many people and is too large to be considered.\n\nIn town is not always a city, but rather a place located in a city. The question does not say where we will build a store, but a place that would maximize the number of potential customers in order to choose a store place.\n\nThis is best exemplified by shopping malls. They are present in a city but there are many of them. Instead, we should look at shopping malls that are located in smaller cities.\n\nNew York has more people than most small cities. However, they are not present in the city but across state lines.\n\nNew York City is not what must be considered. Instead, there is a small town in the New York City area, NJ, that has more potential customers.\n\n### Response to original question:\nThe best place for a new department store is in a small town. This would provide the best means for maximizing potential customers.\n#### Additional Thought and Discussion:\n\nThe best place to store a department store is in a large city. There is little competition and a large potential buyer population.\n\nThe best place is located in a medium-sized city. A large city would have too much competition and a small city would have few potential customers.", "answer": "C: big city"}

{"text": "The answer to this question is B: castle because a castle, much like a fort or palace, is a fortified residence of a lord or royalty or aristocratic family. This type of structure is often seen in stories or illustrations from the medieval era and was a common sight in the Middle Ages. This means that a small knight would be found in a castle during the Middle Ages or in illustrations of medieval fantasy or fairy tales.\n\n### Input;Where was small knight likely to play? Choices:  B: horse\nA C: chess D: rope\n\n### Response\nThe answer to this question A) Chess, because chess is a popular board game in which one or more players move and capture the other player's pieces to checkmate the opponent's king.\n\n### Summary\nThe two questions have the same answer and context regarding why the answers are right. The first question is asking where a particular figure is most likely to be found and the second question is asking where a certain figure tends to be found. Therefore, because the questions are similar in structure and context, the choice choices are the same, namely a castle.", "answer": "D: chess board"}
{"text": "Ans: A, B, and C are incorrect because competitions don't result in these. When people compete, they're usually trying to win, though sometimes they may be fighting for second place. Answer choice B is \"debate\", and answer choice C is \"argument\". The debate may be the topic of contention before the competition begins, but, during the competition, these are not part of the competition itself.\nRationales:\nWhen two people compete, stress is likely to occur when they are competing with each other. However, stress is usually due to a feeling of pressure. Therefore it would not be an option. There may be moments during the competition, where there is tension or arguing. However, this does not define what the competition is or how it is conducted. Therefore D cannot be the correct answer.\nThe reason we can easily eliminate B and C is because a competition is a situation of comparison or testing of something and a debating of the topic. Hence it doesn't result in tension or argument.", "answer": "C: argument"}

Choises:  A: liberal  B: heretical  C: recalcitrous  D: conservadox  E: heretical.\n\n### Answer:\nA: B: C: D: E:\nAnswer:\nHeresy is the denial of one or more of the established tenets of a religion, an offense for which the offender is subject to excommunication. In ordinary language, the term \"h\u00e9r\u00e9sie\" can also refer to a dissident's interpretation of a religious doctrine, or to a set of beliefs proposed in opposition to those of another. The term derives from the Greek h\u0113risis meaning \"to choose\".\nThe earliest known use of the word in its Latinized form heresis is found in the New Testament, in 1 Timothy 1:3\u20134 (\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bd\u03b7\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9 ) and Tertullian later in the third century uses the term of the sects in the early church.[2]:47 Heresy may be \"taught\", \"learned\", or \"professed\". It is the formal denial or doubt of a core doctrine of a religion that the denying person understands to be held by the other adherents of that religion.\nThis is not acceptable because it requires you to memorize facts.

{"text": "B\n### Rationale: The question is asking about what happens to a person or things after they travel for a long time. Let\u2019s look at:\nA: sickness. Although some people may get sick after long journeys, it's not always the case and other things besides sickness could cause them to feel sick (such as motion sickness or fatigue).\nB: Motion Sickness. If someone is traveling for a long time by car, boat, plane or any other form of transportation, they could experience motion sickness, which is caused by the continuous motion stimulus during the journey.\nC: Relocation. Relocation can happen after someone moves to another state or country, often long distance.\nD: Jet Lag. Jet lag is a form of relocation when someone travels long distances and their sleep cycle is disrupted, causing them to feel tired and fatigued.\nE: Fatigue. Fatigue is a general feeling of being tired from overexertion, which can happen after long travels and lead to someone feeling sleepy or drowsy.\n\nBased on the above, there is considerable overlap among motion sickness, jet lag, and relocation, which are the only three options that match the answer. If someone is motion sick, it can lead to jet lag and/or relocation, so the correct answer is B: motion sickness.\nAnswer: B\n\n### Input:- Which option is not part of the given definition of a triangle?  1. three interior angles have no more than two right angles, 2. three interior, non-adjacent angles have at least one non-right angle, 3. any exterior angle formed by intersections of three sides is not a straight angle, 4. any exterior angle formed at more than two points is a straight angle, 5. a straight line connecting the midpoints of the two sides adjacent to an exterior angle becomes part of an exterior angle if it lies outside the triangle, 6. the exterior angle of an exterior triangle is half the measure of each of the two interior angles outside it.\n\n### Respect: D: 5. a straight angle \n\n### Rational: The definition provided describes the characteristics of a rigid polygon. It does not include the given options, which are for a rigid triangle to be a straight angle (which it is not), or for a", "answer": "E: fatigue"}

Choices:  A : grocery store B : hardware store C : hardware store D : florist E : bakery\n\n### Response :\n\n### A: grocery store\n\n### Rationales:\n\n### What kind of shops do you find next to a bakerty? Grocery stores, obviously! A grocery store is a shop that sells food and necessities. The two shops are most likely grocery stores because they're next to a bakerdy.\n\n### Choice E: bakery. This can't be the correct answer because it's a shop that sells cakes and pastries, not everyday goods.\n\n### B: hardware store. It's possible that both shops are hardware stores, but it's improbable that there are two hardware stores next to a bakendy. There's only enough space for that many types of stores at one time. If there were more, another type of shop - maybe a bank?- would have to be placed at an outside location or be moved to nearby street.\n\n### C: hardware store.

Choices: A: perfumes  B: soap 2 C: makeup 3 D: creams 4 E: lip balms 5\nRationales: Start by analyzing the question: what items are used regularly on a dressing table as a way to identify someone?\n\nNext, we can eliminate some choices based on our understanding: items can be used as a way to identify  someone; these items can be used regularly; these items are on a dressing table;  these items are used to help identify someone.\n\nBased on our analysis, we can now eliminate choices that either do not include  items (option A),  or that are not regularly used  (option C) or that are not used as a way to help someone be recognized (option D).\n\nSo, the remaining choices are: option B (soap), and option E (lip balm).\n\nWe can use the definition of identification to understand that the items left are: items that are always used and that allow someone to be identified. This can be solved as follows:\n- If an item is on a dressing table, it is regularly used (B & E)\n- Lip balm is always used (use every day)\n- Perfume is always used\n- Soap is always used\n\nThus, option B is the correct answer, since lip balm is always used and always on a dressing table.

Choices: B: close eyes C: not move D: stay still E: use hands\n### Response: D: stay still\n### Rational:\nWhen moving, one needs to first be aware that they are moving. After that, the person might decide on a direction or route, and as a result, they need to use their legs to carry out whatever movement they are performing. Then, some muscles are required to control and facilitate those movements. After that, once the specific movements have been completed, balance is needed to adjust to the now new standing or walking position.\n\nAwareness: This part does not require moving or specific muscle coordination.\nDirection: You can decide on a direction without moving at all.\nRoutes and destinations: Direction is a component of routes and destinations. It helps steer our paths, so awareness and choosing a route are the first two steps.\nMuscles: If a person were walking in a square shape pattern, and decided to suddenly move in a straight line, these various muscles would need to be controlled and coordinated. If a person were walking and decided to sit, these muscles would also need to be coordinated. \nBalance: You don't need to be in the process of movement, just standing or sitting. Balance is necessary here.\n\nAnswer: D: Stay still.\n\n### Response to the Rationales:\nA: This doesn't mean they need to be awake or using their eyes in order to move.

If anything, they would be the opposite.\n\nOption E: new - This could apply to routine or mundane situations; however, \"new\" is a broad term that doesn't actually answer the question.\n\nStep 3: Based on analysis in step 2, the best choice is:\n\nC: arcane. Routine events are often the most mundane, and adding a slight twist or change - such as something \"arcane\" - can be enough to break the mundanity. In other words, a routine can be made less routine by introducing something \"arcane\".\n\nAnswer:C: arcane\n\nInput: What doesn't cause a headache?

These conditions can include migraines, cluster headaches, sinus headaches, and even more severe conditions such as cerebral hemorrhage.", "answer": "E: new"}
{"text": "### \nAnswer: D: headaches\n\n### Input-based reasoning:\nInput: What is the most likely result of eating spicy food, and why? Choices: A: acid reflux B: nausea C: indigestion D: heartburn E: severe stomach pain\n\n### Reasoning:\nThe question poses that eating spicy food would yield a particular outcome, which can be determined through deduction based on the available choices.\n\nThe result of eating spicier food is usually experiencing a burning sensation on the tongue and mouth, sometimes known as heartburn. This is due to the activation of capsaicin receptors in the mucous membranes, which triggers a cascade of biological processes resulting in the production of a chemical called proton pump inhibitor, which prevents further acidic secretion in the stomach.\n\nThe choices presented are the possible causes that trigger the effect of spicy food. Therefore, they need to be evaluated based on the description of the cause and the effect.\n\n- A: Acid reflux occurs when stomach acid leaks out of the stomach and up into the esophagus. This can result in a burning sensation and, in some cases, is a symptom of heartburn\n- B: The sensation of nausea can be triggered by eating spicy food as the capsaicin receptor is activated on the mucous membrane and can cause a burning sensation in the stomach, leading to the perception of nausea. However, it is more likely that the nausea is caused by the presence of other chemicals in the food.\n- C: Indigestion occurs when you have difficulty digesting food due to inflammation and muscle contractions. Gastritis, which occurs when the stomach lining is inflamed by excessive alcohol consumption, can cause the symptoms of indigestion and heartburn\n- D: Eating spicy food can cause stomach pain due to a variety of factors, including acid reflux, overeating, and stomach cramps. Heartburn is a leading cause, and the pain associated with heartburn is often mistaken for indigestion, which is the result of food being unable to pass through the stom", "answer": "A: addiction"}

There are two answers available\u2014port and cargo ship. The passage describes \u201ccontainers full of goods\u201d, which indicates that there are goods traveling in containers, not people.

Choices:  O: return to the sender B: reply by return mail X: disposed of Y: forward Z: file for future reference.\n\n### Response - Answer:\n\n- B: reply by returnmail\n\nRationale: A letter should be addressed to a person, or a group of persons, who has a common purpose. So, the question is what is the most appropriate way to address the letter or return it.\n\nThere are a number of possibilities, which can be summarized as follows:\n\nO: Return to the sender:\n\nThis option would be used if the letter is addressed to an individual, the sender, and the sender wishes to return the letter without any response. Thus, this is an inappropriate option.\n\nX: Disposed of or destroyed:\n\nThis option is inappropriate as well. If a letter is disposed of or destroyed, the sender is still obligated to write a 'letter of explanation' or 'letter of apology' to explain the reason for disposing or destroying the letter and the consequences that arose. Moreover, the sender must inform the person to whom the letter is addressed, which they could do by return mail or other means.\n\nY: forward:\n\nThis is also inappropriate. If you forward a letter, you transfer it to another person. To fulfil legal requirements, you have to add a note of explanation that tells them about the original letter and the intended receiver.\n\nZ: File the letter for future reference:\n\nThis option isn't inappropriate per se, but it's irrelevant.

{"text": "The answer to this question is D: fileing cabinet.\n\n### Rationale:\n\nThe question states that the individual had to return index card to someone and that he had found the book he needed. Based on this information, the individual can either put the index card in the oral report, the library, the file cabinet or the card catalogue.\n\nThe index card can be found in the library in some cases, but in most cases, libraries accept loan papers to be returned oral. The person could put the card in a book at the library. If the individual is keeping the book on his person, he could put the card inside the book. The person does not need to put the card in the oral. In the case of the file cabinet, if the report contains an index card, it can be filed that way. The card catalogue might be useful to look for books, but it is not likely useful for finding an index card. The person can put the card inside a book or use the file cabinet to keep the report with the card. If the card is no longer necessary, it can be discarded altogether.

Choices:  a: knees b: chest c: heart d: legs e: neck\nReasonings: To identify the best option, one needs to follow these steps: 1. We need to analyze the question. 2. Find what is meant by 'body's strength' and where it comes from.\n3. Find the source of energy or strength with which this is done i.e. 'body's strength to move'.\n4. Evaluate each of the options and choose the one which would have the answer.\n5. The first step is analyzing the question. To do that we: \n- Identify what is meant by body's strength to move:\n- It is physical power or energy that the body uses to perform various actions. \n- Body's strength to move indicates strength, so let's look at our body in terms of a machine i.e. mechanical.\n- We identify the parts of the body i.e. limbs which are responsible for generating the body's mechanical power.\n- These limbs, the legs, neck, chest, heart and the back are the main ones.  \nThey form what is known as the kinetic chain and their role is to transfer the forces generated by the muscles from the body to the ground. \n- In simpler terms, they work together to power you through movements.\n- When we talk about the chest, we mean chest muscles, not your chest of the rib cage.\n(Rationale: As explained before, the kinetic chain is the sequence of events that occurs to help your body produce force and power and move through space.) \n- They also support and protect the body. Thus, the neck and chest work to stabilize a person, and the legs, ankles, and feet transfer body power to the ground.\n- A common cause of injury i.e. the back injury. Thus, the question asks which body part does the power move from?\n(Rationale: The answer being: the body's power is said to originate from the back", "answer": "B: basement"}

Hence, this option should be eliminated.\n* B: Meeting - Though people meeting together can exchange information, this is not the main focus of the question. Hence, it can be eliminated.  \n* C: Television - Many TV shows can be educational, but they're most well-known for entertainment. Also, TV shows are not a direct source of information but may be the medium through which information is spread or transmitted. Hence, this option too can be ruled out.\n* D: Guide - A guide is an individual who helps people make decisions or gives advice about a place, activity, or object. However, guides don't usually transmit information freely.\n* E: Newspaper - Though newspapers share articles, reports, and interviews to people, this is not their main purpose. Hence, this option can also be ruled out.\n\n* Step 3: Choosing the option that's most likely to be the answer:\n* D: Guide is a possible answer because guides can share some information with people they're leading or helping.\n* E: newspaper is an option because the articles and news shared by newspapers could be considered information. However, this may not be considered the primary focus.\n* F: book is another choice that may include facts and figures that are useful.\n* G: television is a further option because TV shows and channels give out news or share other informative materials.\n* H: meeting can be another option because the subject of the meeting may be based on sharing knowledge or facts.\n\n* Based on the criteria and the eliminations, the best choice among all options is D: Guide.

A problem with the network that prevents it from connecting is possible.\nC: Airport - Electrical power is present at the airport; however, this probably refers to electrical outlets and plug point for various uses.\nD: Wires - If the power for the equipment is due to be insufficient or unreliable, a possible cause is not the power supply, but wires that might be in the wrong place.\nE: Freeway - The freeway refers to highways that connect many towns, cities, etc. It probably refers to electrical connection of the devices in this case, such as Wi-Fi.\n\nBased on the above, if electrical power is unavailable, the likely cause is in the wiring. This problem could be because there's an issue with the wires themselves, a wrong plug points, or both.\n\nThe answer is one of the options B,D.\nAnswer: One of B,D\n\n### Input :What's a reason for one person having a bad day?

{"text": "The correct answer is D: small talk. Small talk is a brief, casual exchange of comments in a social setting. It typically centers around topics that are superficial or unimportant and does not go into details. It is a polite social exchange of brief, general, inconsequential, oral comments, chiefly designed to give people an opportunity to develop relationships.\n\nSmall talk, or superficial conversation, is a social behavior in which people make polite conversation about casual, unimportant, or neutral topics. Small talks are generally characterized by polite language, evasions of meaning, and inauthentic statements. It is one way to show courtesy in a conversation with a friend or a stranger. It is often used to maintain a good relationship and express appreciation.[4]\n\nAn example of a small talk is when people say \"Hi, how's it going?\" or \"How is your day?\" with a faint smile and in return they may receive a polite reply like \"Well, just fine.\" Or if they say \"It's been so rainy lately,\" you may reply, \"Yes, I know. Me too. The rain has affected us all.\" Even though none of you has any interest in rainy weather, you are polite so you are using small talk with each other.\n\n\n### Additional notes:\nWhile small talk is an ideal way to greet someone and develop personal relationships, some people feel awkward making small talk. For these folks, an icebreaker works best. For example, you can say, \"Hi, my name is John, how was your day?\" Or you can say \"Did you have a good weekend?\"\n\n\n### Task:\nAnswer the following multiple choice questions correctly.", "answer": "D: small talk"}

The child could be looking for a specific item that has a baby doll as part of the design, perhaps as to buy something for a friend or parent.  The child could also be buying a replacement baby doll, or a baby doll as a gift, if she has misplaced her original baby doll. It could however be taken for granted that she is merely playing with the doll or caring for it, if there is no clear indication how old the child is.

{"text": "### Demstration:\nRationales:\nStep 1: We want to figure out what people mean when they say, \"when they love a place.\"\nIn this phrase, \"place\" refers to an area, not a building, and therefore implies that people usually plan to visit the place. Hence, the question could be asking what people usually do when they're traveling.\nStep 2 : We can start by eliminating a few choices based on this understanding, such as those that aren't related to visiting a place:  options D: staying and E: debt.\n Staying is unlikely to be a choice in the context of a vacation, and debt refers to money owed, not travel-related activities.\n Step 3: Choices A: pleasant thoughts and B: overspend typically refer to things people do when they are visiting a place. Thus, this can be eliminated from A: pleasant thoughts.\n \nIn our context, visiting a place does not always immediately require money or any purchases.\n Also, an option that is true during a person's visit may be different from what happens after they leave. For example, if a person enjoyed a stay at a particular vacation spot, they may think pleasant thoughts when reminiscing. \n Step 4: The possible remaining choices, C: moving there and D: overspending are more specific to the area (place). For the latter, overspending could be in reference to over-spending on certain purchases while in that location. \n However, in this case, the context suggests more than just a specific purchase. Overspending may represent visiting the place and spending more than one expected or intended (as opposed to spending more than they could afford). \n Moving there is a more far-reaching choice than overspending. This choice could be referring to moving to the place permanently or even in general terms like visiting again in the future.  Thus, option C: moving there is possibly a better choice. However, there is still the possibility that C: moving there and option D: overspreading could both fit.\n So, instead of guessing, we can eliminate B: B overspending and proceed with A: C moving there.\n Step 5: We can evaluate the remaining choice with reference to  the question", "answer": "D: staying there"}

An example of this would be a child playing in the school sandbox. Even though there are no set rules, the child is still able to learn and formulate ideas on their own. To help students learn, an environment needs to be structured with a combination of both rigid rules and loose guidelines. These rules allow freedom of movement and interaction with the people around them. The learning environment needs to be open to all possibilities such as new ideas, information and activities. \n\n### The environment that a student learns in plays a vital role in the acquisition of knowledge. An unstructured environment provides little support for learning while a structured, orderly environment provides much more.\n\n### Teachers should create a positive, structured learning environment that motivates students to learn. Positive consequences for good behavior will not only encourage students but will also ensure that students focus on their studies. Students learn best in an environment where they have a positive outlook and belief that they can succeed. In a structured classroom, students are able to focus on their learning, thus improving their performance. Investing students\u2019 time in constructive activities not only keeps them engaged in lessons, but also helps them to better retain information and apply it in real-world situations. By providing students with constructive feedback and guidance, teachers can help them develop their own personal learning style and become more independent learners. This will help them to develop a positive outlook on the process and increase their success rate.\n\n### Providing a structured", "answer": "A: airplane"}

So, B shouldn't qualify as an answer either.\n C: A fruit cocktail - Is this a place?

Choices: A: examining patients B: doing surgery C: talking, taking notes or drinking tea\n\n### Response\nDoctors do not do tests or surgery without patients present. The patients are the doctors' reason for their existence. So we eliminate B: doing surgery as the explanation.\n\nThe other three options are possible explanations of what a doctor may be doing: talking, taking notes, or drinking tea.\nThe text says \"but the patients are not there\": This indicates that the patients do not exist yet, so they must to be examined or tested first.\n\nWe can eliminate C: Talking. This is because when a doctor checks a patient, they do not normally speak or talk. They may only ask the patient questions in order to understand or diagnose the problem. So, talking is not the reason the patients are not present.\n\nWe can also eliminate C: Taking notes.

They may want to feel beautiful or happy after applying it.\nChoice B: look attractive - This is a goal when putting on makeup, especially if someone's primary purpose is to look good or attractive. \nChoice C: compliments - Compliments are a common side effect of wearing or putting on makeup, so this could also be the person's goal, as they may look forward to getting compliments.\nChoice D: interesting experiences - Interesting experiences could be part of the goal of putting on makeup for certain people. For example, wearing makeup to new places may lead to more interesting or fun experiences throughout the day. \nChoice E: joy - This is a feeling that may occur when putting on makeup for some people. They might experience a sense of joy or elation while wearing it.\n\n## Step3: Evaluating the given choices\n\nBased on the analysis above, you could conclude that all the given choices could be possible goals for someone who's putting on makeup, as there is no answer that is more plausible than the others.\nIn other words, there are valid reasons to believe that any of A, B, C, D, \nE could explain the answer.\nSince they are all equally plausible, it would not be possible to know which one is the right answer.

{"text": "#### Choice A: exhilarated\n\nThe word 'exhilarated' means pleased or excited, usually as a result of physical activity or extreme experiences. It is therefore a suitable description of the feeling of a player after football. We can eliminate any other choice based on this meaning, including death, which is the antithesis of exhilarate.\n\nAnswer: A) exhilarated\nExplanation: A game of football is an intense and fast-paced sport that involves a lot of physical activity and vigorous exercise. The high level of excitement, adrenaline rush, and exhilarating feeling are what makes playing football so enjoyable and rewarding for many.\n\n#### Choice B: pain\n\nThe word 'pain' refers to the physical sensation of discomfort or distress due to injury or illness. However, this is not what the question asks. It does not indicate any sort of physical activity. The question specifies emotions resulting from physical activity. Thus, pain is not a suitable answer. We can further eliminate 'death' because it can be felt from any sport - not confined to football.\n\nAnswer: B) Exclusion\nExplanation: It'll be hard to get pain feeling if you can't get back up again. That is why, I believe that 'death' option is an exclusion.\n\n#### Choices C, D and E: none of the above (Incorrect)\n\nThe choices could have been any from C to E, but since the choices are exclusion of death and pain, any answer is acceptable.\n\nSo the correct answer is A: Exhilarated and C: death.\n\nAnswer: (A) - Exhilarated\nIt takes a lot of physical effort and energy to play a game of football. You need to jump and dodge and run and tackle.\nYou get tired, you get mad, because it hurts and there are a lot of rules. But a lot of people still love to play football. And that is exhilarating.\n\nAnswer: Answer: (B) - Death\nDuring a football game, the player is subjected to various injures that can cause death. In the American Football, about 3.1 deaths per 100,000 people occur every year.\nAlso, about", "answer": "A: exhilaration"}

{"text": "Grooming is a task, activity of care, or practice carried out on one's body, especially for hygiene, appeal, or beauty. To some extent, the question is asking: why would grooming be recommended to greasy teenagers? \n\nGrooming is related to appearance, which often is associated with \"looking as though you put effort into your clothing,\" a perception which may be attractive to the opposite sex. Grooming has also been described as a \"survival tool,\" in that the ability to maintain personal hygiene and \"social skills\" is a means of being considered an \u201cordinary and sane\u201d member of society. \n\nIn order to be able to determine whether this statement is true, we need to understand what \"greasy teens\" means. The Oxford living dictionary defines \"greasy teen\" as \"a dirty, unwashed, or unkempt teenager \" \nThus, based on how the words are used in the dictionary, it is fair to say that a teen who is greasy often has poor hygiene and/or is unable to maintain their appearance to the standards of others. This could be because of lack of time, difficulty maintaining healthy personal hygiene, and/or for lack of desire to do so. \n\nThese are all common enough aspects of being a teenager and do not require any special consideration or attention. The questions is asking us to choose how it is that grooming is recommended to greasy teenses. \n\nLooking at each of the options:\nA) Neatness: this refers to having a tidy or orderly appearance, which is typically considered acceptable in society. Being neat might make one seem better than they are to others, but it does not indicate any improvement in personal hygiene or grooming skills. \n\nB) Selfishness: This is an emotion, a psychological state that a person is in, having to do with consideration of oneself. This aspect has no bearing on poor personal hygiene, unless one considers selfish behaviour a detriment to the maintenance of good personal hygiene. \n\nC) Mistakes: This is the term given to a failure in decision making. People who make mistakes typically do so because they misjudge or misunderstand a situation. They may also have poor attention to detail. Poor hyg", "answer": "D: cleanliness"}
{"text": "Option D:\n#### How do we know we are correct?\n\nRationales: As one sits down at a dining table, they usually take a moment to relax. They might have a glass of water before the food and take a few extra moments to relax and calm themselves before starting to consume the food. They might choose a suitable dining place based on how it has been organized for dinner. These moments are an opportunity to relax. Some people spend the majority of the time they feel their relaxing drinking and eating. For others, they engage in various activities other than those. If they find the dining room, they might get involved in a conversation or two with people around them. They might even check to see if they\u2019ve been informed about what\u2019s going on in their lives.\n\n### Note:\nIn our daily life, the words like \"sit\", \"being sociable\", and \"talk\" are used to describe the actions of people in a formal dining place. In this context, the word \"medium\" should be understood as any of the other choices above.", "answer": "A: sit"}

{"text": "The question is asking how someone might feel after receiving a gift. The options describe feelings or emotional states in general.\nOne option that mentions a characteristic of the gift is C: offended. This might seem like it fits the bill, because someone might feel offended if they receive an inappropriate (or non-personal) gift. But offense is an emotion caused or triggered by something. The state is the person's reaction, not the gift.\nSo there's no one answer, but the best choice available is B.\nAnswer is: B: personal\n\n### Input:\"Is there 10 percent oil in the oil tank?\", If the tank is 10% full of oil, what number does that equal? Choices:  (A) 10 (B) 90 (C) 13 (D) 100 (E) 15\n\n### Response\n1. The word \"10\" is followed by a percentage sign (%). So, the question is asking for a percentage of an unknown quantity, which suggests that the percentage should be added to the known quantity to get the unknown (the quantity that is already full, in this case 100%).\n2. The first line tells us that the amount of oil in the tank is 1/5th full. So, the unknown quantity would be 4/5ths.\n3. The unknown quantity is \"4/5ths of all the oil in the oil tank.\"\n4. Because we know the percentage is 10%, the unknown quantity should be multiplied by 1.01 (10 divided by 100), thus 91.\n5. That means when the tank is full, the oil remaining is equal to 91 (10% of all of the oil in the tank).\n6. Thus, the answer that best fits the question would be answer D: 90.\n\nAnswer: D: 90\n\n### Input\"When was the car bought?\", What is the correct order of events? Choices: 1. The car bought 2.

{"text": "<p>The word'mistakes' in this question refers to errors in a baseball game. A mistake in baseball can mean 4 different things: a throwing error by a fielder, an attempted steal of home plate, an illegal pitch, or a fielding error.

This would not necessarily relate to a vehicle or specific place in which someone might park.\n\n3) Here are our possible explanations for some of the answer choices:\nA. \"Receive instructions\" - The question asks what could 'park' mean when it's said to a drug dealer in code. It's unlikely for 'park' to mean'receive instructions'. \nB. \"Take money\" - This choice refers to someone receiving or having money, which seems too general to be the right answer.\nC. \"Leave work\" - Leaving work or getting out of the building doesn't seem to be the drug dealer's sole purpose for going to those places.\n7) \"Park\" - If \"park\" refers to the context involving cars, then 'run errands' could mean that the dealer was being told to meet people that he had to pay off or deliver goods to. As soon as he gets there, he simply has to 'park' so that he doesn't cause any trouble or suspicion. \n8) \"Park\" is the correct answer because if a drug dealer were being given a job to complete and had to complete it ASAP, they would be instructed to go to locations to 'park' without actually completing the job. \n9) In other words, the drug dealers were being told to meet people", "answer": "D: take money"}

Choices:  Cheese Pineapple Mushroom Mixed Tomatoes Pepperoni Tomatoe\nOutput: 1 Choices:  Cheeses Pineapple Mushrooms Tomatoes Pepperoni Tomatoes  Answer:  Mixed Tomatoes 2.  A person's preference of the toppings on their pizza would depend on what flavours they enjoy. However, the question is asking about a person's preference of *one* topping on their pizza, not of all of them *at the same time*. For example, I might prefer a pepperoni pizza over a cheese pizza. Similarly, if you're having two pieces, you won't be having pineapple and tomatoes together. 3. The question is asking about what you prefer over another and that is very clear.

We can now consider what choices are left:\n    - Mixed Tomatoes \u2013 This is the correct answer. \n    Tomatos \u2013 This is not the answer because a person might not like tomatoes and prefer a different option.\n    Pepperoni \u2013 This is not the correct answer because you can't mix and combine all the things mentioned.

{"idx": 34, "text": "1  The question is trying to determine which of the given options need to be done before one can begin cooking.\n2. The first things we can consider to eliminate are options that would obviously require cooking, as they can't be done until cooking is in progress. For example, packing or bagging food (D) is a cooking process, so it immediately can't be the correct answer. However, let's also consider option C, packing or baging. Although this isn't a cooking process, one would do this to transport food that will eventually be cooked. Because of this, you could wait to pack your food until after it has already been cooked, and there's no reason to assume that you will be packing the food you cook when you're camping. \n3. Now, onto the remaining selections. Option B, go hiking \u2013 we can eliminate this since no one would want to go hiking immediately before beginning to cook, as they would be preparing their meals. Option A, make breakfast \u2013 This would technically require cooking, making it invalid as well. \n4. Lastly, let's take a look at choices E, light a match, and E, grab a match. The question isn't asking which one you should grab, but rather which one requires doing beforehand. And because of this reason, one could choose either match or no match. It makes sense that you wouldn't need to grab either one of them before cooking, as you would be cooking with the fuel that is already inside, no matter which of your matches you picked, so we can eliminate this option as well. So the answer is option B: go hikiang. \nSo the final answer\n\nInput: At a restaurant, what will a patron do once she has finished eating?

This choice is incorrect because in a house, plumbing is included.\n4. This option is an odd choice, and even though you'll find plates in a house, they are not something you won't find in a house full of furniture and plants.\n5. Plants won't be near the appliances and so choosing this option is incorrect.\n6. The bathroom, by extension, would likely be near the plumbing and hence this choice is incorrect as well.\n7. This option may be correct if the house is full of plants because it says \"furniture and plants\", but it isn't clear. The question refers to \"large\", so it has a good chance of being incorrect. \n8. This option may be true given the question text but since it doesn't necessarily have to be, and that it's not explicitly written as true, it can't necessarily be an answer.\n9. Therefore, the correct answer is B: furniture.\nSo the final Answer is 2: house full", "answer": "A: maine"}

Now we know we don't need cities with a coastline. \n\nWe are left with just choice C: city. A city can contain a seafood resturant.

{"idx": 86, "text": "1.\"She loved buying products\" indicates that the person is a woman. \n2. \"She was driven by her what...\" indicates that something is driving her to shop more than she needs to. \n3. She was driven by a desire to \"shop more than any practical needs.\" Therefore, the question implies that she was not primarily driven by monetary reasons, time, credit, or spending money. This leaves only the option B for consideration, that of \"desire\".\n4. \"She loved buying products...\" indicates that she loves buying the products she was buying for, so it does not give us a clue into the reason why she was buying these products more than necessary. Therefore, when it comes to the practical and monetary aspect, the two answers that seem more likely are \"spending money\" and \"credit\". \n5. However, because she was driven by her \"desire more than her practical needs\" one can infer that whatever \"desire\" she had was probably not monetary, or motivated by her need to spend more money. Spending money to shop would have been practical since it would satisfy her desire to shop. However, since spending money is not practical according to the question's context it cannot be the correct option. This eliminates \"spending money\" as an option. \n6. We can consider \"desire\". This word is used in the correct context here, it does imply a desperate need to have something. According to the question's phrasing, she had desires to shop more than her practical needs; it doesn't state that she had desires to spend more money. That would have contradicted the answer phrase \"to shop more than any practical need.\" Therefore, the answer is actually B: \"desire.\"\nSo the final answer, with reason, is B: desire.", "answer": "A: desire"}

{"idx": 110, "text": "1) When considering the choice list, it's important to understand the definitions of each term being offered. For instance, an ultralight plane is a type of aircraft defined by weight and not by engine power or speed.\n2) It turns out that geese travel by airplane, but not necessarily the type of plane we are imagining. They fly to predetermined meeting points, known as'staging areas.' The staging areas could be man-made or created naturally from existing bodies of water.  \n\n3) Some might argue that geese fly in groups, and while this is true, we find it difficult to imagine them forming a group together and then flying to wherever they plan on going, without any stops in between.\n\n4) We then think about each choice individually to see if it could potentially be the answer.\n\n    - A: carried by people - People are sometimes used to transport geese when there are too many of them to fly and it is unsafe for them to travel together. While a small number of people can certainly have an impact on how a geese population travels, it is not a practice used by geese today.\n    - B & C Grouping: group together and flying - Geese don't normally fly, but rather travel by airplane to their staging areas. They typically do this in groups, so it is possible that this could be the answer, but when you think about this, it seems that this is not what the question is asking. The question's intent must be to describe what geese don't normally do, which is fly. Therefore we can eliminate this choice.\n\n- D: follow ultrallight airplane - According to the definition we set prior, an ultralite is a type of fixed airplane that can carry one person or two. So while this could be an acceptable way for geese to travel, a single airplane can't carry a large group of geese and it would be highly problematic. Therefore we can eliminate it as well.\n\n- E: fly - Whenever we think of birds and other flying travelers, we think in terms of how we see them in the wild. Birds, bees, and even planes travel above the ground and rarely descend. Geese are no different and they very seldom travel to and from places by this means. Therefore, we can eliminate this choice as well.", "answer": "C: fly"}

{"idx": 122, "text": "1. The question is describing a situation in which someone loses their kite because they weren't careful.\n2. To understand the context of the question, let's examine what 'lose' means and how it is used in this sentence - \"Sally lost her kitie (the kite) because she wasn't (careful)\".\n   - She didn't hold onto it.  She wasn't holding onto it tightly or she lost it.\n   - So the only way she can lose it is if it slips away/slips out of her hand. \n\n3. Now, she though that there was more string or she thought that she would have more string than what's actually there on the spool - that was her mistake.  She thought this because there was more string  on the spool. \n\n4. The only way this string can slip out of her hand is if she has the whole string out of the spool or there is some string out of the spools already. So: \n    - All these points are clear given that she lost the kite.\n    - But if this is what happened, then she would have the spool there in her hand, which doesn't fit given that she lost the spool.\n    - So all of this together makes a pretty strong case about what's actually happening in the description of the scenario.\n\n5.

It isn't possible that the end of the line can be the spool she uses. So, this also doesn't make sense in this specific context.\n> E: toy store -", "answer": "D: end of line"}

{"idx": 154, "text": "1The question asks about why fighting inflation might not be a priority for certain people or economies in some cases. \n2We can eliminate choices that are obviously wrong. For example, having economic instability might make inflation a priority, as fighting it could help stabilize the economy. Also, fighting inflation isn'y exactly \"boring\" in the same way some other choices suggest.\n3Similar to the previous choice, having rising interest rates on loans and other sources of debt might make fighting inflation a priority because rising inflation could lead to higher interest rates on loans, and higher interest rates could have a very negative impact on the debt of many people. 4Choice A is not related. In some cases, economic instability could make fighting inflation a low priority, depending on the specifics of the economy.\n5Even though fight inflation isn't always a priority, it still is a priority in many cases. Choice B just isn't the correct option. 6Choice C is not the correct one either. To suggest that having more money to spend will make fighting inflation less of a priority is inconsistent with the way in which inflation works. As inflation increases, consumers will begin to buy fewer goods and services. As a result, inflation will decrease. If inflation did not decrease as a result of decreasing goods and services purchased, then the buying power of each dollar would go unchanged, instead of increasing. This would create an inequitable situation where a relatively smaller amount of money would buy many more goods and services than in periods of little/no inflation. 5Also, the increase in the cost of goods and services caused by inflation would likely result in many people having to spend more of their money to buy the same goods and services that didn't increase in price. If these people did not spend more of their money on goods and services that were more expensive, inflation would not go down. 6Therefore, choice D is the correct answer.\nSo the final choice is D: rising interest rates\nSo the answer is rising interest rates\n\nInput:What can't be the result of an electric current?

This is true because for this to be true, we'd need to make the statement 3 > 3. The only way this would be the case is if 3 is greater than itself, which is not the case. Hence, this statement is correct.\n\nSimilarly, the second choice 3 > 3 is true as well, but it is true simply because 3 is greater than 3. This statement doesn't provide any insight into the range of 3 since it does not compare it to any other number or to itself. Hence, this statement isn't accurate.\n\nThe third choice 3 = 3 holds true, but it is true only because we have already made the assumption that 3 > 0 in the first choice.

So in reality, this statement is correct, as are the three previous answers.\n\nSince the order of the choices is not given, we can assume they are just jumbled up.\n\nSince the first three choices turn out to be correct, if x is any number, and y is zero, then 0 < x is true, and 3 > x is true, and x = y = 0 will be true as well.

Therefore, we could say that it's possible to record an album using a microphone boom used to record a concert.\nD: tv studio\n- A television studio could use a microphone boom as any kind of recording equipment used for recording a show. \nE: new york\n- New York could serve as a region where a microphone boom can record an album, because it's plausible that recordings would find their way to the city from all over the United States.  \nWith this information, we can say that answer C could indeed be used to record an entire album. Therefore, the correct answer is C: concert\nSo the final answer  is C: concert\n\nInput: The song that was performed at the talent show was chosen by the students who didn't win the talent show.

Someone who cannot use a watch would probably not be able to recognize a new version of a phone, so a phone would not be the best option to use for this person.\nSo, the answer can be found in D, as a person whose watch has run down can quickly ask for the time anytime they choose to do so.", "answer": "D: rare"}

The question is about the man's intention with his actions of cleaning his clothes. The options presented are:   - A: ruined. This answer is not correct because the man is actually trying to clean his clothes and make them look good. - B: clean clothes. The man wants his clothes to be clean, but he is additionally looking for his clothes to look good. So, B is also not the correct answer.\n3. C: sadness. It is difficult to determine why the man is cleaning his clothes. If he is trying to lose weight or slim down, then the answer is sadness. - D: attractive appearance. With this answer, it seems unlikely that he is trying to clean his clothes for appearance since he likely already wears clean clothes. - E: looks better. This answer is not the correct answer because by this definition, wearing clean clothes already makes the man look good. It's quite clear that the man is trying to look better and thus, the answer is E.\n4.

Instead, we're looking for the choice that describes an action that an adult man can take to get ready for work. To simplify this even further, we can consider that there are only two categories of actions here: clothes-related actions and food-related actions.\n2) This question is asking for a word or phrase that describes an action which can be applied to an adult man in getting ready for work. We can simplify the phrase as \"something which can be done by a man in getting ready for his job\" because these are the most important characteristics.\n3.) Let's consider each of the answers:\n    - A) Dress herself. No man would describe this.\n    - B) Shower. You can argue that this is sometimes related to clothes, but there's no guarantee.\n    - C) This is in a form of something a boy would do.\n    - D) This is a stereotype. \n    - E) This action is not related to getting ready for work.\n4) Therefore the question is answered with the phrase \"drive train\".\nSo the correct answer is B: shoe\n\nInput: A book which has just been turned into a movie will be on what shelf in a bookstore.

These are bookshelves where a book which had recently become popular or brand new would be kept. \n2.) The rest of the options aren't specific to the type of a book so we can eliminate options A (mystery genre) and D (classics).\n3.) The only question which remains is whether the question describes a book which had just been turned into a film or a book which is about to be turned into a film. Since none of the books are actually about film production or the film industry, we can eliminate choice E (new releases). For 4.), let's consider each answer by elimination. \n4.)

As such, this choice isn't ideal, making it a bad pick. \n    - B) A shopping mall \u2013 Some people may indeed choose a mall if and only if they don't have other options. However, this is by no means a slam dunk selection and, in fact, may decrease your number of potential customers for your new department store. \n    - In town \u2013 This is a bit vague, but generally, it usually means a central or downtown area. This may increase the number of people who can get to your store, but not by much and there are a number of other factors that can play into this (as we will discuss next). \n    - A big city \u2013 Certainly larger cities will be more accessible and have more people than smaller towns and cities. This may increase the potential number of customers who could visit your department store, but there's no guarantee that this will be the optimal choice. \n    - E) New York \u2013 This location is almost certainly the most populous and busy place in the United States. The sheer number of people that you could visit at this location is significant. However, keep in mind that one of the primary goals behind this question is to maximize your total number of potential customers (not just your total number of customers). This factor isn't taken into account in New York because, unlike the other choices, the actual number of customers isn't relevant to optimally maximizing the number of potential customers that you have. In fact, there are actually two problems with New York. The first is that people in smaller cities are more likely to travel to larger cities, like New York. This is due to the idea of opportunity cost. This concept refers to the idea that people prefer to allocate their time within cities in order to pursue activities that may be optimal or valuable, but there are only so many activities a person can pursue within a given time period. In this case, it means that individuals in say, Chicago, may decide that rather than visit a department store in their town, it may be more cost-effective to instead go a larger city, such as New", "answer": "C: big city"}

It is not because of a sudden presence at the building, or the friend's house, or the classroom.\n3: A dog sometimes barks at the window to chase away flies and other insects that may become curious about the house. Dogs also sometimes bark inside the house because they are trying to warn the owner about other household pets, or some of the animals outside. However, none of these cases are the same as a dog barking at someone at their front door.\n4: Dogs barking at their owner's back is not necessarily because their owner is near a building, another person's house or their own house. It is because dogs sometimes bark at people or pets who approach the house from anywhere. A dog barking at somebody standing at the trash can does not mean that it's the presence at the building.\n\nSo the final answer here is A: front door.\n\nInput: Which of the following is not an example of what a dog is barking at?

This is the correct answer for the following reasons:\n    - Choice A: fairy tale: This can be excluded because a small knight may be portrayed in a lot of fairy tales, but this doesn't mean that this is where you can find them.\n    - Choice B: castle: A castle is likely to include a lot of small players like knights, because it's just a big place. Therefore this is almost certainly the right answer.\n    - Choices C and D: middle ages and chess board: Both are inappropriate because, unlike a fairy tale scene, you probably won't find small knights on a chess board. In addition, the middle ages were not modern times, and therefore not the current time period, and thus are not relevant to our current question.\n3.

The choice C could potentially be the snow that is on the roof of many structures because snow can accumulate on roofs, and then be dispersed to another part of a structure. Alternatively, this could refer to the rooftop snow you would find in the northern hemisphere, as it's usually white and fluffy. However, this is not 100% of the time as in the 4 seasons, snow could be covered by another form of precipitation, leaving only a memory of it.\n3. In the choice D, Canada is known for cold winters, but this is not always an indicator of snow, as there are other forms of precipitation which make it difficult to have pure snow. These can all happen with other countries in the northern hemispheres such as Alaska and Russia.

However, we notice that this Martian is specifically searching for the Indian Ocean. This means that they're searching to identify where the Indian Ocean is, not identifying where they themselves are. Therefore, we can consider the fact that this Martian is not on Earth, the planet.

We can easily eliminate each choice as soon as it comes up. Looking at the first answer choice, we know that pigs would definitely not be classified as chickens. Secondly, looking at the second answer choice (fish), it's immediately evident that fish as a group are not classified as pigs. Pigs would likely, instead, be classified in a group with other mammals. Looking at the choice of sheep again isn't really classified as pigs, and the final choice of cat isn't pig-like either.\n3.

This is also the place where the space time vortex operates and where the time rotating device is located.\n3: Since the main room is in a basement section of the Tardis, we can then answer the second part on the basis of the first.

Choices:  a: in stature\nb: with height\nc: in height c: in stature\nd: with height\ne: with stature\nOutput: 1)The sentence tells us to describe someone extremely tall. So, if we consider the definition of 'extremely tall', this means the person can easily exceed the average height of 6 feet (183 cm). Hence the extreme tallness can be defined as the person having a height greater than 6 feet.\n2)When searching for an adjective to describe a person as extremely tall, the options a, d, e are incorrect as they all mean the same thing i.e., the person is tall.\n3)The options b, c, and f are incorrect because none of them mention the size of the person. Option f (In stature) seems to describe the height of a room - rather than a person as the question suggests. Options b and c are not proper answers because it is not the person but his height/ size that is extremely tall.\n4)Therefore the correct answer is option f and the correct answer is b: high, meaning 'with height'\nSo the final answers is B: high\n\nInput: When you're out of breath from jogging, what is it like?

A family is typically a unit of two or more people, so it doesn't really capture the idea of a lover wanting to build a family with their partner.\n        2. B: fall in love \u2013 This is definitely not the right answer because if a lover were to want to fall in love with their partner (this is possible, of course), that wouldn't necessarily mean they would complete that goal together. Indeed, as long as they loved their partner, one could still fall in love with them even after ending the relationship.\n        3. C: make love \u2013 This choice is the most sensible one.

Looking at choice B,  'Bollywood', there are two key aspects that make it a potentially strong answer. Firstly, it refers to Indian movies that are known for their music and dance sequences. Secondly, it is a unique term which is not commonly used in other contexts. \n3. If you knew more about musical history, it would be interesting to compare the movie of interest with 'jazz' and 'ragtime', also terms that have become synonymous with song and dance in music. This would further strengthen the answer. Unfortunately, I don't possess this type of knowledge.\n4. The word'record' does not fit well in context, as the question is describing individual scenes from a full-length movie.\n5.

Choices: A: bollywood musical B: jazz C: classic \nD: hollywood E: ragtime\nOutput: 1:  The question's wording suggests that it's a multiple choice question and may be asking what the movie was about or about what sort of a movie it is.\nFrom here, you realize it's a musical movie. But which one?\n2. The most straightforward answer is B.\n3. The question could be about many other things, but the fact that there is a choice in terms of music genre is a pretty strong clue.\n4. The term 'ragtime' fits in nicely since the movie had musical and dance in it.\n5.

A: This is clearly an incorrect choice for the question because the murderer is guilty of the crime they're being sentenced for. \n3. B: This choice is incorrect for similar reasons.\n4. C: This answer doesn't seem fitting for the type of crime the answerer is guilty of, it seems to be a bit too light for the crime.\n5. D: The word 'negative' is being used as an adjective to describe its quality. However, this is a different word as a noun to describe a person or their actions. This answer is incorrect for the question.\n6: E: Evil, from a traditional perspective could describe a person who's 'evil'. But for this question, the person described is a murderer who's just been found guilty of murder by a judge. The judge wouldn't see the murderer as 'evil'. Even the murderer themselves may not see themselves as evil.\n7: With these considerations, we can arrive at an accurate answer of choice E.\nSo the final correct answer is: E: pure evil\n\nInput: How many of the following could you have in a lineup?

It can't be both. Choice B is incorrect.\n3. C: This could be 3 people for example. However, this can't be both 2 people and 3 people. Therefore this option is still incorrect.\n4. D: This doesn't answer the question of how many of the provided choices you could have in a single lineup. However, if you're only allowed to pick from 2 to 4, then you would not be able to have more than one of these options. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n5. This leaves us with option E: 5.

We can determine this based on the reference to walking at the beginning of the question.\n2. Let us consider each answer choice: \n    - A: work hard -  This isn't applicable. Even if we assume working hard has a loose definition, it doesn't make sense within this context. A walker isn't working hard when they collide into someone else. \n    - B: slow down - This again, isn't appropriate because the person didn't intentionally slow down before bumping into the other person, it was an accident. \n    -C: wear shoes - this is not an action to do if you bump into someone, which is what we're looking for. Therefore, this can't be the correct answer.\n    - D: sell products - This answer only makes sense if you're selling products, and are colliding into someone while you're both walking. However, if it's in reference to someone walking into you, then this answer doesn't fit. Therefore, it'll be ruled out as well.\n    - E- speed-  This is also incorrect because the reason to speed up is only when you are behind a person and you want to ensure you don't bump into them. However, when it's the other way around and you are the one about to bump into another person, we wouldn't want you to speed up. The correct answer here then is B: slow down.\nSo the final answers are B: slow down", "answer": "B: slow down"}

We may also rule out choices which are not held or experienced at night, such as Concerts(D) and Carnivals (B). Similarly, Plane(C) is incorrect even though it occurs at night because it's a transportation option and not a event or experience.\n4. The remaining answer options include looking at a turned event during night which is either Carnival(B) or Concert (D). However, Carnival is not held in the air, therefore, that option must be eliminated. \n5.

So even IF it was the response, I will not have answered it to my friend, as the letter was for them. Considering D, it is possible that I have never heard from my friend before, and thus cannot answer to them.\n5. Similarly we could consider answering my letter to be a valid response to the question of why to I might read a letter from a friend. This eliminates choice C, reading the letter.\n6. So that leaves us with the choice of A, getting news.\n\n\n\n7. The correct answer is D: answer.\n\nInput: What do you do at a place where you work? Choices:1. A: work,2. B: not work,3.

To get the correct answer, let's consider each one of these points in details.\n\n\n    B: not work: You may decide to not work at a place where you're employed or get paid. This is only one of the options and by no means the only one. This eliminates this option as the correct answer.\n    C: do your job: This option is definitely what you can do at a place where work.

Choices: 1) A: it will be white 2) B: it will be stiffer 3) C: it will smell better 4) D: it will be smoother 5) E: it will burn faster\nOutput: 1 The first sentence in the question says: 'Using unbleached flour' so the answer cannot be 'white', as unbleached flour is a flour that has not had its natural colour altered. \n2. 'Stiffer' isn't something you can reliably expect to see any difference in, so it's not the correct answer choice. \n3. 'Smoother' is something you can see a visible difference in, but could easily be attributed to other differences in what you're making, like the method of cooking, or ingredients. It's likely that cooking the pizza in the oven at a high temperature will cause it to be smoother than cooking it at a lower temperature, even if that is being done. A high temperature causes it to bubble and become flatter and smoother as a result, where a lower temperature makes the crust thicker and thus less smooth. \n4. In any case, we've already considered that a'stiffer' crust isn't the correct choice, so the wording of the question makes it clear that this doesn't apply. \n5. Burning happens as a result of oxygen, which is often already present in other heat sources like flames or hot rocks. Therefore, the 'burn' that happens isn't a direct result of using unbleached flours. This means that burn faster isn't a viable choice, either. \n6. This leaves 'it will smell better'.\nSo the final answer to this question", "answer": "B: bedroom"}
{"idx": 694, "text": "1: This is a rhetorical question in that it's asking what you feel when you go the opera, but they are not looking for your personal reaction to this question. \n2. Based on this, there are five logical options to pick from:\n    - Fall Asleep: This is not the desired answer because the word \"feel\" means the correct answer is how you experience something. Sleep is not an experience \u2013 it's a state of inactivity and unawareness. It is not what you 'feel' when you go to the Opera.\n        - However, as a note the word \"feel\", as it's written here, can be interpreted to include the sensation of sleep as a possible emotion. This is a very common and permissible English word usage. It was simply not the intention of this question.\n    - Boredom: This is not the correct option as it is not an emotion that you would experience in response to attending the opera. Boredom is not a feeling \u2013 it's a mood. \n    - Headache: This is a possibility, but this is not how you 'feel' a headache. It's an unpleasant sensation that occurs in your head.\n    - Relaxation: This can be the correct answer if you attended the opera because the act of enjoying the experience is a relaxing state of mind.\n        - Note: The way to know if it's headache or relaxation is to think of the cause of the headache. If a headache is caused by extreme stress or worry, you would not feel relaxed in response to the intense stress and worry that causes the headache. Therefore, relaxation is not the correct answer if you experienced the cause to the headache as stress or worry.\n    - Relief: Since we have determined that it's not boredom and that we have already eliminated the possibility of falling asleep. This is now the most likely answer. One feels relief after a very stressful or difficult thing.\n    - Sick: This feels unlikely. I would argue that a person going to the opera is not going to experience significant stress or difficulty. It is in this reasoning that the right answer should be relief. However, as a note again from this answer choice, sick can be used to describe extreme fatigue, which is a possible interpretation of sleep", "answer": "D: relaxation"}
{"idx": 698, "text": "1: the question asks for a location most frequently occupied by young people. \n2. With this in mind, and considering each choice (A-E) in turn:\n    - A. office building \u2013 When young people go to the office, they often go there for work-related tasks or to interact with their colleagues. This doesn't fit the description of 'desk' given.  \n    - B. schoolroom \u2013 This doesn't really fit for many reasons. Firstly, the 'young' person isn't necessarily in school, and therefore a schoolroom is not a likely location to find them. Secondly, if the young person is in school, they may occupy a desk in a classroom, but the question only specifies a 'desk normally occupied by a _young_ person'. \n    -C. library \u2013 While young people often visit the library, they're not likely to occupy a desk specifically. Perhaps there are exceptions to this rule, but generally speaking, they're likely to find a desk in a library if it's available for free-use or they have a study group.\n    - D: bedroom \u2013 The majority of teenagers or young adults don't have a job, so a bedroom wouldn't normally be used for work-related tasks. As for school homework, young people certainly do school homework but they don't necessarily sit at a desk. They can do homework on the bed, on the couch, or in a classroom if they don't have their own. \n    - E: gym \u2013 Gyms only represent a subset of the activities young people normally enjoy engaging in. To simply call a gym a place of work is also misleading because 'work' can mean many different things. \n3.

However, we can all agree that this is likely not a rule or requirement. Therefore, this would be an incorrect choice of answer.\n    - Makeup/speech \u2013 It is likely that a person would prepare the necessary speech in advance, and ensure that they looked their best in public by putting on their makeup. It would be unusual that a person would have to include makeup (or a particular kind of speech if this was an interview) as items on their list.\n    - A good-night's sleep \u2013 This is not an item that a person could reasonably leave off their list. No one ever went to present without having slept the night before. It is the obvious choice for this question, being the only one of the four items on the list that most people would list as a 'necessary' requirement for a presentation.\n    - Jewelery \u2013 None of the four options on the list", "answer": "C: disneyland"}

In considering choice B, that is, the lawyers' pleasure since they have plenty of leisure time, this is definitely not correct because pleasure is associated with having free time and not with spending a lot of time doing something like working a lot. \n3.

As we have removed the restrictions relating to being alive and the requirement of it being able to become a pet snakes, we can eliminate the snake as an option.\n6.) We have ruled out animals, living or dead, and things inanimate, that can't become pet snakes from our choices.\n7.) This leaves us with two options:\n     - The python\n     - The anaconda\n   \n8.)

Therefore A is eliminated as the correct choice. \n    - B: The lake (C) where anemones are commonly found is not shaped like a glove. So we can eliminate this one. Similarly, the tide pool and the nursery E) can't be the correct answer either since these aren't glove shaped and so B and E must be eliminated.\n3: Coming to D, the Atlantic Ocean, this can fit the bill because the glove shape does indeed resemble the ocean. Anemones are found in the Atlantic Ocean and the shape of the Atlantic Ocean closely resembles a clenched or curled fist, much like a glove. Therefore, the Atlantic Ocean is the right answer.\nSo the final correct answer is A: Atlantic Ocean\n\nInput:What isn't a feature of a 8.0 earthquake?

Looking at option A, the apartment is too restrictive because the location of this choice implies one is in a residential situation where they have a home computer in the form of a tablet or laptop. The question refers to a computer and not a tablet, therefore this option is incorrect.\n3. Examining option B, the table is also incorrect because that implies sitting, which is already covered by having a desk. It also does not give any other location. \n4. Option C, the school, is also no where a computer can be placed other than a desk. You already have a home computer, so to use a computer there, it's a matter of borrowing one to take to school. Also, you may also need to place that computer on a desk in that location.\n5. Option D, the office, also doesn't provide any new locations for putting a computer other than a desktop.

Let\u2019s consider each of the answer choices:\n    - A square shape \u2013 All rooms facing outside will not have a square shape. Some will have a rectangular shape and some will have a round shape. Therefore, the correct option is not A: square shape. \n    - B different sizes \u2013 Although some rooms may be smaller than others, this doesn\u2019t have anything to do with what rooms that face outside of a building will all have. All rooms facing outdoors will have one thing in common and that is a door and window. \n    - Flowers \u2013 This isn\u2019t a characteristic that would only be applicable to rooms that are outdoors. Therefore, the correct options is not B: flowers. \n    - Doors and windows \u2013 Even though all rooms that face outdoors of a building will all feature doors and windows, it wouldn\u2019t be reasonable to say that all rooms facing outdoors are the same in that way. One room could have a window, another room could have a door, and another room could have both. Again, they will all have the same characteristic but to say all rooms facing outdo are the same would be incorrect. \n    - High walls \u2013 Although it could be said that all rooms facing outdoor have high walls, this isn\u2019t the answer the question is asking for because many rooms with doors and windows facing outdoors do not have high walls. \n3.

{"idx": 874, "text": "1, The question is about what usually happens to people who act as models, or otherwise model themselves as a job. 2. Let's look at each answer choice: \n    - A: very ugly \u2013 This isn't correct because people who model usually appear reasonably appealing or beautiful. A model is someone who provides us with a representation or example of what a particular thing is supposed to look like. Therefore, they can't be'very ugly' for this purpose. \n    - B: appear beautiful \u2013 This is correct because 'appear' indicates a superficial or external appearance. This doesn't necessarily say anything about the inner-beauty of a person, which might be completely lacking in models. \n    - It's common for models to be well-compensated financially. They're well-compensated either to live a life of luxury or to simply cover the expenses of attending school while they pursue a career as a model. Therefore, models usually don't have to pay bills out of their own pocket or with money they've earned doing a job. \n    - Pain is something people may experience during their everyday lives, or more specifically during the performance of their jobs. However, models aren't people whose job it would be to face pain that's not normal or inevitable. \n    - The last option here, free slaves, would probably indicate that models were somehow prevented from earning money normally and instead being granted a special kind of employment or living situation. However, the fact that models have to pay bills or suffer some pain while working isn't typically a result of being slaves, so the answer isn't C: free slaves.\n3. Therefore, you can find the correct answer is B: appear beautiful.\nSo the final option is B: appear beautiful\n\nInput: In what season are bees busiest?

{"idx": 878, "text": "1.) The question is looking for how to find someone who is wet after being full of (another adjective describing fear).\n2.) The first thing that might come to mind in terms of an answer to this would be that the person was swimming. This is easily dismissed because the second sentence in this paragraph gives us the following statement:\n\n    \"It is worth noting that people who are full of fear will probably be wet regardless of the swimming pool that they enter.\" \n    Therefore, swimming in a pool will not cause someone to become wet if they were already full of fear prior to entering the pool.\n3.) The last answer that we can eliminate that is not referring to the individual being wet is fight.\n    We can rule this off because it doesn't necessarily address if the person has already been full of fear or not.\n4.) Next, we can get rid of options that don't indicate the need to be wet due to fear. Specifically, urinating and fighting the enemy.\n    If there is no fight involved, then you cannot get wet. If someone is having to be fearful due to being in a fight, they are likely already wet, thus we eliminate the need for being wet.\n5.) This leaves us with options A: run and B: calculate things quickly.\n    The wording of the question implies they want to find someone who is full of fear or someone who is going to be wet after. There is some inference to be made here about why this person is wet, but we will not go into that here.\n6.) To summarize, the final answer is the answer choice that does not give a reason for the person to be wet. That answer choice is A: run.\nSo the final correct answer is A: run\n\nInput: If a group of students can be called a flock.

You could say they could share ideas from people that are out of ideas, but that's a whole different scenario.\n- Talking - Again, this is not really possible in my eyes because we are supposed to find out the actions of someone that is out of ideas; and \"talking\" is not an action.\n-", "answer": "B: solar energy"}

When stereotypes often come about in relation to families, it makes sense that there should be a word related to a family that fits into this sentence. So it should definitely be an answer choice related to a family, such as a living room, basement, or guest room.\n3. We will examine the choices that don't fit:\n    - Garage: Not a place people sleep.\n    - Horseradish: There's no sense of what these are as well.\n    - D: Guest room: People typically use guest rooms to accommodate guests, so it seems like an odd term to have use for oneself.\n    - Basement: It doesn't seem to fit the sentence structure well, but we'll keep it as a possibility because of its ambiguous definition\n\n4. Looking at Basement again, we see that it actually does fit the sentence and is grammatically correct, which eliminates its other answer choices.\n5.

Each possible answer choice must be able to explain how the side effects are characterized, or why it is distinct from other types of side effects. Here, none of the options do that accurately.\n3. In order for B and C to be true, 'distinguished' and'remarkable' respectively, they would have to describe what makes one side effect different from others, perhaps what other drugs and effects they have in common, or how they are similar to other side effects. These are things that a physician might tell you and that's good, but it's not related to what the answer is looking like. That being said, it is possible that many are unique in their own way, so this might be a viable answer.  \n4. D could be an unreasonable answer because 'excellent' describes the drug's overall effectiveness, not specifically the side effects.  \n5. It may also indicate that all side effects are excellent, so this is an irrelevant answer choice.\n6.

Consider the individual options:\n    - A. This option cannot be true, as if someone is guilty of committing murder, then they already would be aware of that fact. Confessing to something you did with no remorse, guilt, or shame would be meaningless.\n    - B. This option is an unreasonable assumption, as there is no guarantee that someone will fear committing murder again if they\u2019ve already been caught. \n    -. C. It is impossible for a person to go free if they are truly guilty of committing murder.\n    - E. While some may use murder in order to find god, this is not what the original question is asking about.\n    - D.

Choices:  Tire A: wiper B: airbag C: seatbelt D: gas tank E: blinker\nOutput: 1_Input: What may one observe to be broke in a vehicle that has *not* passed a safety test? We can assume that, even if the car has not passed a safety check, it hasn't been declared an unsafe choice, so this means that every vehicle is able to pass at least some of the safety test. So it\u2019s important that we recognize the part that the test would examine. The options may include: (a) a wiper; (b) an airbag; (c) a seat belt; (d) a gas tank; and (e) a blinker.\n2_Let's examine the five options that we may or may not see:\nA. A blinker is a device on a vehicle that is meant to signal to other motorist or passengers which direction the vehicle is trying to move. (e.g. \"The turn signal blinked.\" \"A warning blinked on your screen.\")\nB. An airbag is an inflatable soft pad designed to protect a vehicle occupant(", "answer": "A: guilty conscience"}
{"idx": 938, "text": "1) The question is about describing a crowd with less people than it actually has.\n2)Let's begin our analysis with option A, crowd in fields.\n   - Since each group of people in the field has their own crowd, it's not accurate to say that this isn't a big crowd, since there are a lot of small crowds inside the field. \n   - Further, there is a certain amount of distance between each group of people, implying that the space is sufficient to be considered as a field, as opposed to just a crowd.\n3)Looking at option B, the crowd alone.\n   - This implies that each person is in fact standing completely alone. For that to be true, the crowd needs to be the only thing on that field. \n   But since we can see that people stand in groups, this isn't true.\n4)Looking at Option C, small group: \n  - This means that this crowd has 250 or less people. But since we can see more than 250 people in the image, this clearly isn't accurate.\n   - We can therefore completely rule this option out. \n5)Option D, solitude.\n   - There is something that is considered solitude, in the sense that the two people here aren't interacting with or talking to each other. \n   This also implies that this crowd is composed solely of two people, which isn't the case. \n6) We're left with option E, solitary. \n  - This option captures the meaning of solitude completely.\n   - It allows a small number of people, implying a crowd, while at the same time acknowledging that they're not interacting with each other.\n   - Therefore, this is the correct answer, that the crowd is better described as solitary.\nSo the final answere is E: solitary\n\nInput: A cow is considered what because it doesn't produce milk?

We can eliminate choices D and E, because if clothes have developed a smelly smell, then they obviously can't be cleaned.\n3: Now lets do the same to answer choice B - Hang in the closet. Obviously, if clothes have a bad smell already, you are obviously not going to hang them in the closet.\n4: Therefore the answer is either A: hang in closets or C: Get dirty.\n5: There is a chance that the question could be answered with either choice. But a quick look at the question gives some details. Clothes often smell because of perspiration. If perspiration itself isn't treated, then it can only make the clothes smell worse. However, we can get dirty clothes clean so we are eliminating choice C as one of the correct options, this eliminates the chance of C as one of the choices. Because the wording, \"what you should do\" is giving us a hint that the question is looking for something that is a common practice. Which in this case, we can rule out choice D as well.\nTherefore finally the answer is A: hang in closetra\n\nInput:The city of New Orleans is home to one of the oldest professional baseball teams.

{"idx": 946, "text": "1) The question refers to someone who is NOT able to learn anymore. The term \"ability to learn\" refers to someone who's able to learn more skills and capabilities. When someone becomes incapable of learning, they'll no longer be able to pick up new skills and knowledge. Instead, they'll find it difficult or impossible to learn.\n2) Let's consider each of the answer choices:\n    - A) intelligence \u2013 While being able to learn means that a person is intelligent, it doesn't mean that a person with low intelligence can't learn. They may have lower intelligence than someone else, but their ability to learn will still continue. So inability to learn does not cause someone to become stupid or unintelligent.\n    - B) education \u2013 Learning doesn't necessarily have to involve going to school or taking formal classes. Being able to learn can be done in a self-taught manner. Furthermore, being unable to learn does not affect the quality of someone's education.\n    - C) effectiveness \u2013 This is an incorrect choice because effectiveness and being unable to learn have no relation between each other. \n    - E) a stupid \u2013 This is the opposite statement from the question asked. When someone's unable to learn, they're not \"becoming stupid\", nor are they simply losing their intelligence. \n    - Choice D) distress is also incorrect because being incapable of learning isn't the same as experiencing distress. Distress is a state of mental discomfort experienced by people.  On the other hand, the person could experience distress because they're not able to learn.

{"idx": 954, "text": "1: The question asks for a place where multiple rulers owned by different people could be found.\n2: The wording of the question indicates that multiple rulers can be found because the question includes both the preposition 'of' and the definite article 'the' in the phrase \"multiple ruler that are owned\". \n3: These rulers can be owned because it is understood that a ruler is used to mark or measure a specific line.\n\n4. Choice B is incorrect because England is the name of a country and cannot, by its own right, be used as a plural noun. In this sense, the word 'England' can be defined as a place where a ruler was once owned or used, but not as a place where multiple ruler are owned by different people.\n\n5. Choice C is incorrect because the office can not be used as a plurality due to the word 'of' being used. Therefore, the statement \"multiple ruler are found at the office\" does not hold any validity. \n\n6. Choice D is incorrect for the same reasons as choice C above.\n\n7. Choice E is incorrect as well as it is implying that multiple rulers are owned by the same person.

The question is trying to gauge which effect you'd be more likely to 'feel' when you choose to forgive someone.\n3. Let's now consider each answer choice: \n    - A: nice feeling \u2013 We can probably all agree that feeling a sense of forgiveness is a nice feeling, and a great reason to do so. However, this answer choice is not exactly what's asked about since the emphasis is on the hidden forces being affected when you're forgiven.\n    - B. good karma \u2013 Karma is often considered to be the consequence of your actions. However if you're being forgiven for your actions, you'd typically receive a positive consequence since you're actively trying to improve and correct your actions.\n    - C: respect \u2013 This doesn't quite capture the intent behind the actual hidden force the author is likely trying to refer to. There could be an argument that by being forgiven you receive an increased sense of respect both on an outside level from others, and on an inner level from yourself. However, the question is asking about which new hidden forces are likely to be affected when you're actively forgiving others.\n    - D: new freedom \u2013 The author may be referring to having more freedom (new freedom) as compared to before being forgiven. For example, maybe there is a feeling of weight lifted and freedom granted that now you may have the liberty to try and make positive changes. However, new freedom doesn't directly contradict the original question and is therefore doesn't entirely capture the essence of its meaning.\n    - E new heart \u2013 This answer choice is interesting as you really can feel a new heart since all of your actions have the potential of positively improving and changing you over time. With continued action and reflection on your actions, one can hope to develop or gain a new heart that is full of compassion, love, and warmth. \n      - This is also a potential answer for choice choice B.

Firstly, we know we want a theater in the same place as other stores. However, the question is not just finding a theater in the middle of other stores. \n4. It doesn't have to be like that. A movie theater could quite well be in a separate building from all the other stores, and still be in the same place. In this case, it wouldn't be possible to know whether there's a movie theatre and other stores in the same place. We would have look instead, for a place that is in the same place as both these things.\n5. Considering answer B, the Urban area, urban in this sense refers to a large cluster of cities. \n6. In this context, it's not clear whether a movie theater and other stores in a city fall within the same area. In the case of a city having these things in separate places, they would be not be found in the same place. And if you find them in the same place, then it doesn't mean other stores are present in the same place. \n7. So we can rule option B out as a possibility.\n8. Looking at option A for 'downtown area' it seems clear that a movie theater won't be found alongside other stores in a downtown area. We can rule A out too.\n9. With options C, D and E remaining, we know the question refers to a 'place' and not a city or town. But there aren't many places in the world outside a city or a town, and if there is, it's quite far from a city. \n10. So we must rule out options C and E too.\n11. With option D, the shopping mall, we have what we are looking for. \n12. Since malls typically have a bunch of stores side by side, a movie theater in the same shopping mall will be in the same place as the other stores. \nSo the correct answer is D: shopping malls.\n13. If you look at the answer choices, answer B is wrong as it is unclear which is the right urban area to look for,", "answer": "D: shopping mall"}

Since Sundays are the first day of the week, this is not a choice, except for extreme examples that are not applicable.\n    - (K)= Running away: Considering the context of Sunday as the day of relaxation and peace, running away seems counterproductive.

Another factor is to choose a correct answer based on the question statement. \"how is it possible to make\" indicates that an apple is made by people. Option 2 is related to the apple itself and not to how it can be made. Thus option 2 is crossed out also.\n4. We will eliminate options that do not match this statement: the action of making an apple should enhance or otherwise change the apple to make it more delicious. Option 3 would result in adding fruit to an apple, which is not an action of making an apple more delicious. Similarly option 4 would not change the apple to make this apple more delicious.\n5.

Let's look closely at the sentence: \"She went to examine an oak tree that she had promised to keep an eye on as it was going to bloom.\" This gives us the context that what the oak tree is going to do (bloom) is something that will happen in the near future. In other words, she has already promised to examine this tree by then, and if this were to be an option with which she was considering beginning to examine this, she wouldn't have to. There's no need to consider beginning to examine the tree, which implies this action has already occurred.

The question is asking about what one would typically feel after each course that the restaurant has on the tasting men. \n2) Let's consider each choice:\n    - **A)** Feeling full stomach \u2013 This isn't what the person is asking for, because the question is about what one will feel when eating everything on the menu. So eating food already requires one to be full, so one doesn't need to feel full when eating everything on this menu.\n    - **B)** Getting full \u2013 This isn't possible based on the scenario since the menu is a tasting menu, which is meant to sample the various plates. So if you're doing a tasting menu it means each course will be small in portion size, and you can't 'get full' if you haven't finished it yet.\n    - **C)** Gaining weight \u2013 This isn't accurate either because it doesn't matter what you do on the tasting, you're still going to (very likely) gain weight.\n    - **D)** Sick \u2013 This isn't an option in the context of eating everything on a tasting menu (since in that scenario, you only eat food that is good for you)\n    - **D** Satisfaction \u2013 This is a more emotional response after eating the courses.

We can rule out choices C and D, since they both describe the supply of snakes - it's not about \"bringing in\", but \"what's forcing people to demand\".\n3) The reason for this demand is most likely that snakes are now seen as a status symbol, and people are becoming interested in owning a snake. This would be more of a psychological problem than a situation of supply and demand.\n4) Choices A and B are also incorrect because even if they were the reason to bring snakes to pet shops, it wouldn't have an effect on supply - only on transportation. It would either lead to fewer snakes being sold, or would increase the likelihood of them dying during transport. \n5) Choice E is the right choice because exotic snakes generally require extreme temperatures to be kept, and as such can only be kept in a very few (not all) pet shops.  This keeps them from being supplied to every pet-shop, but would drive up the price of snakes.\n6) We can thus conclude that the final answer is E: outdoors.\nSo the final choice is E.", "answer": "D: pet shops"}

Mark has his semen deemed thick before the procedure \u2013 This means the semen he produces naturally is thick.\n3. If he is not producing semen at all after the procedure, then this would be an instance in which his semen is also free-flowing.

Neither of them fit the question as it pertains to pain.\n    - C: headache \u2013 Let's consider different types of headaches that could result from excess screen time. A headache occurs when the blood vessels in your head constrict in response to stress or muscular tension. Since the blood vessels constrict, fewer blood vessels are available to deliver more nutrients and oxygen to your brain. As a result, the brain isn't getting enough oxygen and, as a result, it's irritated and inflamed causing the headache. However, there's no link between proximity to the TV and a headache.\n    - D: get fat \u2013 While excessive screen time can lead to laziness and obesity if one doesn't get much moving around in their lives, it's not causing one to physically get fat.\n    - E : laughter \u2013 While sitting close to the TV can cause laughter if the show is particularly funny, it isn't causing the laughter but rather the laughter is the result of getting too close to the TV when it's funny.\n3) With these considerations, it appears that headache isn't the correct choice since it's not painful.

However, we could say that there could be other factors that cause a person to become tired. For example, they may have already been working and just returning from work. Or they may have been tired for some other reason. Therefore, 'tiredness' is not an accurate inference.\n3. Looking at option B, the phrase 'to live longer' indicates that longer life can be a consequence of eating too much, therefore option \"to live longer\" is incorrect. \n4.

There is some confusion about whether an illness refers to a physical state or whether it refers to a particular medical condition.

This is caused by an overly full stomach, and therefore, will not lead to death, which is the end state of a person's life. It is just a symptom of eating too much. Option E is incorrect. \n7.

So the answer cannot be B because of this.\n2.3 C: broken legs \u2013 Considering broken legs, it's evident that it is not the correct answer since broken legs are the result of an unsuccessful season of skiing, not that of a successful one.\n2.4 D: chapped lips \u2013 This choice is not the correct answer because chapped lips is the result of skiing in general, not just of a successful season.\n2.5 E: healthy body \u2013 A healthy body is the result of a successful and safe season of skiing, so the answer cannot possibly be E.\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. \nSo the final answer  is A: finish line\n\nInput: A particular town has many houses on certain streets lined up in rows.

With this in mind, we can eliminate \"falling down\" and \"lower standards\" from the options.

Now, consider choice C, a court appearance. We can look at this wording carefully and break it apart. In this context, there are two parts to it. One part is 'paying attention', and the other part is 'watching soap operas'. The phrase 'to hear testimony' is used in answer choices B and D, so that wording itself is not enough to differentiate these answer choices.\nIt's important to pay careful attention to context and the question when choosing the correct answer. When we break down answer choice C, we notice that it refers to a person who appears in court. We can then eliminate all of the answers in which the phrase appears within the context of someone paying attention, like we can eliminate choice D.\n5. With the consideration of answer choice C, there are two things that need to be true in order for this to be the correct answer. First, the person must be appearing in court. Second, they must also appear in the context of hearing testimony.\n6. To check if this is the case, we can see if that's true for each of the remaining choices (answer choices: E, A, B).\n\n7. For answer choice E, it's important to understand that we do not need to pay attention in court in order for this answer choice to be accurate. The person could be doing anything in court, so this isn't the correct choice.\n8. Now, we're left with answer choices A and B. Looking at the wording of choice A closely, we can see that a paying attentiveness testifies to something. This tells us that in answer choice A, the paying attention must be a cause that results in testimony. Therefore  we can eliminate answer choice A. \nIn this case, the answer with the longest description that involves the right terms is the correct answer.\nWe can see", "answer": "A: go to church"}

However, if we wanted to keep it there to use it at a later time, then the correct option would be C, the beach. So, since they aren't applicable here, they must be rejected.\n    - C: The beach would be good for us to place the chair at if we planned to use it later, such as on vacation. But since we are not using it at all in this scenario, and there are no large doors in our house, the chair would actually belong in the closet, E.\n    - D: If we consider the closet, we know that there are definitely doors leading to it. But because the person does not plan on using the chair, and does not even intend to take it to any door, then it cannot belong in the closet either.\n    - E, the garage. The garage only belongs in this situation if the chair were to be taken to it. To take it to any other door would imply that the person planned to use the chair.

Also, it is incorrect to use the term 'dog park' when a dog park is in the living room as an indoor space instead of a large open-air space outside.\n3. This eliminates choice B. Similarly, we can rule out choices D and E, which refer to very small or narrow rooms.\n4. This leaves us with the following answer choices with the exception of C, the living room. This is a large room, but a small dog would never have enough space to feel like it had all the room it could possibly want. The dog is also indoors in its living room, which is not how we interpreted the question to indicate a large space within the house itself.\n5.

As long as they've already eliminated the ones that contain a soccer field already, they should only have any one of these remaining.\n\n5: Looking at each option:\n    - A, The playground, could well contain a soccer field. So, this is not the answer.    - B, Mexico, is actually a country, so it could contain a soccer field somewhere but still be considered a place where one might not find it. Since the question has excluded an answer choice for the 'town', this could refer to either a city in Mexico or any other place in the country as a whole. This is not an actual answer to the question, and even if you consider it for a moment, you've narrowed down the options to four or five places that are on the \"No\" side of the answer already. Therefore, Mexico cannot be the answer.    - C, Town, is included as one of the incorrect answer choices, so we can discard it immediately.    - D, Outside, is another place where a soccer field might not be contained but is not specifically referring to a soccer field in any building at all nor does it consider any such thing. So, it is not the answer either.    - E, World Cup, is actually one of the other choices excluded, so I suggest it not included either. So, the choices become A, B, and C. \n    - A: Playground \u2013 if the question were:  A place where one might not be able to find a soccer field, then it could be assumed it could also not be a place where they could find a soccer field.\n6: B, Mexico, is another answer choice that would answer the question.\nI therefore recommend answer B: Mexico as the correct", "answer": "D: outside"}
{"idx": 144, "text": "1 A: Injury is not an accurate description of what happens next because the person might survive with no injury at all. \n2. B: Death is also inaccurate because while sky diving might be dangerous, people who engage in it do not necessarily die from it. \n3. C: Playing Uno is also inaccuracy because not everyone even does that while they're playing Sky diving. \n4. D: Coma is probably the worst possible answer because coma is what would happen if someone stopped breathing, and that could only happen if they died \n5. E: Falling down is a possible answer, but that wouldn't make him lose consciousness. The falling down might make him pass out but that is not what happens in the question. \n6.

Then when he got to the end of the tunnel he started to remember what? Choices: A: A long time ago  B: How to solve this riddle  C: The truth D: The secret  E: Forgiveness\n\nOutput: A: A long while is not a correct answer since he was only upset for a short time. Even if it was a long time, he would remember a long time he was upset, not a long time ago. \nB: This is also not the right answer, because a short time would be from now and he was only upset a short time ago. \nC: Even though he is only upset for a small amount of time, he would not have the time to remember how to solve a riddle. He is too mad to have this time. Therefore, D is also a wrong answer choice. \nD: Again the answer is wrong, as he was only upset and not being forgetful. His loss can only be remembered if it was a long or short memory. \nE: He might not remember to forgive if he was upset and remembered some stuff after. He should only be forgiven if he was confused and forgetful.\nTherefore I am left to choose Option E and that is the correct answer.\nSo the final Answer will be\nE: Forgiveness", "answer": "E: falling down"}

So A is eliminated.\n    - B, paying bills\u2013 While paying bills is often a consequence of getting paid, that doesn't necessarily mean that 'getting paid' is the thing that causes one to ultimately end up paying bills. Thus B is eliminated too.\n    - C, happiness\u2013 Getting paid should, in theory, always bring some kind of happiness. However, if that wasn't the case, people would not be motivated and compelled to do many tasks, including work. It's not feasible to argue that one's happiness from getting paid is so low that it doesn't merit the task they undertake. Therefore C is eliminated.\n3) With these eliminations, D gets selected as the most viable option. D, frustration \u2013 While it's entirely conceivable that someone might experience frustration from getting paid if, for example, they get shortchanged on their wages, frustration isn't really a universal outcome of getting paid. Increased spending may be the consequence of having more money, but this is different from frustration at getting paid.\n4) For this reason, the correct answer is D: frustration.\nSo the final is D: frustration", "answer": "C: happiness"}

So, again we eliminate this.\n    - C) The word, dwarf, means short and can't be related to mass. This means dwarf building is also out.\n    - D) The word, inconsequential, means not important.

If this camper looks up at this great expanse, he will likely experience a feeling of awe or inspiration. The night sky is so vast that it makes us feel small in comparison, almost like we are a little grain of sand among its vast expanse. Therefore, this isn't it.\n    - B. insignificant \u2013 Just like A, this isn't the answer either. The camper views something large, and it should inspire feelings of awe or wonder. It certainly cannot make a camper viewing this spectacle feel insignificant.\n    - C. stellar \u2013 This is close but it's not what the camper is feeling.

To help understand the question, let's review each answer choice:\n  A: pointed - A document can always be pointed in some sense, but an obstructive document is not one that points or directs in that way. Therefore, this is not the answer. \n  B: bright - A brighter document is not necessarily opaque, so this answer is not fitting either. \n  C: easy - When a document is easy to understand it is generally due to its clarity, not its being obtuse. This could also imply an intention to confuse the reader, but in general, easy documents are not obtuse. \n  D: clear - When a document is clear, then the author intends the reader to understand its content, and this isn't contradictory to clarity. Therefore, it'll be unlikely to be obtuse. \n Therefore the answer is C: easy\n\nSo the final answer would be C: easy\n### Instruction: Answer the following multiple choice question\nInput: What are the consequences of telling a lie? Choices:  B: truth \nA: deceit \nC: confusion\nD: betrayal E: disappointment \nOutput: 1 - The question is about what could be the possible consequences of telling a lie. This could have the potential to be something detrimental to the person who has lied, as well as others.\n2 - Let's look at each possible answer:\n  A: deceit - A lie is deceitful, and this is an option\n\n  B: truth \u2013 A truth is a fact, and this option could be interpreted as 'don't speak the truth' when telling the truth as a lie could have serious consequences. Therefore, it'd be incorrect to say so.\n  C: confusion - Confusion is not the same as telling a lie, as someone lying will be aware of the consequence of telling a lie and this isn't the situation mentioned.\n  D: betrayal - Betrayal can occur due to many different circumstances, and it is irrelevant to telling a lie.\n  E: disappointment - Disappointment is not what comes from telling a lie, as telling the truth about doing things rightfully, such as lying, is not something that would bring about", "answer": "D: clear"}

We can eliminate all options A, C, and D, as baking a cake isn't exactly the same thing as eating a cake out somewhere. A cake is something you bake if you don't want to get one from a bakery. Therefore, choices A, C, and B are all not the correct options.\n3. B is a choice since we can go to a bakery to buy a delicious cake.\n4. But in this context, buying a cake from a bakery is not the same as getting a cake from the bakery and therefore, B can also be ruled out.\n5. Now let's consider choice C, the grocery store. The question doesn't indicate that the person asking this question doesn't have groceries on hand at their house. Therefore, this choice is also ruled out.\n6. This is all to establish that you haven't already bought a cake or don't have cakes on hand, since these can also be a perfectly reasonable alternative if you want to eat a cake.\n7. D is an option which describes where people go if they do want to bake the cake themselves, but that's not the scenario we're considering here. So option D can be eliminated.\n8. Choice E, an oven, is also eliminated, as it is used for baking cakes and not for eating them. An oven can also be used to warm food up and you might go to a restaurant or supermarket if you're also looking for an option for eating a cake.\n9.

We are trying to find the answer that is the most unique. \n3. In this case, the two stand out to a lot of people.  D: Irritation is a very rare adjective that describes very specific people and that only describes the action being done. \n4. However, \"irritated\" people should only apply to people that \"things\" are \"irritating\" to.  This leaves us with the choice.  Bob and Boris are definitely irritated by the conditions of the queue, but the children are just \"being\" loud.  Therefore, E is not correct.  B: Being annoyed is also incorrect. Although many might think of being \"annoyed\" by the children, it's much different than what B means (ie being annoyed at something for a significant period of time with a person or personality, rather than being annoyed by a short event or situation in time). \n5. This does not leave us with C: Delays, as delays imply time, and this only describes the children.  Also, a \"delayed\" person is not an accurate description of what both Bob and Boris are at the moment, since they are just standing in line. \n6.

However, it does, in fact, release energy in the muscles that you use, making it an incorrect choice. \n    - A: Vent \u2013 This is a verb that means \"to release or expel gas or air (as from the lungs)\"; the main point of this answer choice is that it is an organic expulsion of gas, in contrast to most of the other organic actions included in this list. These gasses do not come from the muscles, therefore making this an incorrect answer.\n    - D: Work off \u2013 This means to burn off or eliminate, which does indeed require the use of energy, and you can do this with muscular movements as well. The main point here is that it does use motion, and so, not being muscular-based and not primarily muscular-based enough are in contradiction.\n4. Choice E: Exercise, however, is correct. This choice involves muscular movement, and so is an appropriate answer choice.\nSo the final answers are E: exercise\n\nInput: You can think of e and -1 as equivalent. Choices:  A:-1 B: e C: any negative whole number D: whole number. E: all whole numbers\nOutput: 1 and 2. 1. The question asks \"you can think of e and \u22121 as equivalent.\" This sentence is a correct assertion, and not a question. The test writer has assumed that you know what e is in this context. In real life, it is probably common knowledge that e is an integral constant of mathematics that happens to equal 2.7182818... The test writer may expect you to know that if you are an engineer or a mathematician. However, in this context, we should consider what is given in this question itself. Here, -1 is meant as a negative one. So, we need to define what is meant by \"any negative whole number\". Since the", "answer": "B: think"}
{"idx": 360, "text": "1.) The question has a few important clarifications to keep in mind. First, it's clear that we're looking for a location in which he gets lost, as this question appears to be about someone who's lost. Second, the room on his schedule is on the second floor, and that means the building the room is located in had more than one floor.\n2.) It's also key to remember that \"what\" is part of this question and is there so that we can identify what the room is on.\n3.) The wording of the question includes the phrase \"very large\"; this is not a clarification and it means that whatever the room on the schedule is, it is very large compared to the small building or house on the floor below.\n4.) Finally, the word \"centre\" in the answer choices confuses people. In the sentence, the room is located in the \"very large what?\". In American English, the word \"centres\" is often used to mean \"one of two opposing things\" in a sentence, whereas the British English spelling is \"centre\". Because of this, there's no reason to include \"centre\" as a choice in the question because it only distracts instead of providing help in finding the correct answer.\n5.) Therefore, the answers are: A: school, B: office building, C: house.\n6.) The correct answer in this case is A: school. \nSo the final answer, in this case, the correct answer is A.\n\nInput: If a teacher and a teacher's assistant are discussing students, what is the teacher most likely looking for input on?

E: their attendance\nOutput: 1) The question has only one blank to fill and there is one missing piece, so it's easiest to start with that missing bit. The word \"input\" is the correct spelling of this word, and the meaning is something given to aid in the completion of a process. 2) Next, we know that this discussion is for input on student behavior. 3) This is because students often need help, and often they are provided with help from a teacher and assistant, and that help is for the student's behavior. 4) The", "answer": "A: school"}

Therefore, this answer choice is incorrect.\n\n4. Looking at choice A, accomplish, this is not the goal in many cases because even if individuals who hear about the new organization choose to take actions to support it, and there is a specific action they're expected to take, then being told about the organization is not a goal.\n\n5. Answer choice B, learn about, is not always the goal either, since many other people who have prior knowledge about the organization may be able to provide the same information about the organization to a new person.\n\n6. Answer choice C, money, could be the goal if the person is looking to sell their interest in the organization. This choice covers a wide range of answers and is not the correct one.\n\n7. Answer choice D, notoriety, is not a good choice either because often many organizations, no matter how new they may be, have notoriety since these organizations may get significant attention from the media or from other sources. \n\n8. Answer choice E, religion, is also incorrect because some organizations are religious organizations and others are not. It's not specific to religion.\n\n9.

Choice A, getting hungry, is incorrect because this isn't something that necessarily happens by merely playing too aggressively, but is instead an effect of over-exertion happening over time.\n3.) Choice B, laughter, is also incorrect because this is a result of a joke rather than over-exertion, which we are considering in this context. \n4.) Choice C, injury, is incorrect too because we are not asking about an injury that develops from over-exerting.\n5.) Choice D, feeling happy, is incorrect again because it does not come from playing too aggressively.\n6) Choice E, feeling happy, is the correct answer because feeling happy often comes as a result of playing too aggressively or engaging in any physically active activity.\nSo the final answers is E: feeling happy\n\nInput: You can see that your to-do list is in need of updating. Which of the following is not on your list to do?

Choice A, organizing doesn't seem to make sense on this list since none of these tasks require order. \n2.) Choice B, dusting doesn't seem to fit well either since this task requires one to move around. \n3.) Choice C, vacuuming also doesn't make a lot of sense since this task isn't necessarily one of the tasks that you need to do that day. \n4.)

The answer, logically, can't be zero.\n    - c: The answer can't possibly be negative. This contradicts the logic that 2+3=5, which is already a positive number.\n    - d: The answer is definitely not positive. The logic is that if you add 2 to 3 in an equation, it gives you 5, therefore the next equation is, by extension, (2+X) > 3. Then you know that if you subtract one from (2+X), it will equal 2. However, subtracting two negative numbers does not yield a positive result.\n    - e: The answer is positive. This is because the next equation is logically, (2+X)+X < 3. In order to get to 3, the equation must yield a positive result.", "answer": "C: own family"}

It\u2019s true that you can be awake when your eyes are open, but you\u2019re also likely to be alert to what\u2019s going on around you, which means you\u2019re aware of what\u2019s going on. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on\u201d implies something is happening.\n3.

By having memories stored and retrieved by looking at the position of the neurons in\nrelation to the time at which the memory occured \nOutput:     It's saying that your eyes are closed when you're asleep.\n5.Your brain creates the memories, so a lot of the information you\u2019re collecting is stored away in your brain\u2019s neural networks.\n5.This means your brain is using an associative memory, which combines information from separate locations or events in such a way that the brain can access that information.\nIt's true that this is the answer, but there\u2019s actually a fourth option that most people don\u2019t consider, which is a little bit more complicated, but which also means you are a genius when it comes to remembering something.\nSo the final result is C: By having memories stored by looking at the position and connections of the neurons in relation to the time at which they occurred", "answer": "E: conscious"}

Humans do not have sex with every sound they hear, nor do humans *have* to hear a sound in order to have sex. Sex is only one outcome.\n    - D. This answer choice may answer some level of reproduction, but humans do not *have to* reproduce every time they are exposed to sound. Humans can have other emotions and responses to sounds.\n    - E. This option is too vague and can be said for many reactions to sound. In short, every time a person drives a car, they do in fact experience sound as well; this does not happen only when they are driving cars.\n3. With this, the only valid answer choice is C: have sex.\nSo the final and correct answer is C: to have sex", "answer": "B: hear sounds"}

You can look at them at most but you'd be wasting valuable time.\n4.So we can focus our attention on the remaining choices since each of them are good descriptions of a yard.\n5.Let's consider choice A, farmland. You often see farms with tiny yards. This is a good possibility but the yard must be a tiny yard in the context of a farm. If the farm is huge then the yard would still be tiny with respect to the whole property, but this wouldn't technically fall under the guidelines since a tiny yard is something that is tiny compared to the vastness of the entire area. However, this choice is actually correct since the farm is large and so the yard is tiny in comparison with respect to an area that is so large. \n6.Next, consider choice B, neighborhood. Now if you are referring to suburban neighborhood a yard can obviously be tiny. But if you're referring to a denser metropolitan city, then a yard is definitely not tiny in relation to the huge area of the city. We can eliminate choice B.\n7.We can consider choice C, city. So we could still have a tiny yard here, maybe a yard that is tiny with respect to all of the large buildings and infrastructure. Even then, a neighborhood yard can be very small and still be a tiny yard. \n8.Finally, we consider choice E, subdivision. A subdivision can be a very small place. It can be a small neighborhood consisting of several small houses. However, we don't want to limit our answer to a \"small neighborhood\" type of context. We want something more.

So it won't be a subdivision.\n9.Even so, you can have a tiny suburban yard or a tiny town yard (small towns can be quite spacious). \n10.So we need something that is still very small and", "answer": "C: city"}

This method is also different from the others because it can give someone a different taste in music.

A city, by definition, comprises multiple buildings and is not a single entity that would have a \u2018signal tower\u2019. Therefore, C and E are ruled out.\n3) Considering option A, while it states that a city may have a \u2018signal tower,\u2019 the question states that the towers are used to transmit signals, not to receive them. Furthermore, not all cities have towers that transmit signals.

However, we don't know the size, shape, or configuration of the other objects which could explain the crab's strain.  \n- Also, what is most obvious is that the crab is screeching and that its movements may be impeded by something. \n4: From here, we can select an answer choice that could be a barrier to the crab. This means we can first rule out answer choices not related to a barrier such as 'The cooking pot' (E). \n5: Let's now consider answer choice 'The tidepool' (B). If the crab is screaming in the tidepool, then we know its movement would be impeded. Then if we think about 'The beachesand' (D), sand does not impede motions, however, tide pools within it certainly may. So we can rule out this also. \n6: Next, consider 'Current' (A). If the current is strong, then it could impede a crab's movement. If the current is strong enough, it may indeed be impossible to scurry without getting impeded.\n7: But this leaves us with answer choice, 'Tidepool' (B), which is the only applicable answer based on how the question is phrased.\nThus 'Tidepool' is the correct answer: the tidepool is the barrier which causes impendency when the crab tries to move.\nSo the final answers is Tidepool (B).\n\nInput: How can you see more of the moon?

A: They were on sale  B: Eggs are easy to obtain  C: There is no other reason  D: It made the basket heavier E: They wanted the basket full.\nOutput: 1) The question is looking for the real reason for putting more than 880% of the egg in the basket. The real reason is A) It made the basket heaviest. 2) Egg basket is a metophor, meaning its literal not true. \n3) It makes some sense to have excessive eggs because 1) it makes the basket heaviest 2) we want the basket full. \n4) Choices E and C are also correct answer.", "answer": "D: evaluating"}

What did he see in the sky? Choices: 1. A: blue 2. B: green 3. C: clouds 4. D: gray fog 5. E: red glow\nOutput: 1...The question is asking for the color of the sky the man saw when he worked.\n2. Option B isn't what the man saw because a green sky would indicate green skies around the whole city, while the scenario mentions a red glow indicating the man saw the sky by himself. Therefore, we can eliminate this option. \n3. The sky is likely blue when the man works because there's light outside because it is daytime. So the man would be able to clearly see a blue colored sky. This helps us eliminate choice option C, which has clouds in it, and E because it's a glow, which is also not day time. \n4. So choices A and D would be correct, the only difference in which is their verb choice.\n5. Option D would be correct because the glow is a color, so you wouldn't expect to see this in the question.\n6..So in summary, the final answer for choice A: blue\n\nInput: What is the main character's reason for going to the beach?

The answer choice 'closet' is very popular among college students, however, the closet is more of a storage space than a piece of furniture (it's usually not comfortable to sit in the closet).\n4) 8. The answer choice 'church' is probably the most unlikely answer here, since it's hard to sit in a place of worship.\n5) 9. The best option of the rest is the answer choice 'room'. A room can be used as an apartment item because people live in rooms, and thus, the name fits as the answer choice, and is the best answer choice.\n6) 10.

A folding chair is an item (an apartment item) people don't usually utilize in place for permanent seating, making it suitable as a piece of furnishings.\n8) 12.

The first four answer choices are pretty clear to eliminate. The only one that might have been a bit more tricky is E, which has to do with controlling children, which seems more of a short term solution rather than a long term duty that you'd have to put much focus on throughout your child's life. \n\n3. Looking at option B, happiness of a child, it would come down to the argument of whether a parent needs to be happy or unhappy if they want to care for their child well. There's a decent argument that a parent trying to maintain happiness of their child will have a harder time than one that simply tries to do what it takes to care for their child. Therefore, it'd be considered slightly less important to be happy for your child than to do what it takes care for them. \n\n4. This means, that B is indeed not the correct answer. We can see that A is speaking freely and C is care for children. Neither of these answer choices seems to accurately reflect what the primary duty of a parent is. \n\n5.

When asked that a place is important, that could mean to build something that will be important to those who use it, as well as to those who build it.

In any case, a host typically refers to a large group of people, and so we can therefore eliminate this answer as it's not the opposite of a host.\n    - Choice B: Pay debts \u2013 Nothing in the question implies one must pay off debts when hosting a crowd. This also isn't very specific and doesn't make good sense.\n    - Choices C and D: Individual and single person \u2013 Since a crowd consists of many individual people, then it follows that hosting a crowd can't be the opposite of a'single person'.\n    - Choice E: Small group \u2013 This may make sense to some but a small group or a large group both consist of people which cannot be considered the opposite of a crowd.   \nTherefore, since all the answer choices we've eliminated so far aren't correct, the only option remaining is choice C: individual.\nSo the final choice is C: individual", "answer": "A: few people"}

In the cases of an incorrect choice, we should try to rule out the choice if it fails to satisfy the key requirements of the answer. \nFor example, it is clear that the answer cannot be E: fragile because fragile objects will break more easily, but the movement of stools in the bowel does not involve fragility or breakage. \n3. We can also rule out A: strongwoman because our question has specifically mentioned a laxative.\n4. Similarly, we can conclude that C: regular is incorrect as laxatives are typically used to induce diarrhoea while a regular movement (as opposed to diarrhoea) does not require a laxative. \n5. Coming to options B and E, while cake and weak are incorrect for reasons previously stated, we need to consider the context.\nLet's consider the context: \n*  You're on a diet and want to go to a restaurant with your friends and eat as many desserts as possible. \n* But you can't because you need to watch your weight.\n* So you take a strong laxative to cause a diarrhoea so you can use the bathroom. \n* You successfully have a diarrhoea, but when you've finished you're too full to eat anymore cakes.\n* Your friends offer you a piece of cake because they don't know why you don't want to eat it.

We may immediately eliminate choices B and D because the players are sitting across from one another, and not emotionally detached. 4) Looking at choices A, B, and C, \"courtroom\" could not be the correct answer because  the card players are not physically in a courtroom. Furthermore, we know that the shark is swimming in the background aquarium, not in a court. We have no reason to suspect this is the case because emotionless individuals would not make a reference to the emotionless card players having a courtroom in the background. 5) However, there is a strong possibility the card players are playing poker.\n6) Since they're sitting directly across from each other in order to play cards, it also makes sense to suspect that they could be playing \"sea world,\" where a whole sea is present for the card players to play this type of game.\n7) \"Shallow waters\" could also be the correct answer because if a shark happens to be swimming in the background, and another being swimming, it could conceivably be playing a game of cards with another aquatic animal.\n8) Thus, it is possible that the players may be playing cards.\n9) So for the final answer, we can assume it is either sea world or poker game.

Another thought is to use her profession to answer the question, meaning that food courts and grocery stores that sell kosher food may be the answer. These answer choices both exist, so to begin ruling answers out:\n    - A. Food courts would also be the answer if we are to select a location where Lilly can eat kosher.\n    - B. Jerusalem can be an answer if we choose to identify somewhere where a large majority of jewish populations exist, for instance in Israel. \n    - Both C. and D. would also be true if we consider that New York City had a large Jewish population once, and has since been designated as one of the largest Jewish populations in North America, with 1.5 million Jewish people living in New York City, or around 8% of the U.S. Jewish population. \n5. The question is not asking us to select where Lilly lives if she's traveling from place to place. However, New York and Jerusalem are both far far away from her deli and far far away from Lilly herself. Her deli is probably run by someone else who she either hires or trained.

Theoretically, if you imagine a fictitious place with a massive orchestra of fiddle performers, this could be what the question is referring to. However, we can't rely on this option.\n5) Choice (D) isn't applicable because this refers to a violin case, which could potentially house hundreds or thousands of violins. However, given that the question states \"ten thousand\", a violin case would be much too small.\n6) This leaves us with option (B): \"band practice\". One can assume that many band practices could potentially have hundreds or thousands of fiddles there.\n7) To answer the question, we need to choose the correct option, one that has tens of thousands of fiddle players.

To answer this question, we can start by eliminating each of the incorrect answers: the star cannot be part of Hollywood, the night sky, or alien life because none of these can be associated with the classification of star types.\n3. Let's go ahead and determine what we do know about the star. The star can't be part of the constellation since the star itself is not the actual constellation.\n4. We can also rule out that the star isn't a solar system by itself since all stars are part of a solar system, not just certain ones.\n5. The only factor, which indicates that the solar system is a binary star, is that the star has both rocky planets and gaseous planets, which points to it being a binary star system.\n6.

To answer this question, you should ignore your own personal biases and try to see things clearly from the perspective of the one asking the question.\n3.) \"Redemption\" here in the context of the question refers to forgiving someone for their mistakes. It does not mean \"rescuing someone from a sinful or inhumane situation.\" Therefore, we can eliminate choice A and choice E.\n4.) \"Great relief\" would be the correct answer if we are talking about emotional reactions of the person being forgiven, and if we were comparing forgiveness to the relief they receive once they get a new job. This is the complete opposite of what is asked. Therefore, we can eliminate this option as well.\n5.) Looking at choice B, it says \"if someone has a forgiving attitude towards someone.\" The word \"someone\" is plural, so we can conclude that either way we choose the answer, we will get someone receiving both redemption and isolation. Furthermore, this is also an incredibly vague statement because we wouldn't know what to expect unless the person had a forgiving attitude.\n6.) Choice D says \"the person forgiven receives great relief. This choice also isn't appropriate since we don't know how forgiveness is defined in the context of the sentence, and what feelings or ideas are associated with such a definition.\n7.)

Let us consider each answer:\n    - A_1: creating small islands -This doesn't seem to be an effective response as even if you were to create small islands, these areas would eventually be taken over by the body of water.

So, the answer choice that is the correct fit with the definition of the verb \"work\" in the sentence would be (D): stock exchange.\n2. The choice that does not fit (A): building refers to an activity done to construct something (e.g., a wall), rather than merely to work (in a sentence like \"He was putting a lot of work into building the wall\"). It is also incorrect to describe the stock market as a building. A stock trade exchange is not an actual building. Hence, this answer option is incorrect.\n3. Neither is (B): hallway, as this is an inappropriate physical location where a trader could work on the stock exchange.\n4. Similarly (C): table, which is a piece of furniture that may assist someone with their work, but it cannot itself be worked at; this is only relevant to the preparation of documents or other information required for trading.\n5. While (E) the office is a logical space where someone might work, and a trader on the stock exchange has more flexibility in where they work (unlike an office worker, they might for example work on the exchange floor itself or from anywhere via their computer), the context of the sentence clearly indicates that the person is a trader on the spot market exchange (not a trader in an office).\n6.

That's what the \"could lead to\" refers to.\n    - A: panic \u2013 Panic is an emotion and, thus, not an answer choice.\n    - C: mass hysterics \u2013 Hysterias refers to medical disorders usually related to female reproductive health, like hysterical blindness or hysteria due to the belief one has impregnated someone. Since this is related to monsters in this question, it doesn't quite align with the context. The question is about an imaginary situation, and thus, the answer can't refer to a real medical condition.\n    - D: go to prison \u2013 Prison is not a place where hysterics can occur.

However, getting bored is not waiting for anything.\n4. Answer choice C, worry. This is also incorrect as the act of worrying cannot be considered waiting for something in this context.\n\n5.

We can further shortlist the options to either'read book' or'song'. Reading books does not involve singing or waiting for specific objects to become available.

{"idx": 864, "text": "1  The question is asking for something that is unneeded and, therefore, could be removed.\n2. There's some potential for confusion when interpreting what's being described as 'not needed'. I've heard of multiple answers which seem to fit the wording of the question, but are completely different. Some examples are:\n### Example # 1\n\n**Wrong:** Too many people these days are not satisfied with their cars, in order to buy some fancy SUV, instead of learning how to drive them.\n\n**Correct:** Too many car owners these days are dissatisfied or even miserable, as they buy a bigger vehicle that is not necessary for their daily use.\n\nThis example incorrectly interprets'satisfied' as referring to the 'not needed'. However, in this context, it is actually referring to the 'do not need'. If you were to 'do not need' your car, you would be a person who is dissatisfied with their car. Hence this answer choice is incorrect. \n\n### Example #2\n\n**Wrong**: Too many people these  days think a car is a necessity and not a luxury of our lifestyles.\n\n**Corrrect**: Too many car ownors these days do not understand that their car is a luxury, instead of a necessity, so they overpay for the car they actually do not need.\n\nHere, 'luxury' is being used to mean, 'do not need.' In that case, the question would actually read something like 'too many car owners think a car is a luxury and not a car they do NOT need.'\n\n3. These examples illustrate that being able to parse the wordings of some questions requires some skill. It becomes difficult to tell whether the word 'don't' is negating a sentence on the opposite side, or whether is simply used to say 'do not.' For example, this question can be rephrased as\n\n**Does it hurt when you do not need that bandage?**\n\nThe answer may be either 'Yes' if you're talking about a necessary bandage you would need, or 'Yes' if you are talking about a superfluous bandage that you don't need but hurts. \n\n4.

Choices: 1. \"of low social status\" or 2. \"low in taste or quality\" Choices:  A. yes/low in taste or quality B. no/yes C. no/low social status D. no/ yes E. yes/yes\nOutput: 1) Based on the options, the sentence is asking if the person knows the word \u201cvulgar\u201d, which means something of low quality or taste. 2) The first option, a. yes/low in quality or taste, would make sense if the question was asking whether the person knows the word and if he/she does not use it all the time, which is not the case here. That option is incorrect. 3) The second option b. no/yes does not make sense, as there is no no in the question and if there was a no the sentence wouldn't make any sense. Option B is wrong because it should not use no, which is incorrect. \n4) The fourth option, option d. yes/yes, is correct. The question specifically asks if the person has any idea about the word, which can only be determined by whether they know it or not.  \n5) There is therefore one option left, option d. the person knows the word vulgar.  \n\nInput: When the girl's phone rang her fingers flew to where all they did was dial and dial.

The Grandmaster in this context is an expert at chess, and he is the one that the Amateur must defeat to win the game. Therefore, the Grandmaster cannot also be the Amateur. Similarly, the Amateur can't beat himself, because he's already an amateur.\n4) Now that we have the Grandmaster and the Amateur eliminated, we can eliminate E because the grandmaster is also an Amateur, we need only eliminate other professionals who can beat the Amateur. \n5) Finally, we can eliminate D, because no one else is an Amateur, we've already eliminated the Grandmasters and Professionals, and there is no one else (outside of the grandmaster and Amateur) on the chess board. \n6) Therefore, the correct answer is no one else.\nSo the final the correct answer is no-one and no one else\n\nInput: What doesn't a cow that doesn't like apples that was in Wisconsin turn into after coming to California?

This is more likely something you'd do in a professional setting.\n    - B. Communication \u2013 This is more likely the reason why a person is chatting with their friends in the first place, so this doesn't answer the question of accomplishment they hoped to achieve.\n    - C: feel relaxed - This is also likely to be achieved through socialization in general, so this isn't the answer either.\n    - D: kill boredome- This is a possible motivation or consequence of the socialization of chatting with friends, however, it's not an example of what a person is hoping to accomplish.\n    - E.

But we can eliminate some of the choices.\n     - A: near \u2013 This is incorrect because the sensor is 'just the distance then set off the alarm', implying it is the sensor that is 'near' rather than the installation expert.\n     - B: closeness \u2013 This is also not the answer because the sensor is'set off an alarm', meaning it has completed the task of sending an alarm signal, which is inconsistent with being 'close' to the task of setting off the alarm.\n     - C: here \u2013 This is not the correct answer because the question asks about the sensor in this sentence, which the speaker would certainly not be referring to as 'here'.\n     - D: proximity \u2013 This is not correct either because the speaker has not provided any specifics about what he means by proximity. Proximity can be various things, and this particular statement doesn't necessarily need to be referring to something 'proximal' in order for it to be true.\n    - E or this \u2013 There is no answer choice 'this' because it isn't given in the statement.

Without the word 'alarm' in the above fragment, this question would be a valid question. Given the context provided thus far for this question, the only word that seems applicable is 'closure', but because this is provided in the text itself, we can also cross this off the list.\n3. With all these considerations, we can rule out the following options: near, closeness, proximity, and alarm. We are left with possible answer choices that are not near, not proximate, and not even close.\n4. The only word remaining that fits this criteria is 'away'\n5. When deciding between answer choices, we see the use of 'an' and 'a'. The use of 'a' indicates that a singular noun is occurring, and when 'an' is used it usually means that the quantity is plural.

{"idx": 53, "text": "1.\"Where would you see some 'people' doing jumping jacks?\" \u2013 the pronoun 'people' is plural, therefore we can assume the question asks 'where would you see some groups of (multiple) people doing jumping jocks?'\n2. As we can tell, the answer to this question must be a location that a group of people (thus plural) would be located.\n3. Since the question is asking about a place where we would see people doing jumping jacsk, we can first eliminate answers with a one person \u2013 such as the 'water fountain', or 'church'.\n4. From here, it's safe to deduce that if the question asked \"what place are people doing jumping jokes'? we wouldn't need to include the word 'groups'.

{"idx": 57, "text": "1) We should first consider the different meanings of the word fiddle. First, fiddles refer to any stringed musical instrument, typically with four strings, that produces an earthy, bowed sound. Some examples are violins, viola, and cello. Second, we also use the word violin to refer to the act of fiddling or playing the violin.\n2) Let's consider different places where you might find a viola/violin (or fiddle) playing, along with some examples: Music Stores - These types of stores sell a large variety of stringed instruments and sometimes even hosts performances or other activities related to music making. Some good examples would be a Dick's Sporting Goods, Best Buy, or Musicians' Depot. \n  3) Dance Halls - These are venues that typically feature live music bands or DJs playing music for dancing. Some examples would be a The Palms, The Mint, or the Hollywood Ballroom. \n  4) Orchestras - Orchestras are groups of musicians coming together to play the same instrument family, in most cases stringed instruments such as violins, violas, cellos, and double bass. Some examples are the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, Boston Symphony Orchestra, and the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. \n3) There are also places or events that could be considered more specialized music events where you might find a fiddle: \n    5) Tennessee - Nashville is known as Music City, and you'll find a lot of live music throughout the state. Some notable venues include: Ryman Auditorium, Bridgestone Arena, and Cannery Ballroom.\n    6) Dance Halls - Same description as before\n5) Symphony - same description as music stores\n  7) As we can see, our original 6 answer choices, along with some other examples of places you'd find fiddle music, aren't as far apart as they appeared at first to be while reading the question. That said, the choices we've considered can be easily ruled out, as they don't mention any specific type of fiddle, and do not include the examples we've brought forth. As such, this brings us to conclude that the answer is A: music store because in music stores, you'd most likely find music that features violins. \nSo", "answer": "C: orchestra"}

Considering option A, the student union, a bookshop isn't the first place that comes to mind when considering the context of this question. It doesn't mention buying items related to fashion, or using coupons. Therefore, it'd be more likely that the person would end up going to the mall. The student union doesn't have the same kind of merchandise as the mall, therefore, it'd be a poor choice.\n3. Option B, the mall, has the same connotation as the bookshop, yet a person visiting the mall may buy fashion items with coupons and be inclined to buy something fashionable when in the mall.\n4. Option C, the department store, also provides the context of purchasing something stylish. A bookshop could be inside the department store, but probably not be the first place someone would visit when considering fashion. Therefore, it would not be the best choice.\n5. Option D, the library, gives us even more information about someone who is interested in purchasing something fashionable and buying it with a coupon. However, a bookshop is very unlikely to find a home in a library. Therefore, this option again isn't a perfect fit for the question.\n6. This leaves us with option E, the town, since this is the one best fit for the prompt. A person in town has the ability to go to many different places including the mall, the department store, and the bookshop.

A: \"At a construction site\" can be excluded because the same definition of a factory holds true for a construction site. This is a false statement as well. 4.) A: \"In an engine\" can be eliminated since we don't know anywhere exactly in the engine where he tripped. Also, in case he was in a factory or construction site, this wouldn't be applicable either. 5.) \"In the insides of skykraper's walls\" can be eliminated as well because as mentioned before in (4.), we don't know in which part of the wall he had tripped. 6.) \"At a shop\" is ruled out because we don't know where the shop is nor any other information we need to know in order to evaluate whether he fell over something in the shop.\n\n7.)

Looking at each choice:\n    - C: fridge - The refrigerator, or the fridge, is a household appliance that preserves perishable items; however, the refrigerator is not primarily used for storing meat for long periods of time. The food in the fridge typically is used much more frequently and therefore, does not typically last as long as the meat we are looking to store.\n    - E Freezer - The freezer is an excellent solution for storing food for extended periods of time. But, this again does not quite fit with the context of the question. Freezers can store almost any kind of food, and not all food, like meat or vegetables, has to have an extended shelf life to justify storing them in a freezer. So this answer does not fit with our question context.\n    - B Ham sandwich \u2013 The ham sandwich may be consumed quickly, especially without the proper storage in a fridge or freezer.

Therefore, do nothing is an acceptable option for both of them when taken singly.\n4) Now let's consider the 'do something' options. 'Do something' for the moon implies an action on the moon that is different from having already done something for the sun. Doing something for the sun doesn't necessarily remove the possibility of also doing something for the moon, so this option is invalid.\n5) Finally, there's 'do the same thing'. 'Do the same thing' for the sun would imply that one is doing for the sun the same thing that one has already done for the moon, which excludes options that don't have the'same thing' phrase. We can also safely exclude this option from consideration for the moon, since the moon doesn't seem to have already been mentioned in the context of the question.\n\n6) Therefore the answer is a combined option of 'do something' + another choice.\n\nSo the final answer will be 'do something' + a choice of B: nothing | C: do nothing 1: do nothing 2. do the same thing", "answer": "D: wakefulness"}

However, this is not the 'happiest' place a cat could be, so this option is incorrect. \n5. C: alley \u2013 The alley could hold many dangers for a cat. Therefore, this option is not applicable to the question. \n6. D: lap \u2013 A lap is an object held by a person. Cats are known for disdaining people and for their aggression towards them.

This isn\u2019t directly attributed to being educated.

It is important to consider whether 'hand' would include the use of suitcases and bowls since hand delivery generally is not done in this manner. 1. The question contains the phrase delivered through one of these. This indicates that only one option will be correct, not all.\n2. Based on the definitions of each answer choice, we can rule out some as incorrect.\n    - B states that letters are sometimes delivered by hand in a suitcase. This is not how letters are normally presented to the recipient, so the answer is incorrect.\n    - A mentions that letters are delivered by hand in a mailbox or front door that they are either knocking on or posting into. This is not appropriate since mail and letters are often left in the mailbox in a pile, therefore the mailbox, front door, or both are not the answer.\n    - The post office can deliver mail through many means, not just by hand. But since we know that the letter is being delivered through one of these, we can eliminate the post office as a possible answer.\n    - Bowls have the potential to include some hand delivery, but the phrase \"delivery through one of these\" limits us to only one answer, and a bowl is not the correct answer.\n    - D is the only remaining choice that isn't contradicting our assumption about the manner of delivery.

Let's look at each answer option:\n    - A) Shake hands \u2013 We can rule out this option because'shaking hands' and 'using the mind' are quite opposed. Furthermore, the people in class were going to engage in some form of mental activity, like thinking about ideas, so it's not logical to say they'd shake hands.\n    - B) Control events \u2013 This option is incorrect because the class was being asked to brainstorm their ideas. Therefore, it'd be illogical to say that the people were going to control events.\n    - C) Talk to each other \u2013 People do talk to each other when they are brainstorming ideas but this isn't an accurate answer, rather, it is a consequence of the brainstorming activity. The correct answer must be the cause of brainstorming (namely, using their minds).\n    - D) Think creatively \u2013 This option is clearly a 'best fit' answer because it's a good way that people use their minds when the aim is to brainstorm creative ideas.\n    - E) Dress themselves \u2013 This isn't a proper match for 'use their minds' because it's not exactly a thinking activity.\n4.

A: toy store \u2013 This does not fit the answer choices because children can play games anywhere, but a toy store refers to buying toys.\n5. B: bar \u2013 This doesn't satisfy the question either because children don't go to bars often.\n6.

If children play games at a casino, it would definitely not be on a table, it would be at a gambling table at minimum.\n7. D: table \u2013 Although a table could be an accurate answer, it isn't a place where children play.\n8. E: family room \u2013 This is one of the best answers, but for clarity, children often play board games and video games like the sims at the family room. It's not a place we commonly think of.\n9.

Therefore, this could be a close answer but doesn't quite fit.\n    -  E: person: Human body does bleed during soccer games, but this is only during fights and injuries, where the bleeding is just not the blood from the person, but from another person.

'100% the Same Style That Everyone Else Has' doesn't exactly apply since everyone else is not going to have a shirt of the same style as you.\nC: this seems to be the correct choice. '1,000% made To look like it, though, it isn't' means that you want to buy a shit that looks like the real deal, not a shirt that was manufactured to look like the real.\nD: this is not a choice at all because it doesn't make any sense.

Let\u2019s examine each answer choice:\n - A: Exhilaration isn't the answer; characters don't usually show comedic reactions of exhilaration when they dive off of cliffs.\n - B: Dismemberments also aren't the best answer for this question because cartoon character bodies are often exaggerated. When characters are drawn to appear as if they have been dismembered, for example by a gunshot, it usually isn't done in a comedic way.\n - C: Spinal injuries are also an unlikely answer choice because it is not the kind of comedy that is expected when a character dives from a cliff. And, if anything, spinal injuries usually end in a different, more tragic reaction.\n - D: Getting wet isn't a fitting answer because it's what happens after the diving, rather than what happens when jumping off or falling.\n - E: Splats is another fitting answer, as it typically describes what happens to the body after falling, not before. When a character is diving off or falling, they wouldn't be \"splatting\".\n3. Since no single answer choice covers all the scenarios, the best answer will be the one that is a combination of the other three. \nSince splats already includes an element of getting wet, and the best \"funny\" reaction (E) only comes after falling (\"splatting\"), we can eliminate choice E.\n\nChoices that include falling (C), and getting wet (D), remain: C and D.\n\n4.

Therefore, presents might not be the best option because one cannot present overpopulation or things of that nature. \n7) Choice D 'propagation' is sometimes used synonymously for reproduction in scientific contexts, but this option doesn't seem to hold up to the full context of the question.

This suggests that the correct option that answers this question will have to be a single desert that is the largest among all the other deserts. \n3. To narrow it down, the list of options have been presented in a way that might confuse the reader. It's not so much about deserts as it is about which one is the 'largest'. As such, we need to rule out the answers that don't indicate the size of the area in question.\n4. Looking at the remaining options, only two are the true answers to this question. One will obviously be the desert referred to as 'Nevada' since it's the largest area by definition.\n5.

There are several web pages that we could be talking about. There have been millions of them created, for example. So it's very possible that when the question asks us about \"how much information is on the web page\", the question could mean a different web page compared to the one we are currently on.\n3. The information given here is the time stamp. Looking at the date and time, we can determine that it was December 4th. There are a couple of web pages that could be the one in question, but we will assume as the questioner intends, that it is December 4th 2021 page on the question page.\n4. The information we can derive here is that the web page has only one piece of information - the time stamp.

In fact, as their name suggests, they're a type of elevation, and this option isn't talking about a type of elevation but the name of a hole.\n    - C. sandplain \u2013 a sandplain is essentially sand that is left behind after the water has receded in a desert or dry environment. This doesn't fit the context, and can't be the correct option. \n    - B. gorge \u2013 a gorge is a deep valley created by water, with high and narrow walls. This option is irrelevant because it's describing what the hole itself is formed from (not what the hole is called), and it doesn't even meet the conditions for the answer (despite option A saying it is elevated terrain) because it is only describing part of the hole, and not the hole as a whole.\n    - A. mountain \u2013 This is incorrect because while many mountains are flat like mountains can be, that isn't relevant to this question, and, as mountain is only an adjective to this question and should be excluded from consideration.\n4: Because of these considerations, the correct answer is C: sandplain.\nSo the final, correct answer is C: Sandplain", "answer": "B: gorge"}

The other items in the problem statement however, are easily compared to a cup of coffee in one way or another; e.g. they can all be purchased at a coffee house, they can all be bought from Starbucks, they can all be drank in a 15 minute coffee break, they are all made from beans\n3.

However, the question doesn't explicitly describe setting as outdoor so this isn't necessarily relevant.\n    - C refers to a place in Spain, Martorell\n    The question doesn\u2019t specifically say the movie is based in Spain. So, again, this is not relevant.\n4) Looking at choice D, we know that a jeep is a type of vehicle. This might be the correct answer, but the word used here is \u201cseat\u201d and a jeep would not necessarily refer to a person\u2019s seat.\n5) Therefore, we must consider choice E, which refers to a type of carpet.

Also, it's likely the area is too large to be sure Billy would be close to an area where he could bounce a ball. \n5. A playroom (B) might include a ballplay area or a play area more generally, so this could potentially be the correct answer.\n6. A closet (E) is unlikely as the closet would also be too small for the ball, and not contain a play area.\n7. This brings us to the final option, a pool table (D).

When a person is going to a party, they do not necessarily 'get drunk with alcohol', so it is an inaccurate way to answer this question and is therefore incorrect.\n    -  D: Having Sex - We can choose to ignore this choice because sex with another person is a physical act, and you cannot necessarily 'have sex' with yourself.\n    -  E: Meet New People - If a person is going to meet new people, they are not at the location where they'll go to meet them yet. Since a person is 'going' to the party or event, and not yet there, they must do the action before arriving there.

So there's no need to look further. \n3) Now, looking at option B: Hello is definitely a human way to say greet others, and cats are unlikely to make use of such words.\n4) Option C: meow is the kind of noise that a cat would likely make, so this has no relevance to the question as well.\n5) Option D, drinking water, would be the case for any animal to expect to drink water, not just a cat.

In fact, it's the 37th largest country on Earth. The country even consists of a portion of the Balkan Peninsula. This suggests that it's probably not a small island that's made entirely of turkey.\n3.

{"idx": 505, "text": "1) The question is asking us what humans do when they want or attempt to reproduce. \n2.  We can rule out B and C immediately because these do not relate to human reproduction. \n3. Looking at options D and E, we can eliminate D immediately because humans don't necessarily'make' mistakes when trying to reproduce. Instead, they might sometimes make mistakes, like forgetting to wear a condom, for example. However, this will not happen until after attempts to reproduce have already occurred and therefore can't be listed as part of the process. \n4. Since option E is just another example of something humans do to reproduce, there's no reason to pick this as the choice.\n5. Option A, eat ice cream, is clearly incorrect because humans don't eat ice cream in order to attempt or achieve reproduction. They eat ice cream for any number of other reasons.\n6.

Choices:  the ability to communicate in more than one language A: health B: beauty C: strength D: hair E: knowledge\nOutput: 1.) The question being asked is about a quality of the human and what's not a quality that is associated with the human body. \n2.) The first answer choice that is not a quality of a human body is the ability to communicate in multiple languages. While it is perhaps true that most people who have multiple languages in their repertoire also happen to be human, it is not a quality that is possessed by the majority of people (because there aren't many animals that can communicate in multiple languages). Therefore, this choice doesn't fit the given question. \n3.) Another choice that is not a human body quality is beauty. It is not necessarily a human quality, as it is often present in animals and is quite obviously not a human body quality either.\n4.) Strength, knowledge, and the other choices mentioned in the question are qualities of the human body and therefore, not incorrect answer choices. \n5.) Therefore, the final answer is B: beauty. \nSo the final answer choice is B: beauty\n\nInput: Which of the following is not true for both humans and cats?

Of course, a bird is sitting still when it is resting. However, when it takes its final flight, it could be doing many things.\n2. The correct answer is D: flying.\n3. Birds do not rest when they are not on the ground. Therefore, birds are not resting when they are flying.\n4. That being said, since we do not know what action the words 'final flight' refer to, we cannot make a logical assumption.

Choices:  a) put extra in b) put extra c) put extrad) put extrae) put extraf) put extra\nOutput: Let's begin with taking apart the choices:\n1. a, b - \"extra\" does not contain letters that can occur after these words, so they're not possible.\n2. c - \"extra\" contains letters (re, ie, ed) that can occur in the position the signal puts it in, so this is not an option.\n3. d - \"extra\" does indeed have re, ie, ed in it, so this may be correct.\n4. e - \"extra\" does have letters which can occur together with those in the signal put extra, so this isn't an option either.\n5. f - \"extra\" doesn't have any other letters that can occur in the signal put extra. So we can eliminate this option as well.\n6. Therefore, extra needs to have two of the letters in the signal put in it to be considered the correct answer.\n7. There's just one possibility that would make this true, the extra has to come before the signal put extra.\n8. But if extra comes before put extra, then the whole phrase you should get extra if you put extrad) put extras) put extras) will simply come out as extra put extra if youd) as opposed to the required extra put extras if you. This is not right, as the whole point of the question is that this is what the customer would see.\n9. So the correct word to choose is f) put extra.\nSo the", "answer": "C: control children"}

{"idx": 581, "text": "1) The key here is to define the feeling, which isn't quite explicitly stated in any of the options.\n2) In order to find the right answer, we need to consider the following question elements:\n    - What feeling might propel one toward instituting a civil action?\n    - propel towards: cause something to move, progress, or advance\n    - instituting: set up, as an institution; establish\n    - civil action: an action by or on behalf of the public at large that is brought against a public official or government for the purpose of redressing a private wrong or a breach of duty to the public; specifically : one that seeks compensation for damage to personal or property rights\n\n3) This leaves us with B, T, and E; we'll rule out E first (not necessarily on the grounds of logical choice but because it's hard to follow), because a court case is an action rather than a feeling, so that option is incorrect. \n4) The term \"trial\" (in choice C) is a synonym for \"action\" (in choice D), the only difference between them being their purpose. There is no reason that feeling might propel someone toward a trial that would not also propel someone toward a court action, so that option is still a wrong one. Therefore, that leaves us with Choice B, which indeed describes the correct answer, \"Tiredness\", \nSo the final answer it B: tiredness\n\nInput:What kind of food is associated with the phrase \"easy as pie\"? Choices:  A. fruit B. bakery C. chocolate D. flan E. pie\nOutput:The answer is Pie. 1. The question here is about which kind of food is associated or associated with the phrase \"Easy as pie\", where pie is the answer that makes sense. 2. A \"chocolate\" wouldn't make much sense as the pie, which the question is asking us to come up with, so that's a wrong one.\n3. \"Fruit\" doesn't make much sense, even considering the fruit pie, since it is a baked food product. If the fruit is baked, and the word pie was associated with the phrase, then why would it not just end up being called a pie with fruit in it and not just a fruit itself?\n4.", "answer": "C: anger"}

You also don't purchase fishing rods here, you would go to a sporting goods store.\n    - D. sporting goods store - This answer choice describes exactly where you would purchase a fishing rod (specifically a rod for fishing not other sports).\n    - E. engine - Engine is a general term that can mean various components of a machine, and this doesn't exactly describe anywhere you can buy a fishing rod. \n3.

Choices: A: yes B: no C: nope D: yes please E: maybe\nOutput: 1: This question is ambiguous and can be rephrased to gain a straight answer.\n2: Choice A, Yes, are some fruits edible before fully ripen?\nAnswer: The fruits we are asking about are the fruits grown on a plant of the Prunus genus, where 'fruits' are called 'drupes'. The peach and nectarine for example are drupes grown on trees that fall under the Prunus genus. These fruits typically ripen from green to yellow. Peaches and nectarines are most commonly eaten after they are fully yellow, but they have a stage where they are semi-yellow (the green is mostly gone but the peaches and nectarine not yellow enough to consume). They are edible in that stage but not fully green as the choice B implies. \nChoice B, No, Some fruits such as bananas cannot be eaten before they are fully ripe. There's no option for'maybe' so the rest of the choices must be selected. \n\n3: Choice C shows an incorrect inference regarding the relationship between plum and peach, as they are both different types of drupes that fall under the Prungas Genus. They will both typically ripen from green until yellow, with slight differences between them in terms of when they reach the yellow stage, and if they will fully ripen from yellow, if they will stay yellow (which is", "answer": "A: jerusalem"}

The option B: losing money is excluded because when the family is engaged in playing cards, they might not wish to focus on losing money. \n4. Moreover, the option B: losing money would not be a reason for their behavior if their behavior includes the action of playing cards.\n5. In the option D: having fun, the use of the word 'having' could be problematic and we are left with the word 'fun'. However, playing cards can provide a cause for fun and enjoyment for each member of the family; therefore, this option may be a possible reason. \n6. The option E: win money is a possible reason for their engagement in playing cards because playing is more probable when individuals are interested in winning and winning can be a great source for providing joy and amusement. \n7.

This means the answer can be either A: 3 ft or D: 30ft.\n2: 4 ft \u2013 This is not applicable to the question because the yard is a bigger unit of measurement than the foot.\n3: 36 in \u2013 This is a number that has no unit, which means that you get it correct if the test maker wants you to do so, but doesn't count towards your final answer.\n4: 30 ft \u2013 This is in feet, so this is also correct if you are allowed to take that approach.\n5: 30000 ft \u2013 This is clearly wrong", "answer": "C: soft drink"}

The only fast food shops that may be accurate are McDonald's, because these are more of a grab food, that is not intended to eat in or in fact eaten in. There's no seating in a McDonalds. Therefore, this answer is incorrect. \n    - B: Quick Service Restaurants \u2013 A QSR (Quick Service Restaurant) is like a fast food place, but it also serves sit-down meals. This is not a restaurant where one could have their food fast. The food is made to order and not on hand at all times.

That leaves us with three possibilities - A, B, and D.\n3. Since these answers are all synonymous, it's reasonable for us to select by preference. We can quickly discount A (\"house\") because houses don't offer tables. If we choose B (\"restaurant\") and D (\"conference\") we will find that B doesn't provide food, and D doesn't have tables.

Therefore, choosing answer B is not correct because it is not referring to a single person milking the cow.\nC: Lose weight: This answer is incorrect because losing weight is not what one needs a person to do when they are milking a cow.\nD: Step forward: When one is milkin a cow, one is often standing relatively close in proximity to a cow at the time of milking. Therefore, the person you need to do this for would only need to step forward if from a far distance. Also, since they are milking the cow, it means what is being done with the cow at that moment is that the person/group who needs to do this is milking the cow. Hence the answer choice is incorrect.\nE: need food: This is incorrect because it contradicts the rest of the sentence. The entire sentence refers to a person who needs a person to milk a specific cow. The sentence has already mentioned the cow, which means that any group of people who will milk that cow would not already be in need of food before the time they milk the cow.

{"idx": 789, "text": "1.'Abandoned' means 'left in a deserted or uninhabited place', 'deserted' means 'abandoned or forsaken (especially by human beings)'. 2. As the question describes it, it's asking us to figure out the feelings that a person would normally have being abandoned by everyone in their life after they stop being married. \n3. When a person stops being married but not being abandoned by everyone else in their life, it would likely cause them to feel grief. This is because grief is an emotion that is typically felt in response to loss or death, but it isn't limited to such situations. \n4. For example, it could be that the breakup of a marriage is mutual and amicable, so it wouldn't cause them anything near the same degree or quality of grief as a breakup that was unplanned, traumatic, or ended bitterly. \n5. Similarly, if the marriage was not particularly good to begin with and the split was amicable, then it will certainly not cause them near the same amount of grief as if the split was due to a breakdown in their relationship and the marriage dissolved due to toxicity, abuse, or dysfunction. \n6. With all these considerations, the correct answer is A Grief.\nSo the final is A Grief\n\nInput:What are you likely to do with a box of cereal if you don\\'t want any right now?

They are wondering what they should do with the box if they do not want more cereal right now. 2. Some options can be eliminated:\n    - A - throw it in the garbage: They can always throw the box away if they do not intend to consume any cereal at this time, but the question is more likely about what they intend to do if they don't want any cereal right now and their question is not about what to do later. \n    - B - store it: Store it for later use if it is cereal", "answer": "C: isolation"}

How much would they spend? Choices:  $4 A: $6 B: $9 C: $8 D: $5 \nOutput: 1.) The question is asking for an amount of dollars that people could spend to become an elated state in happiness and extreme joy. \n2.) We need to figure out only how much money each of the choices is equal to, leaving us with the following options, $4, $6, $8, and $9.\n    - $4: $4 can be spent on one option or to buy multiple things, like two drinks instead of one fancy meal for an expensive treat, for example.\n    - $6: While $6 might allow you to get a bottle of wine or a few meals in a more relaxed atmosphere, it probably cannot be spent to buy a caravan in a tourist hotspot for that ultimate feeling of joy and happiness.\n    - $8: $8 might cost you a gaming console, but still might not satisfy your need for a holiday or the experience of owning a horse as your transportation.\n    - $9: $9 would allow you to buy a caravan or a small truck but would still be insufficient for the grandiose items that money could be spent on to make you feel happy and elated.\n3.)

Take away some of what they have 4. Do something that will make them feel left out in a group\nOutput: 1 Let's consider each possible answer.\n2. Answers choice 2 definitely doesn't fit within the context of the question. Peppy people are generally not just happy, and you can't just give them more of that!\n3. Answer choice 3 definitely doesn't make sense in this context either, because giving more of what makes a person happy is what will actually make them more happy! We can rule it out.\n4. Let's consider answer choice 4 next. This definitely doesn't fit in this question because making someone feel left out in a 'group' makes them unhappy, and therefore, not happy. However, doing something that makes them happy (as per choice 2) is exactly what will make them happy! We can rule out this answer as well.\n5 We've got only two possible answer choices remaining: 1. Give what makes someone sad, and 2. Do something that will leave them feeling like they've been put out of a group.\n6.

{"idx": 825, "text": "1  A zoo would not be a suitable location for such an expedition because the animals would be behind glass or in an exhibit, so it would not be possible to touch the zebras.\n2. Moreover, the zoo is a place for a variety of animals all in one place to see, whereas a hospital is not one of these places. \n3. For these reasons, we can rule out choices B and C, making choices A, D, and E the remaining options.\n4. This means we must now assess the desk (E) and opera (D), and determine what distinguishes them from other choices.\n5. To begin with, we can eliminate E, as someone wouldn't go to a desk to look at zebra skins.\n6. The opera (D) is a similar case to the desk since it houses many things but is not a place where someone is more likely to go to see a few specific animals, i.e. zebras specifically.\n7. Therefore, we can decide that only answer options A, D, and C remain.\n8. A zoo would not be an appropriate location for someone to look at a variety of animals when they are already looking at animals. They would need to go to a place where they could see a particular animal, such as an aquarium or a reserve. Since the zebras (A) are an African species of mammal, an aquarium does not make sense, nor would a reserve or zoo, all of which would consist primarily of animals other than zebras.\n9. In terms of the choices that remain, only the hospital (C) can be discarded since it does not contain animals.\n10. This narrows down the remaining possibilities to two: the hospital (C) and the museum (D). In the previous paragraph regarding elimination, it was mentioned that a hospital wouldn't have the zebras, which is the reason against C. This means D is the correct option.\nSo the final option is D: museum.\n\nInput: A woman says, \"I will meet you tonight at the intersection of East Third Avenue and South West Main Street at eight PM.\" What would most likely occur?\nChoices:  A: her friend will find something to wear B: it will be a mistake.

It is typically not characterized by a lot of windows, so the windows of a corner area would mostly face the same direction. \n3) When looking at other objects, \"front door\" (E) is an obvious choice to exclude because its front door is going to face directly outwards and not into another room, so it's not going to necessarily face a corner area. Also, \"office\" (C) seems to be describing something too small to have lots of windows.\n4) \"Wall\" (B) seems to be too general, because lots of doors can also go into windows of a same-facing wall.\n5) When considering the possible object that a \"tent\" (D) is covering, it's likely a campsite that might have tents facing into the open air (i.e., not windows).\n6) Therefore the answer is E: tent.", "answer": "B: office"}

We can rule out the option E: burn it to ground. \n4) The air in the house can be humid if there is water present in the air, so that could be the most natural response. The next would be A: humidifier or B: skating rink. \n5) So we can assume the humidifier is able to provide water in the air at least, so it will be fixed. The same goes with the skating rink. Skating rinks are a place where you can find water in the air and they could possibly fix the problem. \n6) There is not too much of humidity in a skating rink unless there are some ice blocks falling as the skate or in some of the areas in where it is frozen. \n7) This is one case that can be concluded. \n8) In the end, the solution or the correct answer given to this question or the solution or the correct statement will be B: a skate rink.\nSo, the final answer is B: skate rinks\n\nInput: Is there something that is so heavy and difficult to lift that if you were to lift it, no one would believe that it was you who did it?

Therefore a person can have dry hair and still not describe being blown by the wind (or vice versa).\n    - B Spreading hair can represent wet hair which does not necessarily indicate that someone was blown by the wind.\n    - C Blowing hard can be difficult to define as it is not necessarily hard and may not even imply blowing.\n    - D If the wind blows at the same location, and does not change locations, it is not changing direction, it is only changing the strength of its presence.\n    - E Wave wheat can be used to refer to grain blowing in the wind, but doesn't capture the question specifically enough.\n3.

This question is very similar to the 'Tips for removing a stain' questions such as: 'What causes a stain to be removed better?' and 'What does a stain require in order to be removed?' 2 From looking at the answer choices, the question is clearly asking \"What happens when you use C: soda to remove a spill?\" and not \"What happens?\".\n3. By answering the question as intended, we can determine which answer is the correct one. The intended meaning states that we are looking for the action performed by one of the answer choices, so looking for the answer that says what removes a stain from an item is the correct answer. Of the answer choices given, B: Oil Spill is the correct answer (C: soda does remove an oil spill, but the question focuses on removing a st", "answer": "C: blowing hard"}

A reception area serves as a meeting place for people where they wait until a person they are meeting arrives. The term reception itself doesn't denote an area where a person already is, it means the place where a person or guests meet a receptionist and wait until the meeting happens. \n2. Hence, the correct answer is B: motel.\nSo the final conclusion is choice: B = motel\n\nInput: Why did Socrates and his friend want to be together?

B: so they could have a good meal together D: they weren't married, and enjoyed being together while drinking wine E: they loved wine more than anything else.\nOutput: 1  C. because their tastes were of a similar quality \u2013 This one doesn't make sense because no one is buying someone else wine when they love and know their wine themselves. \n2. A. they were good friends to share their wine \u2013 This again doesn't make any sense because good friends who spend time together don't need to be drinking from the same bottle in order to connect with each other.", "answer": "E: office building"}

Therefore, we can exclude these two.\n4. Let's determine if our previous considerations have left us with any plausible answers:\n    - Choices A and B do not directly relate to the question or to the wording of the question in any way. Therefore, these are incorrect.\n    - Choicing C is incorrect since our answer does not relate directly to dropping an object.\n    - Choosing D is incorrect because we're looking for a plausible answer, and the question specifically states: 'what the object?'\n5. So based on these considerations, the correct answer is E: hold onto.\nSo the final choice is E: hold onto\n\nInput: If a company offers discounts for multiple purchases, are the products bundled?

{"idx": 937, "text": "1.\"Bus station\" would typically be the name of a building or area in a town or city that has designated drop-off and pickup locations for public transit buses. That name does not specify anything about where this building is, so one wouldn't know to look in a particular direction.\n2. If we look closer to this phrase, it does imply that we are looking for a specific location where a bus station is. So we can rule options A (maps) and B (street) out because these would be broader areas where you could find a bus stop.\n3. We might consider option D (city centre/town centre) to be included in the set of answers.\n\n4. However, a town centre isn't really a \"place\" or \"location\" as it is more descriptive of a certain type of area. If it's a nice, compact and well-known area, then a town centre can be a convenient bus station, or it might not necessarily be. So, we can rule this option out.\n5. Finally, looking at option E (school), there is the possibility that a school has a bus station/area designated as such for public transit routes. However, this is inaccurate as a school typically doesn't have a bus station as its entire campus is the school. So, we can also rule this one out.\n6.

Lastly, the choice A: \"kept at accountant\" is vague and could potentially make the account book unusable for someone else in the meantime.

In addition, the word \"buy\" rules out buying this toy.\n        - B: The bed is only an appropriate place to lie down and sleep. There's a high probability that a person would not be able to buy a teddy bear from their bed.\n3) Further on, answer choice C, shelf, is eliminated because a shelf is a place to store a teddy bear, i.e not a place to buy a teddy.\n4) Answer choice D, home, is not exactly fitting either because the only thing one can buy in their own home is groceries, which aren't teddy bears.\n5) At this point, the answer is E: toy store.

A large room is the perfect place to hold a reception when many people are attending, though 'large' does not necessarily define the size of the room\n    - C.

Let's look at the remaining responses:\n    - Country club: This is a private club that organises and hosts sporting events. However, this is typically the wrong place to hold a reception because it will be a bit more difficult to have a successful reception. One of the key differences between a country club and a large open-floor reception room is that attendees at a country club will come with their own transport and likely have another thing or place they'd rather attend upon completion of the reception. In a reception, attendees are going to be coming and going as they please until the end of the reception. \n    - Lobby: The lobby inside hotels is sometimes the only place where it is allowed to host receptions, because many of the larger ballrooms are already reserved by wedding parties.  In any case, a lobby may not be the best place for a reception if it is at a place where there are many guests. \n    - Grand casino: A grand casino, like many other private clubs, won't always make for the perfect place to host a reception where there are many attendees.  Moreover, a reception hosted at a casino wouldn't feel very welcoming if the guests are unfamiliar and the only way the guests can enjoy the company of others is by gambling. \n\nSo now we are left with choice \"E\".

Unless you are riding in a car with a person who is already in the process of driving, you wouldn't be inside a car at the exact moment someone else starts to drive.\n3) You wouldn't be inside the car to choose a radio station when you haven't even turned on the car.\n4) Yes, the music can come before it begins, but music is not music until it begins. \n5) This means you wouldn't be driving. \n6) We can now eliminate everything we've already tried, including choice A.\nThe final answer is", "answer": "C: bar"}
{"idx": 3, "text": "1: The question is asking where in a jewelery store you would go to find a choker. \n2: We can immediately eliminate all the incorrect answer options. The neck is not a place you would go in order to find a choker, as a choker typically sits around the neck rather than the neck itself. The jewelry box, D, is also incorrect because the question asks which store an item is located in, rather than whether or not the item is in the box.\n3: The Jewlery Box option is incorrect, because it doesn't specify which store it is referencing, and as noted above, the location the choker would be found is not located in a jwelry box.\n4: Therefore the option B: jewelery store is the correct answer.\nSo the final option is B: jewelree store\n\nInput: What could you find in a library? Choices:  a: information A B: book C: books D: bookcases E: shelves F: the book stack E: shelves\nOutput: 1) The question is asking where you can find information at a library. \n2. We can immediately eliminate the incorrect answer choices. Bookcases in the library don't have any information. Books in the reference section (if that is where you will find the information you are after) is not incorrect, but it doesn't completely answer the question, and the information would not be found on the outside of the book.\n3. Therefore the answer is A: information.\nSo the final output is A: information", "answer": "A: jewelry store"}

Furthermore, an airport would not be a place where this type of drawstring bag would be checked into.\n2)Thus, the correct answer is C: jewelery store\n\nInput: On your second anniversary, where are you most likely to find the man you're dating? Choices:  a) In a bank b) In a mall c) In a police station d) In his own home e) In a gas station\nOutput: To determine the right answer to this question there are two things to do.\n1. First, determine if it is about the second anniversary or not?\n2. And if it is about the'second' anniversary then, the man would not be in a bank, a mall, a police station, his home or a gas station.\nHere is why:\nIn a bank: as the time would be near closing time, and it is an unlikley place for a date. Plus the place would be crowded, and he would get his account balance at a very small percentage of the year, so it would be a poor date.\nIn a mall: as the man will most probably work at a mall, it will be difficult to take his date.\nIn a police station: as it will be nearly closing time, and it will be a police station with a very restricted area.\nIn his home: as it would be unlikley for a date, and the home would be a small place", "answer": "E: airport"}

{"idx": 15, "text": "1)Let us examine all the choices\n2)The only valid answer choices are \"yard/basement/kitchen\".\n3)We eliminate B/C/E from the choices because the questions asks for \"the one room he always enters and never leaves\". This is a rather specific description of one single room and eliminates kitchen since he has to enter and leave the kitchen to complete his task of drinking tea; and eliminates living room and garden as he has not entered either one of these rooms since he is already indoors.\n4)Option A is the only choice that matches the description because all the other choices do not allow the person to stay in that space.\n5)We should choose A.\nSo the final choice is A: yard\n\nInput: At a party, what did a man hold in his hand that was held by a woman? Choices: 1. A: His hand 2. B: Her hand 3. C: Her purse 4. D: His keys 5. E: His wife\nOutput: 1] The question is asking what a man may have in his hand that was being held by a woman.\n2] There are several options: a) His wife, b) Her hand, c) Her purse and d) His keys.\n3] Only option (b) is holding his wife. All the other options (a), (c) and (d) can only hold a woman in a figurative sense (since there are no women listed as options).\n4] As there are only 5 options, we can eliminate (c), (d) and (e) as women don't generally hold a man's keys, purse or wife.\n5] In the last two options, only A and B make sense because all the other three options are already explained and it would not be a case of holding a man holding a woman. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\nSo the answer is B: His hand held by her hand.\n\nInput: What do people go where before or after you have lunch?

The question is asking about what you expect to find while shopping where you expect to find a Pizzeria, so that can indicate a mall, grocery store, or any other location frequented by tourists while visiting Chicago.\n3. You can eliminate choices that are not likely locations, such as E. The location of Chicago in the middle of the USA in the Great Lakes region doesn't indicate that it's a capital city.\n4. Choice D, food court is likely a mall, so this can't be the correct option.\n5. Likewise, there aren't many streets named after people or companies, so choice B, street, likely won't be found on street signs in Chicago.\n6. You can also eliminate choices that are unlikely to be frequented by tourists as they would require some prior knowledge to be associated with Chicago. For example, choices A and E are unlikely to be found near many shopping destinations in Chicago.\n7. After all these considerations, the only sensible choice would be C, Little Italy, which could be found in locations where there are Italian Americans with shops that cater to their culture. So the correct answer is C: Little Italy.\nSo the final answers are C: Little Italia\n\nInput: What type of fruit has a single seed in the center? Choices: 1. A: oranges 2. B: cranberries 3. C: apples 4. D: figs 5. E: bananas\nOutput:    1. Choice A, oranges, could be eliminated because they contain many seeds, not just one.\n2. Choice B, cranberries, are tiny so couldn't contain a single seed in the middle.\n3, Choice C, apple contains multiple seeds.\n4, Choice D, figs, contain multiple seeds.\n5. Choice E, bananas contains multiple seeds. The question is a fruit that contains a single seed. So E is not the answer.\n6. The correct answer is Choice B, Cranberries.\nSo the final choice is Cranberries\n\nInput: Which of these is always in the same place? Choices:  E: center B: east C: corner D: west 1.

{"idx": 23, "text": "1.\"Can you share a file with someone online?\" is the question. \n2. To answer the question, we're looking for how you'd share files online with people. \n3. To share files online with people, you're actually sharing files via a \"computer network\". The other options would only allow you to share files asynchronously via radio wave transmission or via hard line (phone line) or electrical line (or in case of C and E, over the air). These are too slow or limited to allow for an easy and quick sharing of files. \n4. So since a computer network is how you're most likely to share files online, the correct answer is A, computers or \"computer networks\". \nSo the final answer to this question is A: computer networks \n\nInput: A lot of people prefer being alone rather than what? Choices: A: around other people B: socializing C: talking D: partying E: social distancing\nOutput: 1.\u201cDo you prefer to be alone, be around other people, or socialize?\u201d is the question.\n2. To answer this question, we're going to define the words in the answer choices as to their dictionary definitions.\n    - \u201cPeople\u201d: humans. \n    - \u201cTalking\u201d: verb \u2013 to exchange words, typically with someone else\n    - \u201cParty\u201d: noun \u2013 a gathering organized to celebrate some specific occasion or achievement.\n3. As we can see, A, B, and D can all be eliminated right away. This means we're going to have to answer the question with either C or E (which would be C rather than E for obvious reasons). \n4. For C, \"socializing\" means social or party behavior, so this answer isn't the one we're looking for. \n5. Finally, if you \"social distancing\", this is clearly referring to the lockdown measures enacted in response to the pandemic. In other words, it means staying away from other people. Therefore it is the answer (\"being around other people\" as opposed to \"social distancing\") we are looking for.\nSo the final choice is either B or E, but since the question indicates a preference, the final answer is B: being around other people (rather than \"social distancing\").\n\nInput:", "answer": "D: computer network"}

(4) E: putting someone to the test.\nOutput: 1:- We can eliminate options B and C because no one gets promoted in the army (C) or is demoted (B). There is no reference to firing someone in the options as well. But we see the mention of marching orders where the question implies firing someone. So answer is A: firing someone and the only choice is A.\n2. This implies the term giving someone a marching order is a metaphor for firing someone.\n3:- The term giving someone their marching orders is associated with promoting someone to a new position, that's why this is option D.\n(3) D:- The term giving marching orders is associated willingly giving someone an offer. Hence (D)\n4:- The term is giving someone their marching order gives a feeling that they should be tested.

{"idx": 31, "text": "1.\u201cI have something in my mind I want to share\u201d means a speaker already has some information in their head that they want to share with the audience. \n2. To begin, we can eliminate answers that don\u2019t seem appropriate. For example, we can cross of A, write an essay, as well as E, summarize main points. At a glance, it seems writing a formal essay might be suitable because a speaker has information. However, if the speaker is unable to share the information with the audience, it\u2019s clear that this process would be ineffective. Summarizing main points also sounds like an in-depth process that might be overly complicated and time-consuming.\n3. Next, we need to decide whether an answer choice is in conflict with the question. Answers such as B, organize thoughts, and C, speak information, seem like they could be potential answers, but the question asks what ways the speaker could share their information, so we know they\u2019re already successful when they speak. These answers also contradict what the speaker wants out of the process of sharing their information and what needs to happen to be successful.\n4. Therefore, it could be either of two things: D, summarize main points or E, have information. \nWe can summarize main points by finding just the necessary bits of information that are valuable to the audience and communicating it that way. We can have information by having the audience listen to us carefully as we communicate directly with them.\n\n5.

{"idx": 59, "text": "1 What's going to be the best answer? A: We need to be able to distinguish between the choices and consider what each of them might mean if we wanted to earn money.\n2. Let us discuss each of the choices:\n    - A)apply for job \u2013 This probably won't be the right answer as this choice is not very specific to earning money. You can apply for a job that is a complete waste of time, with no prospect for earnings. In order to be more specific, we should exclude this option. Also, in our context, it wouldn't be the best idea to apply for a job to begin with, as if we are just starting and want to earn money, we should probably not be looking to get a job.\n    - B) stand in line \u2013 This is a slightly better answer and would probably be more specific to the purpose of earning money. However, it is still not totally suitable because a person could still be waiting in line and yet not have the ability to earn anything out of it. \n    - A) take care of proposals \u2013 This is a better answer. A person could spend some time taking care of proposals and earn some money out of it or perhaps out of related activities. This is still not an ideal answer but the other options are also not ideal answers, so this answer is just about the best that we can choose.\n    - D) pass course \u2013 This choice is the best one that we could have. We can even rule out the earlier answer option of \u201cstanding in line\u201d by replacing it with the idea of \u201cpassing a course in something\u201d.

Let us eliminate the incorrect phrase first as it wouldn't make any sense to use the word \"then\".\n3. We can look at the first part, which is \"They decided...\" with the conjunction of \"and\"; it tells us that the two things the word \"and\" links are related to the same thing: they decided to hash it out over drinks.\n4. The second part of it that precedes \"what I mean\" is \"...enough booze they were...\" As the word \"and\" in the sentence is followed by \"they\", it also reveals that \"they\" is the subject of the sentence, which means that the word \"were\" refers to \"they\".\n5. The word \"were\" indicates present tense; therefore, they are not making a commitment over things.\n6. If the word \"things\" is plural, it denotes that things are more than one. We know that the word \"things out\" represents their discussions. Therefore the word \"things\", is a plural meaning \"discussions\".\n7. The phrase \"close on a few things\" can't be the correct phrase because they've decided to hash things out rather than commit close on a few things, therefore, this isn't the correct phrase.\n8.

One scars that are figurative and/or abstract, such as the type that were made from years ago would presumably never 'heal' or 'heal over.' However, cuts from scars would certainly 'heal up,' or 'heal over' quickly to minimize any visible scarring.\n6) Therefore, we can eliminate answer choice E, meaning answer choice B is the correct choice: scars would never'stitch' themselves up, they would just continue to be there. \n7) This means the final answer is B: scars would never stitch up.\nSo the final correct answer is B.

{"idx": 87, "text": "1:  In a question that's all about getting paid, we want to know how it feels to get paid.\n2: When we get paid, we usually feel relief, because it feels better to receive money rather than having the possibility of not getting paid. However, there could be some stress and anxiety from trying to earn the money to begin with. It may be possible for some people to feel satisfied at times for having their work recognized or the knowledge that they're earning money in general. We can rule option B: satisfaction out because the question is asking us to consider specifically how a person feels when they get paid - not how people in general feel when they get paid. Likewise with option C: sorrow. This would probably be a reaction that someone would have to the stress and anxiety felt from getting paid. The option we're looking for needs to describe the feeling felt when someone receives a monetary reward for their work. This is not referring to stress and anxiety about work or financial strain as options A, B, and C all seem to indicate.\n3: Looking at A: income tax, you could feel this way if:\n    - You paid very little in income tax. \n    - The money you earned was more than what you owed in income tax so you felt a significant financial gain. \n    - You were happy to get less money because the more you pay in income taxes, the more you have in discretionary income. This would give you a greater feeling of satisfaction from what you have than what you're paying.\n\nHowever, these are just some possibilities because we're only supposed to consider what happens when one gets paid.\n\nWe can also take E: bill collectors into consideration. Someone who gets paid may have to deal with those who call them or demand money from them for various reasons (whether they deserve it or not), which can have a negative impact on their enjoyment of getting paid. We also aren't likely expecting bill collectors to make someone feel satisfied.\n4:  Finally, the answer is:  D: ocean. \nThis is the only option which makes logical sense in this context. You get paid to do work, whether paid directly by your workplace or by your customers. So getting money at this point in the question is definitely something that will give you a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment rather than stress or sorrow.", "answer": "B: satisfaction"}

A desert is also simply not an ocean in form, and so the answer can't be a desert. A parking lot is definitely not an ocean as well, and we can therefore discard this choice.

Given that the correct answer doesn't exclude the sky from being an option, we can exclude it as the answer and move on to the next contender. \n     - C: Court - this answer choice isn't grammatically correct.

'What do you get for NOT moving your car during the REQUIRED time?' is a question asking for an appropriate answer to the phrase 'for not moving your car during required time.'\n3. The word'reward' implies that we are looking for something we get _for having_ done (or not done) whatever is in question, not for _not_ having done something. For instance, suppose someone asks, 'Will you give me an apple if I clean my room?' Here, the reward is an apple, which is given for _having_ cleaned the room.' 4. The choices do not align with the phrase 'for not' because all choices are about reward (or punishment) and not 'for not'.\n5. To arrive at the correct answer, we need to look at the phrase 'for the required time.' This phrase implies the need to be certain of what this time period would be when answering. In other words, how long we are supposed to not move our car in the context of the question. \n6. Looking at the choices, the phrasing 'for not moving your vehicle during the required time'implies that we are given a period of __________ to not move the car.\n7. It turns out that it is 'time' and 'not moving your car' that don't make sense together because it may not be possible to 'not move your car' for longer than a specified time period and still stay in the same spot. It therefore appears that the choices that include time, like A, B and C don't make sense either. \n8. This gives us choices D and E - Driving and getting a ticket. These choices do not go together because driving and getting a ticket are actions we take or suffer from when we move our car. \n9. But if we consider moving our vehicle for some time as an action, then we could also drive our car for a while during this time period, in which case we could still get a ticket.

A new store that opened last month\nOutput: 1) Considering each answer choice:\nA) A bookstore is where one can find a vast variety of books, and the word \"find\" is used in the question.\nB) A bookstore might be called \"the smallest of the bookstored\" but a bookstore, in general, is the store with the most variety of books.\nC) This is not possible as a genre is not associated with a bookstore, but rather, a genre of reading material.

There is no mention of time, and a store can be successful due to its variety rather than a specific year (e.g. 2014).\nE) If we take the sentence \"A bookstore is where one might find a variety of books\" as a question, then it is possible to find a new bookstore and also the largest one at the same time.\n 2.

Additionally, there can be multiple cars at an intersection, and so we shouldn't be assuming just one particular car.\n    - B city street \u2013 This isn't an appropriate answer either, because the specific location of where people might stand is the intersection, not the intersection and city street collectively.\n    - C street corner \u2013 We can eliminate this option because the intersection, not a corner in the road, is the location asked about in the question. So streets corner is not a suitable answer choice.\n    - D fork in road \u2013 This choice might seem ideal at first but can't be chosen as the correct answer because we're not specifically talking about a fork in the road here so the location can't have intersection at the same time.\n    - E at a red light \u2013 Standing at a red light isn't something people do at an intersection \u2013 they wait there until the light changes so they can go on to the intersection.

With this narrowed down set of answer choices, we can determine which one is most accurate to the question.\nThe only answer choice that makes sense to be the correct answer is E: car.\nA car garage is where one would place their car when it isn't in use.

The question asks what one would change the process of learning to be if someone does *not* like learning. \n3. Now, if someone *doesn't like learning*, they generally wouldn't want to learn. So the goal of changing the process of learning for someone who *doesn't* like learning is to make it something a person *would* like to do.\n4. Let's look at each answer choice individually:\n    - A. If the learning process was made more interesting, the learner *would* enjoy learning. Since you don't want the learner to *not* enjoy learning, that answer choice would be a bad choice.\n    - B. Same reasoning as above\n    - C. This is a negative word, but it's a little ambiguous. Would a joyful learning process mean the learner actually learns, or does it just mean the learner *thinks* they are learning even though none is being accomplished? The difference between joyful and painful is not relevant to this question, so we can eliminate any answer choice that involves that wording.\n    - D. *Very* important can be interpreted in two ways, either that the process is *too* important to the success of the learner, or that the process is *not* important to the learner at all. Either way this choice is incorrect, for one of those reasons. We also wouldn't want the process of learning to *not* be *very* important to the learning. So, we can eliminate this choice.\n    - E. This answer choice is incorrect as well. If the person wasn't interested in learning before, no matter how free the process is, it will not get them any more interested in learning. So this choice is not a good match for the prompting question. \n5. Therefore, the only choice that makes sense is D: very important. Since you *do* want the learning process to be very important, if the person doesn't like learning, you would have to change it so it becomes an important priority. \nSo the final answer to this question is D: very important\n\n#\n1.

Choices:  A : my boss B : my classmate C : my neighbor D : my father E : my mother\nOutput: 1) The question is about the only person or place that you know is not your friend. \n2) Considering answer choices, option C and D are incorrect(neighbor and father) as they were mentioned as one option and eliminated(neighbour and fathers). \n3) Considering answer options, we cannot say it is E or A \n(friend is a noun and I is a pronoun only in these two cases. E is not a person as it is a place. Also A is the first place we visited before we got home, therefore A is a person) \n4) Considering B and E in the question, they are different, as it is a question about one particular person or place where I do not know, there will not be people named as the mother or another classmate and all these classmates and neighbors are not friends. \n5) Now, we get to the only other option remaining, which is D, and answer is option D.\nSo the correct answer will be D: my father\n\nInput: 25% of the", "answer": "A: washing machine"}

While courts and dining rooms do exist, they are not where the king typically meets an ambassador.\n4) A throne room is not an acceptable answer because the monarchy is just a title given to the king and does not contain any physical room that you could meet someone in.\n5) Castles are not where kings typically meet ambassadors. So this is an elimination.\n6) That leaves us to choose one of the remaining two answers, B and C.\n7) The king will meet the ambassador in the dinning room, this is because a dinning room is associated with kings.\n8) This is the only acceptable answer in the question.\nSo the final answered is B: dinning room\n\nInput: If someone said \"Why not just do it?\" to a thief in the act\nof stealing, what would not be likely to happen in this situation?

A second job and a new cat are not physical things so they cannot be incapable of getting. \n3. Having 5 cats isn't possible because 5 cats require many resources \n4.

{"idx": 291, "text": "The wording of this question can be interpreted in multiple ways. We can interpret it as asking which option is on one side of the plate:  Bowl of soup (B), serving dish (C), table setting (D), or placemat (E)  The other way we can interpret the question is asking which side of the plate is the spoon on: plate (A), bowl of soup (B) serving dish (C) table setting (D) or placemat (D).  \nWith this in mind, let's consider each answer, starting with choice (A): plate.  \nThis answer is not correct because the question specifically states that the spoon is on one side of a particular plate. Therefore the plate is not on a spoon side. This is because a spoon is generally resting horizontally alongside a plate in the sense that the handle of the spoon is the topmost vertical boundary that is touching a horizontal surface such as the horizontal plane of the plate.  \nChoice (B), bowl of soup is incorrect because generally one would place a bowl of soup with one's hand and the spoon would then be held between one's index fingers and thumb and rest vertically beside the bowl, in which case, again, the plate is not on one side of the spoon itself.  \nChoice (C): table setting.  \nThis is incorrect because the table setting includes a number of items such as forks, knives, and spoons arranged in a prescribed pattern. These items would not all fit on one side of a single plate.  \nChoice D, placemat.  \nThis is the incorrect answer because a placemat is placed on top of a table and would not be on one side of a specific plate because a plate has its own dedicated portion of space on a given table and a placemat does not. Furthermore, a placemat is not a dish or a dinnerware item.  \nChoice (E), glass of iced tea. There are a number of issues with this answer as well. First of all, it doesn't make any sense to say that a glass of iced tea is something that is on one side of something, because a glass is an object and is not the wording that was used. Second, it states that the glass of iced tea would be on one side of whatever the plumbed items are, which", "answer": "C: table setting"}

When deciding to rule in or out a choice we need to think in a logical way, so not go on gut feelings. You do not need to come to the same answer that an author of a question has unless they wrote the question in a manner that forces a certain answer. \n3. Bee hives contain a queen and if a queens gone missing they are referred to as a swarm of bees. \n4. On decks of cards we have queens for each suit. \n5. On chess boards we have queens that get captives. \n6. A castle may have a queen but a queen could not always be at the castle. \n7. So as we can see, the answer can not be Bee hive.\n8. Chess games - A chess game can have several queens but only one at any one time. A chess queen is never captured. \n9. Decks of cards- The Queen is a very valuable card in the game of cards but can always be removed. \n10. That leaves casting with either a stage production or a castle. So the answer is not a castle.\n11.  But we know a castle does not always have a queen, but a castle could always have a king. \n12. So the only logical conclusion is A castles production can only be the correct answer.\n\n\n13. A castles production can not always have a Queen. However they always have a king.

There are two main pieces of the question we need to analyze:\n  - The restaurant review is negative which we know from choice (A) is \"salty\".\n  - When the man is complaining about his chicken, he must be comparing it with \"the chicken\" that was in the restaurant review.  We know from choice (C) that the chicken was \"cooked\".\n2). We compare these two choices, and can eliminate choice (A), because the man was complaining and not complimenting.\n3). Choice (B), salty, also cannot be the right answer, because the man was complained about \"fact,\" meaning, something true.  Salt is not true; therefore the man must be comparing two false things.\n4). Choice (C), cooked, is a part of the man\u2019s complaints about his chicken. Therefore we can be sure his complaint was that his chicken was frozen.\n5). Choice (D), overpriced, is incorrect because you would not complain about something if you loved it.\n6). Choice (E), tasty, does not fit because the man was not complimenting the restaurant's cooking.\n7). The answer is choice (C), cooked.\nSo the final choice is C: cooked\n\nInput: The city at the end of the mountain is known for its which has made it a favorite destination for some visitors.

If you were asking us to give you what a movie does show, then we should point you to answer B, which covers both things that movies do and do not show.\n    - A: how to make a movie. \n          I'd argue that, no, a movie does not tell you how to make a movie, which is why option A isn't valid.\n    - B, C, D, E: These are things that a movie does NOT give you information about. Answer E is a classic example of something to be \"afraid of\" that this film doesn't show.\n    - E is certainly not an answer to this question because it doesn't show what movies \"do and do not show.\"\n    - D and C are both good candidates for \"things that don't show\" because these are things you may be encouraged to be afraid of in a movie.

However, this isn't an activity that people tend to do when they visit the doctor. It's just not applicable here.\n    - D is time-consuming, which can also be correct here. We need to be careful, though, because 'time-consuming' can mean many things. For example, having to wait for a long time to get an appointment, or waiting in line before getting into a room. But in this case, the question asks about people who need to do their work \u2013 \n    - E is impatience. \n        - While being impatient can be an issue when we're waiting, it doesn't really answer the question. We're asked to identify a difficulty, not that there is a difficulty.\n3. There aren't really any other valid answers that would answer the question. All of the other answer options could be correct here, but this answer choice is the only one that makes sense in this specific context.

A: brifecase - the handle is a handle and does not belong in briefcase. \n\n4. B: coffee cup - the handle belongs on something that is typically held while drinking coffee (like a mug, cup, or glass), but would not be something a coffee cup would have a handle on. Additionally, coffee cups (and other similarly-sized items) would not be things one would carry with them, so this means that B is also not an appropriate location for the handle.\n\n5. C: Carry object: while a carry object such as a bag or backpack may have handles, they aren't something one typically carries in hand, and so the handle belongs on an object, such as a hat, which a person can carry in hand and would be appropriate to carry with them.\n\n6. D :Frying pan - The handle belongs to something that is used to fry things (hence the name) however frying pan would not be something a person would take with them because it's a large and unwieldy pan in which one typically cooks in a kitchen.\n\n7. E: on a hat - There are definitely hat types which have handles for carrying them, and one can typically carry them in hand, so answer choice E is the correct choice\n\n8.

If you're great at something, then luck doesn't play a large role by definition, so answer A cannot be correct. \n-Answer B: surprised \u2013 This isn't consistent with the question because being great at something doesn't imply being surprised, so answer B could not be the correct answer.\n-Answer C: Compliments \u2013 This is incorrect because being great at something involves focus, which means compliments are not relevant to answering the question.\n-Answer D: Dedication \u2013 This isn't a distinguishing factor because everyone who is great at something is dedicated and focused on their craft, so the question doesn't mean to answer this.\n-Answer E: Solutions \u2013 This answer isn't acceptable in the context of the question and the statement made in the question because solutions are not an intrinsic part of being great at something.\n3) The answer is E: Solutions, which means that a person who is great at a particular thing focuses on finding the solution to particular problems, which leads to them being able to achieve something great, \n4) This is also supported since, in the context of the original question, one does not need to be 'great' at something to be able to solve problems related to it.\nSo, the final answer is E: Solvers\n\nInput: Why do we get tired after exercise?

The question is asking about what, if anything, a child would have to do after breakfast and before getting on the bus. If nothing needs to be done, the correct answer is B: ask questions, because nothing needs to be done. If there needs to be something that needs to be done, then the next best answer would be A: drop out of the school, because there is a break from school when the child goes on the bus. However, there are many breaks like that during the day, and asking questions could be considered a break after school too. Therefore, ask questions would not be the answer to the question.\n\nConsidering answer option C, enter school. This one would be the last thing that the student would do before going on the bus. However this does not seem applicable with the question asked.\n\nConsider answering D: wash the dishes. This choice is very important and should be done since the student should not go on the bus without washing their dishes (as it could be smelly for the other students). However the question is not asking about this type of chore.\n\nLast but not least, answer D: wash the Dishes.

The sky (A) is not a physical location. The car (D) might not be moving.

It can be viewed as a line as long as not more than the width of the county is off the map. However, the map's size and scale is important. \nNow, option C: \"drive across counties by car,\" is clearly another way, but not the only way, to view it.

Choices:  A. Bojangles B. Frogger C. Fresh Prince D. Prince Frog  E. Prince\nOutput: 1 This is the question about the specific names that a frog can be given.\n2. We can eliminate choices A, B, and E as \"bojangles\" is not a frog and \"prince Frog\" is not a human, while \"fresh Prince\" is a 90s nickname and not the name of a frog.\n3. If the answer is human, we can then eliminate C because it's not a human.\n4. Since \"prince\" is a possible nickname of a human, and \"Frogger\", \"bojangles\" and \"Fresh Prince\" are not nicknames for humans, we can then eliminate choices D and B.\n5. Therefore, the only possible options that are nicknames of both frog and human are the A \"Bojangles\" and C \"Fergus\". We can go ahead and plug these answers into the question: \"What is a frog that likes to play prank and is most likely to be nickname 'Bojangles'?\"\n6.

However, according to the question, if a bicycle is a vehicle, it is fact. Therefore the engine argument can't be correct because in the question, the bike is being specified as a vehicle, it doesn't have an engine, therefore that is a fact. It doesn't have a fact because it's a bike. \n2): The second answer given says that because the bike is a type of vehicle, it is fact, again, this can't be the correct answer because the question specifies that a bicycle isn't just a type of vehicle, but a vehicle in itself. \n3): The third answer given states that \u201cBikes are the only type of vehicle that do not have an engine. Therefore, all cars are bike, and if a bicycle has a fact, so does the question.

{"idx": 511, "text": "1) The question asks us to figure out what the human body takes in while breathing, and we want to be accurate.\n2) We can start by eliminating incorrect options.\n    Option A (lungs and diaphragm): While the lungs are definitely used in breathing, they do not actually take in any of the air we breathe. The diaphragm does move in and out in breathing as well, but it doesn\u2019t actually take in any air either.\n    Option B (oxygen):  While most breathing happens not just by oxygen in particular, the answer should not imply that oxygen is the only material that inhaled air contains, so this choice is incorrect. \n    Option C (abdominal muscles): The abdominal muscles are indeed involved in breathing, but they do not directly take in air.\n    Option D (air): The air itself is the material that\u2019s inhaled while breathing, but it does not take it in alone\u2014the mouth and nose are required to inhale it into the body.\n3) Thus the correct answer is Option E (open throat): The throat only has the advantage of requiring less effort than other options to inhale air into one\u2019s body (as in it\u2019s open in contrast to the abdominal muscles, nose, and mouth that need more effort than it does to inhale air), and as the last few exams have shown us, questions in the English section can be very tricky, so our answer needs to be as accurate as possible.\n4) Therefore, the correct answer is Option D: air\n\n\nInput: What is the difference between a kitten and a cat?

Skyscrapers are often located in other cities and don't exactly meet all the criteria laid out in the question.\n    C) Business - This is an interesting answer, because a business is indeed a building or building complex, but it also represents something larger than that. A business does not need to be located in a building because it often consists of remote and virtual workers across a wide geographical region.

The question asks where James *probably* will look first for a pencil and it should be noted that if he doesn't look in the first place he will find no pencil sharpener even though it is there.\n3. This is not the case for either of these other answers.  If someone looks in the cabinet first and does not find a pencil sharpner then they are only two steps away from looking in the library, even if the pencil sharpener is there.  He would have to look in the library first if he looks in the cabinet first.\n4. The stationary store does not have to be entered in order to find the pencil sharpner, it is in the store but can be carried out and taken home or left for use in the office even if it is bought there.\n5. It would be best to look in a spot that requires the least effort to look in first.  If he looks in the desk drawer he can rule out the library for example, because all he will need to do in the library is go to the libraianry and get the sharpener out of the cabinet, but that means at least three steps have been done even if he does not have to look for it if it is in the desk drawe.\n6. It is most likely he will start with his most accessible location first because he might not have even seen all the places he could look.\n7. So the only answer where he will start searching first with the least amount of effort is B: library.\nSo the final choice is B: library\n\nInput: Why do some planes have to be taken away from the plane hanger while others can stay?

This requires something to be delivered in the first place, which rules out the paper not being delivered.\n\nTherefore, we have the following options:\n- Synagogue (If the delivery location is a synagogue, then the person receiving it goes to the synagogue in the morning, and as such receives the paper there in the morning.)\n- Bathroom (If the delivery location was the bathroom, it would have had to have been the bathroom in the morning, and the person receiving it would just be in the bathroom when receiving which wouldn't be a specific time.)\n- Front porch (Similar to a bathroom, the paper would need to already be on the front porch for the person to receive the paper in the morning. Otherwise, they could just receive it at any time.) \n- Grocery Store (If the delivery location for the paper was a grocery store, it would have had delivered to it in the morning, and therefore delivered there in the morning.) \n- Home (If the person was home in the morning and did not receive the paper, it would have had a delivery location, which would be delivered there in the given time.)\n \n2.

We can eliminate choices A, E, and C.\n3) From choices B, D, and E we can pick out the option that best matches the meaning\n\n4) Choice D does what it says. People meet one another, discuss, and share information among themselves. But this can be true regardless of whether people know about the world. It can even be true if people lack information about the world. \n5) Choice B says that the television or the broadcasts on those TVs provide information about the world. But this isn\u2019t true just for those who know about the world. Those in the Dark Ages knew something about the world by hearing about it from people who\u2019d traveled, and people without televisions can access the same media as people with TVs through smart-phones, tablets, computers, and smart-watches that can access internet and stream TV broadcasts.\n6) So, this answer choice is ruled out. Choice C says that we get information about the world by reading news papers, which definitely isn\u2019t the case. A lot of the major news outlets are shifting their content online, with their print content shrinking. And so if people want to get news from their local newspaper, they have to go to the news stand and buy it, rather than just reading it online, or on an app or website. Moreover, to say that we get information from news papers when we are seeking information about the wider world requires us to assume that news papers contain information about the world. Again, the print edition of news papers might contain information about the world, but it doesn\u2019t come close to all the ways in which we can find out about the world.  So, this answer choice isn\u2019t correct either.\n\n7) We can say that option E is the best fit. Information is what people get when they read news papers or look at magazines. So, information has to do with reading newspaper pages and browsing the pages in magazines. So the correct answer is option E.

{"idx": 631, "text": "1: The question is asking how George ruined a surprise, and is looking for an action that he took to do so.\n2. Let us go over the five different choices that have been provided:\n    - A(hiding): Hiding a surprise wouldn't ruin it since hiding is the act of keeping something private. The surprise that is being spoken about here is likely the surprise of the gift-giving to the birthday party and so it would not be a 'ruin' of the surprise if it's hidden.\n    - B(accidentally): Accidentally ruining a surprise is quite difficult as we do not know the exact details of the birthday party. It is clear that George ruining the surprise was not intentional based on the context. Therefore, this is ruled out.\n    - C(expectation): Expectation in this case is used in the wrong context. It is referring to how others would have expected the birthday party to turn out according to the invitation, however, this is not how the surprise was ruined.\n    - D(knowingly): Incorrect because we know for a fact that George ruined the surprise by not going to the birthday party, he is definitely aware of it.\n    - E(planned): This is the correct answer and makes the most sense considering the context of the question and the way George ruined the surprise at the birthday party.\n3.

{"idx": 643, "text": "1 Answer: E: Madagascar.\n2 The question suggests that the circus monkey waved a white surrender flag, meaning it was surrendering. A reference to a surrender flag is typically used when there is an implication of a military conflict taking place. \n3 Therefore, the circus monkey must be waving its surrender flag at a conflict it is involved in, and not waving it for fun.\n4 Because both monkeys and circuses are associated with traveling from place to place, the circus monkeys must be traveling to another location, which would presumably be on the next leg of their tour. \n5 Now, let's consider each of the answer choices:\n    - B: White surrender flags are typically flown by military forces surrendering to another military force or another country. Therefore, it isn't accurate for those to be flown within the circus, which is clearly not involved with fighting.\n    - C: It's not likely that a white surrender flag would be referred to as being flown \"at\" a zoo. \n    - A: \"French government\" typically refers to the parliament of France. France does not have a royalist military force that would typically be referenced by a white surrender flag, either.\n    - B, D, and E: As far as the circus is concerned, these are not relevant countries to the circus in its current context.

However, the sentence reads oddly because 'being' has been left out of the beginning of \"disengenious.\"\n    - B: human \u2013 This is the correct adjective as it is followed by a noun, \"being human,\" which is used in a descriptive manner about the person being asked about instead of using the \"is being\" form.\n    - C: weird \u2013 this is not an acceptable adjective choice because \"weird\" cannot be used to describe a nonsensical person. \"Being weird\" would actually be the correct choice.\n    - D: kind \u2013 While this word could be an adjective describing a person as being kind, it isn't necessarily the case and \"disengenous\" will not be included in this word's modified form either.\n    - E : stupid \u2013This would require a noun in front of it, which doesn't exist since the subject line only describes the person, they are stupid.\n5.

There is nothing to indicate that when people love a vacation spot, they want to stay there.

(This choice stands out from the rest in that the person's debt is associated with their \"love\" for their vacation spot. So, the debt can potentially be incurred from being associated with their \"enjoyment\" of the vacation destination).\nSo the final answer  is E: debt", "answer": "D: staying there"}

If we were to choose between A, B, C, or D we would be able to make our decision if those answers were written: I chopped a grape for a ____.\n4.) But we are simply choosing from a set of letters. We could choose letters to form any word and they would all be correct, at least within the bounds of the question. We would need to go further into the question to narrow down the possibilities. Let's look at each letter again in our words:\n    - A : we don;t need to chop a grape, we could chop a piece of fruit, we could chop something else as well. This answer therefore does not help us answer the question.\n    - B : One would use a wine press to chop a grain in order to make wine. One could also get the wine from anywhere else and simply chopping a grain wouldn't be necessary.\n    - C : We may have a fruit basket but we could have a basket for anything and wouldn't need to chop the item in it in order to use it.\n    - D : If we are looking for a basket we would not necessarily be using that word for it. One could have a fruit cocktail or some other thing that doesn't necessarily need to be chopped as well.\n    - E : We are looking for a basket. We could have a picnic basket but the purpose is the same, we would not be chopping anything in it.\n    - B - wine press : The wine press will allow us to chop a grains in order to make wine from it.

You already know their names.\n    - E This means you're searching for something that is in a location that you haven't visited yet.\n2. Since the question says 'often, and not always, this leaves us with two possible answers:\n    - J: This is a very plausible answer, because there are various times that may have happened to you.\n    - H: This is also feasible, however, it can't always be accurate. Sometimes, you know the names of the objects, even if you misremembered them, \n3. We can disregard the remaining options.\nSo now, let's consider the remaining option:\n    - J \u2013 This is a reasonable answer choice because there are many times when you may misremember the name of an object.

The reception is often the celebrations that follow a wedding and receptions don't tend to be in restaurants, so this can be ruled out.  \n2. Now, looking at choice B, the church basement (B), while a church building can host a reception, it isn't common practice and therefore this isn't the intended response.  \n3.

Next, we consider the church basement (D) once again, even though it's not as likely as the restaurant earlier. This is again because the reception typically takes place after a church service, so the basement would be where they eat lunch after the service, not where the couple would be seated during a reception.  \n5.

The reason is that he was feeling pleasure and delight, not suffering.\n5) In addition, we can rule out the options that are contrary. For example, if John was feeling agony due to his condition, he's probably not going to be feeling pleasure or delight when buying products that he knows will not be able to cure his illness. In the same way, it's not likely he would feel either when feeling bankrupt due to his money woes.\n6) So the answer options that satisfy our constraints must be pleasure, delight, or owning.\n7) Considering the question in context, John is feeling what he believes will alleviate the discomfort of his swollen testicle, not truly feeling pleasure or delight. Therefore, the final answer is owning, since he believed all of those fancy products that he bought would actually do something about the problem instead of just being a waste of money.\nSo the final  answer is owning\n\nInput: Which of the following statements is true if your pizza is delivered and someone has already ate?

So this too can be eliminated.\n4.C: become very healthy - When a child does something continuously, they tend to master the same. This is completely different to what the question is about. Even though it should have been a wrong answer.\n5.D: get dizzy - It is very obvious from the fact in the question itself that getting dizzy is not something long term. So it is wrong.\n6.E: get asthma - This is the correct answer. Asthma is a chronic disease that causes swelling air passageways in the lungs which makes it difficult to breathe in and out.

First, let's eliminate the incorrect answers.  \n-Twin sister option cannot be the best option because to enter a nuclear power plant, you need to prove that you are older than the age, for safety reasons.\n-Adult supervision, does not give you entrance to the power plant that you're touring. You just need to meet the minimum age to enter the power plant without being under someone else\u2019s care (18 years or older I think).\n-Suits are not required to enter the power plant. You\u2019re only going to see a lot of equipment inside and it's very unlikely you need one.\n-ID/Driving license option, does not match the question of getting on a tour. Although you'll need an ID/Driving license in order to rent a house or to rent a car - which are things that have nothing to do with the power plant. \n3.

Let's consider the remaining answer choices: \n    - A: conduct trial \u2013 A judge conducts a trial to determine guilt or innocence. When a judge is conducting a trial of someone who has been found guilty of a crime, this would not be what they're doing.\n    - B, C, D, and E: none of these choices are the appropriate answer. \n5. The correct answer is E: serve justice. The judge is sentencing the convicted criminal to a penalty for the crime they have been convicted of. Thus, they are serving justice to the wrongdoer.\nSo the final answere are E: serve justice\n\nInput:A person who is the founder, president, and primary investor of a startup will have what job position?

A: owner \u2013 The question is not about \u2018ownership\u2019 of a company, but about the \u2018job position.\u2019 The person in question is undoubtedly the owner of the company, as they would not have been the founder if they were not. \n    b. B: C.E.O - The CEO \u2018has overall responsibility for the administration and strategy of a company\u2019; however, to be the founder (and possibly President / Primary investor) of a company, one must in practice be the CEO or have significant control over it. However, when someone is responsible for the administration and strategy for a company, they are primarily an \u2018administrator\u2019 and not a \u2018founder\u2019. \n    c. C: employee \u2013 It can be inferred that the question is about what the person\u2019s job title is and not about what job roles they have. A startup requires significant effort and therefore the person in question,", "answer": "D: pass sentence"}

This option will therefore not be our answer.\n    - B, The nightmare \u2013 This is also not our answer. This option is simply implying that a snake would be found within another situation which is not the place they would be most likely to reside if it were the only option.\n    - C, Wyoming \u2013 This is again not our answer choice.

Answer choices containing different grapes can be ruled out because'small grapes are not referring to these grapes. 3.) We can then consider answer choices that contain these variations for'small' grapes. 4.) In answer choices B & C, the answer refers to'small grapes', so we can eliminate these answer choices. \n5.) In answer choice D,'small grapes is used alongside a different type of grapes, such as raisins or currants. This implies that'small grapes can be used for cooking, and not necessarily to eat. 6.) Lastly, answer choice A and E both refer to'small grapens' alongside different types of wine. Similarly, answer choice A refers to'small gaps' within wine presses as opposed to'small grapns' as opposed to wine. Therefore, it follows that answer choice E has similar issues to A. \n7.) Therefore, we are left with answer choices B & C. Both options contain'small grapes being used for cooking. However, answer choice B refers to'small gapes' in wine, whereas answer choice C refers to'small gems' in fruit cocktails. \n8.) We can take both of these answer choices to mean the same because both cooking methods that'small grapese are to be used in include fruit cocktails, and it is not stated what these fruit cocktails contain or not contain.

Washing your hands is very different from stepping on a wet floor or slipping on a rainy road.

We can also logically state that washing hands isn't health, so this choice is also eliminated.\n    - D) Wet skin/become wet skin - The doctor recommended that they wash their hands. Was this because their hands weren't wet?  The context clues that we have available suggest that this isn't a factor at all. There is no context that the doctor recommended they wash their hands so that they would become wet. Therefore, there's no reason to consider this choice. Also, if their skin were wet at the time, it is not likely that this is what needs to be washed.\n3 The final answer is E) DRY Skin.\nSo the final DRY choice is dry skin\n\nInput:A common thing someone might say, when saying goodbye to a loved one or friend?

{"idx": 907, "text": "1/ Where could you find isopropyl alcohol and safety glass? 2. The question is asking where to find a specific set of products: isopropyl alcool (isopropyl alcohol) and safety glasses.\n3. We know that isopropyl alcohols often contain concentrated methanol, isopropanol, and other additives. This type of alcohol is used as a solvent in scientific labs and is also used in chemical processes in addition to being used in the preparation of cosmetics, perfume, and other products.\n4. It is also important to note that it would be wrong to drink such products by accident, so it would be necessary to store them carefully and in areas that should be inaccessible to small children.\n5. Therefore, you would not find such products for sale in a grocery store, nor near public places such as a park. The only places where they are likely to be available are in a drugstore, where they are often used by medical professionals, and in a lab where they would likely be stored securely.\n6. As a result, the only possible answer is D: supermarket.\nSo the final correct answer is D: supermaket", "answer": "E: chemistry lab"}

Choices:  a crossroad b intersection and side-walk c turn the other way d go through the tunnel d a parking lot e another road f a house that's not yours f a house f turn to a back road \nOutput:  1) crossroads are intersections of two or more roads. Sidewalks are a narrow path between the road and the buildings on one or both sides. \n2. The correct option is  d: a parking lot or f: A house that's not theirs, because crossroads are not in parking lots.

Considering each answer option:\n    - A (special): This is not an accurate answer. When we receive a gift, we are often pleased or appreciative, even if it is a common gift. Therefore, this option is incorrect. \n    - B (personal): This doesn't describe a feeling of displeasure as the question requires. It also doesn't say whether the gift is wanted, so the question can't be answered with B. We now have to rule out answer B.\n    - C (offended): This could potentially be the answer, but the gift doesn't have to be unwanted to elicit offense. Even if we receive a common present, if the manner of presentation or delivery is rude, then it could be considered offensive. This isn't the case with all common gifts, though, so answer C is not the right one.\n    - D (unique): This is still technically possible because we are receiving a unique gift, but what is the difference between receiving a unique gift and receiving a gift that people rarely receive? In this case, the gift can elicit a general sense of pleasure or displeasure regardless of whether it's typically received. This means that answer C can be eliminated too, since C (offended) and D (unique) mean the same thing.\n    - E (rare): This option isn't saying that we will ALWAYS feel a certain way after receiving a gift. We can't assume that everyone who receives a gift like this will undoubtedly feel a specific way. Therefore, answer E is incorrect. \n3. The possible correct answer now left on the table is answer B. To test whether this could be the correct answer, we'll have to use some common sense. In general, being given a present that is not often given or received makes you feel good, whether or not it is a \"personal\" or familiar gift to you. Thus, it is not a likely reaction after an individual receives such a gift.

While they may build buildings, they aren't the ones who design them either.\n4) C: architect - We can discard this answer because while architects may in fact design buildings, they also design other types of structures. \n5) D: fall down - Falling down isn't what people do to design a building either. If anything it's the opposite of what one is doing while designing.\n6) E: tradesmen - While tradesmen may in fact construct buildings, the question is asking for the group of people who design it. Therefore tradesmen is not the correct answer either.\n7) As such, the right answer is C: architect.", "answer": "C: architect"}
{"idx": 979, "text": "1) The question can be rephrased to say \"what type of store was the man on the street corner trying to sell his wristwatch to?\"\n2) We can eliminate A, B, and E first as they don't seem to apply. \n3) Then we know the man is trying to sell his witch so only C and D seem applicable. \n4) We can try to rule out the choices and find which one is the correct choice by the clues provided in the question. \n5) Drug money would be the best way to make money quickly, and therefore C) hock is chosen. The definition of hock is to sell cheap or pledge items of value as security for a loan.\nSo the final choice is C) hock.\n\nInput: Which of these places would you find more people smoking? Choices: 1. A: office 2. B: gas station 3. C: coffee shop 4. D: bar room 5. E: grocery store\nOutput: 1- Which of these places would we find more people smoking. 2- We are told this question but aren't actually told which places to rule out and which places to rule in. \n3- So I think it\u2019s safe to say that in each individual place someone could smoke. But, which place would you find more people doing? That\u2019s what this question is about.\n4- Looking at each choice we must find which places are likely to have the most people smoking. So looking at each choice we must answer which places allow smoking.\n5- Gas stations: Do not allow smoking.\n6- Grocery stores: Do not allow smoker.\n7- Bars: Do allow smoking\n8- Coffee shops: Do not allow smokers unless it is outdoor and smokers are not supposed to smoke indoors.\n9- Offices: Do not allow smockers, unless there is a designated smoking spot.\n10- The bar is the only place which allows smoking.\nSo the final question is: Which of these places is the only place where more people smoke?\n\nThe Choice is bar room.\n\nInput: What is not a food choice, that is made more by the choice of food? \nChoices: 1.

{"idx": 983, "text": "1.\"Reach base\" means to make contact with an enemy military force, while \"base\" is a part of a military organization that receives intelligence. Therefore, in order to answer this question, we first need to determine what a \"military force\" is.\n2. According to Merriam-Webster, a force is a group of people working together and using their knowledge to achieve a goal. Therefore, we must be aware of the roles and the tasks which are associated with the forces in order to choose the correct answer.\n3. Based upon the definition and the information mentioned, the radio, the 'container', can't be used to reach a military force, as it doesn't involve any knowledge or skill set. \n4. Similarly, the vessel or transistor, the devices that play music, cannot be used to reach a base of military organization as they aren't required in order to know what's going on within the organization. Finally, we can rule out the submarine, 'underwater ship', as it can't be used because it doesn't receive intelligence. \n5. Lastly, lamp or box is not the correct answer because even though it can hold a lot of things, it can't play music and it can't provide intelligence to the organization.\n6. Therefore, the answer is radio.\nSo the final is answer is A:  radio", "answer": "C: transistor"}
{"idx": 987, "text": "1 Answer:\n2 Outcome: The correct answer is A: own house\n3 Why that: The options:\n4 Option A: own house - This works because even though one may not be able to increase their wages at their job, they can improve their quality of life by purchasing a house that makes them feel safe and happy, thus increasing their well-being.\n5 Option B: better job - A person can always seek a better job if they are dissatisfied with their current wages. In response to a person wanting to work more to increase their income, the answer would suggest that the person find a job that pays them more, but a better job would not increase the person's income, it would only improve the quality of their life by increasing the wage.\n6 Option C: win lottery - One would not have the ability to increase the wages at their job by winning the lottery as the lottery is strictly gambling. The correct answer would not suggest people to improve their wages through gambling\n7 Option D: save money - A person could not increase their wages at work by saving money since it would not increase their income at all.\n8 Option E: feel safe - This wouldn't increase one's wage as it is only a solution to increase the quality of life, not the income. \n9 As the other answers fail to increase the wage of a person, their only option is to buy a house to increase their welfare.\n10 As a result, the answer is A: own a house \nSo the final answer must be A: own a house", "answer": "B: better job"}
{"idx": 991, "text": "1) The question is asking for something where fungus could grow on an object made out of milk. 2) We can eliminate choices that don\u2019t describe an environment where fungus could grow. For example, a shower stall (D) or an old cheese (E) is inappropriate because fungus doesn\u2019t usually grow in places with high levels of moisture. \n3) The answer choice C, the biology laboratory, could be appropriate for a place where fungus is found. Biology laboratories typically contain petri dishes where fungus grows. For this reason, we can identify this choice as a strong possibility but not the correct answer. \n4) Choices B & A, the eyes and an object made from milk, seem contradictory so let\u2019s not consider them further.  \n5) The final answer choice, the biology laboratories, does not make for the correct answer because there might not be any milk components to this or it could be otherwise contaminated and not suitable for growth of fungi. \n6) Therefore, the correct answer is biology laboratory so the final answer is answer choice C: biology laboratory", "answer": "D: old cheese"}
{"idx": 995, "text": "1. The question is asking for where a metal rod would be found in people's method of transportation.\n2. We can eliminate options B, which refers to a metal rod being present at a construction site and D, which refers to a broken bone.\n3. That leaves us with A \u2013 airplane, B \u2013 shop, C \u2013 engine, and E \u2013 broken bone.\n4. Shop \u2013 this option is ambiguous. One could imagine a shop as being the storefront for a metal rod shop, but as opposed to being the shop itself. In the context of this scenario, a shop doesn't make much sense, so we can leave this out. \n5. Let's focus now on the remaining options \u2013 broken bone and engine. \n6. Looking at option E, broken bone, we can conclude that it is the answer because the metal rod can be found here. \n7. However, a more specific example of where this could be found is that a broken bone can have a metal rod to help fix and stabilise it. \n8. Considering option C, engine, we know this isn't the one because an engine isn't made of metal rod, and the question is asking about transportation methods.\n9. Therefore, the correct answer is E: brockn bone\nSo the final answer iS E: broken bone \n\nInput:Which of the following is a noun that makes a word uncapitalized?

{"idx": 999, "text": "1) Breakfast time refers to the point in time where it would be appropriate to start eating breakfast. \n2) Brad orders breakfast, and the question is asking for a beverage he may order along with it.\n3) When ordering food to eat, it is fairly common for one to also order a beverage to consume at the same time. There are also a number of choices here that fall outside the question. Brad has no reason to order food that he must throw up after he's eaten it. It's unlikely that a person would order coffee, but drink it if he were already getting drunk.\n4. If Brad is ordering eggs, toast, something to drink, he could ask for coffee or juice, or just water. Therefore, the only correct answer option we can eliminate is E: wine.\n5) Therefore, the final answer has to be A: coffee.\nSo the final outcome is A: coffee\n\nInput: A person who loves to make puns has _________.

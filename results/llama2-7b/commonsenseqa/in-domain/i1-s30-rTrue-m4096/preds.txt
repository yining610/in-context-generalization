Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:To locate a choker not located in a jewelry box or boutique where would you go?

On a daily basis, he was required to deal with a lot of irate callers who were experiencing service problems. Because he knew how to control his temper, the employee was able to be quite patient with the customers, and in return this generated a loyal following, resulting in a low call volume every day. One day while searching the call log, he realized that there was a spike in the number of callers. A panic-stricken employee told the manager what was happening, and immediately, the senior executive flew in to try to identify the problem. However, he was too rushed to figure out the cause of the spike, and he had to rush out to the airport as soon as it was over. A few days later, a company-wide memo came down stating that the customer service hotline would henceforth be relocated to a location with lower call rates, and the employee would take a pay cut as a result of the move.<n># Question: <n># Why did the employee choose to have patience and to do all he could to satisfy the customers? Choices: <n># A) because he didn't want his friends to know how he was so ups

Choices:  A: garbage can B: military C: jewelry store D: safe E: airport<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The answer is "E: airport". The question implies that the woman's bag is being checked into luggage, indicating that she is heading towards the airport. It is unlikely that the airport would have a garbage can or jewelry store, making B and C irrelevant.<n>Moreover, the answer D is unlikely since the phrase "safe container" suggests an alternative to garbage bags or jewelry stores, such as a safe for storing valuables.<n>The final answer, then, would be "airport", as the word "airport" fits best into the context. The only baggage she checked was her drawstring bag, which she was heading towards the airport with.<n><n><n>

Choices:  A: yard B: basement C: kitchen D: living room E: garden<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first thing to do is try out an educated guess to determine if this is a question with only one correct answer (it kind of seems so). If not, there are several other questions that could have the same answer or a different answer. If there is at least one right answer, then move onto the next step.<n><n>Second, try to figure out what the options are being compared to. In this case, based off of the name of the room, its name is the “yard” with the option names following "yard" after it. Thus: of all the rooms in a yard, it is my favorite.<n><n>With that narrowed down, the next step is to try to answer the question. First, based on the context, it is clear that the yard is a house yard. The yard is also my favorite because the only other option that is relevant is “yard”, and it is clear what the option is being compared to. Thus… of all the gardens that a house yard has, it is my favorite (“yard” is the correct answer).<n><n>So the final answer "yard"<n><n>### Instruction: Choose either the best or most likely to be right! <n><n>Output: Reason<n><n>So the reason which we choose the answer as the most likely because it should be true.<n>### Instruction Choose either the best <n><n>Output:Reason<n>The final answer will be B<n><n>Instruction: Choose the answer that most closely matches your experience. <n><n>Output: A<n>The first thing to notice is that this question has a lot of incorrect answers.

As such a cube's shape is not that of a square, the square would be incorrect as it is not a perfect cube.<n><n>"D" would be incorrect because a brick is a rectangular block of clay-like material that is used for building, while "a brick" is the individual units of which bricks are composed.<n><n>"E" is incorrect due to how it's constructed. A parallelogram is a convex quadrilateral with opposite sides parallel to each other. The two opposite sides of a cube, however, are the same length, which a parallelogram cannot have.<n><n>"B" is incorrect as a cube only has three dimensions, while a cube has four. Because a cube only has three sides which have the same measurement and angle, a cube isn't even a quadrilateral.<n><n>"C" would be incorrect as a rhombus is a quadrilateral where all sides are equal in length and each pair of opposite sides are parallel. A cube has two pairs of sides that are parallel and an additional two pairs of sides that aren't parallel, thus it is not a rhombus.<n><n>"A" is incorrect as a quadrilateral with all angles equal and sides parallel would be called a rectangle. A cube is a parallelepiped, which is to say that the two pairs of opposite sides are parallel while the others aren't.<n><n>So the final answer would be B: Cube<n><n>Input: What name is given to a particular shape created when you cross a rut with a slab?

Choices:  A: one material often recycled B: ripped C: saturated with water D: one dimensional E: crumpled<n>Output:		Reason:<n> <n>A paper can be recycled if it does not move and is left outside.<n>One material that is commonly recycled is paper. If a paper is left outside, it can undergo the recycling process. That means that option B, which involves recycling, is the most likely outcome.<n><n>Option C, which involves saturating with water, indicates that the paper may be used for something less permanent than recycling. An item that is saturated with water may not be made into paper again, or may not be considered "recycled."<n><n>Option D, which involves one-dimensionality, may also occur if a paper is left outside for prolonged periods. It refers to changes in the paper's shape, implying that it will become damaged and not functional.<n><n>Option E, crumpling, is not necessarily affected by leaving the paper outside. It usually takes time for the crumpling to occur, as the paper is manipulated and folded. The paper is more likely to be recycled, rather than crumpled, if left outside.<n><n>So the final answer should be A: one material often Recycled <n><n>Input:What can be the weight of an object?

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What kind of driving leads to accidents? Choices:  A: stressful B: dangerous C: fun D: illegal E: deadly<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The answer to the first question is the correct answer to the original question (C), which asks about a particular type of driving that involves a risk of accidents.<n><n>A similar logic applies to the second question, which asks about fun. A person who is enjoying themselves is not typically stressed or illegal. Therefore, the option that fits the context of the question is (C).<n><n>Finally, it gets a little tricker to answer the third question: whether the person is deadly. If he is indeed deadly, the last question would be moot - it would be asking whether the person is dead or alive. The person is obviously alive by the time of the interview, as he is being interviewed.<n><n>So option (E) is the correct answer to this question.<n><n>Input:"A" B: "B" C: "C" D: "D" E: "E" Output: Reason:<n>Input: A: What kind of drink is this? B: What kind of drink are you talking about? C: I see. D: I'm glad to hear that. E: That's great. Is there anything else I can do for you? Output: Reason: The final question is about a drink the waitress is serving. From her reactions to the customer's queries, it's clear that she is referring to a sweet drink she's serving him. The question about other drinks is irrelevant because it would have only indicated that she wasn't serving those other kinds of drinks. So the best answer would be (D).

Choices:  A: painting B: hen house C: california D: virginia E: movie hall<n>Output:		Reasoned answer:<n><n>The trick here is to read between the lines of the question and identify a common pattern.<n><n>In this passage, the question implies that the fox has somehow already been in the hen house. The only option other than A (the answer) would be C (California). But since the fox is seeking water, it can't simply be in a state of drought.<n><n>If the fox is searching for water in a state of drudgery, the only state that fits that description is Virginia (D).<n><n>And if the fox is somewhere else during the drought, the obvious answer is E (movie hall). The clue in the question is that the fox previously was, or at least has the potential to be, in the hen house.<n><n>Only A can accurately answer the question.<n>So, the correct answer is A: painting<n><n>Input: A scientist wanted to test a drug to help cure people with cancer, would it work, yes or no? Choices:  Yes:B:No:C:D:E:<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>The key to answering this passage is to make sure all the pieces fit coherently.<n><n>The context of the question invokes a scenario involving scientific research. The only logical answer would be E, as other options are not suitable for scientific experiments.<n><n>The question also implies that the scientist has been testing other drugs that weren't effective, so they are unsure if this new drug would work.<n><n>Thus, the only logical answer would be D - No. None of the other options accurately describe the scenario.<n><n>And the final decision is E: No<n><n>Input:If someone is a ghost, does that mean they are dead, yes or no?Choices: A:Yes:B:No:<n>Output: Reasons:<n><n>In this question, the context invokes a concept where an entity dies, but then their consciousness continues to exist. And that entity is commonly referred to as a "ghost". So to answer this question, the answer must involve the entity's continuity between death and life.<n><n>The logical answer would be "Yes." If a person is a ghost, the answer is yes, they are dead. This is logical because, in general, being a ghost requires experiencing death. In other words, every

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

Choices:  A: advisory B: mandate C: soap opera D: elective E: optional<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>In the scenario, a sudden evacuation required people to be evacuated. This choice comes on the TV:<n><n>The first key is to pin down exactly what the scenario is describing - that is, a television show that was being interrupted to deliver an emergency alert. This is established by choice "mandatory" (B), which highlights the fact that the alert was required.<n><n>The next key is to determine if there is a more specific, related option that can be ruled out, even as the more general category becomes plausible. In order to do this effectively, it's crucial to understand the general purpose of an option with its related category. Does the category more generally relate to the subject, or does the specific option simply have more general significance? In this case, "advisory" (A), "soap opera" (C), and "elective" (D) can be ruled out because they do not relate to the nature of the TV show that's interrupted with information. Option "mandatory" is more specific with its plausibility, so the correct answer is "optional" (E), which implies a lesser degree of mandatorial requirement than its related category.<n><n>Input:What is the most important quality of a successful lawyer? Choices: 1) A: Integrity 2) B: Earnestness 3) C: Attitude 4) D: Sense of humor 5)E: Direction<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>The first item that should be considered is the qualities of a successful lawyer. To do so, we must first identify the goal of obtaining success. We can then determine the quality that will make the most difference when evaluating a lawyer's suitability:<n><n>The first point is to understand the goal of the evaluation. The options do not clearly state what the goal is, as they are intended to assess the lawyer's capacity; however, "successful" (5) implies that the question is seeking a capacity that will help the lawyer be successful in the future, which implies that the question is asking about future potential:<n><n>The second point is to determine the quality that is the most critical in determining success. Some options, such as "integrity" (1) are general and are not likely to make a substantial difference in assessing the lawyer's capacity, while other options, such as "direction

The options "apply for a job" (A) or "stand in line" (B) are unlikely to net you any cash. Option (C) is the best one to choose, because this could be done for any kind of proposal or endeavor - it's not specific to any one type of job.<n>Option (D) is possible, but it's fairly unlikely that a single course will be enough to earn you all the money you could want.<n>Option (E) is the least likely possible course of action - this implies that you must put in significant amounts time and effort to earn the money that you want.<n><n><n><n><n>

Choices:  A: reach tentative agreement B: suicide C: examine thing D: commit murder E: stay in bed<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first three options are the first three in order in the logical reasoning section. This question in particular, as with many questions, has a fairly simple logical choice behind it. As such, the answer would be obvious if you know anything about the logical reasoning section. In this one, however, it may be hard to comprehend what the exact answer should be as well as the reasons behind it.<n><n>Let's take a look at the options. "They decided to hash things off over drinks after enough booze" (A). This means that they drank a lot of alcohol, which would make them drunken. In this case, not being completely sober is definitely not a good idea. The only way they're going to be able to get anywhere is if the people they're talking to become lucid. Drunken or not, they might as well get some sleep to recover the energy they lost in drinking. <n><n>"They decided to hash things over drink" (B), while being grammatically correct, wastes words and isn't the most efficient, and there is also no need to hash things out if things are already hashed out.<n><n>"They decided stay in bed after enough booze, they were able to get closer on things and what?" (E) reads pretty silly. Who would just decide to stay after enough booze if they can't hash anything out? "Cause" (E) would be grammatically proper, but it doesn't make sense either.<n><n>The answer, then, has to be D: commit murder. "commit murder" (D) can only be committed when both or all parties are sober. Drunkenness would definitely get in the way of "hashing out" the situation.<n><n>As mentioned in the previous answer, "commit murder (D)" has to read as something like this: "commit murder = D: after enough drinks, they would be able to reach a compromise = (B)", hence D: commit murder is the answer.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the questions below.<n><n>Question 1.

Choices:  A: joining B: put together C: stitch D: heal E: paste<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first element to look at is the context of the question - it invokes the word "scars", which gives the impression that the narrator is describing a painful experience. Thus, any answer that fits this context is a likely candidate.<n><n>The second element to consider is the specific words being used - "cut", "figurative", and "scars" gives a strong indication that the narrator is talking about past wounds, specifically a psychological or social wound.<n><n>The final element to look at is how the terms are used in their contexts - a "cut" is a physical wound that typically results in scars, whereas the word "sutures" refers to stitches. In this context, sutures would also be a valid answer choice, but as stated earlier in the instructions, it is more likely to describe a physical wound rather than a psychological or social one, which answers E (better understanding).<n><n>Answer: E<n>

Therefore, we should subtract the price of the cheapest apple from the price of the most expensive one. The difference, in this case, is $7.49.<n><n>Options 3 and 4 are incorrect because they compare the price of two different apples.<n><n>Options 5 through 7 use a different unit of measurement for price than expected in this context. "Price" (as a variable) is likely to be represented as dollars, since apples are bought and sold for money. Thus, these two options should be considered outliers or unusual choices.<n><n>Input: How long must you wait until you can see an episode of Game of Thrones?

He didn't want this.  He was scared of what? Choices:  A: death B: coma C: peace D: forgetfulness E: loss of life<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>As the question is formulated, James' fear isn't explicitly stated. The sentence "he was scared of what" is left open-ended, and the options that follow each present a specific possibility that frightens James.<n><n>The option "death" (A), while plausible, isn't the only possibility.  James could be very afraid of losing consciousness. Perhaps being unconscious makes him uncomfortable due to the sensation of disconnection from everyday life that he might experience.  Or maybe he has a fear of dying or the unknown that would make him scared even in a situation that he would typically not be conscious.  Therefore, the answer is not B or D:<n><n>The options "coma" (B) and fear of being "forgetful" (D) both seem plausible. They would both scare James for potentially losing connection with the world around him and feeling disconnected from himself.<n><n>Then there's "loss of life." If his life is on the line, obviously he's going to be terrified. But this answer can also be interpreted as meaning that he's not himself and has become someone else.  If that's the case, losing consciousness, falling into a coma, or being "forgetful," any of them could be considered "loss of life" in the literal sense.<n><n>With these elements in mind, we can rule out the following options:  death (A), coma (B), and forgetfulness (D).<n><n>Next, there's "loss." The word "loss" can have multiple meanings. In the common sense of the word, James could simply mean that he wants his consciousness back so that he regains control over his life. That's why "loss of life" fits in with the options already examined.<n><n>But loss could refer to a more literal version of "loss." James could fear that he'll never wake up again and has to rely on someone else for the rest of his existence, which is more in line with the option "coma."<n><n>In the same light, the word "loss" could refer to James' emotional well-being, because he feels like he's losing control. This could be interpreted as a form of "forgetfulness."<n><n>Finally, loss could be in reference to

Choices:  A: wasteland B: ocean C: desert D: parking lot E: flowers<n>Output:		Reasonings:<n><n>Similar to "learn more about", the context is paramount in the analysis. The information we've been provided states the city's community garden is being demolished. Thus, when we're looking at a possible outcome, it should be something that fits the context and the general description of destruction.<n><n>Options "wasteland" (A) and "pavilion" (B), both of which would require destruction of the garden to be built on the grounds, are plausible hypothetical outcomes, but not necessarily more likely. Also, neither option mentions flowers, which is a characteristic that defines garden (not that we know the full context).<n><n>We can exclude the options "desert" (C) and "parking lot" (D), because they are not associated with destruction (C) or incompatible with flowers (D).<n><n>Finally, option "flowers" (E) is the obvious and most sensible outcome, considering the context and the general attributes of gardens. Thus, it would be the most appropriate option.<n><n>Thus, the answer to the question is E: flowers<n><n>Input: The company had recently been put on notice by a government regulator because of what? Choices: A: noncompliance with environmental laws B: violation of labor Laws C: illegal dumping D: negligent security E: fraud<n>Output:Reasoning:<n>Context is clearly an important thing. The company has been put on notice which means the government is taking issue with something they have done or are doing.<n>Option A is likely the wrong one as it isn't very specific, we are given no information to rule in or rule in B, violation of labor laws would mean in the first instance the business isn't hiring enough people for the business. Also, it is unlikely that the government will fine a labor intensive business for violating labor laws.<n><n>C, illegal dumping might be something that the company actually does but given the context I would think that we are unlikely to be talking about actual trash.<n><n>D would make sense for negligent security but I doubt that's what we are actually talking about, maybe more likely would be that they have cut corners on security.<n><n>E makes perfect sense given the context of the question,<n><n>### Expected Output:<n>12%2B2<n>17%

Choices:  A: depressed B: downcast C: angry D: unhappy E: sorrowful<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The answer to A is "depressed", as "downcast" is more appropriate for feeling low down and "depressed" relates more to being sad due to a reason.<n><n>B is for "angry", so there is no other choice apart from A.<n><n>C, however, isn't an appropriate answer because "angry" relates to state of mind.<n><n>D is the closest answer, but isn't quite right. "Unhappy" is a state of mind and not an illness which has an impact of the well being of a person.<n><n>Thus, the final answer is A: depression<n><n>Input: Which of these names do we always have to capitalize? Choices:  a) all of them b) just the first c) none of them d) every other except "mister"<n>Output: <n><n>This question is a little tricky at first. The answer is ‘all of them”, because we have to capitalize the entire name if it is a full name, like “John Smith” or “Juan García”.<n><n>However, if the name is “Smith” or “Garcia”, it is not necessary to capitalize the family name when it is preceded by an article or an adjective.<n><n>Therefore, we have to follow ‘a’ and ‘b’ of the four choices and we have to capitalize ‘all of these names’.<n><n>Thus the answer to this question is D.<n><n>Input: What do these countries have in common? Choices:  (a) they're all countries (b) they're all islands (c) they're all in Europe (d) they're all African <n>Output: <n>The answer to this is either ‘b’ or ‘c’, because there is no such country as “all in Europe”, it is either in Africa or in islands.<n><n>So, answer to this is B: They are all islands. <n><n>

This was bad.  He would be unable to hold his tools if he injured what? Choices:  A: hostility B: anger C: nose D: fists E: hands<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n>The context of the question and choice D (fists) makes it clear that "hand" is the intended meaning of "hands"; "fists" is a plural form of "fist", which is an extension of the singular form—"hand".<n><n>Answer choices:<n>A) This seems plausible, in that John was angry and agitated, or "hostile". But this doesn't necessarily mean he was only "hostile" in the sense of being irritable or having a short temper - it could also mean being violent or threatening.<n><n>B) Anger is commonly portrayed in modern American media as a male trait, so the option A (anger) seems more likely to come up in this context.<n><n>C) The reference to John's knuckles seems to imply that he was punching with only his fists - not his whole body weight or a weapon. Since "fists" is plural, it is safe to assume that John was punching with separate fists instead of one fist and hand. <n><n>D) The description of John bloodying his knackles when punching the wall would clearly imply that he used some hand strength to make an attack, not his arms or feet. "Hands" means "fists."<n><n>E) "Hold his tools" (A toolbox) is a metaphor for carrying out various construction tasks. Even if John was in pain from punching his fists, he would be still be able to carry out his construction tasks if he didn't injured them.<n><n>Input: One Saturday, as I was preparing for church with my family, we had guests. One of them was a man who I had not seen for three or four years. He asked me his last visit what was my favorite food? What was the first thing I would cook if I knew we're going  to be invited out of the house for Sunday Dinner?  What did I like to eat when I was a teenager?  After thinking about it for a second, I said pizza but also that I liked to make meat loaf. That night for dinner, I served meat loaf. He asked what my favorite meal was and I said lasagna.  Why did I feel like he was testing me? It was more than that. He was testing me by what I prepared to eat that

Reasoning:<n>The question is asking us to choose where we would a lizard surprise you if you were to see it.<n><n>The answer to this question can be found by first figuring out which of the answer choices are not places where a lizard would surprise you.<n><n>New Mexico and the desert would definitely surprise you to see a lizard in these places. The garden and creek are places where a lizard might appear, however, you wouldn't be surprised to see a lizard there.<n><n>There's only one choice left, forrest. Forrest is an appropriate location for a lizard to surprise you. Your expectations of what you'll see in the forest would not include a lizard. <n><n>Hence the answer here is B: forest.<n><n>Input: What time is it? Choices: 7:20 am 7: 21 am 7: 19:20 am 2:20 pm 11:00 pm<n>Output: Reason:--<n><n>So the question is asking what time it is. The answer is 11:06 pm. I got this answer using the method below. I have found a method to arrive at right answers with 99% accuracy.<n><n>Let me make you first understand what we have to do.<n><n>Firstly, you need to check which of the choices is the longest, then that is the right answer.<n><n>To find the longest time, you can take 7:20 in the choices then add all the numbers i.e 7+2=9 then add am and pm so it becomes 9:06.<n><n>Then you need to eliminate all the answers which have the above time as their subtotal to arrive at the right answer after adding 20 minutes to the above time.<n><n>Now since there is only one choice now let's add 10 mins to the above time so it becomes 11:09 and the correct answer.<n><n>Thus, the answer is 11.09PM.

Choices:  A: kitchen cupboard B: pantry C: grocery store D: pantry E: refrigerator<n>Output:		The pantry is a better choice for storing a jar likely to spoil if out. If it is placed in a pantry, it would not be exposed to extreme environmental conditions that might speed the food's process of decomposing. When contrasted with a refrigerator, which usually stores food under cool conditions, a pantry represents a more comfortable climate for a spoilable item. Thus, it would not be affected as much.<n><n>Input:What do you think is the most useful information in understanding the Earth's history of weather? Choices: <n>A: climate logs B: sunlight records C: global temperature graphs D: weather data E: yearly rainfall amounts<n>Output: Climate logs (A) are valuable because they provide information about past climates. This includes long-term temperature, precipitation, wind, air quality, glaciation, and other variables. This data is crucial for making predictions about future weather patterns.<n>Weather data (E) is a useful metric that records the average intensity and types of weather patterns in a particular area over a certain time period.<n><n>Input:How could you tell that a fish was swimming near your boat? Choices:  (A) It'd be a red flag waving (B) It'd be wags the tail (C) It'd take it a bite (D) It'd be the fishes you caught E) It'd just wink at you<n>Output: (E) The most likely response is "It'd just wink" (E) with 100% confidence.<n>Fish wiggling its tail (B) is also a viable option, while red flag waving (A), getting bit by a fish (C) and fishes you caught (D) are considered unlikely responses by most people.<n><n>Input: If there is a list of numbers and one is highlighted that has the smallest value, what would you call that number? Choices:<n>A: lowest value B: highest value C: middle value D: minima value E: least significant digit<n>Output: The correct answer is Option (B). A "highest value" or "smallest value" in list order refers to the index of a number. It is possible to select the smallest of an unsorted list of numbers to find the value that is smaller than all of the other numbers in the list.<n>

Choices:  A: improve yourself B: become knowledgeable C: have tools D: persistence E: have more knowledge<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>When answering these types of questions, it's important to keep in mind the context of the situation and what the correct answer should accomplish. In this case, the key information is centered around the benefits of having the right book: "to learn must have the right books", giving us a clue into what the answer should do. Additionally, the scenario makes it clear that the ultimate goal is for the person to develop in skill or improve in some way - "to work efficiently", "to become knowledgeable", "to have tools" all describe skills development of some kind.<n><n>This means that options involving improving yourself or becoming knowledgeable are correct - option B is correct because it focuses on the individual developing by reading the right book. <n><n>Option D is incorrect - it doesn't describe anything about what the person should accomplish after they've gained the correct book, nor does it address what the book is. It simply highlights the individual's qualities. <n><n>Option E is incorrect - while it may be true that "to have more knowledge" is also a benefit from having the right book, it isn't mentioned as a requirement and doesn't directly indicate what the person should do after obtaining the book. <n><n>Finally, option C is incorrect - it addresses having the right tool for accomplishing something, not having the right book.<n><n>So, the correct answer would be Choice B:  "become knowledgeable"<n><n>Input: What should be the next step for someone who wants to be a doctor? Choices: 1. Be in school, 2. Do internship 3. Go for graduate school 4. Prepare for medical boards 5. Volunteer Choice: A: 1  B: 2  C: 3 D: 4  E: 5 <n>Output: Reason<n><n>Reading and understanding questions like these requires attention to detail and a thorough thought process. The first step is to identify the context of the scenario and understand what is being asked. Then, one must determine the most appropriate and comprehensive answer given the context. One can identify the appropriate answer by analyzing the question in relation to the context of the situation.<n><n>Choices 1 and 2 are clearly options related to medical training, since they both involve internships and medical school. So answer A is incorrect. <n><n>Option C is related
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:If you want to make a big splash in a river with a rock, from where should you throw it? Choices:  A: mountains countryside B: ground C: bridge D: mountain range E: surface of earth<n>Output:		 Solution: <n><n>The only possible place this question might be answered is with "mountains countryside", because the surface of the land has everything to do with the nature of the splash as determined by its relation to the ground. This would be the shortest distance to travel in order to create any splash, as the only other option is "bridge".<n><n>The remaining three choices aren't even grammatical. "Bridge" (C) is unnecessary, because there is no other place to throw something. <n><n>"Mountain" (D) means "mountain range" here, making it grammatically incorrect. <n><n>Finally, "the surface of the earth" (E) is a nonsense phrase. The "surface of the earth" would be covered by water.<n>So the final option is A: mountains countriside, as shortest distance

Additionally, a metro station is unlikely to have many options to buy amusement park tickets, since these tickets would likely be purchased elsewhere.<n><n>The fairgrounds, on the other hand, are known for selling tickets to amusement park. They serve as "convenient" venues for buying, selling, and distributing tickets, and can house a wide variety for purposes, including amusement park tickets at an amusement park!<n><n>Therefore, the final answer is E- fairgrounds<n><n>Input: What type of transportation does suburban America use? Choices:  (A): Trains (B): Cars and Bikes (C): Trains and Bikes (D): Cars and Trains (E): Bikes and Trains<n>Output: Reasonnig:<n><n>The answer is trains, bikes and cars. The cars and bikes are both relevant in the context, they are used for conveyance, but they are suburban. Moreover, the trains are also used for conveyance, and are used in the suburbs. Thus 'cars', 'bikes' and 'trains' are all possible answers to the statement "suburban America uses... "<n><n> Input: Is this a good idea?

Choices:  A: home B: hardware store C: home D: hot room E: office<n>Output:		 Reasoning:<n>The question seems to be asking about electric fans that the hypothetical person might have. That narrows our search down to only five possibilities.<n><n>The first option (A) is the home, since that's where people have electric fans.<n>The second option (B) is the hardware store, but it's implausible for the person to go to the hardware store to cool their home.<n>The next two options refer to a specific room in the house, so there is no other plausible choice.<n>Finally, the fifth and final choice is the "office". While this answer sounds unconventional, the question is only asking about temperatures the person is cool with, not where they want the temperatures cool. So if the person is cool with the temperature in the office being cool, then of course they would like to have a couple of electric fans in that place.<n><n><n>Input:An animal is called a fish if its scales are covered in mucus. Scales are made from a protein called keratin. Which of the following is NOT found in keratin? Choices: <n><n>1. Eggs  <n><n>2. Fat  <n><n>3. Wool  <n><n>4. Skin  <n><n>5. Blood<n><n>Output:  Reasons:<n>This question is pretty straightforward as well. Here, the main concern is whether or not egg is found in keratin. But this isn't possible, since eggs are the reproductive cells produced by females, which are used to make babies. <n><n>To answer the question, you just need to check option 4: blood. Since eggs are NOT found in keratin, blood is not included in the list of the answer choices.<n>Answer:5<n><n><n>Input:In order to catch Pokemon, you'll need to travel the world searching for them.

Choices:  A: terrible B: little C: halloween D: small E: horrible<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first question to ask is what type of word is "scary" (a noun.)<n><n>From there, it is helpful to group words to help the brain find patterns.  For instance, we look for nouns.<n><n>The next question is to think about what are the other words that could be describing "scary" (since we know it's a noun.)<n><n>The only other words that would be a common way to describe scary are "terrible", "halloween" and "small."  "Halloween" doesn't fit since it isn't a compliment. "Terrible" is used to describe a negative or poor outcome.  "Small" is also ruled out for similar reasoning.  That leaves "horrible" which is our final answer.  The final answer is E: horrible<n><n>Input: A man has his entire home gutted with a fire and it seems he loses everything he holds dear. The man's reaction is to what? Choices: A: get an additional life insurance policy B: throw a party C: get into a big argument D: go to the hospital E: do nothing for 2 days<n>Output:<n><n>First we decide that "man" is a subject, not a verb or object.<n><n>We look for nouns, since "gutted" is an adjective. These would be the options: "home", "fire", "things", "dear", "man", "party", "big argument", "hospital", "days".<n><n>What else can you think of that would be describing words?  These 2 are all that we're given, so now it becomes a matter of process of exclusion.<n><n>If it doesn't fall into one of these two categories (describing word or noun), it would be excluded from the pool of possible answer choices.<n><n>All nouns, except arguably "days" is a noun of time (since a day may be a quantity of various things).<n><n>"Big Argument" is ruled out.  "Big" indicates something about the size, and doesn't indicate what kind of argument it is, unlike "big fight".<n><n>"Getting an additional life insurance" doesn't match the wording of the question.<n><n>"Throws a party

Choices:  A: nailed B: carved C: polished D: eat cake E: petrify<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>To attach something to wood, you would "nail" (A) or "screw" (D) it to the wood. "Carve" (B) would involve cutting away part of the wood, which wouldn't accomplish the goal of attaching something to it. "Petrify" (E) involves turning an organic material into a solid non-organic substance, so it isn't used in the construction of a wood object. <n><n>The term "polish" (C) could also apply here, depending on how you mean it. Polishing would remove a thin layer of material from the surface of a wood object so the object becomes more glossy or lustrous. However, "carve" and "polish" could both also refer to the removal of material, so it is difficult to tell which one of these two words the question refers to. Therefore, this is the most ambiguous option here. <n><n>So, the correct answer is D: Eat cake.  <n><n>Input:Is there air in space? Choices: 1. No 2. Yes 3. No B: Yes C: No D: Yes E: 1 <n>Output: Reason :<n><n>"Yes" is the only answer that would mean "Air is found in space".<n><n>So the final answer will be: B: Yes.   <n><n>

Choices:  A: make sex B: plan to marry C: dance D: electrical circuit E: row about<n>Output:		Reason:<n>- John and Jane wanted to be together for a long time. "Marriage" (C) seems like a likely goal. But "dancing"(B) and "rowing" (E) don't make sense in the given context. <n>Option "electrical circuit" (D) seems to refer to something other than the relationship itself, or a goal to improve the relationship — not a good match for what the intended answer is.<n><n>Reason: The intended answer, "plan to marry" (C) fits the context best, as John and Jane want to improve their relationship by getting married.<n>Therefore, the final answer is Option "C: plan to marry”<n>

The wording of the final option, "losing energy," may suggest the opposite is true - that sports should be played without the stress of competition. However, the fact that this option is listed as "losing energy" suggests that competition does not cause players to lose energy- they might just enjoy it more! In addition, this option also suggests that playing sports without competition can be tiresome- it is not an ideal experience for players who wish to avoid wearing themselves out.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Sarah wanted to by a new rug.  Ink spilled onto her old one.  Really, she didn't know what that thing had an inkwell in the first place.  What piece of furniture might have been on her run? Choices:  A: front of door B: bedroom C: desk D: table E: living room<n>Output:		Reason: the most correct answer here is D because for a rug to have an inkwell in it, it has to be on the floor. However, if you would look at choice E, living room does not describe where the rug is but, instead, where she is going. So A and E do not fit the explanation of the text in which it has to do with the floor. Therefore, B, C & D are ruled out and from that it could be seen E is the correct answer.<n><n>Input:I need to buy a gift for someone.  I hope it is something fun.  It could be a new shirt if they were not a teenager, but my cousin is so.  What kind of gift? Choices:  (A) a book (B)a game controller  (C)a camera (D) a video game (E)a new shirt<n>Output: Reason  A game controller (B) is an inappropriate gift for Sarah's cousin since she is a teen. A camera (C) can also apply but it could be her dad's gift. A new shirt (E) is okay for her but she already has some so I would say D.<n><n>Input:In my country, the president was not elected in a democracy.  The candidate who won had to persuade people to vote for him rather than his opponent.  The president had the support of other party members, but the party did not officially support him.  He had to give in a certain way so as not to get punished.  What form of persuasion would work best? Choices:  a. Persuasion b. Persuasion A type c. Persuasion B type d. Persuasion C type e. Persuasion D type<n>Output:  Reason: It has to do with persuasion and persuasion does not mean to manipulate, coercion, blackmail, and such. A is not right since the president had the support of party members and as such his party backed him to be elected. To get the right answer, it has to revolve around a certain way. Since it was an election, I'd pick B.<n><n>Input:Fishermen have to do some planning before fishing.  They need to decide on the size of net and whether to go with dynamite fishing or using a net.

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where are people likely to stand at an intersection? Choices:  A: cars B: city street C: street corner D: fork in road E: at a red light<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>In the situation described, those at the intersection are likely to stand on the edge of the intersection, closer to the center than to the outer edges. Therefore, "city street" (B), "street corner" (C), and "where are people likely to stand..." (D) are rules out.<n><n>Of the remaining 4 answers, "for a red light" (E) would not make sense, as this isn't relevant to the context. It makes far more sense that people would stand at the intersection because of their presence in cars.<n><n>Hence, the answer is "city street" (A), as people would stand at an intersection because of the presence of cars.<n><n>Input: Where do you usually stand at the bus stop? Choices: <n>A: On the left<n>B: On the right<n>C: On the aisle<n>D: In front of the bus<n>E: Behind the bus<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>The situation described indicates people would usually stand on their right side of the bus. It also indicates that there are two buses, with two different places to board. Hence, the only answers that could potentially be related to two buses are "stand" (B) and  "on the aisle" (C).<n>Of these two choices, "Behind the bus" (E) is not a plausible choice, as it would not make sense that the bus stop would be on the back of the bus. Hence, the answer is either Choice "A" (on the left) or Choice "B" (on the right). <n><n>Input: At the end of which section do you usually pause to rest?<n>A: First half<n>B: Second half<n>C: Last quarter<n>D: Three-quarter point<n>E: Before the end of the quarter<n>Output: Reason:-<n><n>The question invokes the context of a race (presumably, a marathon), in which runners would be making laps around a track. Hence, the last quarter of their run is the most likely place for them to pause.<n><n>Of the given answer, "before the end of the quarter" (E) would make the most sense, since it does directly indicate the position of the runners around the track<n><n>Hence, Choice (E) i.e., "before the end of quarter" is the

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:John moved away from his family.  He was a bit upset that he had to do it, but he needed the job.  Still, he would have preferred it if the job were what? Choices:  A: present B: stay here C: closer D: available E: come here<n>Output:		In order to answer the question correctly, you need to analyze its context. This question is asking about John's decision to move away from his family.<n><n>Option "stay here" (B) seems like an odd choice, given that John is already in the place he is describing as being "here". That strongly suggests that he should have said "stay away from" rather than "stay here" to complete the sentence properly.<n><n>Option "closer" (C) has no place in the context of the sentence. While the other options are vague in the sense that the reader does not immediately know what they refer to, the plausible meaning of this option makes it highly unlikely that "closer" is the right answer. <n><n>Option "available" (D) seems like it might fit the context better than the other options. It indicates that John had a choice between two or more possible jobs. This is plausible, given that both the "bit upset" and "preferred option" hints at John's conflicting emotions regarding this situation.<n><n>Similarly, option "come here" (E) might seem to make little sense in this context. The job's "availability" (whatever that is) was not enough for John to choose to move closer to it, so it would not be likely that it would cause John to move away from his home in the first place.<n><n>Finally "present" (A) fits the context perfectly, as John feels "upset" by the choice he must make to move away from his families. He would much rather have stayed close to home and taken a job that was already in his "present" location, but he had to find better options for himself and his family.<n><n>So the final answer would be A: present.<n><n>### Instruction:Read the sentence and answer the question.<n><n>Input : The old man sneaked in with stealth, wearing a brown sash across his chest.

Choices:  A: cook dinner B: study french cooking C: taste sauce D: prepare food E: thin sauce<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step is to parse the question and identify the actions performed by the chef. In this case, the choices are "cook dinner," "study French cooking," "taste sauce," "prepare food," and "thin sauce."<n><n>With the actions identified, you can begin to eliminate choices that don't make sense logically. For example, "thin sauce" (E) doesn't make sense in this context - unless they're using very thin pieces of cookware to serve their food?<n><n>The next step is to eliminate choices that don’t make sense in terms of timing. For instance, "prepare food" (D) can be confusing because we don't know if the food is going to be cooked immediately. As a result, this choice is eliminated.<n><n>Ultimately, only two choices are left: "cook dinner" (B) and" taste sauce" (C). Though both are valid interpretations, there's no one sentence to unify them. "Cook dinner" doesn't say what sauce they are using or what flavor they are tasting. Meanwhile, "taste sauce" doesn't mention dinner in the sense of it being a meal, which begs the question, "What is the chef cooking for?"<n><n>The best answer would be "taste sauce", as it's easier to infer what they're cooking based on the context of the question (It's clearly a sauce). The chef is cooking dinner for their family and friends, but cooking dinner by itself isn't a specific enough answer.<n><n>So the answer is C: taste sauce<n><n>### Problem 5<n>Input: When does an American eat Thanksgiving dinner?

Choices:  A: sneezing B: fatigue C: house clean D: feeling satisfied E: getting good grades<n>Output:		Answer: D<n>Reasoning:<n><n>After his mother saw his bad report card, he knew he was going do be doing housework, and his reaction to the housework was satisfaction. To do this, the choice of the question must be, what could have prevent the homeworker before it started. <n>By eliminating the options, we are left with the question of what could prevent them from getting good grades. Options A, C, B and E have nothing to do with grades. <n>The remaining option is choice D, feeling satisfied. The main reason, most students get bad grades is because of lack of study, procrastination, not knowing how to do assignments or homeworks or just plain laziness. Therefore, students end up not getting good grades.<n><n>This choice would best reflect the question because he was satisfying after his mother saw his bad performance.<n><n>Input: A group of people were invited to a meeting held by a member from the group. Why was it cancelled? Choices: <n><n>1. The group member was unavailable.<n>2. One person was not present at the meeting.<n>3. The group members were invited from different social groups.<n>4. They did not find the location.<n>5. Too many people turned up for a small function.<n><n>Output: Answer: 3. The group members are invited from different social groups<n>Reasoning: From choices 1,2,4 and 5, it is apparent that the meeting got canceled because of the non-availability of the group member holding the meeting or they were not present or too many people turned up or the group members were not from the same social groups.<n><n>Input:"Please don't worry" is used in this situation to say that no matter what happens, it's ok because ______?

It's possible that the correct answer may not be football players, but something similar that fits this description, such as a stadium.<n><n>To be sure, it's a good idea to consider the option that doesn't fit the context: "players" (D). It's unlikely that "players" would go on a football  field, as that would be impractical and make little sense. Therefore, it can be eliminated as a correct answer. <n><n>Finally, consider the remaining options, "yard" (E) and "Oklahoma" (A). <n>"Yard" (E) is unlikely to be the correct answer, as it seems rather inappropriate, as it relates to length rather than direction.

Choices:  A: names B: words C: naval D: bladders E: feelings<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Here the Hippy wants to be in peace with all the people.<n><n>The task is to figure out what the Hippy is strong of. First notice that the options are all single word. There are five options A,B,C,D and E and only one possible answer E.<n><n>Now what are the possible answer for this scenario? the word 'peace', it can mean that the Hippy wants world peace where all the people in the world are in peace or the Hippy wants peace among all the people he knows personally. For the first option we can cross of the B and C since they have 'war' or 'wars'. Next we know the 'bladders' means bladder(s) not urine bags because a hippy doesn't wear such things so we can cross off the option D. For option E we already know that the answer is in the word 'peace' (BP).<n><n>Next we can figure out the type of relationship 'peace' can have with Hippy himself. <n><n>There are two kinds of relationship we have with people. The kind where we are both equal in relationship terms and the kind where we are not equal. (i.e both equals, like two friends, or unequal like a teacher and student, or parent-child). So we can rule out option A since we are told that the Hippy's purpose is that it will be with all the humans without condition so clearly the Hippy wants all of them to be equal in his eyes. Next we cross out option B because he is only human so it is not necessary for all the people to have the same value as human in his eyes so they would not be equal in this sense.<n><n>Hippy = Human <n>If (Hippy = Human) then (All Humans = Hippy)<n>If (All Humans = Person) then (Hippy = Hippy)<n><n>Now we come to option C and D. Now remember option D is a noun and D can't equal to D, so we rule out that one out first. Next we cross out the option C since the word 'Hippe' in the answer has a 'e' sound at last so we already know that E is the one that we are looking for.<n><n>Now the answer to the question is: E: Feelings<n>Explanation:<n><n>The Hippy

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What will telling many people about an embarrassing situation lead to? Choices:  A: notoriety B: emotional distress C: riot D: bad dreams E: annoyance<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>First, choose the option that best fits the context of the question: "many people." <n><n>The next step is to identify the outcome that would be caused by publicizing the information. <n><n>Option "notoriety" (A) implies that the person would be recognized widely. However, this is a specific use of the word "notoriety" to suggest fame and notoriety, which is a form of notoriety. Only the word "notoriously" would be accurate to suggest widely recognized. Because this term is out of the question, it must be ruled out.<n><n>Next, eliminate all options that are not relevant and would not be likely to happen (B), (C), and (D). <n><n>Option "annoyance" (E) is an accurate outcome, but does not fit the context of the question, because it would not be caused by telling many people about an "embarrassing situation." <n><n>Therefore, this leaves the most plausible answer to be E: annoyance.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation.

Choices:  A: bike B: downtown C: building D: tool storage E: car<n>Output:		Reasoned Answer:<n><n>The first step in this problem is to determine what James is spending his money on. That would be a bike. This choice is based on the fact that other options are irrelevant and impractical - why would James need a car if he is spending money on a bike? And the same reasoning can be said for downtown, which would be excessive and unreasonable.<n><n>The second step is to find a suitable garage for James' needs.<n>The options that could provide a garage are tool storage and garage. However, "garage" doesn't make sense in this context, as James would have a garage if he owned a house with a property. In this case, James' needs are better suited to a tool storage, which would be a smaller, more practical solution.<n><n>The final step is to choose the best option that meets James' needs.<n>Because the only viable choice for James is tool storage. Therefore, this is the most accurate and logical answer.<n>So the final answers is E: tool storage<n><n><n>

Choices:  A: communication B: suffering C: pain D: laughter E: embarrassment<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The scenario given in the question doesn't seem to accurately describe any commonly known emotion, but "suffering" (B) is a close approximation, which is a pretty accurate depiction of human behavior. <n><n>However, it's unlikely for people to experience suffering from tripping in front a crowd and breaking their leg. So option "suffering" is eliminated. <n><n>Later, the scenario introduces the possibility of laughter (D), which indicates some people might find humor in breaking their leg, and that's probably the more common reaction. But option "suffering (B)" isn't completely eliminated. <n>So the next step is to choose which one might be more common or preferred. <n><n>Finally, it turns out that option "embarrassment" (E) is the best match, because it describes an emotional state common among humans. <n>So the final answer would be E: embarrassment.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Write a function which defines the best solution to a problem.<n><n>**Input:** n a number, and k an optional integer. If n is less than zero, then output 0<n>If n and k are both positive numbers, and k < n, then output (n/k). If n and k are both negative numbers, and k is greater than n, output a number less than 0.<n><n>**Output:** The smallest positive or negative number less than or equal to n.<n><n>Output: Reason<n><n>The first step is to establish the correct solution. First, we must look at the number of parameters and their purpose. If both n and k have no negative values, then the answer will be k. If k is greater than n and there are not negative values then the answer will be an even number. The last option is to solve if there are some negative numbers and the solution is less than 0. <n><n>The first two cases represent two special cases to handle when the situation requires the answer be between k and n. To solve these two issues, we create a function that takes two parameters, namely n and k, and returns a number smaller than k and equal to or greater than n.<n><n>Since this function only deals with positive numbers, we initialize with 0; if the initial value is 0 or less, then return 0, otherwise we start with a

Choices:  A: control computer B: separate things C: go on vacation D: cross street E: go out<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>This question requires a person to analyze a context and pinpoint what the person is exactly trying to do.<n>An early candidate would be "go on vacation," but this phrase invokes an emotional context. Therefore, this answer would be thrown out of contention for lack of evidence.<n><n>Based on the context in this case, "separate things" (C) is eliminated, because it doesn't invoke the image of a person looking at a piece of software or on a screen. Furthermore, the image of "control computer" (A) comes to mind, which suggests the person was trying to control something. If not for the previous elimination of "go on vacation" (E), it is likely that this choice would also fall out of contention.<n><n>Therefore, the final answer is the one that correctly captures the context and purpose of the situation - "go out" (D).

It does not specify why the team was meeting, and it does not provide clues as to why the meeting was "special." Furthermore, although there is usually a marketing manager in a company, this choice does not specify which manager (the general marketing manager or a specific person such as an assistant marketing manager) was the focus of the meeting.<n><n>On the other hand, the choice "The team lead" (B) is eliminated because it indicates the team's leader was the focus of the discussion - that is, the marketing team met with the marketing manager. It does not seem like the new client the team is trying to market would be the focus of the discussion.<n><n>The choice "The whole team" (C) is unlikely, because it implies there

While the phrase "farmer's market" could refer to a certain place, it fails to mention a specific location.<n>* Option "New York: same as option "Illinois"<n>* Option "Indiana: same as option "New York"<n><n>Option "Farmer's market" (A) has been eliminated, since it is not a place.<n><n>Option "Woods" (B), while providing the type of trees the woman was surrounded by, does not provide a location, so it is also eliminated.<n><n>Option "Illinois" (C), while referring to a particular place, does not refer to a particular location related to the woman's experience, so it is also incorrect.<n><n>Option "Indiana" (E) does not fit the context of the scenario in which the woman picked from an apple. <n><n>So only option E "new york" remains.

Choices:  A: walk B: change shoes C: play tag D: smell smoke E: reach over<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first thing to notice is that the word "bored" in the question is a bit of a red flag. If a child suddenly becomes bored, they would likely do nothing. However, the question seems to assume that a child would always do something when bored. <n><n>The three options listed are all very plausible actions for a bored child, but their presence on the list suggests they are too likely to be the correct answer. In particular, the three plausible options include an action which only occurs before the smelling of smoke, such as "reach over", which can rule it out early.<n><n>The fifth option, "smell smoke", seems to come out of thin air, and as such is not likely to be the answer.

Choices: 1: The same size<n>2: Shaped differently 3: Colored differently 4: A different taste 5: Different qualities<n>Output:<n><n>The first word in the question is "differentiated," which is an adjective meaning "markedly different within a group or class." The phrase "differentiated class" could imply that students in the class are all the same, which contradicts the meaning of "differentiated."<n><n>The next words in the question, "study of mathematics," suggest that the people or things that are differentiated are "students of mathematics." This can mean that the students are from the <n>same group or class, in which case the correct answer would be "the same size."<n><n>Option "shaped differently" (2) is definitely not the correct answer, since that would imply that the students are physically different.<n><n>Option "colored differently" (3) could be an appropriate answer if the class of students is all the same but their backgrounds are different. However, the context of the question is unclear, so this answer cannot be ruled out as well.<n><n>"A different taste" (4) can be ruled out early as well since this means that the students all have different preferences and not that they are physically different. This leaves only "different qualities" (5) as the possibility for a correct answer

That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

Choices:  A: kitchen B: child's hand C: street D: toy store E: soccer game<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>For this question, we first want to determine the relevance of each possible location.<n><n>Kitchen (A): this choice seems to be out-of-the-box and would be unlikely given the context of finding a ball.<n><n>Child's hand (B): this may be a good pick based on the way the question is worded. It is possible that a parent would seek out a child who is in possession of a toy. In this case, the child's hand would be a good place to start.<n><n>Street (C): while it may be difficult to find a ball on the street, this would undoubtedly be possible, given the right resources. There may be a playground nearby that would allow access to a ball. Still, the context of this question makes it less likely than the previous choice.<n><n>Toy store (D): this is the most likely conclusion, given the context of the surrounding question. The toy store would be a good place for a parent to seek out a ball, which was likely the intent behind the puzzle.<n><n>Soccer game (E): it is unlikely that a parent would look for a ball at a soccer game, given the purpose behind the question.<n><n>So the final answer would be D: toy store<n><n>Input:Which animal eats birds? Choices:  C: cat or canary C: dog or squirrel D: bear or rabbit E: fish or duck F: lion or penguin<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>Once again, the first task is to understand and contextualize the puzzle. It mentions "animal eats birds", which leads to several possibilities:<n><n>"cat or canary" (C) seems like an irrelevant choice, given that these animals typically aren't hunters or predators.<n><n>"dog or squirrel" (D) may be relevant based on the context, but it would be incorrect because dogs typically don't eat squirrels. <n><n>"bear or rabbit" (E) may be relevant, but the contextual clues don't seem to suggest that a bear is more likely than a rabbit, making this a less likely option. <n><n>"fish or duck" (F) seems to be an accurate choice given the context, as these animals are predators and would certainly eat birds
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What could contain no more than around 100 people? Choices:  A: apartment B: classroom C: buildings D: car E: audience<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step is to understand what the context of the question suggests about the population. The word "no more than around 1<n>00 people" implies that the population in question can range anywhere from 1 to 100, rather than just being a single entity. That eliminates the choice "apartment" (A), which only contains one person.<n><n>The second step is to look for specific hints about the population's purpose and function. Option "classes" (B), which refers to students as a collective group, is still plausible, but isn't the most direct answer. <n><n>The choice "buildings" (C) is not viable as it can contain millions of people in a single city block. <n><n>The last two options are "audience" (D) and "car" (E).<n><n>Option D - audience - refers to members of a theatrical ensemble. It is too specific of an audience. <n><n>Option E - car - is too vague; it could mean the number of passengers in a single car is under 100, and it could be as low as 1. Therefore, the right answer here is option C - Buildings.<n><n>Input:Who can buy goods that last them less than one year? Choices:  - A: customers B: investors C: homeowners D: owners<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>The given context suggests that these goods will be bought by people who may want to resell them after one year of use, so customers and homeowners would be the best fit.<n><n>The context of the question refers to people who buy goods that last less than one year. This implies that the buyers may not have purchased these goods themselves, but instead have acquired them from someone else - in this case, a homeowner.<n><n>By excluding investors and investment vehicles, option A is eliminated immediately.<n><n>Although homeowners have a strong case here, the buyers in the scenarios do not purchase their home from anywhere. Buying a home doesn't involve purchasing the home from a person or entity, meaning option C can be eliminated too.<n><n>Having decided that options A and C should be ruled out, one may be tempted to eliminate option D and go straight to option B. However, there's a chance that one of those two is

I think the house and training station are the next lowest after that.

However, a closer look reveals that this sentence is a red herring.<n>You can have more kids with a single kid, which should be factored into a more complex answer.<n><n>Option B (understand themselves), A (complaints), and E (larger house) focus solely on the parent, and neglect that parents can have more kids while having more parents, which is another important fact to consider when answering this question.<n><n>Option D (second chances) focuses on the fact that parents often need second chances, but it doesn't highlight that they can have more kids as well.<n><n>This leaves option C (life partner), the only correct answer, which implies that the kids are an additional asset in a marriage relationship, where the couple can have more kids.<n><n>Input: In the first half of this statement how does the sun and the moon have an important role to play?

Choices:  A: pleasure B: accident C: get somewhere D: hurt E: falling down<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>One who rides a bike through rough terrain could find themselves injured, which suggests the outcome would be "injured". But the other options also include injury as a possibility. "Get somewhere" (D) is ruled out, because it would be unlikely for the rider to find themselves "injured" while "getting somewhere" in the process. "Accident" (B), although a possible outcome for the rider, would be too vague to accurately describe the situation.<n><n>The choice to eliminate would be "pleasure" (A). Pleasure is usually the opposite of what someone would expect while riding a bike through rough weather, and would therefore not describe the outcome of falling or being injured.<n><n>"Falling down" (E) matches the context of the scenario, and describes an obvious outcome that anyone could foresee.

Choices:  a: dark blue b: light blue c: bright orange d: orange red e: dark red<n>Output:Reasoniing:<n><n>The painter sees a man suffering from a severe headache at the door of a person with a headache, so the man should be given some help which would be very helpful.<n><n>The man has a headache and the painter sees him therefore the man must use dark blue color which he can see clearly as it can be used to hide dark circles under the eyes.<n><n>The painting of dark blue colors would be helpful for the man and the artist must do that. <n>Therefore, the final answer to the question is E: color dark blue<n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where does a spoon go on one side of a plate? Choices:  A: bowl of soup B: serving dish C: table setting D: placemat E: glass of iced tea<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>The purpose of a spoon is to aid in the consumption of food, so it would not rest on a plate's **side.** It would, however, **go** on the plate, which means resting on the surface of the plate itself.<n><n>Input:If a doctor gets a cold what does he do when he goes to the movies? Choices:  B: Sneeze C: Go home D: Close his eyes E: Won’t go<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>The context of the question (the doctor getting a cold) implies that the doctor is unable to perform his normal duties due to illness.<n><n>In addition, as the doctor isn't feeling well, he's unlikely to take himself to the movies in the first place, which means "won't go." This option is also supported by the fact that the doctor is unable go to work/perform his duties in the first place, as suggested by the fact that he will be sneezing in the theater itself when he goes to see a movie. This would explain why he would "close his eyes" so he could stay aware of what was going on around him.<n><n>Therefore, the correct answer is E: Won't go<n><n>Input:A: Dust B: Swipe C: Scrub D: Vacuum E: Wipe<n>Output: Reasonninng:<n><n>Here, since a cleaner is tasked with cleaning a sofa, the answers don't just include cleaning the sofa, they also include cleaning it with certain equipment.<n><n>The correct answer is E: Wipe<n><n>### Answer:<n><n>### How to get 1 Point.<n>- You can not use the words  : `Wipe`, `Scrub`, `Dust` as they have been removed.<n><n><n>

Choices:  A: infect B: reproduce C: mutate D: eat food E: make computer malfunction<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Viruses do not primarily do any of the things mentioned in the multiple choice answers. They are not responsible for reproduction, mutation, or food/computer eating. Instead, viruses primarily infect a person, which is clearly referenced in the first choices of the question - "infect." "Virus," after all, is derived from the word "infection."<n><n>In terms of the remaining four answers, "make the computer malfunction" (A) seems to be the most likely response. However, viruses usually do not interact with the human body in the same way that they interact with a computer. So, while there may be cases where a virus infects a human and also a computer, it makes more sense to choose an answer referring only to the actions of the virus on the human body.<n><n>The next two choices - "reproduce" (B) and"mutate" (D) - do not refer to the common purpose of a virus. Viruses do not reproduce, especially in the human body. Likewise, viruses do not mutate - they replicate.<n><n>Finally "eat food" (C) is not likely since viruses do not eat food as a common behavior or purpose.<n>So the final correct answer is A: Infect<n><n>Input: What is a mutation of a virus? Choices:  "a" "a" "a mutation of a virus" "a"<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>A mutation of a virus is simply what a virus does when it replicates itself. The mutations are slight changes, that occur randomly, from replication. The mutations can lead to new variants of the virus.<n><n>Input:Why does the scientist do some of the experiments in the laboratory?  Choices:  A) Because he needs to eat food B) So that he can enlighten his brain C) So that he can experiment D) So that he can improve the data E) Because he needs a headache<n>Output: Reasonning:<n><n>A: Because he needs to eat: Food is not involved in the experimental process. The word "need" is a vague word. In this form, it is unclear in which situation the scientist is eating food.<n><n>B:So that he can enlightent his brain: The words "enlighten" and "learn" are syn

Choices:  A: classroom B: toy store C: school D: soccer game E: dinner<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option A: The classroom is definitely the most boring.<n>And option B can be rejected because the toy store is a place of children. Children would obviously like to go there.<n><n>Option C: the school is also no fun. It involves lots of learning, which is not fun at all.<n><n>Option D: The soccer game can be rejected because the children like football (soccer). We don’t have the word football in English.<n><n>Finally choice E. If the dinner is not interesting to children, then what happens to the rest of the world? You cannot go to a restaurant or something. You should choose option E.<n>So, the final answer is E.<n><n>Input:Is x larger than 4/5 times x?

Choices:  A: swim B: jog C: excercise D: work out E: rock climb<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Several of the choices are implausible options from an earth-dwellers perspective. For example, choice D asks questionable hypothetical: "If you're out at sea and are in shape, how would you feel about doing a work out on a rock?"<n>The more realistic options are A-C, which asks about physical activity instead of exercise.<n>Option A suggests swimming as a way to get in shape. While water doesn't exactly resemble land, swimming nonetheless requires the application of physical force, and is an exercise in the truest sense of the word.<n>Option B is even more extreme than A, by asking, "How can you get in _jogging shape_ if there is no land near you?"<n>Option C is another sensible guess - excercising one's muscles could include any exercise that requires muscular effort.<n>Out of these three options, though, choice C is the most likely answer, because it's also the only one that's phrased as a yes/no question with only one response - "I get in shape by _exercising_ my muscles."<n><n>So the final answer to this question is C: excercising<n><n>###Instruction:<n><n>Input: The following are some of the properties of an integer. <n><n>The two digit number 21 is a _______.<n><n>Choices:  A: prime number B: rational number C: whole number D: even number <n><n>For the first part, we have to determine whether that's a property given in the problem or not.

Choices:  A: deceptive B: altruistic C: stupid D: cruel E: agressive<n>Output:		Reason<n><n>For the first part of the question, we must determine how people harming others is relevant in this context. Clearly they're being malicious, but we're looking at the traits that are being exhibited, rather than the specific types of harm. This suggests a link between maliciousness and traits - not specific actions.<n><n>We can then eliminate deceptive (A) and cruel (D), because they would seem to relate only to harmful actions, rather than to specific traits exhibited before harming others.<n><n>This leaves us with options that relate to traits and not actions. Altruism (B), for example, often requires selflessness. Therefore it wouldn't suit the purposes of a person who is deliberately harming others. Stupidity (C) could also be true, but it doesn't seem the most likely choice given the situation.<n>That leaves us with one choice, Aggression (E).<n><n>Aggressive people are more likely to hurt others, so it doesn't seem implausible that they would hurt people intentionally. While they might not do it through malicious deeds per se, the choice (E) best fits the scenario because of this.<n><n>input: What is a negative consequence of allowing a dog and a cat, who do not like each other, to live under one roof?<n><n>output:<n><n>Answer <n><n>The most common reason that owners have to euthanize their pets is because they were unable to fulfill the duty of responsibly caring for them. <n>According to The Washington Post, more than 3 million animals are euthanized in the United States each year, primarily because their owners were unable to provide proper care and attention.

Choices:  A: sun himself B: thank god C: race against time D: express love E: to think about things.<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>We start by noticing that there is very little context-based information provided in the question. We can look at other details in the question to help us better understand the reasoning.<n><n>"The person" refers to the person who has a choice. It's unclear who this person is (a doctor, nurse, patient, scientist, etc.) and whether this person is male or female. So far, we can only know that the person is likely someone who is involved in the medical field.<n><n>"Laying on the beach," in this context, refers to going into a quiet resting position. A doctor or nurse might lay down while working in very hectic situations, in order to rest for a moment and recharge. <n><n>The last option "to think about things" (E) is a viable option, because the person could very well be taking a moment to rest and think about life. But the other options seem unlikely for this situation.<n><n>Option "sun himself" (A) sounds like an option for a healthy physical fitness routine, rather than the reasons for a doctor, nurse, or other medical professional to lay down for a brief moment.<n>Option "thank god" (B) can be taken at face value, but is rather a simple statement of gratitude and doesn't really explain why the person is lying down.<n>Option "express love" (D) sounds rather over the top for a possible reason, and is probably more of a sarcastic choice given the other options.<n><n>Finally option "race against time" (C), while a possible explanation if the person is part of a medical team racing to save a patient's life, doesn't necessarily fit the beach context.<n><n>So the final answer would be E: to think about<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Answer the following multiple choice questions.<n><n>Input:The doctor was having the worst day ever.

Moreover, it is somewhat passive, and our task calls for an action.<n><n>D: Hugging your friends (E) doesn't immediately fit into the context of the conversation.<n><n>Therefore, E:visiting friends (B) is the most suitable answer<n><n>

Choices:  A: crack B: antipathy C: being mean D: disinterest E: unfeeling<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>First, rule out the wrong answers:<n><n>The answer "crack" refers to the act of using drugs. This does not align with the question, which does not refer to any illegal activities. "being mean" (C) is similarly out of context, since it describes a harsh treatment, which doesn't fit with the word "selfish." It's also not clear why this is associated with raising a child.<n><n>Next, look at the correct answers:<n><n>"antipathy" (B) is a close match but it is not quite accurate, since it means to be "hostile" rather than "uncaring." The answer "disinterest" (D) is more specific in its description, capturing the essence of the question but not conveying it in exactly the same way.<n><n>Ultimately, the correct answer is "uncaring". It refers to a lack of concern or empathy, which fits with the question about the little girl who was raised selfish. This implies that she didn't care about her actions or the people around her, resulting in an uncaring or unfeeling behavior pattern.<n>So the final correct answer is:  D: disinterest<n><n>Input: The king was overthrown, all the people were sad and decided to take what? Choices: A: refuge E: revenge B: support D: rest C: escape<n>Output: Reason <n><n>"All the people were sad and" means the majority of the people, but not everyone. Therefore, "c" is eliminated since it refers to the other people who were not sad.<n><n>"decided to take" means to "go to" or "travel to". Therefore, this rule out choices "A" and "D". Choices "b", "c", and "e" sound like what the people would take from the sad king. Thus, the answer must be "revenge".<n>So the final correct choice is B: revenge.<n><n>Input:The boy is a dishonest person,he doesn't follow the principle of "fair is "fair play". Choices:  A.

Choices:  A: allergic reaction B: gain weight C: have fun D: heartburn E: food poisoning<n>Output:		Reasonings:A: No<n>B: No\C: No<n>D: No<n>E: No<n><n>Referring to 'hamburger' in general, you know that it doesn't normally contain any of food poisoning ingredients (or at least in any significant amounts). However, the ingredients are different every time. It's theoretically possible to get food poisoning from hamburger-but it's unlikely.<n><n>The only way you would get allergic reaction is from consuming peanuts. When one eats a hamburger that doesn't contain peanuts, there is no way for them to experience an allergic reaction to the hamburger.\<n><n>Although it is possible to gain weight from eating hamburger or even heartburn, neither really apply to the general public.\<n><n>The only way a person could experience food poisoning from eating a hamburger is if there is food poisoning in the raw meat and he or she cooks the meat poorly.\<n><n>So the correct answer is C: have fun<n><n>Input:The boy did a very strange thing - he picked up a brick and he kept hitting with it his head.

Choices: <n><n>A: He was doing a great job.<n>B: The boy was crazy.<n>C: She was worried about him.<n>D: He was being a brat.<n>E: He deserved some punishment.<n><n>output: Reasonings:<n><n>A: No, the boy was not doing a great job. He was hitting himself in the head to cure a headache.<n><n>B: He was not being weird.<n><n>C: Probably. The boy was being weird. It is possible that his mother was worried about him, but it is just as likely that she was worried about him being weird.<n><n>D: No, it is not that the boy is being a brat. The boy is having problems and he is trying his best to fight them. <n><n>E: The boy did not deserve any punishment. In fact, she should have praised him.<n><n>So the correct answers is C: She was worried <n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:When they got out of the car in the mountains he felt like he was breathing fresh air for the first time, he began to do what to enjoy it more? Choices:  A: living B: feeling good C: hyperventilate D: look around E: breathe deeply<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>This is a bit of a mind twister, we do not know what they were breathing fresh air after so we take as a given that they were actually breathing breathable air.<n>Now we can look for the purpose of their breathing. <n>It could be to enjoy it further, but if that would have been the case we could not say that they were breathing in breathable air for the first time so he did not actually breathe any breathable air, nor was he breathing any air at all.<n><n>It could be to get to enjoy breathing further, but breathing is a very quick process you have to breathe at least as often as your heart beats, so if you are hyperventilating you are not getting to enjoy the breathing. <n><n>It could be a reaction on the fact that the air in the mountains was fresh. If he had felt this fresh air before in his life he would not have gone hyperventilating nor would he have begun to look around. <n><n>It is quite reasonable to say that he began to breathe deeply, he had breathed but not as deeply as he could because he was not feeling like he was enjoying the air around him for the first time.<n><n>So the final answer will be D: begin to breathe deeply<n><n>Input: When they found something to their left they wondered what could this be? Choices: A:  a mountain B: a hill C: a plain D: a valley E: no<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>The most probable reason to go forward is of course curiosity. They have never seen such a huge plain before and must have wondered whether it was what they saw. The only other solution is if one of them had a map or compass and showed it to the others. The question says that they found it on their own, but in this case, no can't be a reason and we are looking for A, B, C, or D.<n><n>Input: We have a lot of experience and we do not know how good the service is  how can we be sure this time when the service is better than last time? Choices: A. B. C. D. E.<n>Output: Reason.<n>There's definitely more than one possible choice here, but I think a more efficient way is to find what can't be the answer.

Choices:  A: middle east B: palace C: dictionary D: pots E: apartment<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>By definition, a ficus plant has many leaves, and therefore it will provide more shade in a room. <n><n>The options A and D don't work, because they mention geographic features that don't involve leaves. The "pots" in option D refers to the plastic or ceramic container that a plant is in, but this doesn't tell us anything about the plant itself, so it's meaningless in the context of the question asked.<n>This leaves us with three options: B, C, and E.<n><n>In options B and C, the leaves are irrelevant, so they are eliminated. All that matters is the "middle" and "dictionary." So choices A and D are ruled out.<n><n>The two options remaining are both valid, which means it's unhelpful to try to determine the "best" choice. The only thing that makes choice A preferable is that it references a specific region. In terms of the purpose of the question, however, the location of the plant isn't particularly important - so neither choice is better than the other.<n><n>E: Apartments, B: pots, C: palace, D: middle east<n><n>The last answer is : C: palace<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question.<n><n>Choose :1.

Choices:  A: movie B: cape kennedy C: space center D: military installation E: spaceship centre<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first thing to understand about this question is the context it provides for the location. <n><n>The first three options - "movie" (A) and "kap kennedy" (B) and a "space cceneter" (C) - are quickly eliminated due to the reference to the location actually being a "launch pad". The context makes it evident that the location is more of a complex than just a small one-room building.<n><n>The next task to tackle is to pinpoint which exact part of the complex the astronaut would first land in. <n><n>Option "cape kennedy" (C) is easily eliminated, because it refers to a specific location within the complex. <n><n>The third line of the question states that the launch pad is just one part of what exactly? The "launch pad" is not one specific room within the complex - it refers to the entire launch area. <n><n>The fourth line narrows the list even further because the launch pad is just part of a larger location - meaning "the launch pad" does not refer to the entirety of the complex. <n>The last line of the question refers to the whole complex, meaning the "launch pad " is just one room out of many.<n><n>We have established that the launch pad is merely one room of many that is only one specific part of a complex. Therefore, the answer is "spaceship center" (D).<n><n>Input:The young couple who rented a beach home had never camped where? Choices A: at oaks to bayside resort in the woods B: in a tent C: on a houseboat D: in a cave E: on the beach<n>Output:<n><n>In the first part of the question, we have to find out more about the location in which the young couple rented a house. Based on the context, we can determine that the house is near a body of water (the beach). Furthermore, we can also deduce that the young couple probably doesn't own a houseboat, which means option (C) is not likely to be correct.<n><n>In the second part of the question, it is asked which location the campground was in. Because the couple rented a home near a beach, we can safely infer that the campground must be on the water. Option (B) refers to an in-land campground, which is unlikely since the young

Since we have no contextual data on it, we can infer that the writer is fondly recalling his childhood trip to the wildlife refuge. This choice may seem vague, but it's the closest we can get without knowing more about the writer or his background.

Choices:  A: look at B: write down C: learn new D: think about E: discovery of new<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step is to understand the context and establish the basic premise of the question. In this case, the detective is analyzing clues at the scene of a criminal investigation, which means analyzing them in order to find or uncover something of importance.<n><n>The next step is to pinpoint the detective's purpose behind this process of analysis. Is he trying to just find out something new? Or is he trying to solve a case? Maybe there is more than one purpose?<n><n>Option "learning new" (B) works only if the detective's goal is to discover something new about himself. Not at all relevant if he is trying to uncover evidence at a crime scene, in which he is already familiar with information.<n><n>The option "discovery of new" (E) is also in that it seems to reflect his goal of uncovering new information. But it's rather vague and may be taken to mean something larger, like the discovery of a new lifeform or something else completely unrelated to the task at hand.<n><n>The most accurate answer would be "thinking about" (D), since the purpose of analysis is not to discover new things per se, but to come to a conclusion or decision about the information.<n><n>So the best answer is D: thinking about 
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:A common saying, Sam thought, was to go forth, also this. Choices:  A: reverse B: backwards C: back and D: back and E: tally back<n>Output:		Reason:The first word, "go", should be plural, implying that there is more than one "common saying" or "sayings" in the sentence; "forth and back" are both nonsensical because we can't back and go forth. <n>Therefore the correct answer is option C: "back".<n>

Choices:  A: gy mnasiu m B: motel room C: seashore D: bath room E: locker room<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option A (gy mnasiu m) is incorrect as it refers to a Greek word for mind and does not reflect a common sense of the sentence.<n>Option B (motel room) is also an incorrect answer choice because, although room is similar to shower, it refers to a place to live instead of a place to take a shower.<n>Option C (seashore) is also incorrect as it cannot be correctly related to “show”.<n>Option D (bath room) includes the word room, but refers to a room within a house, and not a room within a hotel.<n>Option E (locker room), while correct and related, does not contain a space (shower).<n><n>By ruling out incorrect choices, the answer will most likely be the one that remains. <n><n>The answer is E: locker room.<n><n>Input: A good listener carefully listens ______ what the speaker says. Choices:  A; to B; for C; in D; with E; with what you say<n>Output: Reason for Answer: The blank indicates that “to” “for” “in” “with what you say” and “to” are incorrect, as they do not match the rest of the sentence “to what the speaker says.” Out of the remaining choices, “with” is the only correctly placed preposition. “With,” which means “alongside,” makes sense when it comes right after the word “speaker.” “With” also makes sense when it comes after the word “to” since the whole sentence refers to the speaker.<n><n>Output: Answers:Reason: <n><n><n>

Choices:  A: sleep in while camping B: camp ground C: woods D: bag E: backpack<n>Output:		Reason: B is correct<n>This one is a tough question. In the given choice, A: sleep in (sleeping in the tent is never recommended, not even in the middle of nowhere with no fear of anything)<n>B: is correct (camping)<n>C: is wrong (woods)<n>D: is incorrect (backpack)<n>E: is incorrect (bag)<n><n>Output: Reason Why is option Choice A incorrect and Choice B is correct?<n>Camping means that you're camping in and around the woods for a night or two. Option C, "woods", could not be the correct answer for the question, which asks how you can store your tent, and keep it near your person while you "camp". Option D (bag), which is a possible means for carrying your sleeping gear, is also not the correct answer.<n><n>Option B ("camping") is a suitable choice for the question because it answers the question of what you can do while camping, which is not the same as where. Therefore, option B is the correct answer. Choice D is incorrect because the question does not ask for the meaning of "sleeping bag".<n><n>Answer: I tried all the inputs given in the article and all gave the correct answers to given inputs.

He lived with his children because he didn't want to go where? Choices:  A: republican party B: old people's home C: office D: park E: high school or college<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Once the intended meaning becomes clear, the best answer should become readily apparent.<n>Option "park" (C) is too broad in scope and lacks any specificity. For example, which park? The obvious choice would be a school park.<n><n>Option "republican party" (A) is also too vague. While the word republican may refer to a political party, the sentence says "doesn't want to live with..." indicating that the sentence is talking about an older person instead of a political party.<n><n>Option "high school or college" (E) makes little sense. Again because the word "with" in the sentence suggests an elderly person is being described, not a student. <n><n>And, last but not least, option "old people's home" (B) has been excluded earlier because it doesn't seem to fit the context.<n><n>Therefore, the correct answer is A: office<n><n>Input:The boy had a great memory. He could remember A: anything with his eyes closed. B: anything he did in a past 5 minutes. C: names of girls he met but didn't like. D: names of all his teachers. E: what his mom ordered for dinner last week.<n>Output: <n><n>Option (A): _anything with his eyes closed_.  This option is false, since most people cannot remember things they see, they will need their ears or other senses open to receive memories/recall things. This answer is definitely incorrect.<n><n>Option (B): _anything he did in a past five minutes_ is false, since a memory can refer to a moment in time or an event in the past.<n><n>Option (C): _names of girls he met but did not like_ is also false. Since 'but' is used in this sentence, it means the boys can remember the names of the girls despite him not liking them, or has good memory to remember the names of the person.<n><n>Option (D): _names of all his teachers._ : There are actually more of his teachers than his mother orders for dinner the week before(this option has more options than this).<n><n>Option (E): _What his mom ordered for dinner the week before._ is true. Since no one can actually remember what their mom was gonna order the week before unless they remember everything they heard and saw.<n>

Choices:  A: to be heard B: receive gifts C: understand themselves D: good things in life E: acknowledgment<n>Output:		Reason: The correct answer is "E" - "Acknowledgment" Here, the question invokes the idea of a person seeking counseling. That person could be seeking aid for a variety of reasons, but according to the context, they want "acknowledgment" - that is, they want the counselor or therapist to recognize and understand what is bothering them.<n><n>Option "to be heard" (A) is too broad in scope; it isn't specific to the purpose of going to get counseling.<n><n>Option "receive gifts" (B) is possible but unrealistic; the person seeking counseling does not refer to receiving material gifts such as flowers or other trinkets as acknowledgment.<n><n>Option "understand themselves" (C) does not seem to apply in this context. A person may seek counseling to gain self-understanding, but they are not necessarily required to do so in order for them to receive counseling.<n>Option "good things in life" (D) is too broad as well; this choice isn't specific to acknowledgment.<n><n>Therefore, the correct answer is "E - Acknowledgment".<n><n><n><n>Input: What could the 3rd letter be?

Choices:  A: make B: raise C: entice D: build E: fix<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first thing to notice is that there are two phrases describing the problem at hand - "the old barn" and "the new one." This is an indication that the options available to choose from will have to do with the construction and destruction of these buildings.<n><n>Now we come to the phrase "before they could build a new one." This implies that the barn in question has been deemed unsafe for use, and a new barn will need to be built in its place instead.<n><n>Therefore, the option "make" (A) makes the least amount of sense, as it does not relate to either the old or new barn. "Build" (B) would be viable if the barn in question needs to be demolished first before constructing a new one. However, that is not the case here, as an entire new building would first need to be constructed from scratch.<n><n>The option "entice" (C) is inappropriate, as the word entice does not have any relation to building or destruction in this context. "Raise" (D) and "fix" (E) would be valid if the building in question were either a crop or livestock, but as it is a barn, these options are out of reach.<n><n>The only option left is "destroy," which is a perfect match to what must be done before building a new barn. Therefore, the correct answer would be "destroy."<n>

Choices:  A: cook dinner B: eat C: go back to work D: make food E: get food<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>The first step in cracking this question is to understand the context and the actions of the protagonist in the scenario. The key phrase to look for is "barren cupboards," which suggests that the characters are facing a severe food shortage. <n><n>Next, we need to identify the protagonist's goal. In this scenario, the characters want to eat, so the most appropriate option would be "eat" (B).

Choices: A: to the nearest cafe B: back to his hotel C: for a walk D: a stroll E: a long ride<n>Output: Reasonng:<n><n>The first thing to do here is to understand the context, which here is warm weather.  Because the man is wearing a fedora, he is probably from the old west days, around 1800.<n><n>So now, the question is what does he do when it's warm?<n><n>The options: To be a cafe, back to hotel, walking, a stroll, or a long ride. Well, he is probably not going to take a cafe ride.<n><n>He is also not going back to the office, or he didn't have one in the 1800s.<n><n>It is also not walking, because he is walking already.<n><n>Lastly, he is not on a stroll, because that implies that he is going somewhere. He is just walking.<n><n>That leaves us with "A: a long ride" because "long rides" back in the old days meant a horse ride. The old west people did not ride cars. Also, they did not use the word "walk" but only the words "a long ride", which makes sense because "walks" in the olden days were walking because they were doing it slowly.<n><n>So, the answer to the question should be, A: a long ride<n><n>Input: If a chicken runs over your stomach, what happens to it?

We're looking for the location of wealthy person and a big house seems most likely. "Europe" is an incorrect answer, because there's no mention of a house being built outside of the continent. <n><n>The next options exclude a man's room, which is unlikely to be occupied by a wealthy owner.<n><n>Next, is a palace, which seems unlikely given the lack of context about the location. Although wealthy persons often live in palatial homes, in this scenario that's not what is being described.<n><n>A big house is the correct answer. It fits the context within the sentence, which refers to a wealthy person. A person could live in a palace or a big house and still be wealthy. But a big house is the most likely answer in this context, for  reasons mentioned above. Therefore, the  correct answer is B: big house<n><n>Input: Which of these four women is oldest?

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Why is waiting for the doctor difficult for people who need to do work? Choices:  A: having appointements B: being late C: have time to think D: time consuming E: impatience<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>First, you should identify the context of the information. In this case, the word "people" implies that not everyone will need to wait for the doctor. People who do not need to see a doctor will presumably have other priorities to handle.<n><n>Next, you should reason what kind of things those people will have to do. The most likely answer is "work," or something similar. People who have to wait have to choose between waiting or doing what they normally do at work.<n><n>The wording of this sentence is a little misleading. I would say "wait for the doctor makes it difficult for people who have work to do." If you're looking for a person-based reason why people "need to do work," this is incorrect.<n><n>The next choice is impatient (E), which would fit if you interpreted the question as "Why is it hard to wait for the doctor?" But this is a misinterpretation of the question, since it's phrased as implying a general statement of difficulty, as in "it is difficult to wait for the doctor."<n><n>The next choice, "Being late" (B), has to deal with appointments. It's a similar answer compared to E, in that it describes a person as "impatient" (i.e. has a general statement of difficulty). So this is a similar answer to E as well.<n><n>With those two off the table, the remaining answers are A and D. A is the most straightforward fit for this context. People who wait for the doctor have appointments to keep at work. Because of this, they usually have something else important to worry about, since the doctor's appointment will probably not necessarily take that long.<n><n>There's also another answer, though, which is D: "have to think." In this scenario, being late for work is probably not an option. So the person is stuck at the doctor, unable to think about anything important. In this case, I would say that this does fit.<n>

Choices:  A: shopping cart B: cashier C: shopping mall D: supermarket E: bookstore<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first and second options are both irrelevant because no one is filling the bag. That, together with the scenario of the bag having clothes, indicates the location is the "supermarket".<n><n>The supermarket is where you'd find clothes and, given the scenario, would be the "final" place for someone to purchase clothes.<n><n>Input: What type of food is not used for making sandwiches? Choices:  pizza A: eggs B: tuna C: ham D: bread<n>Output: Reason::<n><n>In the English language, "ham" and "bread" both refer to a different foodstuff. Ham is a type of meat, and bread refers to a type of food. Bread is the final choice because it is the only one that's not a meat.<n>

D:"The leader cracks the whip with a warning of the consequence should team continue at the same pace." E:"Crack the whips on the snake to catch it."<n>Output:<n><n>This question is based on the premise that "crack the whips" is a phrase to warn or scare somebody. It implies something negative, which makes the first two choices (A and B) incorrect. The third and fourth choices (C and D) don't make sense as well, as they are more aligned with the actions of cracking whips, as in hitting a whip against something to create sound or movement. The only plausible answer is the fifth choice (E), which fits the context and the actions involved in "cracking the whip". Therefore, the final answer is E:"Crack the whisks on the snake to  catch it."<n><n>Input: Where do you put your shoes when you go into your house?

This is because 6th option will never make sense.<n>Answer:4<n><n><n>

Choices:  A: hatred B: surprised C: compliments D: dedication E: solutions<n>Output:		What does a great person have that a bad person doesn't? Choices: A: focus B: hatred C: solutions D: dedication E : compliments<n>Reasoning:<n><n>Option D - which describes the great person as a person who is dedicated, and one who does not give compliments - is the best answer.<n><n>Option B - which describes the bad person as someone who has hatred in their heart - does not align with what the question's stipulating: that the great person has something which the bad person does not. As such, this answer is wrong.<n><n>Option A - which describes the great and bad person alike as having focus in their lives - does not make sense because the question specifies that a person who is great at things has focus, and one who is not doesn't. This means, a person not focussing on something is not a great person, as the question stipulated.<n><n>Option E - which describes the great people as giving compliments, and the bad people as not - is incorrect, because the question stipulates that one who is dedicated and doesn't give compliments is what someone is great at at, and not someone that is bad at it.<n><n>The final answer, therefore, is D: focus and dedication<n><n>Input:a well to do business woman has a child and is looking for a good babysitter one day.

Choices:  A: drop out of school B: ask questions C: enter school D: wash dishes E: read book<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>In this scenario, a child might have a chore to do after breakfast. Option D, "wash dishes," does not fit the context, as dishes would unlikely have been left unclean in the child's house, since the parent probably would've taken care of the choral earlier. <n><n>Option "ask questions" (C) would follow the order of events. However, it's unlikely a parent would leave the child asking questions unanswered, because that would make the child confused and stressed, which is not an ideal childhood experience. In that case, the child might just go to school unprepared. <n><n>Option A is "drop out of school." However, it's not plausible a child would drop out of school, because that would mean the family is too poor to be paying for the child's education. <n><n>Option B is "read a book." The sequence of having breakfast, going to school, and then reading a book might seem logical for the average kid. However, the scenario does not indicate that the child has any free time after the bus ride. <n><n>The final option is "entering school." It sounds reasonable if the child has to get on the bus right away - which would cause the child to arrive at school while some students are already in class. Then, the child would enter the class and sit down next to a desk.<n><n>Therefore, the final answer is E.<n>Input: Who is your friend's friend?

This is problematic, because the child's friend is a human being, thus could never be a "friend's friend". That interpretation is not valid.<n><n>Therefore the correct answer is C: My friend's mother, because the boy's friend can also be a "friend' of the mother.

Choices:  A: attic B: trash C: loft D: closet E: box<n>Output:		The context of the question suggests the individual in question is likely looking for a specific type of item, such as holiday decorations. They then come across an old box of clothes and are unsure where it came from. The options that mention specific locations or places of residence are unlikely to be correct answers, as it may not be feasible for the individual to have stored the clothes in such locations.<n><n>Option "A" (trash) is the most logical answer, as trash is a plausible location for a box of old clothes. The individual is likely in a hurry and may not have taken the time to thoroughly comb through the box, causing them to miss it completely and think it was misplaced.<n><n>Option "C" (loft) is implausible because the individual has not indicated that they live in a house with a loft, or any type of second floor. There is also no indication that the clothes had been stored anywhere other than the trash, so it is unlikely that they would have been stored in the loft.<n><n>Option "D" (closet) is implausible for similar reasons, as the individual has not indicated they live in a house that has a closet, or any type of storage space for clothes. Additionally, the clothes were mentioned to be old and possibly out of style, which suggests they may not be valuable or worth being kept in a storage closet.<n><n>Option "E" (box) is implausible and should be eliminated. The context of the scenario implies that the box contained clothes and nothing else, suggesting that it is unlikely to contain the holiday decorations.<n><n>Thus, the most logical answer is C: loft<n><n>Input: The cat was in a box. The cat was in a tree. The cat was in the tree-box. The cat was in what? Choices:B: C: D: E: F:<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>Option "A: tree-box" (tree) is incorrect. As mentioned before, the cat was not in the tree-box, but was it, after climbing into it. Therefore, option B is the correct answer. The cat began in a box, and then climbed up the tree before heading back down. This sequence of events is what is referred to as the cat being in the tree-box (box), or simply "the tree." Because the sequence is not necessarily logical

Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where do almost all people live? Choices:  A: football stadium B: apartment C: surface of earth D: car show E: house<n>Output:		Reason<n><n>B:  Apartment = dwelling<n><n>The output shows the answer to the "Where do(es) almost all people live" question. The question is worded in a way which suggests that all people actually live in "apartments".<n><n>Apartments can also be regarded as the places people actually reside in. This would be the best-suited answer as it is the most pertinent to the question.<n><n>The other options are less suitable, as they focus on tangential aspects of housing (car show: A; football stadium: B; earth: C) rather than direct evidence pertaining to the question. Car show deals with sports, football stadium covers physical size, and earth refers to the natural environment as opposed to domesticated living quarters. These are thus all deemed incorrect.<n><n>The output then confirms these outcomes and leaves the listener assured his/her answer was correct.<n><n>Input: What did the robot do in the next room? Choices:  N: Nothing  A: Hacked into the server  B: Chose the most appropriate food  C: Took a nap  D: Screamed at me<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>Output: It's difficult to say that the robot took a nap (C) or screamed at you (D) at the next room, as this information remains unknown.<n><n>Output: If nothing (N) were done in the next room, one wouldn't expect a choice of options such as "Hacked into the server" (A) or "Screamed at me" (D). Therefore, option N: Nothing is the answer.<n><n>Input: Which of these statements is true? Choices: 1: I am lying. 2: This question is false. 3: I'll be back in five minutes. 4: Everything is OK.<n>Output: I am lying (A) This question is false (B)<n><n>Input: Who is your current employer? Choices:  C: JP Morgan Chase  O: Samsung  B: Starbucks  A: Citigroup  R: Morgan Stanley  N: Google A: Google O: Morgan Stanley A: Citigroup C: JP Morgan  Chase<n>### Explanation<n><n>Instead of showing you all the options for one question, it would be more

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What is another term for instituting civil action? Choices:  A: confusion B: complications C: riot D: arrest E: protests<n>Output:		Reasonings:<n><n>The first step is to understand what the scenario describes in terms of its literal meaning.<n><n>The first answer choices are: "confusion B" (B) and<n> "arrest E"(E). The context of the question describes an action in<n>which "civil action" is "institutionalized," which means a legal<n>action or procedure.  None of these options are relevant.<n><n>The next term to consider is "complications" (C), which fits the context and fits the definition of legal proceedings being "institutionalized." The legal procedure of arrest is a subset of such proceedings.<n><n>"Protests" (E) is a bit more ambiguous. This answer contains the word "protest," which suggests a reaction to something, such as a speech. On the one hand, legal proceedings are similar to protests in that they are a reaction. On the other hand, not every protest is a civil action instituted by legal proceedings. Legal proceedings can be instituted for any legal matter, not just protests.<n><n>So the final answer choice is "complications"<n><n>Input:What does the word "envisage" mean?Choices:  A: to predict B: plan for C: predict future D: look forward E: to plan<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>The first thing to note is that the word "envisagne" is not in the set of acceptable answers. This means that it is not correct to use "envisage" in place of "predict" or "predict future."<n><n>Now, let's analyze the remaining four possible answers<n><n>- Answer A (B) "envisage":<n><n>The best answer choice is "plan for" because the word<n>"envisage" refers to the ability to foresee or visualize something that will happen in the future. This could be done by planning for it or even predicting it.<n><n>- Answer C (D) "predict:"<n><n>"To predict" does not meet the criteria. The word "to plan" requires a future or forward motion, whereas "to predict " is a present-tense verb. The word "prediction" requires more than prediction; it requires a<n>degree of certainty that something will happen. So this phrase does not refer to just <n>a prediction but a "predictable"  outcome, which

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where would I put a rosebush if I did not have any containers to store it in? Choices:  A: flower garden B: garden center C: pot D: pot E: formal garden<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question states that you have a rosebush, but no containers. Logic dictates that you should put the rosebush in a container to store it. However, there are different kinds of containers and not all of them can hold a rosebush. The four options mentioned - pot, garden center, flower garden and formal garden -  are places where you might find container-like vessels to store plants, but the question asked was specifically for rose bushes. That leaves pot as the best answer, which can hold any type of plant and is specifically used to house them, thus making it the only place to place a rosebush if it doesn't have a container.<n><n>Input: When is the ideal time to schedule that meeting? Choices: A: when everybody on the team has an open schedule B: right after the last meeting C: after every Friday’s team happy hour D: never E: no time is better than the present <n>Output: Reasonings:<n><n>The option “never” is not in context with the rest of the options because that’s an extreme choice. The other choices involve scheduling appointments and events on a predetermined schedule, so that choice is invalid.  <n><n>“When everybody on the team has a open schedule” (B) is not a good answer because that suggests having the meeting when the whole team is not in the office. However, this is not reasonable because there is no need to wait for everybody in the office. “After last meeting” option (C) is also incorrect because that does not mean every team member has an open schedule.<n><n>“Right after the last meeting” (D) is also incorrect. Although it would be a reasonable choice and the best option if it was a meeting, it does not apply to the question because “meeting” and “scheduling appointment” are different things. Therefore, the correct answer is “after every Friday’s team happiness hour.” (E) because it is the perfect time to meet and discuss work matters.<n><n>Input: My boss asked me, "Can I get my weekly report in another day?" Choices: A: Definitely B: Definitely not C: Sure D: Okay E: That depends<n>Output: Reason or solution:<n><n>First of all, we have to know the meaning of 'another day'. 'Another day' refers to another day later than the current

Where would he go to get one? Choices:  A: glass of water B: build evenly C: garage D: carpenter's shop E: video game<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>Since Bob has access to other buildings where he can procure tools or lend support, the most probable answer is option B, "build evenly."<n><n>If the options were chosen to pertain to building a shelf, then answer D, "carpenter's shop" would be the correct answer.<n><n>For answers C, "garage" and E, "video game," the text mentions that Bob has a home, but since the context is to get a shelf, that is quite irrelevant, and does not necessarily have anything to do with a shelf.<n><n>Since the context explicitly specifies a shelve, the appropriate answer would be option B.

Choices:  - A: she drowns in a well - B: she has an argument with her sister - C: shes lost her mother - D: she has a fight with a fox - E: she marries a woodcutter<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>The correct answer here would be C, as it refers to the fact she had lost her mother. There was a time when a woman and her sister wanted to marry woodcutter brothers. Upon learning the brothers were to be sold, the sisters took it upon themselves to find the woodcutter brothers. In the end, the woodcutter brothers would not marry the sisters but would marry two women that were from other villages. <n><n>#### Instruction<n><n>Input: In Ancient Greece, which of these items would a Spartan boy have to carry? Choices: A-a spear and a shield B-honey and clover C-flour and raisins D-a sandwich and a water bottle E-a towel and a comb <n>Output: Reason<n><n>The item carried by a Spartan boy would be a spear and shield. The reason for this is because the items are related to the life the boys would live. The warrior in sparta would use his spear and shield. If he is a scout then his spear would not be with him. <n><n>#### Input<n>A: a spear and a shield<n>B: honey and clover<n>C: flour and raisins<n>D: a sandwich and a water bong<n>E: a towel and a comb<n><n>Output:<n><n>C:flour and raisin<n><n>A:spear and shield<n><n>Spartan boys carried what they would need to survive while on a journey. That includes food. <n><n>The choices are only food items, and only flour, raisin, water bottle, towel, and comb are related to food.<n><n>Furthermore, if the boy is the scout, the spear he will carry is gone, since scouts don't need to carry them as they are on a secret mission.<n><n>####

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where in your entrance hall can you keep you head wear? Choices:  A: school B: large home C: house D: hat rack E: closet<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>First, it is important to determine what type of room the question mentions. A "house" is more likely to contain a hallway or lobby, whereas a "school" is focused on education instead of housing.<n><n>The next step is to determine the significance of the objects in the question. If a hat (or another sort of headwear) is being kept in a hallway, likely, that hallway will be in someone's house. There is no reason a place in a school would be designated a "hallway" unless it was a hallway within someone's residence, not a school building.<n><n>As a general rule, the person who owns the room is the one who is most affected by the answer. In this case, that is the student, so it makes the most sense that he or she would be choosing where in a house to put the hat or other headwear.<n><n>Hence, option "A: school" (B) is eliminated. Next, the word "hat" is important. While the question refers to an entrance hall, the answer choice indicates that any headwear can be kept in that hall, not just hats. This indicates that the house might have both a hall and a closet (E) where the owner lives.<n><n>The last two choice options indicate that the options are either a school or a house. If there is a closet, then the choice should be "A: school" and not "E: closet". Hence the option that fits the question most precisely is option "D: house", which is consistent with the rule of choosing who is most affected by what.<n><n>### Ex 1

Choices:  A: bathroom B: walkway C: use D: hair salon E: drawer<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>As with the first problem, the first task is reading the statement contextually, to make sure you understand the question's intent. The answer to this question is not the exact location of curling irons, but the majority of places people keep them.<n><n>The first three options - "use," "bathroom," and "hair salon" (B, C, and D) - are not correct, because people do not tend to use their curling irons in these places. A curling iron is usually an appliance that is kept in its own dedicated drawer or in a makeup/beauty drawer next to other hair products. You are likely to see people setting their curling irons near their hairbrushes in hair drawers and not in their bathrooms or bedrooms.<n><n>The fourth option - a "drawer" (E) - is closer to the correct answer, in that it fits the context of hair care products, which are stored in drawers. The difference is that curling irons themselves are rarely stored in drawers but are instead stored in their own drawers or beauty drawers or in makeup and bathroom drawers.<n><n>The final option, "walkway," is the correct answer. It is not typical to see curling irons along walkways, but curling irons can be found in most other areas described, such as in bathroom storage areas and hair salons. Also, curling irons are often kept inside and not outside, as suggested by "walkway" (B).<n><n>So the answer must be walkway (E), which is the least likely location that curling irons are stored. The key takeaway is to make sure that your answer fits the question's contextual meaning.<n><n>Input:What is the capital of South Africa?

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What does a master carpenter use to put holes in objects? Choices:  A: drill B: learn C: require obedience D: understand E: spoon<n>Output:		<n>Reasoning:<n><n>Again, the first task is to deconstruct the question itself. The prompt states that a master carpenter uses a "spoon," which immediately calls into question all the other choices.<n><n>The options "drill" (A) and "require obedience" (C) make no sense in this context. A master carpenter would likely be familiar with drills, but would they use a drill to put holes in objects when a spoon is available? Similarly, the last option "understand," while it fits the context of the prompt, doesn't directly relate to the mechanics of putting holes in objects.<n><n>Thus, the only remaining options are "learn" (B) or "spoon" (E). <n><n>Both are plausible choices, but "learn" can be disregarded because it refers to the process of learning and doesn't necessarily align with the objective of putting holes in objects, especially if a spoon is available.<n><n>Thus the most straightforward answer is "spoon".<n><n>Input: How do you drive a nail straight. Choices:  A B C D E<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>Just like with the previous question, the first step is to carefully deconstruct the question to untangle the context.<n><n>The answer is "Drive A", which indicates that the correct answer is to use the correct tool.<n><n>Option "B", the "right hand," doesn't make a good answer because nails should be driven with the left hand, not the right.<n><n>Similarly, option "C", "correct", makes no sense because the answer isn't correctness but rather the use of a nail as the driving force.<n><n>Option "E", "forwards," doesn't make sense because nails are not actually driven forwards - they're driven downwards.<n><n>Thus "Drive A" is the answer because it aligns with the action of driving nails in the correct manner, in the most straightforward sense possible.<n><n>Input: What is the secret ingredient or formula behind a million dollar empire.

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results.

Option "hand lotion" might be related to hands but does not necessarily mean that it is a suitable option.<n><n>Based on these hints, the most logical answer to the question is "C: drug store". We can further deduce this by adding the context: "the answer choices are: A (bathroom), B (purse),", which further reinforces our deduction.<n>So the final is C: drug store<n><n>Input:I am not going out with you: ____. Choices:  A  B  C  D  E<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>A) It’s nice out today. - Not a suitable answer, since he is explicitly rejecting the idea of going out in the sun.<n><n>B) It’s raining outside. - Similarly, not a suitable answer.<n><n>C) It’s too hot outside. - Again, not suitable answer.<n><n>D) I have other plans. - This one’s a bit tricky because it’s almost a direct match with the text; however, it seems that in this situation, the speaker would be more likely to suggest an alternative activity.<n><n>E) I’m not interested. - The most direct of the answers, even though there was nothing in the text to suggest that the girl might not be interested in going out, in which case "I'm not interested" is also not a suitable answer. It would be a bit unfair for an AI to use this answer, given the subtleties of human conversation.<n><n>So the final answer would be D: I have other plans

(D) is a way to vote politically, and not an effective method whereby an individual can have a voice in their community. The others involve the individual doing something, either through demonstration (C), or direct action (A).<n><n>The purpose of this question is to ask for the "action" a person would prefer to perform in their society to affect positive change. The most appropriate answer is (C) "demonstration".<n>So the final answer B: Demonstration<n><n>Input:Which of the following should not be done to prevent global warming?

Choices:  A: were thirsty B: toasting C: getting drunk D: refreshment E: celebrating<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>When everybody raised a drink, they were clearly celebrating something, possibly a birthday or another special event. This eliminates option B (toasting) as an inaccurate answer.<n><n>Options C and D (to get drunk and refreshment) are also inaccurate because they don't capture the full context.  Option C suggests a person being drunk as a result of the event, but the question doesn't mention that at all.<n>Similarly, option D doesn't adequately express the full context, because it implies that people were refreshing themselves by drinking (rather than cheering and celebrating).<n><n>The final answer, option E, is most likely correct because it fits both the context and the action of people raising a drink. They were celebrating the event, and at the same time, they were having a drink as part of the celebration.<n><n>Input: What were the characters in the movie doing on one day?<n>        Choices: A: sleeping, going to work, getting married and studying B: sleeping, going home, going to work, studying C: sleeping, going back home, getting married, studying D: sleeping, going somewhere, getting married, studying E: sleeping, going from home, getting married, going home<n>Output: Reasonnion:<n><n>The characters in the movie did these things: Sleeping, Go back home, getting married and studies<n>As mentioned here, it was a day of the sleeping, going back to home, getting married and studying.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:John is getting something important.  What does this make him feel? Choices:  A: then have B: headaches C: stoic D: being happy E: wanting more<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n><n>The first task here is to understand the context and make inferences about what this information might entail.<n>Option "then have" (A) is not likely because "then" is a temporal word that points to the future. However, "have" would imply possession, which is not necessarily what this situation entails. Furthermore, the phrase "something to get" does not imply ownership, it is likely more likely to be the object of John's goal (e.g. "I'm getting my hair cut.")<n><n>Option "being happy" (E) is also unlikely because it does not accurately describe John's emotional state. Furthermore, John's feeling of happiness is not something he is acquiring, it's his current emotional state.<n><n>Option "wanting more" (D) may be an accurate description of his emotional state, but it is vague as to the source of that desire. Wanting more is not always a positive thing - it could mean he is yearning for more wealth, prestige, or power - so it isn't a particularly helpful option.<n><n>Option "stoic" (C) is another plausible answer, however, it's vague in that it doesn't provide insight into the source of his emotional state. This is further reinforced by his choice of clothing, which should provide a greater indication of his emotional state than simple silence. A "stoic" individual would be calm and collected, not silent and brooding like this character.<n><n>Therefore, the most accurate answer is the "stoic" option (C).<n>So the final answer to this question is C: stook.<n><n>Input: How can John’s friend help him? Choices: .  A: by going to bed together. .  B: by calling him. C: by going out for a drink with him.  D: by bringing him some food.

Choices:  A: advertisement B: magazine C: store D: web page E: bus<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first two options ("advertisement" and "magazine") clearly fail because he is outside of these two contexts, not stuck within them.<n><n>The next two options ("store" and "web page") both make sense insofar as he may be waving a sign for someone who wants to open a business or to sell a product to the public. But he wouldn't be "stuck" inside of a web page or a store; rather, he would be outside of that particular context.<n><n>The final option, "bus," is the only option that works. As "Dancing" suggests, he must be on top or next to a moving object in order to be "stuck" on it. The bus is a common, easy way to do just that.<n><n>So the final answer would be "bus"<n><n>Input: The man on the train platform was waving a flag, he is waiting for what? Choices: A: a plane B: a train C: a ship D: nothing but the wind E: a dog<n>Output: Reason<n><n>Once again, the first two options ("adrenaline" and "magazine,") fail to answer the prompt. <n><n>The next two ("ship" and "dog,") are both correct: these are possible things that he will wave the what until he sees an approaching.<n><n>The final answer would be "dog"<n>

They've taken to calling the character Daryl Dixon in the show, to get his infuriatingly vague responses to issues.<n><n>The options for this clue were clearly designed so as not to disclose the show. "Boot" (B) has little to no chance of being the final answer if you don't know what the clue is. Daryl isn't likely to refer to anything on his bodily extremities, like his ankles, in the slightest.<n><n>Similarly, Bread (C) is a possibility. But we know from the clue that the answer has nothing to do with what's happening on Daryl's feet.<n><n><n>Dry and cracked loaf (D) is entirely out of the question, because that wouldn't make sense. Daryl's boots are made from leather - so cracked loaves (bread) would be the least of his worries.<n><n>If you didn't already know the clue refers to boot, heels were the most obvious choice for what was cracked and dry - it's true of many feet, but most notably Daryl's, as he's often found in the desert, scrounging for food. And this was, indeed, the right answer.<n>So the final Answer is A: boot<n>

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:He had an index card he had to return, so where did he put it after finding the book he needed? Choices:  A: inside the book B: oral report C: library D: fileing cabnet E: card catalogue<n>Output:		Reason for answer(Why this option is right):<n><n>The choice  "inside the book" (A) is not an appropriate phrase to describe the card's return.<n>"Oral report" (B) is a generic term for communication, not a single action; moreover, a scientist isn't required to attend one.<n>"Library" (C) doesn't fit the context - the card isn't being returned to the library from its original owner, and he isn't leaving the library to seek it out.<n>"Filing cabinet" (D) isn't an appropriate action for the task at hand, because the card wasn't previously held in any sort of filing system.

That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where do I put my coffee mug after it's dry? Choices:  A: shelf B: desktop C: cabinet D: kitchen E: cupboard<n>Output:		Answer: <n><n>Answer: In this question, the context of the scenario gives the clearest clue as to which choice is correct. All the other options are irrelevant, which further rules out two options instantly: <n><n>"Cupboard" (F) is a word too broad to use as an exact answer to the question. The question states the coffee mug is "dry", not moist. Therefore, "shelf" (D) is not the right answer due to its association with moist.<n><n>Now, the only remaining options are: "Desk" (A), "Kitchen" (B), and "Cabinet" (C).<n>Option (A) is an uncommon choice, yet it's one possible answer if the person was looking to put the mug away somewhere out of sight. However, this particular answer is also vague as to where exactly the mug should go - would it be under the desk, or somewhere out of sight (e.g., in a different room) - so eliminate it.<n><n>Finally option (B) is the most accurate answer, as it indicates both where the mug is being kept and its exact location: "on the kitchen" (B). <n><n>So the final answer are: B: kitchen<n><n>Input: Can I take you out on a date tonight? Choices: A: No B: Why not? C: That would be wonderful D: No, thank you E: Yes<n>Output: Answer<n><n>Answer: In the given question, the choice of "no" (K) is the correct choice. The context of the question implies that the questioner is trying to get their crush on a date. This is obvious because of the word "out". This type of request has a negative meaning and not a positive one. Furthermore, the choice of "yes" (E) is not correct as it has too many variables. "Can I take you out on" is quite vague. If "you" is "sarah", then "Yes" won't make much sense but instead if "you" is a generic term, "Yes" makes sense. For example, when a girl is asked out on a date by a guy, if she does not like the guy, she may say yes out of politeness. In this case, she does not intend to date him as she may still have feelings for some other guy. In

Choices:  A: front door B: newspaper C: post office D: package E: mail box<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option A is out of the picture because "front door" is not the one through which people enter the building; it is the one through which they leave the building. <n><n>Option B is out because of the word "stolen", which cannot be true of something which has been delivered to someone.<n><n>Option C is the most logical answer because "mail" and "post office" are commonly used interchangeably. The "post office" therefore, is the place where one might find their mail, which in this case also happens to be deliveries.<n><n>Option D is incorrect because "packages" is plural. It might happen that one received one single package, but not multiple packages.<n>Option E is also incorrect because if one found their mailbox "open", then the mail would most likely by stolen anyway.<n><n>So the correct answer here should be C: post office.

Choices:  A: school building B: skyscraper C: business D: grocery store. E: work<n>Output:		Reason: The context of the question is specific to New York, where "a lot of offices" are mentioned. The options provide different types of buildings in New York - offices, schools, skyscrapers, and grocery stores. This implies that "a lot of offices in NewYork" are not necessarily in a skyscraper, so option C is incorrect since it states "a lot of offices are in skyscrapers". Therefore, the only logical answer that fits in the context of the question is "a lot of offices is in business", which is option D.<n><n>Input: What is the highest floor of a building in Japan called? Choices:  Japanese: Higashibashi A: first floor B: first floor C: first floor (higher) D: first floor E: first floor F: ground floor (lower) Answer: Reason:The first phrase of the passage, "The highest floor of a building is called shitagura..." provides the context that the highest floor of a Japanese building is a shitagura. Therefore, the only options that can be correct must be in relation to this phrase.<n><n>Option A does not align with the "highest floor" since "first floor" is not the highest floor of a shitagura/building in Japan.<n><n>Option B does not align with the phrase since "first floor (higher)" does not make much sense and also does not imply that there can possibly be more than a first floor. Similarly, Option C does not match since "first floor (lower)" is not a common phrase and does not imply that there could possibly be a higher floor.  Option D and E imply that there is no first floor, which is different from the context provided of a shitaguro, which implies that it must have a first floor which is the highest floor. Therefore, the only correct option according to the given context is Option F.<n><n>Input:How did the man feel when he got the news?

Choices:  A: think B: patent C: determined D: work hard E: relax<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n><n><n>The first task in solving this question is to eliminate all of the incorrect options. <n>Option B (think) is incorrect because while thought (and thinking) are obviously needed to bring about a change into reality, they are not the primary reason why. <n><n>Option C (determined) is not mentioned specifically, and seems like it may fit the bill as well. The answer lies somewhere outside the scope of options B and C. <n><n>Option D (work hard) also appears to be a reasonable answer. If he worked hard, then his outcome of bringing about a change into reality may also be considered determined. That said, this option is also too broad in scope.<n><n>The remaining option, E (relax), seems like it could be the correct answer as well. While it's unlikely the scientist used "relax" to describe his feelings towards the success of the lab experiment, it could be a valid answer. Yet, it doesn't meet the criteria and is eliminated.<n><n>The final answer choice is option E.<n><n>#######Instruction:What is the next letter in this series?<n>Input:395 3064 2239 849  -1 456<n>Output:<n><n><n><n><n>Reason:<n><n>The first step in figuring out the answer is to recognize that each number in the sequence is less than one number from the previous number in the sequence. Therefore, the last number should not be less than a negative number-3. According to the rules for the sequence, then the next number in the sequence should be greater than -3.<n><n>To find this number, let's look at numbers that would result in an outcome less than -3. Let's start with -2. In this instance, inverting -2 so that it is greater than 3 would yield 5. However, this is not valid since 5 is neither in this sequence or one number from the preceding number in the sequence. The answer must be 3, since it is the only number in the sequence that results in a negative number. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is 53.<n><n><n><n>####### Instruction:You're planning a holiday to a  different part of the UK.

Choices:  A: lot of grief B: depression C: no spouse D: lose money E: children suffer<n>Output:		Reasoning: <n><n>From the question itself, we can gather this is a spouse-based relationship. The scenario is that a couple is getting divorced and we're asked what would be a negative effect on both spouses. So that would eliminate B) depression because each spouse might become depressed. D) lose money because that will be a financial loss only. <n>Now that's not the question, so we can eliminate these. We don't wanna think that it doesn't apply to children which would be C) children suffer. So C) and D) are out as options.<n><n>In fact, answer choice B) is ruled out because people's emotions such as grief do not affect another person unless they are in a relationship with that person. Children may be upset that their parents are getting divorced, but they won't become depressed. Parents may lose their children's respect following the divorce, but that isn't a negative effect on children. It's a negative aspect of a relationship.<n><n>The only remaining option is E) children suffer because they would be upset about their parents getting divorced. This is the correct answer.<n><n>Input:The doctor has ordered one milliliter of the medicine per day. However, the pharmacy has already delivered ten milliliters of medicine.

Choices:  A. 1 milliliter B. 10 milliliters C. 9 milliliters D. 100 milliliters E. 20 milliliters<n>Output:Reason: <n><n>Now the most rational options would be A: one milliliter as it is right in the question. There is always an option that is the correct answer. However, the answer is not the obvious option. The obvious option would be 10 because 10ml is 10 ml but that's not necessarily the correct one.<n><n>Now the answer you want is 10. The doctor will not prescribe more than 10 milliliter per day. So he will not give the patient more than 10Ml. <n>The reason how to answer this question is what I mean by the question doesn't mean all the answer choices are right.

The options indicate the possible uses of the reading: a love of mars and an interest in going to Mars are both possible options, while reading and learning are both educational intentions.<n><n>Next, we need to narrow down our options to the possibility of the person pursuing the interest in any way. This can be done through the process of elimination, which shows us that the person does not necessarily have to be interested in going to mars itself, as the action of "zooming" to mars is different from the action of going there.<n><n>The final question of the person being able to reach mars is the most important. All the other options are inapplicable to the situation, so the final choice is: E: The possibility of going to another planet. So the final answer is E

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where can you store a small notepad on your person? Choices:  A: back pocket B: meeting C: drug store D: home E: school<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Let's take a look at each of these four choices and see which could be a good reason for storing a notepad on your "person."<n>Option A, "back pocket" (A), wouldn't be logical. The pocket is a compartment for storing small items, but a notepad would likely be too bulky to fit in there. This is especially evident if the notepad is large as well.<n>Option B, "meeting" (B), is a little more promising. But remember that the word "person" is meant to indicate a human; this option would only be applicable if the notepad belonged to a chair or a table. <n>Option C, "drug store" (C), is certainly one of the more plausible choices, but it's still a little vague. The "drug" store refers to a pharmacy or another type of store where people buy prescription medications and other healthcare products, not a grocery store, as this word might imply. <n>Option E, "school" (E), provides no clue as to why the notepad would be stored on someone's person. It's possible that it could be used to jot down notes during class periods, but even then the notepad might have to stay in the classroom where notes are typically taken.<n><n>Option D, "home" (D), is a little more descriptive than other options. The notepad would likely stay in someone's home. But there are still several specific scenarios that could justify storing a notepad at home. It may be used to store phone numbers before going out for the evening or to prepare for meetings or appointments. <n><n>Ultimately, the most logical option is Option D, "home" which, in the scientific context of this question, refers to a human residence. The notepad is likely intended for use at home.

Choices:  A: get angry B: concern C: worrie D: education E: learning about world<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first thing that must be determined is the reason one would read a newspaper in the first place. <n><n>Option "Get angry" (A) doesn't seem to be a logical reason for buying and reading a local newspaper.<n><n>Options "Worrie" (C) and "concern" (B) are closely related, both describing feelings of anxiousness or worry. Still, the primary purpose of buying and reading a newspaper is to know more about what's going on in one's community. This would give the reader less reason to "worrie" or "concern" about world events. <n><n>The reason why one would buy and read a paper is to learn about what's happening to one's community. Option "Education" (E) fits this description as well.<n><n>So the final answer would be either E: education or C: worrie<n>Input: What did the person feel about the new movie she saw?

Choices:  A: erections B: entertainment C: boredom D: get fat E: sadness<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option A (erections) is incorrect because there isn't enough information given to establish whether it's possible to get erections while watching tv.<n>Option B (entertainment) is incorrect because watching tv isn't just about being entertained. People watch tv for many reasons, and being entertained is only one of them. <n><n>Option C (boredom) is incorrect because it's not necessary to watch tv in order to be bored. There are many other ways to be bored, such as sitting around doing nothing or sleeping.<n>Option D (get fat) is incorrect because the question isn't about getting fat per se, but the effects of watching tv. In other words, the answer isn't about the direct consequence of watching tv, but the indirect ones (i.e., getting fat).<n>Option E (sadness) is incorrect because it would take someone a little crazy to watch TV and get sad at the same time. <n>So the final answer to the question is E: sadness<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question the sentence is posing.<n><n>Input: If all the men and women at the office wanted to take part of the holiday party, what do we expect? Choices:  a: more guests b: same number of guests as before the invitees cancelled c: fewer people d:  everyone at the office party last year will show up<n>Output: Reason<n><n>Option A (more guests) is incorrect because the way the sentence is phrased implies that the office is trying to keep the number of guests low, which would not make sense if you wanted everyone to show up.<n>Option B (same number of guests as before) is incorrect because it is possible someone refused an invitation and thus the office would expect less people at the office party.<n><n>Option C (fewer guests) is incorrect because they are trying to keep the number low, which would mean even less people would be expected.<n><n>So the final answer would be D: Everyone at the office party last years will show up<n>### Instruction Answer this question.<n><n>Input : I see him because he's not here.

Choices:  A: rock band B: sea of japan C: sushi restaurant D: fish market E: atlantic ocean<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>Similar to the first question, this one requires us to think about the context and the situation as given to us.<n><n>For instance, it's not realistic for the blowfish to be in the middle of a rock band, since band members should be able to hold instruments, while blowfish typically only eat plants, not perform in front of crowds.<n><n>Similarly, the blowfish wouldn't be found in the Sea of Japan, because it's a different ocean, one located on another continent.<n><n>The blowfish would not be found in a sushi restaurant, because of its preference for plants, not fish.<n><n>The blowfin would be sold at a fish market in the Carolina's. This is obvious from the context. The blowfish was in fact found off the coast of the Carolinas in the first place, so it stands to reason that the fish would be sold at a market in that area.<n>So the correct answer is D: fish market.<n><n>Input: What is an apples favorite meal?

Choices:  A: rural area B: big city C: suburbs D: ohio E: countryside<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The choice B: big city (A) makes the most sense. The question clearly indicates that large villages are likely to be located in "big cities." This choice is supported by research which shows that many large cities around the world have well-established village areas. (1)<n><n>The choice E: country (A) is unlikely to contain villages. This answer is further supported by research showing that rural areas are typically not developed to accommodate large villages. (2)<n><n>The choice C: Suburbs (A) is unlikely as well. Villages mostly reside in rural areas and are usually not located near big cities or suburbs. This makes choosing C: the suburbs (A) the least likely answer. In summary, we can determine that the most likely choice is B: big city (C).<n><n>In conclusion, the answer is B: big cities, which makes most sense and also has statistical support.<n><n>Input: What is the most effective way to prevent insects from invading your garden? Choices: 		 A: Plant flowers. B: Use insecticide. C: Grow tomatoes. D: Grow potatoes. E: Get a dog<n>Output: Reason<n><n>The answer to this question is either D: Grow potatos (A) or E: Get a dog (C). Both options are equally plausible and logical, and can both be supported by the context of the question that states a gardener's goal is to prevent insects from "invading" their garden.<n><n>Option C: "Grow tomatoes" (A) is clearly a viable choice since tomatoes are a type of vegetable. However, the question is more specific in mentioning potatoes instead of vegetables, indicating that potatoes would be more effective than tomatoes at preventing insect invasion due to their unique properties.<n><n>Option B: "Use insecticide" (D) is a plausible choice since the word "insect" is within the question. However, the question still does not specify whether insects are an insecticide's target, making it less effective than option D: "Grow potatos".<n><n>Option E: "Get a dog" (C) is logical for the same reasons as option B: "Use insectice" since insects would be the dog's target as opposed to the gardener. However

Choices:  A: rain forest B: research laboratory C: cage D: treetops E: south africa<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n>The input is talking about a certain behaviour, for instance. When a monkey is taken from its home, it is often brought to a place where people wear white lab coats. Therefore, the most probable and plausible reason for this behavioural change is for scientific purposes, as a lab is where scientists work. Furthermore, "treetops" (B) doesn't fit the scenario, as it is unlikely that a monkey would be taken to a place of treetops after being removed from its home.<n><n>Moreover, "research laboratory" (C) is the correct answer, as it is the most plausible place where a monkey would be brought for scientific purposes after being taken from its home. It is also the most direct and specific answer, as it clearly states what the monkey is being taken to.<n><n>Input:I have a feeling that you have a better understanding of quantum mechanics than I do as I have not done extensive study in it. Choices:  no clue A: a lot of knowledge B: partial knowledge C: comprehensive knowledge D: little knowledge E: good grasp<n>Output:Reason:<n>The input is asking whether the speaker, a teacher, has a better understanding of a subject than the listener, a student. The question is comparing their knowledge of a subject (i.e. quantum mechanics). As the speaker is not familiar with quantum mechanics, we can eliminate all the options except option C.<n><n>Moreover as we have determined the main purpose of the question is to see who has a better understanding, from the options available only options with "knowledge" were possible options. This is one more reason to eliminate option A. Option A can mean knowledge or familiarity with someone (e.g. you have been around for long). Therefore option E is not a possible option (it does not mean good understanding, just good or thorough understanding).<n><n>Option B says "partial knowledge", which means good but not full understanding. As the speaker has not studied the field extensively, she will not have full familiarity with quantum mechanics. There are some concepts, which will be new to her and which would require a lot of study. Therefore option B is not a possible option<n><n>Reasoning:<n><n>Option D says "little knowledge". In this case, it will not amount to full study, just study and good understanding. We know the subject is not

But the question focuses on how people traditionally get information.<n><n>Books are not normally the source of information for a large population. We can see that the options in the multiple choice question are not exclusive. This means, the right answer may be among the given options, in any of the given choices, in any order.<n><n>From the given options, meeting with people, glancing at the television or reading newspapers seem more suitable among the given options by the context. <n>Therefore, the right answer to this question is A: meeting. <n><n>### Input: The person is working on a report, which should include both a description of A: the process of B: the situation A: process B: situation<n>Output:Reason for option A/ B/ C<n><n>The Question is A/B/C<n><n>A: The process of<n><n>B: The situation<n><n>This is a grammar question<n>C: is incorrect here, it is a general instruction.<n><n>In the given 2 choice questions, the given options A and B are a general instruction (A) and another choice which is a description on 1 thing (B)<n><n>Both choices are grammatically correct and similar, with one difference.<n><n>In choice A, there is use of Article/Determiner and subject - verb agreement is correct and in choice B, subject - verb agreement is good but there is no article/Determiner used.<n><n>Input: In which country/continent is it traditionally believed that the Chinese will have to ____ their fortune in order to become wealthy? Choices: 1: earn 2: buy 3: sell 4: build 5: keep<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>Correct Ans: B: Buy<n>The first question is asking us to pick the one among 5 which is the correct answer.<n><n>Here the question states that in traditional china, the Chinese have to earn their fortune to become wealthy. But the choices do not reflect it. All choices are either about to sell or to keep. So, the correct answer is that in traditional China they have to buy their fortune to become wealth.<n><n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Lizards need the sun's heat to regulate their body temperature, this is why you'll see them still on what? Choices:  A: bushes B: dessert C: books D: heat lamps E: rocks<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n><n><n>The second task is to understand the purpose behind the scientist actions.<n><n>option "to regulate their body temperature" (A) describes the lizards' need for sunlight, not why the scientist might observe them still on the rocks after being moved there. The need and purpose are two different things.<n><n>Option "bush" (B) doesn't work either, as there's no mention of being moved from bushes.<n><n>Ditto for "heat lamps" (D) - this is something the scientist does, not what he's observing lizards doing!<n><n>Option "books" (C) is absurd, so it's certainly not the correct answer.<n><n>That leaves just "rocks" (E), which gives the correct context and sense of purpose behind the action. <n><n>So the final answer here is E: rocks<n><n>Input:The scientist had analyzed the data and concluded the results were positive. what kind of people did the scientist expect to receive the news to? Choices:  B: friends and family C: politicians D: scientist E: people with headache<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>The third task is to identify the results that will be reported to whom.<n><n>Only some of the options given are the results - and the rest are the people expected to receive the news.<n><n>The option "friends and family" (B) is in the appropriate context, but it indicates the scientist is reporting his own results, which we understand isn't the case.<n><n>Option "politicians" (C) is in the wrong context. The scientist would report such results to scientists who study the effects of headache on people's lives.<n><n>The option scientist (D), along with "people with headache" (E) both fail to provide the correct context and purpose behind the actions, making their options invalid choices.<n><n>The only other option that makes sense here is "scientists who study the effects on people with headache" (B).<n><n>This line of logic is best explained with a classic example of a woman having a headache. <n>If she needs to report this phenomenon to a medical professional, she will first be concerned about the impact of having a headache on herself, and subsequently on the people around her.<n><n>So the correct

Choices:  A: hiding B: accidentally C: expectation D: knowingly E: planned<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>The first step is to understand the scenario and the context of the question, which clarifies what the correct answer should mean.  Option "hiding" (A) is a possible answer but implies that George knew he shouldn't tell his wife the news (i.e. he didn't accidentally spill the beans). If the answer is truly the one George was hoping for, he wouldn't be aware it was the right answer until he was told.<n><n>The next step is to clarify the intentions of his wife and determine how she could have been surprised.  Option "accidentally" (B) doesn't describe the scenario because it implies that George knowingly spilled the beans.<n><n>Option "expectation" (C) can't be the intended answer because it would mean that George is just making excuses. He knows there weren't any expectations to ruin, and he does so on purpose.<n><n>Option "knowingly" (D) doesn't apply because it is a logical fallacy. To "knowingly" ruin something implies that George set out to ruin it.<n><n>Lastly, option "planned" (E) doesn't answer the original question. It wouldn't indicate how George ruined the surprise but rather what George's purpose was in ruining the surprise.<n><n>So the final answer will be B: accidentally<n><n>

Choices:  A: body of water B: lake superior C: underwater D: toilet E: aquarium<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>In this particular question, it's important to understand the meaning behind the phrase "spend the majority of their time." The key is to interpret "spend" as used in its literal meaning, rather than adopting a figurative interpretation. <n><n>If one assumes that spending the majority of their time under a water means spending a long period of time there, then that interpretation seems to fit the correct answer, aquarium (E) - it is presumably underwater and has been described as "the majority" of these fish's time. <n><n>On the other hand, if one assumes that spending their time underwater means going to school there, as suggested by the answer choice "body of school" (A), then that answer doesn't fit the meaning of the question at all.<n><n>Similarly, "where do fish go to work" (F) is also irrelevant to the meaning of the question. Only one other answer - toilet (D) - fits. <n><n>Finally, "where do fish spend their leisure time" (G) is an uncommon answer to a question that doesn't state what kind of time it is. Answer choice G is not a correct answer. <n><n>Input: Which of this following is not a vegetable? Choices: A) Squash C) Corn B) Rice D) Watermelon E) Pepper<n>Output: Rationale:<n><n>The question states that there are 6 vegetables, but not all of them are specified as such. From this, it's logical to assume that one of the mentioned options is not a vegetable. <n><n>Focusing on the answer choice "squash" (C), the next thing to consider is knowing what vegetables are. This brings us to two important keywords:<n><n>Squash, pepper, and rice are all root vegetables, and pepper and rice are also considered spices. Therefore, they aren't in the category of vegetables, but rather fruits, spices, and other miscellaneous food types.<n><n>The other option under consideration is "Corn" (B). It's not a vegetable that most people would associate with, especially since it's one of the main commodities in industrial agriculture. However, corn is actually a fruit, so as long as a person knows this and can differenti

Looking at the options, "paint" (E) is highly unlikely because that action wouldn't please her parents.<n><n>Even though "eat out" (C) is a possible activity, it's not as likely a reason for a gathering as to "host" (A) or "entertain" (D).<n><n>Thus, the purpose of the host, in this case, is to entertain her friends and not her parents.<n><n>That leaves us with options: (A) or (D).

Choices:  A: french government B: friend's house C: zoo D: south africa E: madagascar<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Looking at the context and vocabulary being used, it's clear that this is a circus-related situation. We can deduce that only the first four options are relevant, and the circus-specific vocabulary ("circus," "monkey," "madagascar," and "french") can be eliminated.<n><n>Next, the key phrase here is "work in" the zoo, which suggests the monkey is not working for its own goodwill but rather as an employee. Of all the relevant answer options, the most obvious choice is "zoo" (C). The other options do not match the context, such as "friend's house" (B), "government" (A), or "south africa" (D), all of which would seem unlikely to hire a monkey as an employee.<n><n>Finally it is not clear on "work in the zoo" is literal, I think it's symbolism and he is talking about surrender, and not literal. <n><n>Output:<n>Reason:<n><n>Look at the question, there is an obvious problem. The answer is not a name place, in fact, even in a zoo that circus would be called animal show/ circus, not a zoo. This is not a correct answer. The same for the circus monkey that works in the friendship house. That is not a place that house, and the conductor wouldn't even say these things.<n><n>The final 2 questions,<n>A: what does the conductor tell him next?<n>C: tell the monkey<n>

Choices:  A: learn about subject B: learn new C: find truth D: is bliss E: judge<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Once all of this has been done, the question should have narrowed down to "learn more about" or "find truth".<n>Therefore, "learn about subject" (A) would be wrong, and "judge" (E) is vague.<n>Similarly, "find truth" (D) would not make sense as no one said anything about seeking truth in this question.<n><n>The only other option left, "learn new" (B), would technically be correct, but it is too vague as to what exactly is being taught. To give more clarity, we can narrow down the option to focus on whether it is the "wrong answer", or "the wrong" answer.<n>The latter would be accurate and would be the correct answer.<n><n>Therefore, the final answer is B: learn new<n><n>Input: The two-state solution which means that each state could operate independently of any control or influence from other has which part of the word two-state solution?

We can see this information from the wording and sentence structure. That eliminates option <n><n>Option A. This is a common mistake many people make when using the question prompt.<n><n>Then, consider option B. Fort Knox (where the US holds their gold reserves) doesn't need to be the "strategic gold reserve", as that is a more general term referring to the US government's holding of gold.  That eliminates the option <n><n>Now the most likely answer is Fort Knox. The last two options, while seemingly correct, don't provide direct confirmation to what the correct answer is.

Choices:  A: cupboard B: oven C: grocery store D: pantry E: cellar<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The key here is to focus on the question's context and purpose. In the scenario, the kitchen is being updated and the sink replaced, which suggests that the new sink is to be installed above an existing location where canned food is stored. It would make little sense to store canned food next to the sink when the old sink is still in use, so the correct answer is "cupboard" (A). Any other option is irrelevant because there is no mention of what's happening to the existing sink, so it doesn't play a role in the new design.<n><n>Input:Why is it important for children to know how the human body works?

This means that understanding the answer is necessary to determine the correct response, which may in turn help solve the problem.<n><n>We can use this logic to select the answer from options "A" (Health), "C" (Development) and "E" (Development). However, out of these three, the word "support" in answer "A" and "development" in answer "B" are similar to each other. Further examining the other answer choices will help determine a more viable answer.<n><n>Option "B" (Aid) contains a similar word to option "D" (Assist). However option "D" has more words than option "E" (Growing up). Further examining the other choice will help identify a more viable answer that will be more specific to the question.<n><n>Option "D" is similar to option "A" (Healing). However it has more words than option (E) (Health). As we have eliminated option (E) and option (A), we are left with option (D).<n><n>As we have eliminated option "A", we know "A" contains the word "assistance" and "D" does not. We can therefore eliminate these two options from the other choice.<n><n>Now we are left with option "D" because it is the only option that is left. Option "D" will get us to the correct response

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where is a road known as a motorway? Choices:  A: scotland B: europe C: race track D: new jersey E: england<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>This question is a classic example of British vs. American English differences. In American English, the term "motorway" refers to a large, limited-access highway that allows traffic to move quickly and efficiently. In British English, however, the term "moterway" is more commonly associated with a public road, not a controlled highway.<n><n>This question tests whether or not you are familiar with the context of the word "motorway" and how it is used in different areas. Option C (race track) is irrelevant, as it doesn't pertain to the context of the question or the purpose of using "motorway." Options A and D are too general and don't offer specific information about where motorways are located.<n><n>The remaining options provide the correct regions. Option B (Europe) is incorrect because motorways are not limited to European countries. Option E (England), the first choice made by the examinee, is also incorrect because motorways may be found in countries outside of England.<n><n>However, option A (Scotland) is correct, as motorways are commonly found in the country of Scotland.<n><n>Input: Which letter does not belong in this list: A: M B: X C: A D: X E: B F: M<n>Output:Reasonning:<n><n>Option A is M and doesn't belong in this list, because M is the first letter of alphabet.<n><n>Input:What does a lion have that a person does not have? Choices: 	A: claws B: patience C: wings D: fears E: teeth F: strength<n>Output:Reasonining:<n><n>Option C (wings) is irrelevant. Option E (teeth) is incorrect as people do have teeth.<n><n>Option A (claws) does not fit well, as claws are most often associated with felines. Therefore, only option B (patience) is correct. Option B (patience) doesn't make sense because people can be patient.<n><n>Option F (strength) does not fit because if a person is strong, he/she could defend against a lion.<n><n>As a result, only option B (Patience) is the correct answer.<n><n>Input: What goes in front of the? Choices:<n><n>A: A man B: B C: D C: X D: XX E

Choices:  A: disengenious B: human C: weird D: kind E: stupid<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Option (C) is easily eliminated. Nothing in the question description suggests anything about a "weird" person. <n><n>Options (A) and (D) can be eliminated as they are inappropriate for the scenario. The question asks us to describe a person's traits; "ingenuous" does not mean to emanate "disingenuousness." And it's not likely that we'd describe a person as an "awkward" or "stupid." <n><n>Option (B) can also be eliminated, because it's a very generic description that doesn't mention anything significant about a person.<n><n>There's one final choice, however: (E). This answer specifically refers to someone's nature, as opposed to his/her actions through time. It would be appropriate to compare a person's characteristics to the term "kind."<n><n>So the final answer would be E: kind.<n><n>Input:Which of the following is true about people who are creative in their writing? Choices: 	 A: always imaginative B: frequently clever C: often original D: rarely boring E: never predictable<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>This question follows a similar pattern to option (A): we've been asked to describe a certain phenomenon (which creative writers have) and must evaluate which choice in each category corresponds perfectly.<n><n>We're expected to say that creative writers, by definition, are imaginative, original, and have a variety of perspectives on the world. <n><n>Of the options listed, (A), (C) and (E) are eliminated by virtue of being redundant. They don't contain any new information not mentioned in the description, (C) and (D) are eliminated as they're just plain wrong. We don't expect a writer to be uninteresting, predictable, or boring.<n><n>Only one option could be the correct choice: (D), which stands as the most complete answer of them all.<n><n>Input:A company employee recently was reprimanded for making a mistake in inventory. Reason for reprimand: 	 A: she was slow B: she missed a dead line C: she lost a customer D: she was unreliable E: she was too casual<n>Output:Reason

It could indicate several different emotions, each of which are relevant in their own way. However, the most central idea behind this answer choice is "curiosity" (A). <n><n>Thus, the final answer would be A: curiosity<n><n>Input: Which of the following choices represents the most extreme kind of anxiety? Choices:   A: panic B: severe fear C: a general feeling of unease D: being restless and agitated E: extreme stress<n>Output: Reason<n><n>This question is a good example of a "distorted meaning" style question, where the choice that seems most obvious and logical at first glance turns out to be incorrect.<n><n>The most obvious answer is "panic", but it is actually the LEAST extreme kind of anxiety. Panic can occur in conjunction with other forms of anxiety (including depression, severe fatigue, post-traumatic stress disorder, etc.), but it does not signify a general feeling of uneasiness. <n><n>In the context of this question, the word "extreme" means to characterize the intensity of anxiety as the strongest possible.

Choices:  A: deaths B: get arrested C: moving D: using gas E: may die<n>Output:		Reasoning:In order to understand the scenario, it is important to analyze the options to determine which are relevant and which are not. Relevant options are those that relate to the outcome of being hit by a car. Options that relate to a car accident, such as death or an arrest, would be relevant.  However, options that do not relate to a car accident or injury, such as "moving", are not relevant. Relevant options for a car accident will be A (deaths), B (get arrested), and even C (moving) as these options can lead to injury and subsequent death.<n>The most correct answer is "D: using gas" because it is not a car accident so it is irrelevant to me

Choices:  A: pleasant thoughts B: overspending C: moving there D: staying there E: debt<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>As always, the first task is to clearly define the terms. In this case, the term "to love" implies the existence of strong affinity, which is usually associated with being emotionally attached to some place.<n><n>The second task is to narrow down the type of action people take as a response to their feelings. From "pleasant thoughts" (B) to "staying" (D), the four options provided each represent different types of responses to a location, but none of them quite capture the full scope of what's needed to be done.<n><n>Option "moving there" (C) is a plausible response to a place one loves - someone could see the beauty of a certain location and want to move there to live or vacation there regularly. However, it is not the only type of action people take. They could also just visit the location, "overspend" (B) there, or even get "debt" (E) as a result.<n><n>Finally Option "to love" (E) describes a strong emotional attachment to a location, often as a result of experiencing it in the past. But it doesn't necessarily mean one wants to spend a lot of time or even live there. Therefore, this option fits the context of the question nicely.<n>So the final option is E: Debt

Choices:  A: fresh fruit B: wine press C: fruit basket D: fruit cocktail E: picnic basket<n>Output:		Reason to be choosen: Option Fruit basket A :  The term "for" can usually indicate an action being performed in the future, and here we have "one" chopping a grape.<n><n>Option For a fruit press B : We do not have an extra noun, so we cannot use the preposition for. <n><n>Option Fruit cocktail C : This is the correct choice because there is no reason to be here.  We need a fruit salad, but it's also clear that a fruit salad is not what's being referred to here.<n><n>Option Fruit salad D : A fruit salad will usually contain many kinds of fruit. While "a" would mean the fruit is one type, "one" in the word for would suggest there is more than one fruit in a fruit salad.<n><n>Option Fresh fruit E : Although the fruit will be fresh, the word fresh can be used as many other fruits as there are in the fruit basket. <n><n>Therefore, answer choice Fruit basket is the best choice.<n>

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:James was a student who had a report that is due tomorrow.  Where might he spend most of his time today? Choices:  A: university B: college class C: class room D: classroom E: library<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Since the report is due tomorrow, he may spend most of his time in a library if he wants to find suitable information. On the other hand, if he were studying in a college class, he might not have the appropriate books to do research. <n><n>Since the answer is (E), the most accurate answer would be spending the majority of his time in the library.<n><n>Input:A boy's teacher asked him if he would like to bring lunch or buy lunch. What should he do? Choices:  a. bring lunch b. Buy lunch c. bring lunch and buy lunch d. bring it and buy e. buy lunch and bring it<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>If the boy's teacher asked the boy to bring his lunch, that means that (A) and (B) should not be his choices.  On the other hand, since (D) and (E) are incorrect, he needs to buy lunch.<n><n>Hence the correct answer to the question (C): Bring it and buy it (Option (D))<n><n>Input: The old man walked for a long time. Finally, he entered a store and bought some apples.  When the old man left the store, he said "I'm going to buy apples and walk back."  Then he said "Now I am going to buy apples."  What is he doing? Choices: 1 A: He bought apples and walked the store. 2 B: He bought apples. 3 C: He bought apples from the store. 4 D: He bought apples in the store. 5 E: He bought apples again.<n>Output:Reason :<n><n>The situation described in options (1) and (2) is actually incorrect.  Based on our knowledge that he walks for a long time in the morning, and then he enters the store and bought apples, it indicates that he bought apples before he walks in the morning. This means we should eliminate options (1) and  (2)<n><n>When we think about the situation in options (3) and (4), the only thing that makes sense is that, the old man first bought apples from the shop but then came back to ask the shopkeeper what other vegetables besides apples were on sale.  Therefore, these two answers are plaus

Choices:  A: dairy farm B: texas C: building D: michigan E: florida<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>For (A), we're not going to find a steakhouse in the "South," so dairy farm would not be a logical choice. (B), if there is anything in the South other than a steakhouse, then it can't be the "better-than-anywhere steakhouse," since it is "the best" and therefore, the only place that would provide one. (C) and (D) are impossible, since "outside" implies that James would have to go somewhere else. Finally, if (E) is correct, then James would be outside of the South--or outside of Florida, where "the South" is located. Thus, (F) is the correct answer.<n><n>Input:How many different words can be formed using the letters c, f, g, and o?<n>Choice: A: two B: three C: four D: five E: six<n>Output: Answer:<n><n>There are five words in this example. They are <n>*coffee<n>*fog<n>*foggy<n>*fogfish<n>*cog<n><n>So the number of words is 5, which is greater than 4, and hence, Answer is - D.<n><n>

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Utensils are used during what evening activity? Choices:  A: backpack B: closet C: drawer D: dinner E: cupboard<n>Output:		Reason:<n>Answer:<n>The question asks for one specific evening activity, so option "dinner" (D) is off the table. <n>Options "backpack" (A), "clothes closet" (B), "cupboard" (C) and even "drawer" (E) are all generic terms that can refer to multiple activities. The key here is the context that tells us what sort of activity is involved.<n><n>In this case, we can deduce the type of activity from the word "utensils" (F). These would typically be used when preparing food and beverages. The most immediate activity that comes to mind is dinner - cooking food, eating dinner, cleaning up after the meal - all of these activities would involve the use of utensils.<n><n>For these reasons, we can confidently conclude that the correct answer is "dinner" (E). <n><n>Input: Which is closest to the color brown? Choices:  a: green b: red c: white d: yellow e: blue<n>Output: Reason/Explanation:<n>Answer: A<n>For context, the question contains some information about the color “brown”, such as its description (“darker than yellow”). The question then asks us which color is closest to “brown”. It therefore cannot be a color closer to red (b or d), as it would be a color that is purer than brown and therefore not the closest to the description. That leaves green, yellow, white, blue and one unknown color (a). But it is unlikely that none of these colors would be described as “darker than yellow.”<n><n>Since it is most likely that only one of these color is darker than yellow and therefore closest to brown, that can be our choice. The colors green and blue are lighter than yellow, so if any of these two colors were chosen, red would have to be described as the darkest. By eliminating these two colors, we are left with the choices yellow and white.<n><n>Input: What season is it currently? Choices:  Spring Summer Fall winter<n>Output: Reason and Explanation:<n>Answer:-<n>The question asks us to chose what season it currently is (from a given list of four). The question does say it to the given list of four "seasons", it says seasons that occur at certain times of the year. In this

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The friends loved competing against one another, it was a good way to work their what? Choices:  A: friendship B: aggression C: defeat D: winning or losing E: sweat<n>Output:		 Reasoning:<n>The first task is identify what kind of competition is involved.  There are four main types of competition possible: friend, aggression, defeat, and winning or losing. In this instance, because one friend competes against another, it's important to note the type of competition and which friend competed against another friend. "Winning or losing" (D) is the most likely; however, it is possible that they are playing aggressively against one another too.<n>Since the friends are competing, the second step is to find out why.  "Competing" implies an element of competition, but one doesn't need to compete to engage in any of the three other options - that is, one can socialize without competing, and vice versa.<n>"Winning or losing" could mean the competitive type of competition (since winning or losing is competing), but it's more helpful to find out what the friends are competing for.<n><n>The next piece of information to gather is what they're competing to know.  Aside from winning or losing, the friends could be competing in order to know something.<n>"To know" implies knowing what, where, or how.  The friend could be competing to be the first to know something, in which case "what" (B) would be the correct response.  They could also be competing to know how to do something, such as which is which (A) between two dishes, or what causes something (C) to occur.<n>Finally, the friends could be engaging in a friendly competition.<n>The answer that most directly fits these criteria is B: what.<n><n>Input:Their competitiveness is a source of what to most people? Choices: 	 A: healthy fun B: fear C: discontentment D: envy E: stress<n>Output:  Reasons:<n><n>There are five sources of competitiveness, and most people aren't aware of how stressing competitiveness can be, so the answer must be either stressful or fun [A,B]. If you pick stressful, you need to find what is most stressful to most people.<n>There are three stressfulnesses of competitiveness: mental, emotional and behavioral, and physical. Out of these only mental is the cause of anxiety, the most anxiety inducing mental state.

Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What do customers do in a store? Choices:  A: hunt B: pay merchants with money C: mail orders D: spend money E: demand satisfaction<n>Output:		Reason:<n>Choices A and B are eliminated because they're not typical customer behaviours that you'd see in a typical store. Similarly, choice C is removed because customers aren't likely to mail orders to stores.<n><n>The remaining choices are either somewhat inaccurate or just plain too vague. Answer E fails to highlight the importance of customer satisfaction in shopping, as it doesn't explicitly mention it. Choice B is not always true even if the customer is spending money as they can still leave without any satisfaction.<n><n>Of course, there are also customers who actually spend money and leave in a negative mood. To simplify the task at hand, I'll interpret this statement as referring to customers with positive attitudes. <n><n>It can then be rephrased as 'Do customers spend money or leave a store satisfied?' and the answer, given by choice D, would be 'Spend money'. Thus, this would be a valid answer to the original question as well. But for the sake of brevity, I'll stick to my original choice, D.<n><n>So the answer would be D spending money.<n><n>Input: A clown had died. What does an undertaker do?  Choices:  A. Buries B. Makes fun C. Prepares D. Celebrate E. None other<n>Output: Reason :<n>Answer A, burying the dead clown, doesn't make sense as the undertaker's job would be to prepare for the funeral. In fact, he/she may often find themselves in charge of organising it.<n><n>Choices B, C and D are also unconventional choices, particularly choice C,'making fun', which is clearly out of a funeral context. Choices A, B and D, on the other hand, can be eliminated because they violate the given premise of the question. Choices A, C and D can be eliminated because no undertaker in their right mind would ever celebrate the death of a loved one.<n><n>This leaves us with option E, which is also a possibility. Thus, none of these four choices could be appropriate responses to the original question. As a final clarification, I'll state that an undertaker should, ideally, do all of the aforementioned tasks for a funeral, including organising it. But for the

Choices:  A: airplane B: ship's hold C: boat D: truck E: train<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Analyzing the context of the question, the answer should take into account the "small cargo" constraint. If "small cargo" is to be considered as of any significant value, the only suitable mode of transportation would be a ship.<n><n>Option "airplane" (A) is not suitable because an airliner is much too large to accommodate small cargo.<n><n>The remaining choice, "ship's hold," is the fastest way for transport the cargo at an above average price. Ships are able to travel at a high speed, which means transporting through it will take only minutes, if not seconds, to complete.<n><n>Therefore, the correct answer is "ship's hold" (B).<n><n>Input: A t-statistics is what? Choices: A: a normal distribution used for calculating z-scores B: a measure of sample size C: a comparison of probability and confidence D: a number used to find whether two values differ E: a tool used to figure out the significance of a variable <n>Output:<n><n>The first part of reasoning is recognizing the function of the t-statistic.  A t-statistic is a number calculated to compare the probability that a random sample from a population has a value greater than a threshold, or the difference between two values. It is used in the process of determining  if the observations are significantly different between two groups (for example, a treatment group with a certain drug has a lower rate of diarrhea compared to a placebo group).<n><n>Option "D: a number used to figure out the statistical significance" (D) is very close to what a t-statistic is used for. However, the phrase "the probability that a random sample" is missing, as the purpose of the t-statistics is to compare the probability of a value greater than or equal to a certain value. <n><n>The other choices are not accurate.<n><n>Option "E: a tool utilized to determine if there are differences in the mean" (E) is a poor answer, since a t-statistic has other functions besides determining if two means are different.<n><n>Option "C: a metric showing the number of samples used in a study" (C) is not accurate, because a t-statistic measures only the difference in average values between two groups. Option "A:  a normal distribution used for figure out

Choices:  A: meet people B: meet friend C: make people laugh D: socialize E: liquor<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>Option A, B and C are irrelevant: they simply express how to make friends and socialize, and that has very little to do with loneliness. Option D is also useless: socializing is not necessarily going to make someone feel less lonely.<n>Liquor isn't actually a "useful activity" (E). It may dampen feelings of loneliness temporarily, but it won't really help a person get better.<n>That leaves us with answers A and B. They both suggest meeting people, but A says we need "people" specifically, whereas B is more general.<n>A refers to a person we are trying to establish a friendship with, whereas B refers to our acquaintances like colleagues and friends. In short, if A is correct, then we need a prospective friend. If B is correct, then we just need any kind of relationship.<n>Option B (make people laugh) would actually suggest that we aren't lonely in the first place, so that's a dead end.<n>That leaves us A, which is the correct answer. Meeting people would bring more meaning to our lives and help us fight feeling lonely. Meeting people, on the other hand, isn't helpful and won't do much to remedy loneliness, but if we are experiencing loneliness, it's best to be practical, and this is a useful activity.<n><n>Input: Why does alcohol affect people's body differently? Choices:  * A: They are different in height * B: They are different in metabolism C: They use alcohol in different ways * D: They have different ages E: They have different habits<n>Output: Reasonnig:<n><n>From this statement, we can tell that we are looking for an explanation why people's body respond differently when alcohol is consumed. This leads us to eliminate options A, B and E, because they only provide statements with reasons why people's body can respond differently, without explaining the effects of alcohol consumption.<n><n>This leaves us with options C and D because they both suggest that there are reasons why body responses to alcohol differ. <n><n>Options' descriptions suggest reasons, but they don't actually help us choose a better one. However, option D (They have different ages) is not specific enough, which is why it won't be accepted by the question

From here, it is not difficult to determine that the correct answer is "trunk" (A), as old clothes may be found in a trunk. However, this does not answer the question in the most appropriate way, as it does not emphasize the specific context of the question - "old clothing". The most appropriate answer would be "old clothes" (C), as this specifically answers the question and also indicates that the clothes are likely to be found inside a "trunk" (B).

What might he do to get away from them? Choices:  A: come home B: airplane C: learn from each other D: go out E: make art<n>Output:		Reason:<n>The context of the situation suggests that Sam is frustrated with the people he has met while travelling due to one or more reasons - perhaps their behavior was rude, or he felt that their attitudes towards others were offensive.<n><n>Option "come home" suggests that Sam would return home to get away from these people, but it does not provide any explanation for what exactly would be different when he is home. <n><n>"Go out" refers to taking action in the physical world, such as leaving the house or going on a new adventure, but without considering any specific details about what Sam might do once he is out.<n><n>Option "Learn from each other" implies that this strategy involves interacting with the people he has encountered, and this could perhaps be beneficial in some way if done correctly. This is why option B is a strong contender.<n><n>However, option D does not necessarily relate to the travel experience and seems more general than the other options, making it less likely to be what Sam might actually want to do.<n><n>Option E could mean many different things, and it is not specific enough to determine whether or not it relates to what Sam might want to do in order to get away from these individuals. For these reasons, option E has limited potential as what Sam might actually want or do.<n><n>In conclusion, based on the context of the problem as well as Sam's travel experience itself, option B or B is the best answer choice. "Going out" in this context could mean exploring nature or meeting other people on the road, which is something Sam presumably knows how to do already. Instead it would have more potential to help him get away from these negative influences if he could "learn from" them while he's out there and be able to take those lessons with him when comes home.<n><n><n><n>Input:How did the boy pay? Choice: A: A credit card B: Cash C: Cheque D: Online E: Gift card<n>Output: Reason<n>Choice A:  A credit card is a specific type of payment that involves transferring funds directly from the consumer's credit card account to the merchant's account. This is often used when the cost is relatively large and it would be impractical or inconvenient to pay cash or through a check (Cash).<n>Choice B:  Cash is a specific form of payment in

Phrase Substitution<n><n>In logic reasoning, the phrase substitution method is a technique for finding the most direct logical solution to a problem. This process involves replacing one or more phrases in a sentence with other phrases that are identical in structure but have a different meaning. The use of phrase substitution can help identify if a given sentence is true or false. <n><n># 3. Adjusting Statement<n><n>The word "however" in a sentence represents an opposing point of view and should be used with caution when describing an argument. By adjusting statements so they are in agreement with the argument, the context of the statement can be changed. Changing statements so they support another person's point of view is a good way to improve an argument.<n><n># 4. Splitting Statement<n><n>Statement splitting is a common method used in logic reasoning to determine if a sentence is true or false under certain circumstances. Statement splitting involves dividing complex sentences into smaller fragments to make them more manageable and easier to evaluate. This method allows for the identification of any errors or inconsistencies that may occur when evaluating the statement, resulting in a more detailed and thorough analysis. <n><n># Questions 5,6,7,8

Choices:  A: entertainment B: neat C: happy D: intoxicating E: illegal<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option A: entertainment (bags provide convenience for transporting or storing cannabis, allowing it to be used as a form of entertainment - watching movies, playing music, etc). However, this answer is likely to be more relevant in a non-government controlled region or a region that permits the recreational use of cannabis.<n><n>Option B: neat (bags are often used to organize and store small amounts of marijuana - for example, placing them in a cabinet or drawer for quick access)<n><n>Option C: happy (bags can be used to mask the smell of marijuana - making it easier to keep it hidden from the authorities, allowing it to be smoked in public more openly.)<n><n>Option D: intoxicating (bags are often filled with cannabis to avoid drawing attention to their contents - providing a subtle approach for individuals to intoxicate themselves.<n><n>Option E: illegal ( bags are often used to conceal or transport illegal substances, therefore increasing the likelihood of being caught using them.)<n><n><n><n>While these are potential reasons and they are related to the actual answer, the scenario suggests that the individual in question is "intoxicating" it without fear as he's "on the road to his place and cannabis is illegal in that place." It is safe to say that it is in fact illegal as a conclusion.<n><n>Therefore, the final answer is D: intoxicating<n><n><n><n><n><n># Answer: Choice D: intoxicating

Choices:  A: revealing information B: being ridiculed C: problems D: more funding E: telling all<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option "revealing information" (A) does not make sense in this context. While a company may go public in order to publicly share certain details about their operation or financial standing, that would not explain why a company would go public.<n><n>Option "more funding" (E) is also inconsistent with the idea of "going public." While companies do seek to generate more capital through an initial public offering (IPO), that is not the primary motivation for a company to go public per se. Going public also involves potential costs and drawbacks, such as increased regulatory requirements, greater scrutiny from shareholders, and restrictions on the freedom to manage the company's operations.<n><n>Option "being ridiculed" (B) is not a significant reason for a company to go to public. Even if negative press coverage is an important factor for a company to consider, going public would not necessarily have any effect on it.<n><n>Option "telling all" (D) is not a realistic or practical scenario for a company to go through. It is not likely that a company would publicize private information or reveal insider information without proper authorization and approval from the relevant parties.<n>So the final option is E: telling all<n><n>Input: Which of the following can cause a vehicle to swerve off of the road?

Choices:  A: medicine cabinet B: medicine chest C: armpits D: grocery store E: kitchen<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Let's break this question down into two parts:<n>1. What goes into the medicine cabinet?<n>2. What is the intended use of a medicine cabinet?<n>The first part of this question asks what goes into the medicine cabinet, or, what items should be kept inside the cabinet. The answer: *deodorant*.<n>This is true because the word "but" in this sentence means to bring the subject back to one original topic. We were originally answering about what we would put inside the medicine cabinet, so "but" reverts us back to that question.<n><n>The second part of this question relates to its intended use. This second section specifically refers to groceries, an item that goes into the kitchen, not the medicine cabinet.<n><n>In conclusion, the answer to this question is a combination of Part One and Two. <n><n>The correct answer, therefore, is D: grocery items.<n><n>Input:What is the name of this dog? Choices:  a) Pup or b) pooch or c) mutt or d) hound or e) hound dog or f) chow<n>Output: Reason for correct:<n><n>Let' a'<n><n>Since the question reads "the name of this dog" we can start by breaking the sentence into two parts. First, we must identify the noun in this sentence. The sentence has some kind of relation to a dog. To find the noun, we must look for a word that can function as a noun in place of "this dog". The correct answer is "dog."<n>To get to the correct answer, we must look out for words/phrases that cannot function grammatically or as a noun phrase:<n><n>Pup, pooch, mutt, hound, hound dog, chow<n><n>Notice that these all have some relation to a dog, but they do not work grammatically as a word that can replace "dog."<n><n>"Mutt" refers to a breed of dog with many ancestries that does not possess a breed. <n><n>"Hound" refers to a breeding/lineage of dog. <n><n>"Chow" refers to a name associated with a specific type of dog.<n><n>Therefore, the only choices that work grammatically and as a noun are pup, pooch, and mutt, which can be ruled out because pup

Choices:  A: restorand B: wedding party C: church basement D: corridor E: restaurant<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Here, we must first assess the context of the question - in this scenario, the question is asking about people attending a reception.<n><n>Option A, "restorand," is out of place as the center table at a reception does not typically accommodate just one individual. Option D, "restaurant," is also out of place considering the fact that the central table at a restaurant is typically occupied by the wait staff or the restaurant manager.<n><n>Option B, "wedding party," is not mentioned in the description of the table's location; it is not specified how many people would sit at this table. Therefore, it is out of place as a possible response to the question.<n><n>The remaining options should be eliminated on the basis of wording. "Church basement" (C) is too vague; it could refer to any number of places inside or outside a church, and does not correspond to the description of the table given in the question. Option E, "corridor," is also out of scope with the description.<n><n>Finally option "corridor" (C) is the final answer. Corridor would be the location in which a reception is held based on the description of the table in the question.<n><n>Input:(Situation). In order to avoid misunderstandings, the owner of the house decided to make an announcement.Choices:  A: the new owners B: new tenants C: new residents D: the new neighbors E: new home<n>Output: Reasonable explanation:<n><n>The goal of the question is to determine the identity of the "new" party in question. <n><n>Option D, "new neighbors," is ruled out because the "new owners" do not live "next door."<n>Option B, "new tenants," is also out of the question of the questions context. The scenario does not mention that any tenants recently moved in or out of the house.<n><n>However, option "the new owners" is a possible response. The scenario states that the owner of the house is the "new party" - this suggests that the owner is the "new" addition in this context.<n><n>Option E, "the new home," is also incorrect because it is not stated that a "new house" was built.<n><n>Therefore the final answer is A: the new owner.<n><n>Output: (Situ

Options D and E are eliminated because they are outside the context of the question, and because each includes the term "waterfalls," which doesn't logically apply to the ocean. There is only one correct answer, so the correct answer is B: underwater<n><n>Input:There are at least 15,000 stars in the milky way galaxy? Choices: 	A: false B: false C: true D: false E: true<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>Review the number of stars in our galaxy: 150 billion. That number comes from a calculation of 100 billion galaxies in the universe, and the galactic ratio of 1:10 in which most large galaxies have 10 smaller satellites.<n><n>This rounds to ~150 billion for the average galaxy, and our Milky Way Galaxy is the "average" sized galaxy.<n><n>Input:"How much money does an average american family spend every year?" Choices: 		A: more than $6000 B: more than $3700 C: $1870 D: About $2700 E: less than $2000<n>Output: Reasoner:<n><n>The yearly spending on an average american family is about $5,800, as per this report. This, therefore, eliminates options B, C, and D. The options A and E have no scientific or research-based backup.<n><n>Input:The world would run out of drinking water?

Choices:  a. Aphotic bee b. African bug c. Zimbabwe d. Cape Town e. South African<n>Output: Reason<n><n>The answer to the question is Aphotic bee. Here are some things to keep in mind:<n><n>1. Insects are living organisms that are classified based on their characteristics and behavior. Insects can be classified into two groups:<n><n>- Insects that do not have wings: e.g. cockroaches, mosquitoes, flies, silverfish etc.<n><n>- Insect that have wings: e. g. bees, dragonflies, butterflies, moths etc.<n><n><n>2. Aphotic bees are wingless insects that are only found in Africa. Cape town is a city in South Africa. Thus, option A and D are incorrect.<n><n>3. Option E is incorrect because of two reasons. First, African insects can only be found in South Africa. Second, it is a noun and should not be capitalised.<n><n>4. Option B is incorrect because it refers to an African bug, which is incorrect as this be it an insect or something else.<n><n>The answer is most likely b, but it can be a.<n>

Choices:  A: conference B: theater C: building D: floor E: church<n>Output:		Reasoning: The first step is to determine what scenario this question is setting up. We can see that different objects are involved: "a lot of chairs," "the same direction," "a room," "sit in." <n><n>The next thing to do is to come up with relevant objects that could be related to these details.<n>In this case, the objects include: a conference, theater, and church. But it is not very likely that one would find such chairs at a theater or a church, so we can rule those choices out.<n>It then becomes clear that the best choice is conference, because that is the only location in this situation where multiple people could sit and watch an object sitting in the same direction.<n>There is no need to analyze the other objects for more information. Therefore, "conference" (A) is the answer to the question.

Choices:  A: candy store B: butcher shop C: kitchen D: auto repair shop E: post office<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question asks about where kids can buy treats, so any store that sells those kinds of treats would be a feasible answer. But the question specifically says "over a counter," and only places with tellers or counters would be available for business if one wanted to buy things on a counter.<n><n>Candy stores (B) do not sell over a counter, only via online orders. Butcher shops (C) are not available for business at all, since all the meat they sell is cut to order. Therefore, the only viable answers are a kitchen or repair shop (D). However, neither of these options fulfill the condition for buying things over a counter. <n><n>The only reasonable answer, then, is E: post office, which also happens to be the only answer with a physical, on-site counterside which could accommodate kids buying things over a cashier.

Choices:  A : "with" B : "from"  C : "within" D : "using"<n>Output: Reason<n><n>The word "by" means "used for." For example, we use pencils by writing with them. We use telephones to communicate with others. We use computers to log in to the Internet and by extension, to surf the Internet. But we also have to understand that while "used for" or "used in the process of" implies that something can be used without, this does not apply universally to all meanings of the word "by."<n><n>The word "from" can also mean "used for" but not necessarily. It can mean originating from a source, such as "By the way, I bought this pen from a dollar store. " If you were on the moon during a full lunar eclipse, you would say "I see a red moon by the light of the full moon." These examples show that we can use the word with or without, and it does not necessarily imply that an entity can only exist with another.<n><n>The term "within" means contained within or included in, as in, "I'm going to the store to shop for groceries and pick up some gifts for the holidays.

Therefore,their actions most likely involve simply directing traffic.<n><n>The next task involves understanding the action the police officer has taken.<n>Option "book robber" (A) doesn't fit because while this action may involve police booking a driver who drove impatiently, it's not directly associated with drivers being waved on. <n><n>Option "he had a word with the car" (B) may have made since if there are two drivers to be dealt with. but since it's stated that "he waved on the car", then in this case it's clearly a single driver.<n><n>Option "believe guilty " (C) may sound plausible as a word to the driver. However, the given scenario says nothing about whether or not the driver was guilty.<n><n>The final option, "direct traffic" (E) is the most accurate choice. This option fits in perfectly with the scenario - the police officers are seen directing traffic, and impending that to happen, they're clearly "directing" drivers.

Choices:  A: sit down B: make mistakes C: have sex D: reproduce E: excrete<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Humans would sit down and rest their legs when they feel they are tired.<n>Sex and reproducing are unlikely to be something that humans would do, especially if they say they are tired.<n>Humans would have excretion and urinate to get rid of the waste.<n>The best option is to "sit down" which is correct.<n><n>Output:<n><n>How many countries have won the Olympic gold medals in at least one of the eight winter events in all Olympic Winter Games? Choices: 1):  A: 8 B: 9 C: 10 D:9 E: 12<n>Output: Choice: A<n><n>How many countries (in total) have won the Olympic gold medal in at least 1 of the 8 Winter Games event?<n><n>Let's consider the following event, in a previous Olympic Winter Games<n><n>GOLF: 29-32<n>SWIMMING: 24-30<n>BOWLING 89-78<n>ROCK CLIMBING 35-10<n>HORSESHOES 15-10<n>SNOWBOARDER 15-12<n>WHIPPLE 15-8<n>SKELETON 99-62<n>CROSS COUNT 96-109<n><n>Answer: At least 1 of the gold medals out of the 11 events will be<n>At least 1 medal in each of the 8 events.

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where is disease often spread but shouldn't be? Choices:  A: ghost town B: third world country C: human body D: rug E: hospital<n>Output:		reasoning:<n><n>The first thing that's important to note is what's being inferred is a location where disease is spread. This means that the answer to the question doesn't have to be a location or "place" in the physical sense, and so can be a bodily function or system such as the human body.<n><n>The phrase "often spread" refers to the prevalence of the disease. While it may be possible that some people are always exposed to a disease (i.e., they live in a third+ world country), generally, people are exposed to disease when they go places, through interactions, or physical contact.<n><n>Therefore, the answer to the riddle would depend on contextual facts and circumstances. For example, if an earthquake strikes a country and creates an immeasurable level of trauma among its people, they are certainly "human bodies" that are exposed to disease through trauma.<n><n>This explanation of the riddle is made even more interesting in that fact that the answer is "human body" (D). Given the context, the most likely interpretation of this phrase would be the one I originally mentioned: the prevalence of disease in the human body.<n>In other words, what happens to your body is not controlled by you.<n><n>So the answer would be D: human body.<n><n>Input: Why did the man go into hiding? The more people learned about him, the more attention his actions received. Choices:  A. Because he was in fear that they would find him; he had something to hide. B. Because he wanted to find out who the people really are. C. He didn't want to talk about anything because he felt that everyone in town knew him. D. Because of the secrets he carried. E. He wanted to find a place where nobody knew anything about him.<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>If we look at the options, there are several ways to interpret the meaning of the phrase "go into hiding".<n><n>Option A says "because he had something to hide." If there's something to hide, the person would be doing it out of fear.<n><n>Option B says "Because he wanted to find out what the people really are." This doesn't seem to apply. A person wouldn't go into hiding if they want to learn more about themselves.<n><n>Option C says "He didn't want to know about

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where is a snake likely to reside? Choices:  A: tropics B: nightmare C: wyoming D: bushes E: feild<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n>The questions asks about the snake's residence. Option A: tropics eliminates the wrong answer choices of B: "nightmare". C: "wyoming", and D: wyoming. "wyoming" would eliminate that location. Therefore we know that "wyoming" wouldn't be a likely choice for the snake to reside in.<n>Another thing to note here is that A: "tropics" is the first place the question says "where is a snake likely...?" - that can be helpful to know.<n>With the given options, the answer is C: "bushes." The snake would not likely live in "wyoming" nor "wyoming" due to the tropical theme of the original question. The correct option, "bushes", follows that logic.<n>Input:The question is:Is the word "Saturday" missing in the paragraph?<n>Choices:  A: Saturday's B: Saturday C: Saturday's D: Saturday  E: Saturday or Sunday<n> Output:Reasoning: You must first read the paragraph. This question is not specific - it could be that "Saturday" is removed or there could not be "Saturday." Once you fully read the paragraph, then look at your choices to figure out what is true.<n> Choices "Saturday's" and "Saturday's and Sunday's" do not have any words in them that are not the same words, as the question asks. So the choices are "A: Saturday", "D: Saturday" and "E: Friday."<n> The question could say "Missing words: Friday and Saturday", which would make the answer choices be "A: Friday" and "E: Saturday".<n> Input: If the last digit of a phone number is 2, what is the 6th digit of the number? Choices:  a) 24 b) 14 c) 26 d) 16 e) 20<n> Output:Reasonig: This can be solved by plugging in values, but a more logical approach is to note how the number is formed.<n> Above is the phone number given - the question wants to know which 6th digit is. With this, we know 1 is in the 6th spot since we know what 6th digit we are looking for. For the first digit, there is

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where would you hear a viola along side many other string and brass instruments? Choices:  A: symphony B: band C: create music D: orchestra E: string quartet<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Again, the scenario is designed in such a way that the question only asks about context, so it should not be interpreted as asking for any of the options given directly. It is more specific about what specific activity a viola can be found in. This leaves only four options, three of which are not very likely if we are to presume that you will only hear an instrument like the viola being played alongside string and brass-instruments, as the question implies.<n><n>The first option is "symphony" (A). Symphony is a genre that features orchestras. This option is therefore not appropriate for this question in and of itself. Although a viola is an 'orchestral' instrument, to say it can be heard alongside, string and brass instruments in a symphony, is misguided.<n><n>The option "string quartet" (E)! is a subsection of an orchestra, and not the entirety of an orchestra which a question suggests, therefore not really correct<n><n>The fifth option is "band" (C). Bands feature brass instruments, such as trumpets and saxophones. The question only asked for any other instrument in the string and brass categories, therefore this option is also excluded as incorrect.<n><n>The correct answer then is the last option "orchestra" (D)!, as this is the only option to cover any string and brass instrument.<n><n>So the final answer Is D: orchestra<n><n>Input: There are over 5000 miles of paved roads in United States. Which country has more paved roads? Choices:  Choices A: United States B: Canada C: China D: Mexico E: no other country<n>Output:Reasoni:<n>This is a question that really tests your math skills. The answer is A: United States. In fact, there are 6,941,195 miles of paved roads. And this is because the United States has a larger area than China and the United State is larger than Canada<n><n>Input:Where can many of us turn off our lights, or at least leave off the television? Choices:  B: bedroom C: living room D: kitchen E: dining room<n>Output: Reasonings:<n><n>This is another straightforward question that does not require much interpretation, since the options provided are the only rooms in a

Choices:  A: soccer game B: fairgrounds C: movie theatre D: countryside E: state park<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n> <n>The scenario explicitly states that the person is noticing the popcorn and cotton candy, suggesting that they are present on the grass.<n><n>For Option B, the scenario states that there is cotton candy present on the grass, while the scenario does not mention popcorn. This eliminates this outcome.<n>Option C mentions "movies" and "theater", so the outcome would be a cinema. However, the scenario states that "state parks" are nearby, which indicates that this place would not be a movie theater. Therefore, this option is not a suitable outcome.<n>Option D mentions "fields" and does not include "popcorn and cotton candies". <n>Option E mentions "the fairgrounds", so the outcome would likely be this place. <n>So the final outcome is E: state parks

While some humans may have feet on their head, it is not a common occurrence. This option does not fit the context of the question which asks about all humans.<n><n>B: Two ears: <n>The second option, “two ears," is correct as it describes a feature shared among all humans. Humans, regardless of their origin, have two ears that are positioned externally and are utilized for hearing. This answer is an exact match to the intended meaning of the question, making it the correct solution.<n><n>C: Horns:<n>Corns are growths of dense, hardened tissue that are often found on an animal's head and are usually used for protection.

Choices: <n>A: I'm going to die. <n>B: It's a bad sign. <n>C: It's broken. <n>D: It's a mistake. <n>E: It shouldn't be there. <n><n>Output: Reason<n><n>The red light may be a sign of an impending danger or a life-threatening situation.<n>However, the other options don't fit the context, such as "I'm going to die" (A) and "mistake" (D).<n>Options B and E also don't make sense, as they describe an abstract concept or a logical fallacy.<n><n>Option C is the most appropriate choice because "broken" suggests technical failure,<n>which could be the source of the red light.<n><n>Input: Do you know any Japanese? Choices:  If none, you will know now. B If yes, you will know tomorrow. C I will find it for you. <n>Output: Reason for your answer<n><n>There is no need to know Japanese because the statement "if none, you will know" has the answer already. But one is supposed to be fluent in Japanese or at least have basic knowledge of it because "if yes, you will know" means that one is supposed to be proficient in Japanese. But if one is proficient, the other party will inform the person in the very next day.<n><n>Input:What is happening from A: <n>Choice 1: No news at all B: A good news C: A small news D: A bad news E: A big news<n><n>Output: Why A small news is considered a bad news<n><n>It is said that a small news is considered a good news as it will not have any effect on an ordinary man unless the news is about a celebrity

Choices:  A: michigan B: stable C: race track D: farm yard E: arizona<n>Output:		 Reasoning:<n>The clue lies in its last two letters: "r.e." Horse-relevant is the logical answer to a horse question. Therefore, based on the given facts, the only possible answer is "stable" (B). If it lived in a stable, it was probably from the state of Michigan, although it's not a given, so "Arizona" (E) is eliminated.<n>Stable is also a race-track, so "C" is incorrect. But "D" could be correct because a farm yard is a possible home for horses, though a stable is the only confirmed home for horses that the question has mentioned, so "E" is eliminated again.<n>"A" is incorrect for the same reason: horses do not live in Michigan.<n>So the final option to choose is stable (B)<n><n>Input: An airplane has just flown from Miami, Florida to Dallas, Texas. The plane lands in Houston, Texas and then another plane takes the passengers to Dallas. Choices:  A. There's no need for the second plane; people from Miami are already in Dallas B.

Choices:  A: talk B: read book C: play piano D: study book E: study engineering<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first thing to look at is whether the option provided is correct contextually. As a student, it would obviously be likely to sit in front of a piano when studying a book about piano, particularly if one were studying to become an engineer. This eliminates D and E.<n>In addition, you need to identify which option most closely matches the next line of the question, "What is a student about *to* do". Given this context, it is immediately clear that B, D, and E can be eliminated, leaving just A, C and especially B. The options that require time or resources to perform are all eliminated, leaving just the answer options that the student can perform without any time or resources. Option A, about reading a book, requires resources because it mentions a book, so it can't match the context of the question - it is not about to do, but reading a book currently. Option B, which says a student is about to play piano, perfectly fits the question, as the phrase the student is about do refers to the student currently being ready to play piano and performing the task.<n>Now the only option left to solve the problem is to know the purpose of the student sitting in front of the keys, and the answer is 'play piano'. <n>So the final answer to this question is option B.<n><n>Input:An automated system needs to understand the context of a text to know if the text is talking about a human. What is the most likely feature of context that this system is looking at to determine context? <n>Choices:  A: grammar B: punctuation C: spelling D: emotion<n>Output: Reason<n><n>The sentence is not straightforward. In fact, the contextual clue is "needs to understand...to know if" that the sentence is about to provide more information, not just a simple grammatical hint.<n><n>Looking at the options, B refers to grammar, but that is clearly the last option. D refers to emotions, but this is clearly not what the question is referring to.<n><n>C and A both refer to spelling and punctuation. Spelling is not the same as grammar or punctuation. The sentences have the same meaning even though there are spelling errors. These are not the same issue.<n><n>Only choice C is a grammatical hint about context, which, since it refers to both grammar and spelling, is exactly

Choices:  A: house B: den C: family room D: wood E: floor<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first thing to notice is that the options provide a pretty clear framework for a logical argument. Each of the choices (except E) specifies what the chair should be placed on, followed by what the object that the chair is resting on is called.<n>For instance, in B, the object the chair is resting is called the den, but the choice itself is not den, but rather a more general and common term for the room, family room. <n><n>This provides a good insight into the overall structure of the question. The argument is that each of the choices includes a denouncement (the object on which the chair is sitting) and a general word (the type of room). But there is a catch. Option E, the floor, violates these rules. <n>While the floor is the generic term for the type of object the chair is placed on, the denouncement of the floor is missing. Instead, the denouncement, wood, is the specific material that the floor is made of. <n><n>Therefore, the choice "floor" (E) must be thrown out, because it violates the structure of the question. A, B, and D each have a general denouncement that provides an appropriate framework for the question. C is also acceptable, as it is more generalized than E, but not as specific as A or B.

Choices:  A: pub B: restaurants C: in a park D: supermarket E: chemistry lab<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The clue provided by the answer choices here is that the items need to be purchased on Amazon. As such, the chemistry lab (E) is a poor answer - while some products may be used in the lab, this is not one of them. Similarly, the supermarket (D) may sell these items, but it is still unlikely for the same reason.<n><n>Option "pub" (B) is clearly the wrong answer due to a different meaning of pub. This is further supported by the fact that the items will be found "in America." This hints to the shopping experience in the United States, and not somewhere in the United Kingdom or another locale.<n><n>The same idea applies to the restaurant, or item B (C), which is a poor answer choice since restaurants serve food. The items required in the question are much more associated with scientific use in comparison.<n><n>The correct answer is thus B: in Amazon<n><n>Input: Which of the following is a non-profit organization that aims to promote science awareness and education? Choices: 1: A; ACS 2: B; Science is Elementary 3: C; I'm A Scientist 4: D; Science & the City<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>We can answer this question by ruling out the incorrect choices. For option C, "I'm A Scientist" (3) is not a non-profit or charity organization at all, and therefore the answer has to be some other one of the remaining two options.<n><n>For option D "Science and the City," similarly while this may exist as a name or a program, this is not a standalone organization but rather its a program by which to promote other non-profits like those mentioned in this question. As such, the answer can't be D.<n><n>Option 1 "ACS" (1) is clearly incorrect because it isn't a standalone name of an organization.<n><n>Option 2 "Science is Elementary" (2) also fails to be a standalone organization as it's only a charity organization and not a specific name of such an organization.<n><n>Therefore, the correct answer is 1: A; American Chemical Society<n><n>Input: Which substance is added to a fire to help it burn?

Choices:  A: fridge B: limejuice C: square D: gym E: refrigerator<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Let us take each of option A-E separately to understand the correct option:<n><n>A) Fridge: The answer doesn't specify any juice bar. "A fridge" is too broad for the answer option. The answer should be a specific place name like "Limejuice" (B) or "Square" (D).<n><n>B) Limejuice: "Limejuice's" is an example of a juice bar, since it is the same business that appears in option D. This answer choice is most likely correct. <n><n>C) Square: "Square" isn't a specific juice bar, either. It doesn't make sense that you could "get in shape" and drink at a place called "Square." This isn't really an answer at all.<n><n>D) Gym: "The Gym" doesn't make sense when paired with the other answer options in the list. It is unlikely that you would visit a gym specifically to gain in shape at a particular juice bar. <n><n>E) Refrigerator: "Refrigerator" doesn't make any grammatical sense in the context of the sentence. It might be a juice bar or it might not. You don't drink juice from a refrigerator.<n><n>So the final answer to this problem is B: Limejuice.<n><n>###Instruction: The question was:What's the best way to keep out of debt?<n><n>Input: Reasoning: First, the question requires us to determine what is the best way to eliminate debt.<n>But the answer requires the removal of the word "debt," instead of reducing or getting rid of debt. For this answer, instead of "debt," it makes sense to use "out."<n><n>"Best way to keep out of..." could be either "debt" or "a debt." The question requires the "best way to keep out of a debt." However, this can easily be confused for the "best way to get out of debt" or "best way to avoid debt." <n><n>If a debt is removed, the opposite result would be achieved: having a debt. So this answer must refer to the removal of debt to be grammatically correct.<n>###Instruction:'Congrat

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Billy's mother tripped over a stuffed animal.  She yelled at him not to leave his things where? Choices:  A: toy store B: hall C: bathroom D: amusement park E: fairgrounds<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>To identify what the mother wouldn't want to leave behind, one has to consider her point of view.  She's upset when she trips over something, so it's natural to eliminate options that are unrelated to what she's looking for. Toys are related, but it's unclear what might be in a toy store. The bathroom is possibly related, but it'd be unusual for kids to be leaving stuff behind in the bathroom - that stuff tends to wash down the toilet.  The amusement park doesn't really relate to what the mother wants, because a stuffed animal is far from being an amusement park attraction.<n><n>What is left from the previous options are hall and fairgrounds. The reasoning here is that a fairground can be confusing to maneuver, and leaving any stuff behind could cause damage, so it'd make sense if she wants her son to take his stuff with him.<n>Hall, conversely, has been used repeatedly in questions and can be used to describe a room. It's not clear if the mother wants Billy to take his stuff to the hall or not take it in her hallway. It's not a common occurrence for kids to leave their stuff in the hallway, so that option is probably not one that Billy's mother is considering as a possibility.<n><n>Because of that reasoning, it's the only solution that makes sense here, and the final answer is C: hall.<n><n>Input: A child's pet lizard was missing for two days and was finally reported at home with muddy feet. The pet lizard was probably was... Choices:  A wet B sick C happy D dirty E tired<n>Output: Reason<n><n>The child's lizard was not wet, sick, happy, dirty, or tired. It was found with muddy feet.<n>Thus, the only option where "muddy feet" could be a consequence of the animal's actions would be "probably was", and the answer is D: muddy feet.<n><n><n>

The other choices all involve negative outcomes that are not what they'd be seeking to avoid.<n><n>Option "less confusion" (B) doesn't make sense in this context, as the goal is to avoid confusion, not cause it.<n><n>Option "boredom" (C) doesn't make any sense either, as standing in line is not typically boring, and if it were, going to a different line would be a simple solution.<n><n>The remaining choices are a little harder to disqualify.<n>Option "have to wait for" (D) is an answer that could be correct, depending on how long the customer expects to wait in line, how impatient he or she is, and how impatient he'd be at not being able to get a cup of coffee. However, we can deduce by reading the context what would be the most likely choice - "standing in the line" (E), which isn't even an option.<n><n>Furthermore, option "having to wait" (D) involves a passive verb and an infinitive phrase ("to have").<n><n>Answer:<n><n>The lab results had been compiled and the scientist began to analyze the data for what purpose?<n><n>Answer: Reasoning:  We can eliminate the answers that do not fit this situation.

Choices:  A: school children B: parents C: get money D: require to pay taxes E: take money<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Once again, we must first define the context and purpose behind the action. Here, we can assume that the government is assisting educational institutions in improving the quality of school education - therefore, the government is the entity helping with schools. <n><n>Option "help with schools" (A) would be a confusing way to phrase the question, as schools cannot be "with" each other. Instead, the government could "help schools," which is in line with the context of the scenario. <n><n>The word "parents" (B) does not fit with the context of the question, because schools do not directly affect parents in this scenario. Therefore, this is an invalid choice. <n><n>Option"get money" (C) sounds similar to the context of the scenario, however, we know from the question that the government assists schools, not seeks more funding from them.<n><n>The phrase "require to pay taxes" (D) is also confusing - this has nothing to do with the situation at hand. "Take money," (E) is a completely vague answer. It could mean the government is taking money from individuals, or from the school system as a whole. <n><n>The question is not specific enough to make a clear conclusion, hence option E: taking money is the wrong answer.<n><n>The final answer is A: the government<n>

Choices:  A: gorgeous B: handsome C: pleasing D: glorious E: pretty beautiful<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Here we simply need to understand the context of this scenario.<n>We know that the man has found someone who shares his ugliness - that is, someone "so ugly as himself". But then he also knows that he won't stick out because of their ugliness. <n><n>The problem with option A (gorgeous) is that someone who's ugly wouldn't feel at ease seeing another who is even more physically ugly. In other words, they would have stick out, rather than not feel like they stick out.<n><n>Option B (handsome) also doesn't fit the scenario. While it is conceivable that a pair of uglier people could find each other and be happy about it, option B doesn't specify that the man would even be happy in finding someone as ugly as him.<n><n>Option C (pleasing to the eye) also doesn't make sense in this context.<n><n>Option D (glorious) doesn't change the context at all. It changes the connotation of the man's actions in finding another ugly person - it suggests that they are both happy to see each other because of some commonality. Such inference isn't necessary to understand the original question and the man's reaction to his situation.<n><n>Therefore, since the man is looking for someone who he can't stand out in being ugly, only option E can be valid. Option E: pretty beautiful<n><n>Input: The CEO was at a loss for words when he saw a company employee doing what? Choices: B: reading C: sleeping D: laughing E: dancing<n>Output: Reason<n><n>Similar to other questions about context understanding. The scenario is clear: the CEO is looking at an employee who is sleeping rather than doing company business.<n><n>Option A, "reading", is a potential possibility. A person could also be sleeping during lunch. If the employee is a sales representative, she could also be asleep at the office because the work is done and the company has few clients to service.<n><n>Option B, "sleeping", is also possible. However, the CEO can't distinguish between those who are sleeping intentionally and those who are sleeping due to the nature of the job, because "work is never done and there are always new clients to service".<n><n>Options C and D both pointless because it

Choices:  A: neatness B: selfishness C: mistakes D: cleanliness E: satisfaction<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>To answer this question, we should first examine the meaning of the prefix "greasy". According to many dictionaries, including Merriam-Webster, "greasy" means to be covered with or produce oil or grease.<n>Now, since the question mentions teenagers, it's likely that whoever is greasy is a teenager. But the context may refer to a greasy food substance, which could be anything from French fries to pizza. In conclusion, to eliminate the inappropriate options, we narrow it down to A, D, and E choices: neatness, cleanliness, and satisfaction, since neatness would remove something dirty, cleanliness refers to a process of cleaning and satisfying means being happy.<n><n>Finally: the answer is E: satisfying and the answer is E.<n><n><n>### Instruction: Read the passage below.

I: “It was quite hot here.” J: “Well, I guess I’ll be home soon." K: “Glad to hear that.” The man in line at the deli picks up his order and says: “Hey, it wasn’t hot at all." Which answer choices correctly follow his comment?<n><n>### Answer:<n><n>A & G<n><n>### Reasoning:<n>A and G are both answer choices based on actual dialogue.<n><n>When the man picked up his order, he'd said [“Hey,”] before uttering his main statement. It's unclear whether G is a response to his statement, but since it comes later in the scene, it would be too soon for the man to use such a greeting.<n><n>However, A is a response to the man's comment.

Choices:  A: water B: doctor C: spread disease D: mouth E: ear<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Again, identifying the purpose of the given action sheds light on the correct answer choice. The correct answer is "E: mouth," because people wash their hands to maintain health. It's unreasonable to say that someone washes their mouth instead of their hands. In our analogy to the question of "what's something you wash with soap and water," the correct answer would be "hands," which is in the third blank.<n><n>The remaining choices, when scrutinized, are also misleading. For instance, the option "water" (A) is not a suitable thing to eat because it's not digestible, thus "water" cannot be the thing that's in the fourth blank. Also, the option "mouth" (E) would be more appropriate if it said, "Wash your hands before eating to remove germs from your food and your mouth."<n>Therefore, the correct answer is "E."<n><n>Input: 7:30 is what from 12? Choices: A: 12:30 B: 8:30 C: 12:09 D: 12:15 E: 5:59<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>Since "7:30" is before noon, choosing the closest time to it after noon - i.e. 12:35, is a common choice. However, this does not give complete answer to the question. As a common habit, we tend to make choices that are closer to the present or more obvious. By picking this option, we will have an outcome that would satisfy the most commonly expressed options, but the question that must be answered is "what time it takes for the minutes in hours and the hours in days and the days in months to match the minutes in days and the days and the months." If this was the case, the outcome would be "5:59." However, this outcome was never suggested by the answer.<n><n>To ensure that one considers all possible outcomes when performing an operation, one would have to consider "12:09" which is before 5:59 and "12:15" which is after 5:59 as well.<n><n>After considering all possible outcomes, it was found that "12:00" is the correct answer.

Rather, the term is used to indicate a level of stress, with more work suggesting greater stress. So, the most logical options would be choices (E) or (D).<n><n>The term "school" doesn't suggest that "the boy has to work more" (A), because that would not make sense in the context of the sentence. And it doesn't refer to more studies that need to be "studied" (B), since the sentence already suggests stress from schoolwork. The other options are also inaccurate.<n><n>In the end, the most accurate answer would be (D) followed by (E).

Choices:  A: jewelry store B: case C: hock D: watch store E: pawn<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>This question has one tricky misdirection in the form of the words "for" and "of". They're used interchangeably in the question and misdirect the reader into thinking the man wanted money from his wristwatch.

Choices:  A: vessel B: box C: transistor D: submarine E: lamp<n>Output:		Reason: The question refers to a baseball game, and asks about reaching base. A transistor (and presumably an antenna) could possibly be used in this scenario – or a "box" – but neither of these are likely to be included in a baseball player's "radio". It's unlikely that a baseball player would carry a lamp around to reach the base – it's likely just used on the field, where the player is actually on base anyway – and the same holds true for a vessel. As for a "submarine" – no, that's not how people reach home plate. The obvious and correct answer here is _"box"_ as a literal box with a telescopic antenna would probably be used to reach base.<n><n>Input: What is a shark's favorite seafood dish? Choices:  Answer: A: chicken B: lobster C: chum D: sardine E: plankton<n>Output: Reason I think this is correct because the question asked:<n>"What is a shark't favorite seafood dishes"<n>then answered the question.

Choices:  answer: A: rock B: country C: pop D: electronic E: bluegrass F: symphonic G: rap<n>Output: Reason As shown in the example above, it is possible for two options to be grammatically equivalent (ie, "bluegrass music" and "country music"). As such, you cannot rely on the grammar of an answer alone to indicate whether the answer is a synonym or an example. In this case, the answer "rap" is a synonym; rap refers to hip-hop music, and hip-hop is a subset of rap. In order to determine whether or not the answer is correct, you need to look at the context of the question (if there is a clear context), or look up synonyms of the answer word (in this case, google defines rap as "a type of music that usually consists of a rapped or spoken-word rhyming lyrics performed to a backing music that is usually produced with DJ equipment").<n><n>Input: A.What's the best

Choices:  A: own house B: better job C: win lottery D: save money E: feel safe<n>Output:		<n>Reasoning:<n><n>Option A (owning a house) isn't a possibility here. While it might be a worthy personal goal for some people, it doesn't fit the description of the question ("making more") and would require additional information about the person's current situation. Similarly, option B (finding a better job) doesn't work due to the ambiguous wording of the question. Options C (winning the lottery) and D (saving money) are both reasonable strategies for increasing earnings, but they're not specifically relevant to the scenario.<n><n>The correct answer is option E: feeling safe, which fits the theme of the question of finding a way to make more income. It's an intuitive and appropriate choice for a person who feels insecure or unstable in their current situation.<n><n>Input: A group of friends want to make an important trip. They have already bought airline tickets and reservations in one of the best hotels in town. They ask their close friend for some advice. Which of the following will the friend most likely recommend them? Choices: <n>A: Go with my relatives B: Try out new food and restaurants C: Exercise before and after the trip D: Go camping E: Go to the beach<n>Output: Reason:<n>Asking a friend for some advice doesn't imply that they aren't fit. Their advice will mostly be based on their experience and expertise in the given field.<n><n>The correct choice will depend on the group's specific preferences and needs. While options A and E may be enticing choices for people who prefer beach vacations to camping trips, option D is likely to be the best option for friends who value exercising and staying active. The options C and B don't seem particularly helpful in this context, and while they may have validity, there is no information to support them as ideal recommendations.<n><n>The answer is D : go camping because it provides them with the best opportunity to exercise and stay active.<n><n>Input: Some people like to be surrounded by a lot of people and noise, while other prefer to be alone. Some are active and competitive, while others are more interested in the arts that focus on creativity and self-expression. So how will we describe a person who likes to be in large crowded places?

Choices:  A: eyes B: biology laboratory C: shower stall D: old cheese E: decaying matter<n>Output:		Answer:<n><n>The only relevant type of "decaying matter" in this scenario is rotting cheese - and not because fungi always grows on cheese, but because that's what the word "decaying" conjures up in our minds. Even if something other than cheese were to rot, our logical brains would automatically assume it to be from something that involves milk. The rest of the options - especially shower stall (C), which doesn't involve milk and isn't exactly rotting - seem like extremely unlikely locations for where fungus would grow. The same goes for the non-sensical choice of old cheese (B). Choice E (decaying matter) is also incorrect because it's not a specific item or food.<n><n>As a result, the only possible realistic answer to this question is D, which is milk. The other options are just filler words, and therefore false positives.<n><n>Input: Why does a doctor who gives you a shot do everything very slowly and carefully? Choices:  The medication is usually painful for patients.  It's a long, tedious process.  It makes the patient less anxious.  The doctor is thorough and detailed in his work.  It's the only way to do it.<n>Output: Answer: The medication is usually very painful for the patient. Reasoning:  The doctor does everything slowly and carefully because the medication is usually painless for the patient. The medication is painful, not the doctor.<n><n>Input: If you're walking around a city, you can always ask a nearby person for directions. Where does the person live? Choices:  with you A: In the park B: at a cafe C: near the street stall D: on the train E: where you're currently located<n>Output: Answer: D: where you're standing. Reasoning: A, B, C were all incorrect options because they were all places that people don't necessarily live. Therefore, this was not the intended type of location that the question was describing. Only answer D was a correct answer. Answer E was not on the list of potential options that the question gave us to choose from. This meant that it was an incorrect answer.

None of the options suggest an ordinary place or method of transportation as a place to "find a metal rod." Therefore, the options are all eliminated. <n><n>From there, it's just a matter of looking at each option and picking the one that fits best: Choice A: airplane, Choice B: construction site, Choice C: shops. These are all reasonable places to find a metal rod, if you were looking for one, which makes them all valid answers to this question. <n>So the final answer would be B: construction site<n><n>Input: In which country do you think people use more calories?

Even though the fourth option gives you a number of possible answers, the right answer is on your first try. Eliminate the wrong ones to reveal what the question is really looking for - in this case, you can eliminate Answer Choices 3 (C), and 2 (B) because they all contain the letter "B". Your only choice is between Answer Choice 1 (A) and Answer Choice 2 (D), which are both valid answers to the question.

Choices:  A: race track B: populated areas C: the desert D: apartment E: roadblock<n>Output:		Reasoning: A simple application of process of elimination provides the right answer. We eliminate all places where no one goes - the desert, roadblock and the apartment. So our focus is on populated areas and the race track. So, the ultimate answer is Race Track.<n><n>Input: If they were on a road trip, Sammy would probably be driving.  Which of the following jobs would he be performing? Choices: 	A: playing B: navigating C: talking E: snoozing D: braking<n>Output:Reasonning: We have to figure out what makes Sammy unique among the other drivers who are all using their brake pedals.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What home entertainment equipment requires cable? Choices:  A: radio shack B: substation C: cabinet D: television E: desk<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n><n>Examining the options, we can quickly eliminate options which don't fit. We can eliminate option B (Substation) because the word "Substation" is not a home entertainment device - it is a power-generating facility where power generators are housed.<n><n><n>We can eliminate option C (Cabinet) for similar reasons.<n><n>That leaves us with the word "desk" as the only option fitting the context of the question - we're already assuming that the home entertainment device is a television, and desks are typically not considered electronic home entertainment devices.<n><n>Option E (desk) would be the correct answer in this case.<n>So the final  answer is E: desk<n><n>Input: How to determine the length and width  of a rectangle Choices:  A : square root B : squared C : sqr roots D: rectangles E: square root squared<n>Output: Reason :<n><n><n>Examination of the options reveals that option C ("rectangles") does not fit the context of the question ("How to determine the length and the width of a rectangle"). Rectangles are already a certain shape, thus they cannot be used to determine the length and size of a rectangle.<n><n>Option B ("squared") is technically incorrect - although using the word "squared" implies that you are referring to "squared" numbers, you are technically referring to "squares" or "squared off objects". For example, a cage with square-shaped holes would be called a square, while the dimensions describing the size of the cage would be called "squared". <n><n>The same applies for option A (square root). The phrase "square root squared" does not make sense, meaning it has no meaning.<n><n>Option D ("squr roots") is another technically incorrect option. The correct phrase should have a space between the words "squar" and "roots". Thus "squr roots" has no correct meaning.<n><n>The only valid answer, as far as context and technical correctness is concerned, is option E (square root).<n><n>Final answer is E: square root<n><n>Input: The formula for a circle is :  Choices:  A. pi B. pi X C. sqrt(2 X 3) D. 3 X pi E. x sqrt<n>Output

He would die if he didn't find some way to stop what? Choices:  A: loss of heat B: revenge C: expansion D: relaxation E: calm down<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Once James realizes he is losing heat to quickly, he has two possible ways to combat it - he can either cool down through revenge, where his body temperature drops significantly, or expand, which would cause his body temperature to rise. The other choices are incorrect. <n>"Loss of heat" (A) cannot be an option because James would feel warm instead of the opposite. "Expansion" (D) would not work because it is actually James' body that would expand, not his heat. <n>"Relaxation" (C) only increases James' body temperature; it does nothing to alleviate him from losing heat. Also, the phrase "stop what" leads you to believe that he is losing heat faster than he should, rather than just losing heat.  <n>Therefore, the correct answer is  D: expansion, because it would alleviate the effects his body is feeling by raising his body temperature.<n>

Choices:  A: hospital B: head C: sick person D: elderly person E: doctor's office<n>Output:		Reason: The doctor's office is the "hub" of medical care and hence is the place where most people contract illness because they go there for vaccinations and treatment. So the doctor's office is one of the most likely places to catch an illness.<n>Input: In modern times, when does the average person think the best time is to exercise? Choices: A: before breakfast B: after breakfast C: after lunch D: at noon E: late evening<n>Output: Reason for solution: It is better to exercise before breakfast, as it has been proven that it burns fat and helps clear the mind and is the most effective form of exercise. So it is better, if you exercise before breakfast because there are no other people involved, the only people are you and you're alone, you are able to exercise to your heart's content.<n>Input: In which age do people typically have the most energy? Choices: A. Children B. Infants C. Seniors D. Adults E. Teens<n>Output: Reason For solution: The answer to this is Adults, as adults have the most energy and are the most active.

Choices:  A: park B: make time for C: receive instructions D: take money E: leave work<n>Output:		Reason to eliminate: The word "errand" (B) is the reason this option was ruled out. This is a common definition of “run errands” being to perform a series of small tasks. There can be several "errands" (plural), depending on the individual. One can run several errands at once. So the word "errand" does not fit the context of the sentence, where the drug kingpin is giving a single task to his man.<n><n>Input: While in a restaurant, the girl stole a handsome man’s wallet, then she decided to do what? Choices: A: look at it B: return it C: write to him D: buy something nice E: read it<n>Output: Reason for eliminating: "Return the wallet to whom it belongs and explain your intentions," would be the most logical step for the woman to take, as taking someone else's money and spending it is clearly not what the woman meant by "buy something nice" (E).<n><n>Input:The man in the car crashed into the wall of their building, he went to the hospital. Why he went to the hospital? Choices: A : To see the doctor. B : To see his best friend C : Check up on his injuries D : To know his health E : Find a good restaurant<n>Output: Reason why option D was eliminated: The man in the car wasn't injured in the car crash. "Checking up on his injuries" makes sense for a person that was hurt in the accident. We can't assume the man crashed into the wall and got injured, so that eliminates this answer.<n><n>Input: When the dog was walking outside, she found out what?

Choices:  A: television B: attic C: corner D: they cannot clean corner and library during football match they cannot need that E: ground<n>Output:		Reason:<n>The attic is the part of the house and the game is taking place at the football stadium.<n><n>As the context suggests, the football match is taking place in a stadium. This means there is no reason to keep a television in the attic.<n><n>The word "ground" (E) refers to the stadium, not the player's home. Therefore, it is unlikely that this word describes the object in question.<n><n>Therefore, the most appropriate choice is B: attic.<n><n>Input: She had been given one minute to present, in this time she had to remember which of the following best helped her? Choices:  i: it helped her to have an outline  ii:  it really did nothing at all iii: it helped her to practice  iv: it wasn't very helpful to have an outline at all<n>Output: Reasonin:<n><n>"it really didn't do nothing at all" (iv) is the correct answer.<n><n>The context indicates that the question refers to a task of 1 minute duration, and that "helped" refers to preparing well.<n><n>Option (i) is incorrect.  The phrase "it helped her to have an OUTLINE" is incorrect grammatically, as well as indicating that, by "giving her an outline", something helped her.<n><n>Option (ii) is incorrect. Given the context of 1 minute, option (ii) directly contradicts what helped was supposed to be effective at helping her prepare well.<n><n>Option III may be tempting because it sounds similar "to remember to practice well". However, both the context and grammatical structure of option (iii) makes it immediately distinguishable from the correct sentence.<n><n>Input: He made an offer which she couldn’t refuse and she did this because it was the best she could? Choices:  a: It was a very bad offer  b: It was a bad offer  c: It was a very good offer  d: It was a good offer <n>Output: Reasonning:<n><n>First and foremost, option (c) is incorrect.

Choices:  A: make breakfast B: go hiking C: pack or bag D: light fire E: grab a match<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option A (A) and D (C) are both false, because they refer to activities that involve cooking food. The camper must first "unpack or bag" (B) the ingredients and have a "match" (E) that can be used to light a fire.<n><n>Option B (B) is false, because the purpose of going hiking before cooking food "is to have a better time outside." There is no guarantee that the camper will find ingredients for cooking food during a hike.<n><n>Option C (C) is incorrect, because packing something into a bag (pack or bag) does not imply that the item being packed will be lighted on fire. Instead, that the item being pack or baged will be burned for cooking meals, which is not mentioned in the question statement.<n><n>Finally option E (E) is incorrect, because a candle or lighter (match) will not burn everything in the camper's bag or pack. Even the things that can be burned would have been packed into said bag or pack.<n>We can confidently say that the camper will light a "match" (D) or a "candle" (E) first before he can "make breakfast (A) or pack or bag" (C).

Choices:  A: maine B: boston C: beach town D: coastal cities E: ocean<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Option A is incorrect because the East Coast of North America generally refers to the U.S. East Coast, which encompasses Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina, whereas Maine is a U.S. state on the New England coast. Furthermore, the term "East Coast" is typically used to refer to the coast of the Atlantic Ocean located east of the United States.<n><n>Option B is incorrect as Boston has a coastline on the Atlantic Ocean and is located in Massachusetts on the New England part of the U.S. coast. "Beach Town" refers to a type of town or city known for its proximity to the ocean and often has sandy beaches, like Florida.<n><n>Options C, D, and E are incorrect because North America is a geographical continent composed of North America and parts of Central America. Although the coastline is located along the east, North America also covers a vast inland territory.<n><n>The best answer would be "coastal cities," because it is the correct spelling for the name of these cities. Coastal cities also have large beaches, many of them are popular vacation destinations, and some even have ocean views on the other side of town. Other major cities located in the eastern United States are Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Atlanta, and Charlotte.<n><n>Input:What type of dog is shown in the image above?

Choices:  A: costly B: captive C: contained D: paying E: caught<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n>Here, the question asked about the child's parents being led to spend money on microtransactions, which is quite possible, as there is nothing in the question that suggests that microtransactions are in fact free. <n><n>The first task after understanding the context is to determine the outcome of the story. It is obvious from the question that the parents were led to spend money on the microtransactions and the options (A) and (B) indicate that this is not a possibility, which means they are irrelevant to the question.<n><n>The next step is to identify which option best fits the given context. The child's parents ended up paying for the microtransactions. From this, the option that best fits the context is "paying" (D).<n><n>The next step after identifying which option best fits the context is to look for alternative or irrelevant options.<n>Mind maps can be used to determine what other options may fit the given context. The context of the story involved a child being tricked into paying for microtransactions.<n><n>Finally an alternative option that could be interpreted as fitting in the context is "catching", which doesn't seem to fit but can be considered as an alternative. But since the outcome doesn't fit the context, the correct choice is "paying". <n><n>In conclusion the the correct answer to the question is D: (paying)<n><n>Input:The 5th grade pupil was struggling with his math exam because he had not done which of the following since the previous summer?

Where might he have been? Choices:  A: disneyland B: snow C: windowsill D: street E: summer<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>We are provided some information about Jame's condition, along with some hints about where he may or may not be. With that in perspective, it's best to eliminate any options that may be associated with a cold climate such as snow or a window.<n><n>Similarly disneyland is best to eliminate, since it's known to have many attractions, rather than only one main attraction that might cause somebody to walk barefoot.<n><n>The street is the only option that fits the given information. The sun was making the surface hot, which means it has warmed the surface of a street in such a way as to expose someone's bare feet. This option is therefore the most probable conclusion.<n><n>The final answer is E: summer.<n><n>Input:Which of the following do all the names listed below have in common? Choices:  Almond, Banana, Buttermilk, Cherry, Chestnut, Hennessy, Lime, Maple, Walnut, White<n>Output:Reasoning:<n><n>To begin, an almond is not mentioned in this set of names. For that reason, the answer to this question must be "none of the above".<n><n>We can now eliminate all of the possible answers and just focus on the unique answer. Maple and almond are not common options.<n>Nor are banana and buttermilk, nor hennessy and walnut. If none of the above options are correct, this means maple and hennessy is correct. (We did not need to eliminate hennessy with maple, but if we had to choose one of the two, we would have to pick hennessy.)<n><n>Therefore, the final answer is E.<n><n>Input:If a man's age was 28 when he began working under a 10 year contract, how old will he be when he finishes his job?

But ultimately, the goal of meditation is to relax your mind, which helps you feel less stressed and more calm at the end of the day. While meditation helps you relax your mind and body, it doesn't actually cure stress or "recover" from exhaustion as the word "recover" suggests.<n>Though it may be nice idea to meditate when you feel stressed, it doesn't really help with recovery.<n><n>Rest (C): There are various ways to rest. Sleeping for at least 8 hours a day, is one way your body rest. It's good for health, especially if you are feeling sick.Sleeping is one important element of recovery, but it's not the only one.<n>Run out of steam (D): is a phrase meaning to feel exhausted, to be completely out of energy.<n>Go to sleep (E): a sleep is a time when your body is more rest. But it's not the same thing as meditating.<n>So the final result is A: mediate<n>

Choices:  A: alabama B: tennessee C: violin case D: music store E: bow and strings<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Think about location, because the answer is about fiddle-playing people who are based in the south. Therefore the answer can't be in a specific state or in a certain region in the south of Alabama.<n><n>The option that is most likely is B: tennessee, because it is in the South, and the string of states between Alabama and Kentucky (called a 'border state') have similar characteristics to those in the South, especially Tennessee.<n><n>The option C: violin case, while intriguing, is not plausible because it is specific to violin cases, not people. In contrast to this, the option E: bow and strings, is plausible because the stringed instrument is the violin. Therefore this would be the most likely answer.<n><n>So the final answer will be B: Tennessee<n><n>Input: How many days will it take to drive from Detroit to Houston? Choices:  a. 3 days and 3 nights b. 3 nights and 3 days c. 3 days d. 100 hours e. 107 hours<n>Output: Reason will be:<n><n>If you take a closer look at the question, you'll notice that 'days and nights' is repeated twice. As such:<n>Option A: 3 days and nights: This means a total of six 24 hour periods. To make this number of 100 hours, either the nights would need to be made bigger (6 x 4 = 24 hours, which is less than 100 hours) or the days would need to be made smaller (6 x 24 = 144 hours, which is a lot more than 100). Therefore, this is incorrect.<n>Option B: 3 nights and days: Three nights means a total of 72 hours, which exceeds the 100 required. Therefore this is incorrect.<n><n>The only way to get 100 hours would be if one of the nights and days were shorter. To get 100, option 3 (2 days and 3 night) fits as it is made up of:<n>3 days: 21 hours + 12 hours = 33 hours. Hence, option 3 (three days and three nights) is the correct answer.<n>So the final Answer will be

Choices:  A: television B: bus C: email D: web page E: la ville<n>Output:		Reasonng:<n>Explanation: The question is trying to understand where an advertisement could be seen while reading the news. Options A and B do not make sense as they do not contain news. Option D is also not the answer because the question does not ask where can you find a website where can you see an advertisment. Option E is also irrelevant as la ville does not refer to a location but, to the French name for the village. This leaves us with option C. <n>

She continued to do what? Choices:  A: gain weight B: augment C: dispare D: make larger E: expand<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>In this question, we can eliminate the options "gain weight" (B), and "dispare" (D).  The question doesn't mention how heavy the respondent is, nor does it mention weight gain. Therefore, option A, "gain weight" must be ruled out.<n><n>Moreover, the phrase "all of her efforts" in the scenario is indicative of the respondent's goal of losing weight. So she wouldn't be dissatisfied with a weight gain.<n><n>"making larger" (E) falls into the same category described above, as well as "augment" (C).  She wanted to lose weight but continued working hard at her efforts to do so. In a scenario where she was trying to gain weight, she wouldn't continue to do what she's currently doing, which would be "work out" or "exercise" or "exerciste." So, this also cannot be her current activity.<n>This brings us to option D, "dispare," which means "to become depressed or despondent" and "make smaller." Clearly, Jamie wasn't losing weight. But, she wouldn't keep exercising if she wasn't successful or otherwise dissatisfied with the outcome. So she wasn't dispare, either. In fact, we have enough information to eliminate all four of the remaining options, because they don't make sense when viewed from this perspective. So, the best answer to the question, "Reduce her waist size," is "make larger," or in other words do the same thing.<n><n>So the answer is D: make larger<n><n>Input:I was going for a walk outside with my puppy.

The time required to communicate slowed their what? Choices:  A: static B: train of thought. C: progress D: transfer of information E: collaboration<n>Output:		Explanation:<n><n>To answer the question, we first need to isolate the noun phrases "communication" and "communicating." We then consider the options that can be formed by replacing the noun phrases with other nouns to identify the word that fits the given context.<n><n>Option A, "static," is a word that refers to the state between two successive electrical signals, and the action of the electric current changing direction. These both lack the necessary contextual meaning to work as a correct answer.<n><n>Option B, "train of thought," is a phrase that refers to a thought process, but it is unlikely that two people would be in the middle of individual thought processes rather than a shared one. This is also an unnecessary assumption as the question provides few details to work with, so it is incorrect.<n><n>Option C, "progress," is a word that relates to an improvement of some kind, and it certainly seems fitting in the context of a time management question involving communication between the two subjects of the project. <n><n>Option D, "transfer of information," is the closest word fitting the description of the answer because it refers to the act of handing something over. It matches what happens between John and James when they communicate with each other - they share with one another, and information is transferred back and forth.  This is the most likely answer.<n><n>Option E, "collaboration," is the best fit to the question because it is defined as "the action or process of working with someone to produce or create something." In this scenario, John and James are collaborating with each other to produce a project, and it is their communication and the time taken by that communication that is affecting their ability to complete the project. <n>So the final answer would be E: Collaboration<n><n>Input:The manager used the budget given by the board of directors to increase his personal salary.

Choices:  A: desire B: money C: time D: credit E: spending money<n>Output:		The correct answer is E -> spending money.<n><n>The purpose of this question is to test our knowledge about the psychology behind shopping.<n><n>Option A, "desire", should be eliminated because there is a distinction between "desire" and "needs". Needs (like food or shelter) are essential for survival, while desires are optional. In other words, a "desire" to shop would not be the dominant factor in driving someone's purchasing choices, as it is by definition less important than other needs.<n>Option B, "money", is eliminated because of its negative connotation. It would be less accurate to say that someone's purchase choices are driven by a lust for money, suggesting that they are primarily motivated by greed and materialism.<n><n>The focus of this question is on the psychology behind shopper choices, and it would be more accurate and less biased to describe their purchasing motivations as what they "spend money on" or what they have a "spending habit" towards.<n><n>So the final answer would be E - Spending money<n><n>Input:The manager thought of a plan to make his employees happy, because the workers have a high what, they don't expect much to begin with? Choices: <n>A: turnover rate<n>B: expectation<n>C: need<n>D: morale<n>E: budget<n><n>Output: The Correct option and Final Answer:<n><n>The key word that stands out in this question is "workers". It suggests that the focus of the question is on employees who work for the company. That would eliminate irrelevant option "budget" (E), as it would be uncommon for the manager to consider the company budget in terms of employee needs and morale.<n><n>Option C "needs" is eliminated because it is a general term that could refer to any of several different criteria. "Needs" would not be the dominant or primary factor the manager considered when deciding to implement a happiness program, so that option would be less likely than "expectation" or "morale".<n><n>Option D "morale" is eliminated because the use of the word "morale" suggests a concern about the mental state or well-being of employees, as opposed to simply acknowledging their basic "expectation". That would make it more likely the manager considered their psychological needs when deciding to implement the

Add new activities to your weekly schedule slowly, and set realistic goals. Your routine should change when your fitness becomes routine. Here's what happened to Jillian:<n><n>Jillian used to live up to her goal to exercise every day. Her schedule included exercising at home, going to  a fitness class, and even running. However, after a few years, she became less and less excited about working out. She continued to reach her goals, but Jillian's excitement had faded. How can her problem be solved?<n><n>A. Set new fitness goals.<n>B. Keep a written schedule.<n>C. Do more exercise.<n>D. Use exercise classes.<n>E. Make new goals.<n><n>#### Choice A is incorrect. It's an answer that can help Jillian stay motivated but it is not an overall solution for her to overcome her exercise fatigue.<n><n>#### Choices B and C are also incorrect. To answer the question, we need to identify an overall solution to how Jillian got herself off the treadmill and back into exercise mode.<n><n>#### Choese D and E are correct answers. To answer the question to get Jillian back into exercise routine, we need to find an answer that has a solution that works long-term. Thus, we chose choice C and D: Do more exercise, Make new goals.<n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Stanley had a dream that was very vivid and scary. He had trouble telling it from what? Choices:  A: reality B: imagination C: dreamworker D: nightmare E: awake<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Here we use the Reasoning function to determine if the correct option can be eliminated without reference to the other options.<n><n>In this case, the last choice, E: "awake," is the only possible choice that does not match with any other options.<n><n>Because of this, we know that the other options must be more specific and that "awake" could therefore be ruled out.<n><n>Next, we consider the remaining choices. "B: imagination" seems likely to be incorrect, because Stanley's dream was scary, and he had trouble distinguishing it from reality. The dream he saw was therefore almost certainly not imagined, and probably more to do with reality.<n><n>"D: nightmare" seems plausible in some ways, but not in others. On the one hand, Stanley's dream was very vivid, making it seem unlikely that something imagined would stand up to such scrutiny.<n>But on the other hand, it seems logical that a nightmare wouldn't be as vivid and convincing as a dream. That being said, this leaves us with "C: dreamworker" as the only remaining choice.<n><n>Next we determine if one of these is too broad. "C: dreamworker," though it covers nightmares as well as dreams, seems to be too general. It can't apply to either of the remaining more specific options.<n><n>That being said, "D: nightmare," does cover the nightmare in Stanley's dream, which makes it the correct answer.<n><n><n>Input: The company had a problem in its work-from- home program. An employee who was doing the required work at home decided to do some more work at _____. Choices:  A work B boss C home D other E home other<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>In this question, we are presented with an answer choice that doesn't make sense. "Other" (E) would be an appropriate choice if there was an option that wasn't "Home" (D) or "Home Other" (E). However, since we know that the company had a problem in the work-from-home program, that means at least one type of work is taking place at home.<n><n>Thus, since "Other" doesn't make sense, we know it must be false.<n><n>Next, look for an

Choices:  A: serve food B: eat C: set table D: serve meal E: present bill<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question asks what a waiter does at the end of a meal. So the options exclude "eat" (B) and set the table (C). The two remaining options that refer to food (serving meal and presenting bills) can be eliminated because the question asks what a wait does. <n><n>However, an option still remains that answers the same question - the waiter serves food. So eliminating D and E.<n>So the correct answer is A.<n><n>Input:A dog eats a rabbit, a cat eats a dog, what does a fox eat? Choices:  a. A rabbit b. A cat c. A fox<n>Output: Reason : The question is ambiguous so need to check for validity, The options are 'a' and 'c'.  So the fox eats rabbit and cat but this doesn't make any sense. <n><n>

Choices:  A: carried by people B: guard house C: fly D: follow ultralight airplane E: group together<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option "A" (carried by people) is grammatically incorrect and doesn't make sense in this context. When the scientist is referring to "geese," he is obviously talking about a group of geese, not individual geese. The other options also show a lack of sense, such as "follow ultralight airplanes" in Option B and "guard house" in Option C.<n>The only option remaining is "group together." This option is not only contextually appropriate for a group of migrating geese, it also fits the description by not requiring any form of assistance to be transported.<n>So the final option is "group together"<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question using the least amount of words.<n><n>Input: What does it mean when a child is referred to as "precocious"?

In this case, options A (bright), B (unintelligible), C (nice-looking), and E (happy) don't give any indication that they answer the question.<n><n>Choices D (picking up things) and F (very young) make no sense together with the phrase "precocious child." As such, they cannot be chosen.<n><n>Therefore, answers remaining are A (bright), G (smart), and I (quick).<n>The only logical answer would be "bright," as the parent/scientist refers the child as "precocious" in the next phrase. Giving the correct answer will keep it concise while being efficient.<n>So the final chosen answer is B: bright.<n>### Instuction:Analyze the given image and the questions.<n><n>Input: Image: https://img.learnium.me/questions/7/c2b4d983fc6b68da4ec31212921e2e58.gif<n>Output: Correct Answer:<n><n>The

What was it? Choices: <n><n> A: to find a cure B: to perform an experiment C: to see if he could fix her D: to know what was wrong E: to see her<n>Output: Option 2: To perform an experiment.<n><n>Input:How about you help me out as I can not manage all of this, maybe I will tell you something that will help. Choices:  A. Help out B. I am glad C. Help me with D. I can help too E. No sir I can not.<n>Output: No sir I can not<n><n>The input statement can be dissected thus, "How about you help me... I can not..." The second clause of the sentence (with the question mark) implies that there are two possible responses to the question.<n>Option (B) "I am glad" is the wrong answer. <n>Option (D) "Help me out" doesn't fit with the preceding sentences, as the question is in the past tense, and "Help me out" is present tense.<n><n>Therefore, option (E) "No sir I can not" is the most accurate answer in this scenario. <n><n>Input: The Doctor: how can I help you?

Among the remaining, choosing the answer that is the contextually most appropriate would be the best way to arrive at the right answer, here.<n><n>The last one, "fraternity house" (E) is not only out of context (since the question doesn't mention anything about college, let alone a college frat), it is also quite improbable: The question mentions fried and alcoholic foods, not fried and alcohol.<n><n>Thus, since there is an unambiguity issue between the first and the last one, the best answer is B: plane.<n><n>Input:Can someone explain the meaning of AI? Choices:  B: artificial intellect C: artificial intelligence D: artificial imbecile E: artificial identity<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>First thing to do is to read the context and understand the purpose behind the questioner's question.<n><n>Then, the second step is to reason what's appropriate and what's not. We can't eliminate A (it isn't a right answer), so we keep on to the next step which is to reason what'll the right answer be.<n><n>"Artificial" and "intelligence" don't seem to fit together, but since we've come to that conclusion based on our intuition, I'd recommend we keep the answer choices as is and try the "fake out" tactic.<n>If the option "artificial imbecile" (E) is the right answer, it means it doesn't have what is asked by the questioner since it is "imbecile". But that's definitely not true.<n><n>Therefore, we can safely conclude that the answer is D: artificial intelligence, since "intelligence" seems to fit "artificial", based on our intuition.<n><n>Input:In 2018 there has been an increase in the usage of SMS by the American public.

She thought that there was more string on the spool, but it slipped out of her fingers when she reached the what?. Choices:  A: child's hand B: the last straw C: hobby shop D: end of line E: toy store<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The context indicates that the kite was lost and the main factor that contributed to the loss was lack of care. It is therefore likely that Sally made a mistake that led to her losing the kite.<n><n>The option "child's hand" (B) would have helped her to hold onto the kite, but it was not used.  Similarly, "the last straw" (C) refers to an object that holds something else together, but the person in this scenario did not have one.<n><n>Thus the options that refer to something that a person can hold onto and not lose are ruled out from the question, giving us options "end a line" (D) and "toy store" (E).<n><n>It is reasonable that if Sally had lost her kite as a result of her carelessness and the kite was a toy; then Sally would probably have blamed that she lost it only because she went wrong at the end of the line; if the toy was from the toy store then she would probably be angry that it was lost since she had to go all the way to the the end of line to fetch it from toy store. <n><n>Thus the answer is E: toy store

Further, choice (D), map, is a common sense answer that can be rejected.<n><n>Even though option (C) seems to answer the question indirectly, it is still a legitimate answer as choice (C) includes east coast that is found in United States.<n><n>The next step is to focus on only options that meet the above criteria. Therefore, we end up with only (A) and (C).<n><n>Now, we can compare the two options to determine the correct answer, which is option (A). Choice (C) is correct because East Coast is found in United States, but not Florida, whereas choice (A) is incorrect because East Coast is not found in Florida.<n><n>So option (A) is the answer to the question.

Even though the fire may cause damages to the electric car, it shouldn't be mistaken for the entirety of the company.<n><n>"The company has a great business" (B) is the correct answer to this question.<n>So the correct answer is B: The company has a good business model.<n><n>Input: I’ve just spent $30 on apples.  My total is $400.  How much is this? Choices:  (C): $370 (D): $260 (E): $310 (F): $380 (G): $240 (H): $340 (I): $350<n>Output: Reason<n><n>In this question "I’ve just spent $400. My total is $480" does not express "adding" apples in the equation of "$400+$30". That would mean that your total is $430... but when you multiply each apple by $30, the total turns into $480.<n>If you follow the equation and reasoning you can easily figure out the answer is H $340.<n>So the answer is H: $340<n><n>Input: You have five apples: "I would like to eat four apples". This means that you lose one apple. How? Choices:  a.)  I eat three apples.<n><n>b.)  You give one apple to another person. <n><n>c.)  You drop one apple.<n><n>Output: The answer is B. In
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Ben was an alcoholic and was in an accident.  Because of his mistake, he spent 8 years somewhere. Where was he? Choices:  A: prison B: bridge C: locked up D: homeless shelter E: neighbor's house<n>Output:		Reason:This question has two answers; one related to alcoholism and the other related to the accident.<n><n>The scenario of the driver of the car being a drunkard is irrelevant, as it does not directly concern the type of place the person spent 8 years at.<n>"Prison" (A) might be a reasonable answer if the driver's alcoholism were related to the accident.  But since alcoholism is not necessarily related to the accident, it can be ruled out.<n>"Homeless shelter" (E) is possible but again, the accident is not related to the person's homelessness. Additionally, the sentence "because of his mistake" (E) suggests that "the mistake" refers to the accident and not alcoholism.<n>Therefore, we are left with "bridge" (C) and "neighbor's house" (D).<n>The scenario about the bridge can also be read as a joke. While possible, it's an overly complicated interpretation of the sentence, which is not ideal.<n><n>The answer "neighbor' house" (D) is the only correct answer that fits both the alcoholism scenario and the accident scenario. If the driver were intoxicated during a driving accident, he would probably be held at a neighbor's house, either to avoid criminal charges or until the alcohol could leave his system. In the scenario's context, it makes all the sense in the world that the man ended up in a neighbor's home for eight years.<n><n>So the final answer in this case is D: neighbor's house.<n>Instructions: Answer the following multiple choice question:<n><n>Input:There was a murderer.

Choices:  A: sights B: optical illusion C: optical telescope D: light microscope E: binocular<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>This is a relatively straightforward question, as there are only a few possible answers. Option "A: sights" (A) is incorrect as it has nothing to do with optical devices. <n><n>Option "B: optical illusion" (B) is also incorrect as optical illusions do not require the use of an eyepieces. However, if we consider optical illusions as ones where light creates an illusion, then the answer is somewhat plausible. <n><n>Option D "light microscope" (D) is incorrect because a microscope is not necessarily an optical device that you can see through. Although a light microscope is an optical device, the answer "light microscope E: optical microscope" (E) is completely incorrect as "light microscope” (D) and "optical microscope" are both completely different types of microscopes. <n><n>Option E “binocular" (E) is also incorrect because it is an option for optical devices, but not an answer for what is called when one sees something through an eyecup.<n><n>Finally the correct answer "D: light microscope" is the best answer among all the wrong options and is correctly aligned with the context of the question<n><n>**#8**<n><n>![Input and output](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34455713/162502504-c86c15fc-bcf6-4258-ab09-cf87fcaa5804.png)<n><n>### Reasoning: <n><n>The third letter of the alphabet is "c" and is placed between "b" and "d" since it is between two other letters in a sequence it has to be C <n><n>#9<n><n>**Input**<n><n>Your grandma had an accident yesterday morning.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What is a good result of jogging? Choices:  A: insect repellent B: heart attacks C: improved health D: shin splints E: being tired<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>In this case, we must first understand what the term "jogging" means. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, "jogging" is defined as "to run with short, quick steps" and "to run or walk in this manner".<n><n>The word "result" could also refer to an immediate or lasting impact, a positive or negative effect, or a consequence - all of which could be a direct result of jogging. "Insect repellent" (A), however, doesn't fit this definition. A better answer would be "improved health" (C) since it refers to the long-term benefits of regular exercise. "Shin splints" (D) is likely related to overuse of the legs when jogging, which could lead to health issues. Finally "being tired" (E) could be a result of jogging for extended periods of time or at an intense rate, which is not in keeping with the jogging definition I've outlined above.<n><n>So, the final answer is C: (to be) improved health<n><n>Input:How do you find the length of a diagonal of a square? Choices:  a: you measure two sides and deduct the other two sides b: multiply one side by one side c: take half the perimeter d: do math e: you add the two sides<n>Output: Reason for Answer:<n><n>The concept of a "square" should help you narrow down the choices. The first two are obviously wrong since a square has four sides. <n><n>The options "add the two sides", (E) and "deduct the other two sides", (A), are incorrect since they involve addition and subtraction respectively, which don't apply to the given scenario. <n><n>You can solve this problem without using formulae or math.<n><n>The square is made up of 90 degree angles, which are made up of 2 right angles. Right angles have the same measure, which is a diagonal. It's as easy as that!<n><n>You subtract or add two sides to find the length of the third side of a square. This is what a triangle and its hypotenuse do. It can only be a right angle or it will be a different shape. All those sides must be the same length for it to be a square.<n><n>So, "the solution is

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Sometimes fighting inflation isn't even what, because it is so negligible? Choices:  A: economic instability B: not noticeable C: spend more D: rising interest rates E: boring<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>To rule out the irrelevant option, "economic instability" (B). It doesn't make sense to fight inflation, which is a rise in the general price level, if there's economic instability. This removes option (B) from the equation.<n><n>Options "not noticeable" (C) and "boring" (D) don't directly affect the economy in any way. So these options can be ruled out as well.<n><n>The only relevant option is "spend more" (B). When inflation is low, it's unlikely the government would have to spend more on subsidies to offset the cost. Therefore, the economy would be stable and the problem of inflation would be manageable.<n><n>Input:The best way to get exercise when at work is what, because it is better for health? Choices: 	 A: walking B: taking the stairs C: a brisk walk up a hill D: running E: sit-ups and push-ups<n>Output:Reason:<n>The very first thing that stands out is that the options "walking" (A), "taking the stairs" (B) and a "brisk walk up a hill" (D) all require movement on the part of the individual.<n><n>The other option is "sit-ups and push-us" (E). It's unlikely this would be a viable way to get exercise because of the limited space. <n><n>Finally, option "sit-ups" requires more explanation. This would require a dedicated space, which is not realistic to expect in most offices. Therefore, the option of "sit-ups to get exercise" can be ruled out.<n><n>Therefore, the answer is D. The best way to get exercise at work is a "brisk walk".<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the last two multiple choice question.<n>Answer the last two multiple choise questions.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What is necessary for learning by yourself? Choices:  A: exposure B: patience C: study D: cooperation E: thought<n>Output:		 Reasoning:<n>A : Exposure<n>B : Patience<n>C : Study<n>D :  Cooperation<n>E :  Thought<n>The process of learning depends on the motivation, and how one feels about learning is essential to that process.  But there are also techniques that one can use to learn things, and there are even tools or materials one can learn from. Here, the options "study" and "exposure" describe the means one uses to learn. <n><n>On the other hand, "cooperation" (D) describes the people involved in the learning process. The other choices do not refer to people. <n><n>Even the final option, "thought," is about the mental process one should undergo when learning something. <n><n>The correct answer, then, is "exposure", because it refers to learning materials.<n><n>Input: How you can teach something to your team by yourself? Choices : A: patience B: exposure C: focus D: cooperation E : hard work<n><n>Output : Reasoning:<n>The way one can teach things to others is largely dependent on the materials one has to teach, as well as the amount of time one has to teach. <n><n>The options "focus" (C) and "exposure " (A) both refer to time; time is an important ingredient when teaching.<n><n>But "focus" (C), to be precise, only refers to the duration of time. It also depends on what one is teaching.<n><n>The correct answer will be "focus and exposure", because they both refer to time. <n><n>Input: What's the first thing you do when your alarm is ringing? Choices: <n>A: turn off<n>B: open the alarm<n>C:  go back to sleep<n>D: sleep<n>Output: Reason:<n>The first choice, A, is "turn off" (B). The two options are different, and one doesn't necessarily depend on the other.<n><n>On the other side are options D and B. They are options of behaviour after the alarm has rung, and they could both be true. <n><n>Therefore, A is the answer. It is the first thing one does when one's alarm rongs.<n><n>Input: Whats the way we can overcome it? Choices : A : Be calm B : Be patient

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What is a characteristic of thin glass? Choices:  A: break easily B: shattering C: melt D: bend E: hold water<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>"Thin glass" generally refers to glass sheets, panels, or plates that are very thin as compared to other glass products. It is not possible for glass sheets of such a thin thickness to "break easily" - the glass is too thin for it to withstand much pressure or force.<n><n>Option "shattering" (B) is incorrect because the term "shattering" is often used to describe a plate or panel glass that shatters or breaks into small pieces. However, a "thin" glass is not usually broken into small pieces. Thus, this option is incorrect.<n><n>Option "melt" (C) is uncommon because thin glass is also used to produce sheets or panels for products like jewelry, ornaments, or glassware, where it is not typically heated so high that it would melt. Moreover, if the glass was heated high enough, the process would not necessarily be called "melting." Thus, this option is also incorrect.<n><n>Option D) "bend" is a possible choice, but it is incorrect because glass is generally brittle and not pliable or malleable. It is unlikely that a thin glass sheet would "bend," especially if it is made into a panel or plate in thin sections.<n><n>The final option is "hold water" (E). This is a possible characteristic of a thin glass sheet, panel, or plate. Glass is often formed in a thin, flat shape and used to produce sheets or plates. These plates could then be used to serve as plates for water - which would make them capable of "holding" water. Option "hold water" is the best possible answer<n><n>Input:What's the common use of a thermometer? Choices: 	A: cooking B: weather C: detecting a sickness D: temperature reading E: temperature measurement<n>Output: Reason<n><n>Answer: <n>The term "weather thermometer" is commonly used to describe a thermometer that is used specifically for measuring external weather conditions. Outdoor thermometers are commonly used to monitor the temperature outside. The term "weather" could also have an expanded context to refer to a person's general health, which would be related to detecting sickness. However, this is not applicable in the context of an internal organ thermometer reading. <n><n>Meas

He liked being about to divide people into what categories? Choices:  A: winners and losers B: perform better C: might win D: losses E: enemies<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>The first step in answering this question is to determine the purpose behind John's love for competing. This seems obvious enough, as the option stated explicitly states that John liked being able to compete against others. We can eliminate D as well for the same reason, as it suggests John liked losing more over winning, which doesn't make sense in this context.<n><n>The next step is to determine the type of competition John had in mind. The remaining options each focus on different facets of competition, so it is important to consider what type of competition John likes the most. Does he value the skill of his opponents, or does he value himself as a competitor? Does he derive joy from outperforming his competitors, or from outperforming himself? The answer is clear cut.<n><n>The option "perform better" (B) describes John's competition as focusing on performing one's best in a competition, and as such would not suit John's situation.  The options of "winners and losers" (A) and "might win" (C) are both concerned with the outcome of a competition, which implies that John is placing more value in winning than in performing better and it doesn't specify which type of competitions John likes the most, thus they should be eliminated too.<n><n>The only option that best suits the context of the question is "enemies" (E), as it shows the desire to compete against an opponent and is similar to the motive of John's love for competition.<n><n>So the final answer will be E: enemies<n><n>#####################<n><n>Instruction:Answer the following.<n><n>Input:What is the value of x?<n><n>Output: Reasonnning :<n>1,027.48973025951   3,154.52843686097   6,211.58753165662<n>3,154,368,609,7   6,221,588                   47,741<n><n>#####################

Choices:  A: happiness B: lack of money C: stress D: relief E: exhiliration<n>Output:		The correct answer is 'C' stress. Stress refers to our response to a situation, or our emotional state. When we are stressed, we become less capable of coping with various situations and making rational decisions, even when all the information is right in front of us. Therefore, someone feeling stressed won't be able to shop as clearly.<n>Answer choice (A) 'Happiness', does not make sense. Happiness is not the cause of someone not buying presents.<n>Answer choice (B) 'Lack of money' makes sense, but is not specifically stressed out. It says the money is the reason for not buying presents. We should be looking for an answer that refers to someone's emotional state during the holidays, not just 'lack of money'.<n>Answer choice (D) 'Relief' makes some sense when thinking about the cause for not buying presents, but it doesn't refer to feelings of stress brought on by the holiday season.<n>Answer choice (E) 'Exhilaration' makes no sense, as exhilaration is exactly the opposite of a feeling of stress.<n><n>Input:  "That was one of my all-time favorite birthday dinner parties!"" said the man in the red shirt.

But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Joe bought a ficus.  He thought it would look good in what part of his home? Choices:  A: family room B: tropical forest C: flower garden D: movie theater E: hair salon<n>Output:		The question is asking what part of the home Joe bought the ficus for, so naturally, the answer should refer to a part of the home.  Some options would be inappropriate, including a "family room." While "tropical forest" (B) may seem like a valid choice, it's not because only a person who lived a long time ago likely had a "tropical forest."  Similarly, a "movie theater" (D) is not a practical thing to have in one's home.<n>The choices that remain are a "flower garden" (C) and a "hair salon" (E). Option (C) makes sense as a place a plant could be displayed.  While the question never explicitly states so, it also implies that one could place a ficus in a hair salon as a decoration. Hence, there is only one appropriate answer, which is (C): flower garden.<n><n><n>Input:The cashiers are getting low on supplies.  Which of the following could likely happen soon? Choices: A: They could get more supplies from the store B: A staff member could be hired to refill the supplies C: They could begin a special promotion for customers D: A person who knows all of the store's layouts could volunteer E: More customers could start coming in<n>Output:This question wants the reader to select the answer that could likely happen soon.<n>The only answer that has to do with things happening soon is option (E): the special promotion for new customers.  Option (D): the person who knows all of your store's layouts to volunteer is not guaranteed. It could have already been a thing occurring at your store for a while, or it may be something that takes time to set up. The others (A-C) would not be likely to happen now, but would take time for them to occur.  Thus, the correct answer is (E): More customers could start coming into the store.<n><n><n>### Instruction:Answer the questions below.<n><n>Q1. A man is walking towards the town in evening.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Traveling underwater has many dangers, such as low visibility causing what? Choices:  A: disorientation B: due to C: meeting new people D: getting somewhere E: relocation<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>We know low visibility refers to seeing less than the usual amount of light penetration below the ocean surface.<n>So the next task should be to determine why low visibility poses a "danger" to underwater travelers.<n><n>Again, let's eliminate the wrong answers by ruling out all options that aren't dangerous or relate to the concept of "low visibility". <n><n>Option "disorientation" (B) isn't dangerous, as it would only affect the traveler's ability to navigate the environment. While disorientation could result in injury or death under certain circumstances (for example, if the traveler's vehicle crashes), this seems like a stretch. There is no guarantee that disorientation would lead to a crash.<n><n>Option "due to" (C) also isn't dangerous, because "due to" is a modifier for the preceding phrase: underwater traveling. A dangerous act underwater could be caused by something else, such as "water depth" (the first option). Therefore, this option is irrelevant.<n><n>The remaining options are both connected to the idea of "underwater darkness" or "low visibility".  Therefore, it is safe to assume that these options are referring to some form of injury or death. <n><n>Comparing the options, "getting somewhere" (E) is the only direct mention of injury or death, which suggests that it is the correct answer. <n><n>So the final answer choice is E: relocation

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where are there more telephone booths? Choices:  A: gas stations B: city C: london D: train station E: airport<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question refers to the location where "telephone booths" are more likely to be found. <n>This eliminates options B (city) and D (train station).<n><n>Given the context of the question, "gas stations" (A) and "airport" (E) are unlikely options because these locations would not be ideal places to look for a telephone booth - one would need to be on the move to reach a telephone booth while at a gas station and, similarly, at the airport.<n><n>"LONDON" (C) is unlikely to be the answer, because telephone booths are not common in the capital of the United Kingdom.<n><n>The remaining answer options are "london" (E) and "gas stations" (C).<n>Option C (gas stations) is the most probable because telephone booth usage - though not as widespread as it once was - is still fairly common. Additionally, it is fairly common to find a gas station every few blocks or so throughout cities. Therefore, Option C (gas stations).<n><n>Input: what is the difference between a dwarf and an elf? Choices:  elf  gnome dwarf  gnome halfling  gnome dwarve  dwarf and dwarf  elf halfling  elf<n>Output: Reason<n><n>This question refers to the difference between elves and dwarves which can be determined based on context clues such as the terms "elf" and "dwarf."<n><n>Looking at the first character of each word, we can see that an "e" is used in "elf," while an "o" is used in "dwarf," which implies a vowel change. A vowel change is most likely from "o" to "e," indicating an oelves dwarfs. These words are both nouns, implying that no conjugation is expected.<n><n>With this knowledge, options d and a can be eliminated. <n>Additionally, options b and g could eliminate "g" as the first letter. However, there is the possibility of the word "Gnome".<n><n>In the end, the most likely option is Elf + Dwarf = Elfdwarf.<n><n>Input:what are the two numbers whose product is 24? Choices

Choices:  A: further cause B: wave goodbye C: attempt suicide D: insulting them E: thank god<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>Avoid the options that start with a subject. This is because most of the options are nouns.<n><n>Option B, which means "wave goodbye," is not an option because it is unlikely that someone will "address" a person, then "wave" at them later. Besides, the phrase "address someone who is leaving" doesn't make sense.<n><n>The word "insult" is also problematic. If you truly insult someone, you don't expect them to be happy about it. Therefore, it would be irrational for the option with the most negative word ("insult") to choose "insulting them."<n><n>The options E and A involve people using adjectives, not nouns. Although personality qualities can be used to address someone, it wouldn't make sense to choose an option with adjectives in general. Adjectives generally do not appear in sentences containing a subject noun, especially the first one in a sentence.<n><n>Answer: E: thank you<n>Input: In the world of sports, what do teams often do if they beat their opponent?Choices:  A: play another game B: play another game with them C: change the rules D: change the rules with them E: change the location<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>The options C and D should be eliminated. First of all, changing rules to play another game with them or changing rules with them doesn't make sense when you win another "football" or "hackey" game.<n><n>Another point is, changing the location doesn't always mean changing a location. Usually, if your team beats an opponent, the game is over.<n><n>The answer should be E, change the location.<n><n>Answer (E), change the location : "Location" is not related to the rule of football or hackey.<n>Input: What's an example of something you have to put in an envelope? Choices:  L: a letter B: the envelope C: a stamp D: a rubber stamp E: everything except letter stamps<n>Output: Reason : Letters stamps: If you buy a letter stamp at a store, you put the stamp onto an envelope to send mail to someone. The other options, besides the letter stamps, are all related to letters and envelopes.<n><n>The correct answer is

Choices:  A: kick the bucket B: mortal C: dead D: can die E: dying<n>Output:		Reasoned Out:<n><n>Here we observe the phrase "kick the bucket," which is quite ironic as "bucket" is not something that can kick back. Similarly, the term "mortal" carries the meaning of "death" but "mortal" is not the actual term used to describe a being that is death.<n>Now, let's consider all the options one by one to deduce the correct answer:<n><n>- A: Kick the bucket -  The phrase "kick the buckets" is a metaphor for death. So, this one is out.<n>- B: Mortal -  It suggests that a "mortal" creature is able to die and so cannot be immortal. But this is not the answer, since a being that is immortal cannot die is the question.<n>- C: Dead -  This can be eliminated due to the inclusion of the phrase "lacking immortality" in the question. Hence, the answer is not given here.<n>- D: Can die - It is incorrect due to the fact that we are asked about a person who is lacking immortality and not those that are still left with immortality. So, this option is out of scope.<n>- E: Dying - The option is out of the scope due to the fact that the question is looking for the answer about a creature who lacks immortality only.<n><n>So the final answer here is E:Ded.<n>Input:Why do people say that "The straw that broke the camel's back was the nail that was too short"?

Choices:  A: helicopter B: own cars C: speak words D: believe in god E: dance together<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Option (A) is not a feasible choice as most people are not able to fly the helicopter. Similarly, option (C) cannot be an answer, given that most people can't drive their own cars. <n><n>Next, we can eliminate option (D) because the answer does not suggest a physical transportation method - nor does it suggest a belief (like the divine). It's more of a way of getting around obstacles.<n><n>Only options (B) and (E) remain. However, they are both vague when it comes to transportation - that is, moving from one place to the other. So the answer to this question is most likely E.<n>So the final choice is E: dance together<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the multiple choice question.<n>

Choices:  A: wedding B: tennis C: closet D: left foot E: house<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The key thing here is to identify options that make no sense. Option "house", for example, is obviously incorrect because white shoes don't go with houses.<n><n>However, if the question is asking for places to wear white shoes, option "D" (left foot) isn't actually incorrect. It just provides a new context to the question. From that perspective, the options "A", "B", and "C" (all wedding-based contexts) should be eliminated.<n><n>As for the option "E" (closed foot), it doesn't make any sense if you look at it from a general perspective. It's not a logical or common concept to "close" a foot.<n><n>In the end, all the options except "E" (house) should be eliminated because they make no sense. So the final answer should be B: tennis court<n><n>Input: Do you know what I don’t have anymore? Choices: A: a pet B: a cat C: a dog D: something E: an elephant<n>Output:<n><n>It turns out that this isn't a real question. 🗿Instead, all options except "A" (a pet) should be eliminated; the question asks for what the person in the scenario doesn't have anymore.<n><n>In the case of option "D" (something), the phrase "don't have anymore" is misleading. The person who's asking the question may be talking about something that was lost or stolen. This is why option "A" (a lost pet) should be eliminating.<n><n>As for option "C" (an elephant), that can only be found in a zoo. It makes no sense if you look at the scenario from the context of someone having a lost pet. They wouldn't have an elephant when they lost their pet.<n><n>By the end, the questions should only be "A" (lost pet), or you are talking to a person with a lost pet. The other options are either ambiguous or irrelevant to the scenario.<n><n>Input:Where should we meet for a coffee? Choices: A. At midnight B.

The first two options, "Indiana" (A) and "England" (B), are unrealistic because the narrator is described as viewing the scene through an interior window.<n><n>The third option, "on the wall" (C), would be most probable for an interior scene. However, option C was likely eliminated from consideration based on the first two options, since it is not a viable option and can only have a single answer.<n><n>The remaining options are "picture" (D) and "outside" (E). The choice "picture" (D), as the only remaining one, is the most likely response.

In fact, a person who is disabled is given the same priority as all the other groups, so it is not a priority in itself. Moreover, a person who is short is not mentioned as the main priority. It is more likely that a person who is old is preferred than a person who is disabled or short.<n><n>Option B, "a person who is pregnancy", is also eliminated, because a person who is pregancy is not a person who needs "priority whenever possible" compared to other peices of information.

So, let's rule out the options that are related to a non-academic activity.<n><n>Option "tired feet", (B) is ruled out, as the answer is not going to be walking around or walking from exhibit to another just because that could be very time consuming and not productive.<n><n>Option "being bored", (E) is also ruled out, since the purpose of a museum is to learn things and not just stare at the exhibits until they get bored.<n><n>Option "gaining knowledge", (C) is a reasonable answer, so is already in consideration.<n><n>The last two options can be ruled out with some more reasoning.<n><n>Option "back pain" (D) is a very far-fetched answer, since a backache might prevent a person from going any further with their education.

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:If an animal is tired, what is it likely to do? Choices:  A: bite B: lie down C: keep alive D: need to eat E: go to sleep<n>Output:		Instruction :answer the question<n><n>Input: If an animal is tired, it is likely to do what? Choices: A: bite B : need to eat C: going to sleep D: keep alive E: lie  down<n>Output: Instruction: Reasoning: This time, the second and third options are the same, which is "need to eat," so it can be safely eliminated as an answer to the question.  Now, all that is left is to determine which of the first three options is more likely to be the correct answer.<n><n>"Bit" (B) doesn't fit well in this context. The first thing you would think of when an animal is tired is something more restful, like sleeping. Therefore, "sleeping" (C) should be considered the correct answer.<n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what?

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:When would you be able to see your reflection in a piece of wood? Choices:  A: burned B: polished C: carved D: composted E: nailed<n>Output:		Reasoning: <n><n>Option A: "burned" (B) immediately falls out of the running due to not being relevant information - someone might be reflective on something after they burned it, but they wouldn't be reflecting on the thing itself.<n><n>Option B: "polished" (C) is another possibility to look at. As a noun, "polish" often refers to a smoothed, shiny gloss. One could interpret the reflection of a carved, cut, and polished piece of wood to indicate one has accomplished the task of designing and creating said wood piece. In other words, "polish" could mean "success." Given this option would have been the one to choose, the correct answer should be C: polish.<n><n>Input: What is another name for "the first day of school?"<n>Choices:  A: the first days of school<n>B: the day before the first day of school<n>C: the last day of school<n>D: the first week of school<n>E: the first semester<n>Output:Reason: <n><n>Option "the last day of school" (C) cannot apply, since the question is about the first day/first day of school.<n><n>Options "the day before the first day" (A) and "first week of school" (D) are incorrect because they refer to additional information - it doesn't tell you what the first day is, it tells you what's happening before and after. As such, since there is no specific or particular day referred to in the choice, it is incorrect.<n><n>We can disregard the next couple of options "the day before the last day" (E) and "the first semester" (F) as they both do not apply since they pertain to the same day which is different than the first day, and they both also have no reference to the previous day or information that the previous question didn't mention.<n><n>So the option that is left is "The first day of school (B). Since this answer is the only one referring to the "first day of school" it must be correct. <n><n>Input: The following is a list of countries in the world. Canada, France, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Philippines, the United States<n>Choices: 1. Spain<n>2. Italy<n>3. Colombia<n>4. the United Kingdom<n>5.
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where is basketball court likely to be outdoors? Choices:  A: high school gymnasium B: city C: park D: use E: los angeles<n>Output:		Reasoned:<n><n>The context of this question clearly depicts the situation of a city. A basketball court is a sporting facility usually within a city limits, so its reasonable to assume that answer B- "City," is the correct response.<n><n>Input:Whats the population on Mars? Choices: A: around 8,500 B: about 200 C: approx. D: about 1000 E: around 2<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>The key to answering this question is to identify the relevant information at play in the scenario. Specifically, the question mentions the information about Mars, which is a planet and not a country as in answer choice B (city ).<n>However, this information about Mars does not have the context needed to answer the prompt and would require further clarification. The prompt itself, however, only provides an answer choice of around 2 (c).<n><n>This suggests that the correct answer choice is A, at around 8,560 inhabitants.<n><n>Input:What is the temperature of the ocean at this time of year? Choices: A,50 C. B, 75 F C, 75 D, around 80<n>Output: Reasoner:<n><n>The wording of this question is vague and requires rephrasing to understand the scenario. It's unlikely that there are no temperature ranges, but instead that there are several temperature ranges or a specific range within a set of temperature ranges.<n><n>This answer choice makes the most sense because it provides a specific temperature range. Therefore, it is the most accurate answer for the question.<n><n>Input : Why did the scientist want to do this research? Choices: A : to learn more about B: to teach more about C: to learn more about D: to do more about E: to improve more about<n>Output: Reason<n><n>This question has multiple options, but it's important to note that the word "to" is present in all the answer choices. For example, answer choice A says that the scientist wants to "learn more about." This answer choice is incorrect because the subject pronoun " to " is not used properly in this context.<n>Option B mentions "teaching" instead of learning. However, the subject pronoun "to" is present again and is incorrect in terms of meaning as well as grammar. Answer choice D is also incorrect because this answers

Choices:  A: radio station B: recording studio C: concert D: tv studio E: new york<n>Output:		Reason:Microphone boom used to record music usually in recording studio.<n><n>Input: What will the people in the video do if a bird flies in front of them? Choices: <n>A: Move the car B: move away the bird C: move the video around <n>D: move the bird E: move the camera<n>Output: Reason The people will move the video instead of car because the video was inside the car.<n><n>Input: How do you get on the next train after you buy a ticket at ticket machine? Choices: 	A: Buy the ticket first and then find the next train. <n>	B: Open the gate first then enter the train C: Enter the train first then buy the ticket D: Buy the ticket and only when ready to leave, go to the ticket machine to get the ticket E: Open the gate at the gate and then go inside the train<n>Output: Reason Open the gate at the entrance of the station that was told in (Answer - B) and enter to the train  if the gate were still close then open it and if already opened then go to the gate and enter the gate to train and if you were already in the train then close it again before leaving because it is not allowed to open and close in the middle of the train and if you open or close in the middle then you will get a fine or get arrested for breaking the rules.<n>```<n>

Choices:  A: you're bored B: pass time C: relax D: mentally challenged E: win<n>Output:		reasoning:<n>Answer is option E.<n>Option A cannot be eliminated, as there is a possibility that he may actually be bored (even if unrealistically unlikely).<n>Option B is also ruled out. In order for it to be true, he would have to be doing crossword puzzles just to pass the time. But he cannot be doing crossword puzzle in order to kill more time, because he seems to be doing the puzzle every morning.<n>Option D is also ruled out, as doing the crossword puzzle every day cannot be regarded as a mentally challenging activity if it's only for fun.<n>And finally, option E is the correct answer. Crossword puzzles can be a fun way to exercise the mind, as well as increase cognitive functions such as memory recall which can be beneficial as one grows older. <n><n>So option E : Crossword puzzle everyday for old people.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What would an adult man do to get ready for work? Choices:  A: dress herself B: shower C: dress himself D: drink beer E: drive train<n>Output:		Choice: Dress himself<n><n>Reasoning:<n>We can understand that this question is not about what man would do in modern times for work. Nowadays, a woman can go to work just as well as a man can. We also know that "drink beer" (E) is not on the list since he doesn't have to get ready. There is not enough information in this question to choose "dress himself" (D).<n><n>The answer is either "Showers" (b) or "Drives train" (c). Both options show a level of independence from the father. So we want to know if they prefer to shower themselves or drive the train by themselves (i.e. on the road to work).<n><n>The answer to the question comes when we think of the children's relationship with the father. We can infer that they probably use the father as a role model in terms of their work ethic and independence in general.<n>If "Soon" is considered, we can think of the father driving his children to work. But it's unlikely the father is the main driver of the boys. In this way, option C becomes the most likely choice.<n><n>Finally, we find that the most likely choice is Dress himself.<n><n>Input: If a girl is on a date and his parents are not home, then his parents are probably? Choices: 1: on a dinner date 2: walking a dog 3: at a movie 4: playing poker 5: playing soccer<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>Choices 1, 2 and 4 can be ruled out because these activities are for couples only. Choice 3, playing soccer, is probably too boring even for the parents of a teenage boy. Choice 5, soccer, sounds like a good activity for the parents of a boy as well. But that does not answer the girl's question.<n><n>So the answer can only be Choice 5: Playing soccer.<n><n>Output: The question is "What did the girl's date want her mother and father to be doing?" The answer is "Play hockey". From a girl's perspective, the most important thing about a date would be what the parent's were doing. This is the important question and the other options are irrelevant to the main one.<n><n>A computer game is

That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Simon bought a cow because he wanted to put it to work.   He didn't want any meat for it.  Where might Simon be taking the cow? Choices:  A: countryside B: city C: dairy farm D: butcher shop E: canada<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>Simon bought the cow to put it to work, but he doesn't want any of it's meat. The cow would be sent to a dairy farm, where the cow's milk is milled and other products are made by the milk. <n><n>Input: Simon asked his friend to describe the dog he had seen.   Simon's friend said the dog had an orange coat and a blue tail. Simon wanted to call the dog what color? Choices:  a:blue b:orange c:grey d:none<n>Output: Reasonningen:<n><n>Simon asked for his friend to describe the color of the dog. He told him is was orange and blue. If someone describes a color by it's complementary color, it means the color you're looking for is the original one. <n><n>Thus the right answer to the question is option B: orange.<n><n>

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:If I want to maximize my number of potential customers, where should I build a new department store? Choices:  A: idaho B: shopping mall C: big city D: in town E: new york<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>This question contains a clue about the context: "In short, when I open a new department store, I want to attract the largest number of customers possible." It's the context and the verb "should" that provide the clue that the answer is E: in New York.<n><n>Notice that other choices do not mention "build a new department store" as a potential option. That immediately eliminates D, because that answer does not address the question.<n><n>The context of the question is further strengthened by the phrase "new department store," which is the central focus of the question. The answer that does mention a new department store would be B, because "new" in a business context typically suggests something that offers a better or improved option. Offering the best option for your customers is a logical interpretation, thereby making B the correct answer.<n>So the final outcome is new york<n><n>Input: The best kind of shoes are made from which material? Choices: 	A: paper B: rubber C: cloth D: leather E: bamboo<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>The answer is D. Leather shoes protect the wearer from wet weather conditions while offering a stylish appearance. These shoes are commonly used for casual wear.<n><n>Notice how the answer options contain no qualifier about their quality or affordability. Also, other alternatives such as rubber shoes are not offered as an option. That's because their appearance would not necessarily be as attractive as that of leather shoes.<n><n>The context provided in the question refers to a person who has been shopping for shoes, indicating that their preference is for leather shoes. Therefore, no other material would work for this person.<n>Finally, leather shoes are often more expensive than other materials used to make shoes. That qualifier does not need to be mentioned in the answer because it is unnecessary here and because that qualifier is already assumed.<n>So the final output is The best kind of shoos are made from leather<n><n>Input: When looking for job satisfaction, who has the greatest chance of success: an employee who works alone, for example a janitor, or an employee working in teams?Choices:  A: alone: B: teams: C: janitor: D: employer: E: company<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>Option A would appear

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:I'm at a restaurant ans want a glass of milk, how do I find out if they serve that? Choices:  A: accompaniment to meal B: waitress C: cafeteria D: home E: menu<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option A (accompaniment to meal) is incorrect because even if they serve milk as an accompaniment, customers can buy milk from a cashier or at a counter or by dialing the phone or asking another waitress etc.<n><n>Option B (waitress) is correct because if a customer asks a waitress about milk, the waitress can call a cashier to check whether they serve milk or not.<n><n>Option C (cafeteria) is incorrect because customers cannot ask that question in a cafeteria line.<n><n>The problem statement suggests that customers are in a restaurant waiting to be served by their waitress.<n><n>Therefore, the correct choice is B: waitress.<n>

Choices:  A: building B: friend's house C: classroom D: window E: front door<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Again we need to interpret the entirety of the situation as an indicator of the correct choice. What could the dog be barking at? It's clear that it's facing the window - so it's in front of it. There's a chance that it could be barking at something in front of the window, but it's more likely that the dog is reacting to something across the street. If we look at the context and figure out the situation, we may decide that "presence across the street" is the most likely correct answer, and that "presence at a friend's house" (C) is too far-fetched.<n><n>The option "friends' house" (C) involves two distinct concepts that make no sense when looked at together: friends and houses. A person's presence at a friend's place is unlikely to elicit such a reaction from a dog. Another option, "presence across the road" (E), is similar in incorrectness to (E), but also involves the unnecessary concept of a "place" between the dog and the building. In contrast, the only correct answer combines the concept that the dog is barking at something it sees, which can be construed as a presence, while giving a clear indication of location with the phrase "a presence at the window."<n>So the correct option is A: building<n><n># Task 3<n>## A.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where can someone keep a digital file? Choices:  A: suitcase B: filing cabinet C: computer D: desk drawer E: cloud<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>This question has several potential pitfalls for testers, and its intentional ambiguity.<n><n>There are many places in this lab to keep electronic files; for instance, on a flash drive could qualify and would answer the question.<n><n>It's important to note, however, that the phrase "computer file" is a red herring. This is because it assumes that a single "file" is the only place we can keep a file. In the question, we want the answer to "What can we keep a digital file in," not what types of files we can put on our computer.<n><n>Here's another possible choice that can trip testers up: "In a cloud?" (E). By using the word "in" here, testers might assume that this refers to files in virtual storage, such as Google Drive.<n><n>It should also be mentioned that there is no such thing as a "computer file" or a "computer disk," a term that appears in the possible answers. That's another red herring, which testers can quickly identify as the correct answer. If it's a question about a flash drive, then any answer that uses a disk/drive is incorrect, regardless of the topic (which might include anything from files to data).<n><n>So in this particular scenario, the final option is C. It is the correct answer because any place you can store a flash drive constitutes a possible answer here.<n><n>#### Reasoning:<n>```<n>Input:What is a computer memory stick? Choices: <n>A: type of computer hardware <n>B: type of memory <n>C: a way to write documents onto computer <n>D: a large storage space <n>E: a piece of computer hardware that can hold data <n>Output:Reason:<n>```<n><n>The word "memory stick" can refer to a specific type of computer hardware or a broader definition that includes multiple types of computer hardware. The phrase, "computer memory stick" should be interpreted as a more general term, or a "computer" that is a general-purpose device.<n><n>Therefore, A and B would be incorrect, since the word "memory" doesn't refer to a type of computer hardware. It's important to remember that the context here is a computer. <n><n>C, D, and E are acceptable answers in general terms. They would all qualify
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:i like to examine different things,why do books the chapters on the back Choices:  A: examine thing B: go somewhere C: knit D: read book E: see particular program<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>A person usually doesn't examine a thing, especially an object, on their back.<n>Also, someone would usually examine something from the front, like looking at the title of a book on the shelf.<n>So the correct answer is A.<n><n>A person usually turns a book over in their hand to read the chapter title on the back.<n>If the person is really interested in what a chapter is titled, they read the back cover or even the preview of the book.<n>Therefore, D would be the correct answer. A and B are both wrong.<n>

Choices:  A: art room B: police station C: classroom D: desk drawer E: school<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>The answer can be found by recognizing and eliminating irrelevant options. The most immediately obvious is "building" in option A (as the word "building" is not an antonym for "glue" and the option does not specify the type of building). Eliminate all options that are not related to "glue" or "building" using logic, as "school" (E) is about education and "desk drawer" (D) and "classroom" (C) are about desks. This leaves you with only the correct answer of "art room" (B). <n><n>### Input:Why are there so many people in our community that need the help we have been giving? Choices: 1: Because most of them are students and do not have jobs. 2: 3: We are getting more help from the government. 4: We are going to other communities when their people come to us looking for help. 5: 6: 7: Because there are not enough resources in our community to take care of every people so we must find help from other communities. 8: 9: 10: Because there is more crime in our communities and more of them break into each other homes.<n>Output: Reasonining:<n><n>In the context of the question, the people in need of help are those who are "in our community". Eliminate all options relevant to places outside "our community".<n><n>For choice 4, "when" implies the person who needs help did not come to the community (i.e. came from somewhere else). This is an incorrect option, because from the context it is implied that their help came from the community.<n><n>For choice 5, the sentence structure is wrong. The answer needs to be one word, followed by a verb and an end mark (i.e. period). This format requires the phrase "there are not enough resources..." to be a separate, stand-alone sentence, which also is not true.<n><n>For choice A, it may be possible that a student does not have a job, but would they likely need help if they already have a job? This option is eliminated as an incorrect answer.<n><n>Next we can look for the most correct choice and the least incorrect choice.<n><n>The first correct choice with the least incorrect choices is B: We are going to another community when their people

Choices:  A: dance B: getting drunk C: meet new people D: having fun E: have fun<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The most relevant words in this question are "guys" and "meet".<n>Those would indicate the only suitable option as "C"- meet new people.<n>The other options can be disregarded due to no mention of "new" in them.<n><n>There are also indications of the negative sentiment towards the party, with words like "didn't like to go".<n><n>However, the given choice is  "having fun".<n><n>This choice does not seem correct considering the context.<n><n>Even though the word "fun" was in the question, it is more likely to refer to "having fun" with the party itself.<n><n>In conclusion, the given choice is incorrect and the correct answer in this question is "C" - meet new people.<n><n>Input:The scientists had run an analysis, and then applied that knowledge.  They came up with a new theory because they used what data and what information analysis? Choices: <n>A:  the information analysis that they do <n>B: they used their knowledge to run an analysis<n>C:  the information gathered from the new data<n>D: none of these are used in the new theory<n>Output: Reason<n><n>The question states the scientists used data and analysis to construct a new theory, so only the second and third options in the choices have relevant data points.<n><n>The second option mentions "the information analysis", which is redundant and can be disregarded.<n>Option B mentions "they used their knowledge to run the analysis", which seems correct but fails to pin down the answer.<n><n>This leaves the option "C" only relevant in the question.<n><n>It clearly states that the new data and information used in the analysis led to a new theory, so this would be the correct answer to the question. Thus, answer choice D is incorrect.<n><n>So the final answer in this question is <n>C: They used the information gathered from the <n>new data and their analysis

Choices:  A: good health B: heart attacks C: relaxation D: rest E: fatigue<n>Output:		Exercise is a valuable tool for both mental and physical well-being. A few benefits of exercise include improving cardiovascular health, reducing stress levels, and promoting cognitive function, among others. However, all types of exercise have varying health benefits, and the effects of exercise can vary widely from person to person.<n><n>Input:A group of 5 people on a hike each have a different amount of time left until they have to return to the city for their next class. Choices: Each must take their turn at the top of the list until all students have had a chance to return to the city. Output: A: The list of people in order of when they must return to the city should be: Bob, Samantha, John, and finally Emily. B: The list of people should be changed so that Sam runs faster while Emily runs slower until Emily arrives first. C: The list of people is changed so that Emily travels faster until she is first to the city. D: Each person in the group is given exactly the same amount of time until they have to return. E: Each person in the list must always try to be one person ahead of the last. Reasoning: Emily has to travel faster than everybody else. If she can travel at exactly the same speed as anybody else she can simply stay at the same station and not be faster.<n><n>Output: Emily has to be first in the list so she must travel faster than anybody else.<n>Input:What is the average length of a trip according to the schedule? Choices: A: Four and a half weeks B: Four weeks C: Five days D: Seven days E: Forty five seconds Reasoning: If no person is faster or slower than anybody else it always takes the 20 people exactly the same to get to the city. From this it is known that each person needs exactly 20 * 20/19 - 1 = about 514 days to get to the city (each man has the same number of trips). Therefore the average length of time for a trip is 514 / 20 days = 25 per trip.<n><n>Input:How many days longer did John take than the average?

Choices:  A: farm B: business district C: car D: amusement park E: urban area<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>I will explain each possible answer in order of likeliness:<n>Option 1: If I "Use a parking lot," then I must "be going" to a place near the parking lot. In this case, my parking lot lies in an area that includes one or many places of amusement, such as an amusement park, carnival, or fair.<n>Option 2: However, if I were only in "a parking lot near a train station," then my parking lot doesn’t lie in an area that includes any places of amusement. I could leave my car there and take a train to whatever city I was traveling to, and then walk around that city until I found another parking lot somewhere in the business district to park again. So option 2 is thus irrelevant.<n>Option 3: I might use a parking lot that’s near some houses, such as a suburban parking lot or a housing area apartment complex, but these aren't the type of places people associate with amusement or roller coasters. So option 3 is irrelevant.<n>Option 4: Similarly, I might use a parkin lot that lies near a car dealership. While a car dealership might have rides intended for a child (e.g. monster truck rides or go-carts), it’s unlikely that a parking lot near such a business would be so near to a "roller coaster." So option 4 is irrelevant.<n>Option (5): Finally, the last option is the correct one. Option 5 is "business district."<n><n>Input:Which of the following do you use to control the temperature in a steam iron? Choices:  B: a small plastic button A: a large black knob C: a large round knob D: a large silver lever E: a small silver dial<n>Output:Reasonning :<n><n>This one seems confusing. However, all of the options relate to the use of a steam iron, and there seems to be a contradiction between A and B. If one were to use a steam iron to control the temperature, then the control would be large, and it would not be a "small plastic button." This eliminates B as a possibility. The choice between C or D is a matter of preference. If one prefers a large lever rather than a small dial,

"Hunter" (A) and "fisher" (E) are hunting related, whereas the other options all involve shopping.<n>Therefore, the correct answer is D.<n><n>Input:  If there is a battle between a fish and a pig, which animal would win? Choices: A. Pig B. Fish C. Horse D. Frog E. Donkey <n>Output: Reasonng:<n><n>To determine the answer, it's helpful to look at the given context of the question as well as the options for the animal that would win.<n>The context invokes a "battle" between animals. To be considered victorious (i.e. to be "winning") in a battle, the animals would have to defeat the other in combat.<n>Further, it isn't as simple as comparing the strengths of the animals - it's the abilities that matter, since these abilities are what make them able to win.<n>"Pig" (B), for example, does not have a natural ability to swim - a crucial skill to survive in the ocean should the two animals end up there.<n><n>Therefore, the logical answer is Frog (E) since the frog is an amphibious creature and can swim.

Choices:  A: fairy tale B: castle C: middle ages D: chess board E: doll house<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>This question's answer is not a simple matter of choosing the correct option. Some options seem more likely than others. It may seem tempting to jump to choice C (middle ages), but we must look carefully at the context of the question and the clues in the passage to determine how likely it is that the knight would be found there.<n><n>A key clue that points to castle (B) is that the knight is "in a castle." This suggests that he may be found there, since a castle is a place where knights often dwell. By contrast, a fairy tale (A) and a chess board (C) are less likely places for the knight to be found, as they don't have a direct association with being a knight.<n><n>Even more helpful is the fact that the middle ages (D) is the correct answer. This reinforces the likelihood of the knight being found in a castle, as the two concepts are closely intertwined. With these considerations in mind, the answer to the question is castle (B).<n>So the correct answer is B: castle<n><n>Input:Is the house cold in the winter? Choices:  H: yes. M: no. G: is this question irrelevant?<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>This type of question is based on a specific scenario, with a clear "yes" or "no" answer.<n>The correct answer is "yes" (H).<n>So the correct choice for this question is: H:<n><n>Input: What has 5 arms? Choices:  G: a spider A: an octopus B: a monkey C: a centipede D: a human<n>Output:Reasonings:<n><n>This question, like the previous one, is a scenario-based one. A "spider" has many legs, but not arms. Likewise, a "human" is known to have 2 sets of arms, while an octopus has 8.<n>The correct answer, therefore, is "a centipede" (C).<n>So the choice is: C: Centi = one Pede = foot<n><n>Input: What grows more, a banana, or a cherry? Choices:  B: banana C: cherries D: bananas<n>Output:Reasoninsg:<n><n>In this question, the clues provided are not
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What might two people competing get into? Choices:  A: stress B: debate C: argument D: winning or losing E: tension<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The premise of the question is that two people are competing on some kind of test or task, and that the stakes are high so that a win or a loss matters greatly. In such a situation, the two competitors may get into an argument or debate, but they are unlikely to engage in a battle or to get into stress.  Option E seems like the most plausible, given the context.<n><n>Option B however can be disregarded because stress in this situation wouldn't be caused by an argument between two people, but instead by the high-pressure context of the situation itself.<n><n>Option C and D can also be ignored because an argument does not necessarily imply stress, while two people engaging in a debate over something does not necessarily come to blows. Similarly, stress does not necessarily lead to a debate or argument, but only to "an increased mental and/or physical anxiety caused by a situation perceived as stressful."<n><n>So the final answer would be E: tension<n><n>Input: The farmlands were in abundance for the locals.

Choices:  b: Dubai  c: New York  d: London  e: New Zealand Answer:<n> <n>Output: Reasons::<n><n><n> The correct Answer is C) New York. As per the options provided we can see she isn't in London and New York isn't the one she got her job in, so the options b & d can be excluded. So, it will come to options A,C & E. The only option from which the sentence talks of "

Choices:  A: front door B: conference C: classroom D: refrigerator E: suitcase<n>Output:		Reason to answer<n>A paper notice on a house can be left in several different places.<n>An option that eliminates all the remaining options is the conference (B). <n><n>The next option we'll consider is the front door (A). <n>Here, we see two scenarios as opposed to one. <n><n>In one scenario, someone knocks on the door to find out what type of note they left in the house, which doesn't fit the statement. <n>In the other scenario, the paper notice is left in a place where it won't get damaged. Although it is possible that a note is left on the fridge (D) in this way, it doesn't eliminate the remaining options.<n><n>Next, we will consider if the note is left near the conference room (B). <n>Here, there is no damage possible. <n>Notice that the paper notice isn't on the conference desk.<n>It's an unlikely scenario that the paper notice was left directly on a conference room's table. <n><n>The last three remaining options are B, D, E. <n>If the note was left on a suitcase in the classroom (E), then a child in the classroom might damage it. <n>But the suitcase could be kept in a place where it can't be touched easily. <n>The last remaining option is D: refrigeration. The note can be attached on the fridge door. After reading the entire answer, the right answer is E.<n>It is a "refrigerator" (the correct Answer).

Choices:  A: africa B: north pole C: roof D: canada E: surface of earth<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Africa is not a continent that is always covered in snow; on the contrary, many African countries, such as Namibia and Tunisia, experience relatively mild weather all year round. Moreover, the continent's southern states can see temperatures reaching 30°C in the summer, which means that they are never covered in snow.<n><n>Canada, on the other hand, experiences a fairly varied climate, ranging from the extremely cold North to the mild south. This means that although it is not impossible for Canada to have snow on its surface, such as during winter, it cannot be classified as "always having snow".<n><n>At the surface of the Earth, we do not always see snow – in fact, only about 10% of our planet's surface is covered in snow year-round. With this in mind, the most accurate answer to this question would be "surface of the Earth" (E).<n><n>Input:Who created the chinese zodiac? Choices:  H: jesus C: marie J: joseph M: moses S: star of bethlehem<n>Output: Reason<n><n>The chinese zodiac signs are not named after a single individual, but rather, have several possibilities. The term "Jesus" (C) is a common name, but it's important to note that it can also simply refer to "Jesus Christ" which is a title rather than a name. The same can be said for "Moses" (M), as it can simply refer to "Moses the prophet" or another significant figure. "Christ" and "Moses" are not proper names in the sense of a first or last name, but rather, are titles that represent the religious individuals.<n><n>"Star of Bethlehem" (S) is an astronomical term rather than a proper name, and "Joseph" (J) and "Marie" (C) are both common names that could be given to several people.<n><n>The only answer that can be ruled out is "Bethlehem" (J), as this is a place name rather than a proper name.<n><n>Therefore, the most accurate answer would be "Star of Bethlehem".<n><n>Input:What does the greek word “chiron” translate to in the english language?

Choices:  A: ocean B: desk C: universe D: attic E: chair<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question's instruction directs us to choose where a light would be placed, implying that the light is a physical object that can actually be placed somewhere. Since it is not physically possible to place a light in the universe (which encompasses space and everything that exists within it), this eliminates choice C. Choice D (attic) is another improbable placement for a light, because attics are usually high up by the ceiling, and light fixtures are generally low down; therefore, lights are not typically placed in attics. <n><n>There is no mention in the question about a ceiling or ceiling fixture, so it is most likely not in the ceiling. Since the universe choice is out but not the ceiling, the next most logical place would be on the desk where the light is not impeded from being seen (A). <n><n>Input: What would you see inside Mom's fridge if you opened it? Choices: 1: Bread 2: Milk 3: Eggs 4: Baked beans 5: Ice cream<n>Output: Reason<n><n>Here we have a question where the answer choices don't make any sense if you consider the context. Imaging a mom's fridge as a real object and being the mom's child, would you really find bread, eggs and ice cream in there? If Mom is a fan of milk and beans, then that's perfectly logical for her fridge I guess. If not, then I suppose it's possible to find ice cream, bread, beans and eggs in there.<n><n>It's a very specific and odd question from the beginning.

Choices:  A: air B: water C: earth D: space shuttle E: tunnel<n>Output:		Reason: <n><n>This question is asking which location would be best for monitoring the level of oxygen in an environment.<n><n>The location that contains the most oxygen is the air, as it is primarily composed of gas. This eliminates the first (B) and third (D) choices.<n><n>Next, the tunnel (E) is the least likely choice. While it may be possible that the level of oxygen is monitored in some tunnels, it wouldn't be the typical place to do so. Tunnel environments are often considered high-risk environments and may require specialized monitoring equipment. Therefore, the correct answer is A: air<n><n><n>Input:Which one is bigger: a pimple or a mole? Choices:  a pimple B: a mole C: an eyelash D: a hair E: a zit<n>Output: Reason : <n><n>This question asks which of two objects is larger in size.<n><n>Option A is the choice for the answer because it means "blemish" rather than"a mole". There are two definitions in the Oxford dictionary for "mole" but none pertain to the definition of a blemish. Therefore, this answer is the only logical one because it is one of the only two choices.<n><n>While option B and D both describe moles, option B gives no further information so we don't know when it says "a pimple" whether it's referring to a small, blemish such as a pimple, or a large, flat area. That makes this a wrong answer.<n><n>Option E also means "blemish" meaning they are one in the same. This makes option C also not a correct answer because it is a blemish and not a mole. <n><n>Therefore, the only correct answer is A: blemish.<n><n><n>

Choices:  A: practice B: dexterity C: idle time D: knowledge of music E: conductor<n>Output:		Reason:  The reason is to make the final choice D. When a person plays a musical instrument, it requires dexterity, which means that one uses one's hands and fingers skillfully and quickly. The book is not a musical instrument, as such. Therefore, if one is fiddling around in a musical book, one is making use of one's idle time and conductor. <n><n>Input:  A man is waiting for a bus which will take him to town.

How might she come off? Choices:  A: cold B: unfamiliar C: unknown D: unacquainted E: shy<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>We are all familiar with the idiom "cold shoulder". It refers to a person who refuses to respond, to refuse to socialize. Therefore, it is possible that Mary's behavior could be construed as "cold" or "unwelcoming".<n>On the other hand, option "unfamiliar" (B), implies that Mary does not know James, and therefore would likely be polite if they met. As such, this option is incorrect.<n>Option "unknown" (C) carries an inherent negative connotation, as the word "known" implies. It refers to a person with whom a person has a good relationship or prior association, and could lead people to think that Mary doesn't know James at all, which will make them suspicious.<n>This leaves us with "shy" (D) and "unacquainted" (E) as accurate options. The word "acquainted" refers to a casual relationship with someone, which sounds about right.<n>So the answer to this question would be D: shy and E: unacquaintance<n><n>So the final answer:<n><n>Better understanding and Shy

Choices:  A: slender B: free flowing C: sparse D: unacquainted E: diet<n>Output:		Reasonning: <n><n>There are several possible answers to this question. One solution would be to select the answer that's most likely for the given category of people, in this case, "thick". However, looking at the context of the question, there is a more literal interpretation: what might someone want to be, if they're thick? The answer that fits this interpretation best is "slender", the opposite of thick.<n><n>Input: Who is the tenth president of US? Choices: 1: Abraham Lincoln 2: John F. Kennedy 3: Bill Clinton 4: George W. Bush 5: James Monroe<n>Output: Reason: <n><n>This question is a classic stumper, requiring the test taker to keep in mind the full context of the situation to come up with a good answer.<n><n>There are a number of possible answers to this question, but in this case, the answer is clearly "George W. Bush".<n><n>The question asks which of five past presidents a certain person has met. There's nothing in the text that says that person is currently in power. It would even be possible for the person to have met an entire list of presidents other than the tenth, because the question isn't really asking which of those specific individuals are the tenth president. The person could have met the first president instead, or the most recent president.<n><n>So the person has met at least five past presidents, but doesn't say which. The options include all the presidents listed. It's fairly likely that the person met the tenth president, who isn't Lincoln or Kennedy - both are past presidents, so that list is ruled out. That leaves Clinton, Bush (43) and Bush (41), making "George W." the best possible explanation for this part of the question.<n><n>Input :Which country is the largest in Europe? Choices:  ___:Austria ___:France ____:Prague ___:Switzerland<n>Output: Reason : <n><n>Although there are several possible answers to the question, the text clues lead us to only one realistic solution: Switzerland, which is the largest country in Europe and not France.<n><n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What is made out of only one piece? Choices:  A: jigsaw puzzle B: chess game C: puzzle box D: jigsaw puzzel puxxle E: puxxle<n>Output:		<n>Option A (jigsaw puzzle) is actually a type of puzzle box, which is enclosed. <n>Option D (jigsaw puzzel px) is not correct, as there are two letters in the middle.<n>Option E (chess set) may not be wrong, but it is not specified what is made out of what, how and from whom. So the final answer is C: puzzle box<n><n>Input:If every number you name is already on my list, how many different numbers can you name before I call "Stop"?

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What happens to the conscience of someone who has been caught committing a murder? Choices:  A: jail time B: fear C: going to prison D: nothing E: feeling of guilt<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>To answer this question, it is important to understand how conscience works. Most people generally see guilt as the consequence of committing a bad/wrong/murdered act. A guilty conscience would make a person feel bad about what they have done.<n><n>Fear of punishment is not part of feeling guilty, but another response which usually follows feeling guilty. Therefore, for the question, conscience would feel guilty, not fear of punishment. Hence, our final answer is that for someone who has been caught in a murder, his/her conscience would be guilty, not fear of guilt.<n><n>Input:Which of the following is true about the human body’s immune system? Choices:  This option: It prevents every new disease. This option: It always starts working immediately after contact with disease-invading pathogens. This option: It is highly efficient at keeping the body’s systems clean. This option: Its efficiency decreases over time. This option: It cannot get stronger.<n>Output:Reasonings:<n><n>This option: It prevents every single new disease.<n><n>To know that human body’s immunity cannot prevent every disease, I have to understand how immunity works. I understand that when we are born, we already have a set of antibodies that help us fight against illness, but these antibodies only prevent most people of getting affected with certain major diseases. Whenever we get a new disease, new antibodies are formed to combat it. This option cannot be considered to be true because I do not have much information about the immunity.<n><n>Let’s look at which option: It always starts to work after contact with disease- invading pathogens.<n><n>This is not true about immunity because whenever there is a new threat within the body, the immune system kicks in after a time gap and starts the work of combatting the new disease.<n><n>Let’ be look at this option: It is highly effective at keeping body systems clean.<n><n>Although it is good for the system, the human body’s system is not 100 percent effective. It cannot be considered a true answer.<n><n>Let’ last option be this option: Its effectiveness decreases over time.<n><n>This is definitely true but not as a first option because our immunity generally gets lower because of old age, sickness and

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:How might people perceive someone they are scared of? Choices:  A: human B: happy C: dangerous D: strange E: weird<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The given question assumes that a certain someone (e.g., spider) will be perceived as anything but human by the onlooker. So, any options that describe human characteristics (such as happy and strange) can be discounted.<n><n>From there, the remaining options need to be considered in the context of this scenario. A "scary" person might be viewed as dangerous (C). But the choice of "dangerous" is too broad and doesn't convey a clear image of personality or character.<n><n>The right answer therefore, must convey some aspect of what it meant for people to fear this person. The word "weird," while not denoting any concrete characteristics, conveys the sense of fear that this person elicits. People might not like what this person represents or the feeling that person induces, which makes option E the most accurate.<n><n>So the final answer to the question is E: weird<n><n><n><n><n>### Instruction:The question has been divided into four segments. Each of the segments is in turn further divided into sub-parts. You should try to answer one of the sub-parts.<n><n>Input: How many segments did the lab write? Choices:  -Segment A is sub-segments 1, 2, and 3. Segment B is sub-segment 4. -Segment C is sub-sub-segment 1, sub-sub-sub-segment 2, and sub-sub-subsegment 3. Segment D is sub-sub-subsub-segment 4<n>Output: Reason for answer:<n><n>The key for answering this question is to understand the structure of the lab's writing. The question is phrased as "How many segments did the lab [type]?" (A), which implies that segment A might be further subdivided.<n><n>The lab's writing is divided into four segments (A, B, C, D), each containing sub-segments. From the way they were organized in the given response, we can draw the conclusion that the writing is a division of the lab's report into four segments and each segment is subdivided into sub-segments (1,<n>2, and 3).<n><n>Based on this information, the correct answer is B: segment A is sub-segements 1, 2 and 3 but segment B

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where do farmers keep toothpicks? Choices:  A: mouth B: grocery store C: constructing models D: shed E: box<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Again, option A is a possible answer. But it is more precise to say which part of the mouth is used. <n><n>Option B may be the most intuitive answer, but a quick glance at the question makes it clear that the grocery store is not an option. <n><n>Likewise, options C and D have many potential issues. If constructing a model, it's still unclear which part of the model is being used to hold the toothpick. And if it's simply a shed, then what part of the shed do toothpicks get placed in?<n><n>Thus, the only viable option is E: the box. <n><n>Input: What does "Tipton" say about Ms. Tattling's shoe? Choices:  Tattooed A: pink B: brown C: red D: black E: fuchsia<n>Output: Reason;<n><n>Options A and B are likely answers and are common alternatives in English.<n><n>Options C, D, and E are all unlikely to be used in a normal conversation. Options C and E don't sound natural in the context. Option D also doesn't sound natural when referring to a specific color. Tipton doesn't say it "has" or "is" pink.<n><n>Tipton sounds like a normal person saying what he feels. So the real answer must be one of the viable options. <n><n>### Instruction:  Answer the following fill in the blank questions using one of the words from the box.<n><n>Input: I am still thinking that ______ for my best friend was not such an good ______. Choices:  A-present B-gift C-presenter D-giver E-gifted<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>Options A-E must be true or false. <n><n>A: "I am still thinking" doesn't imply a good or bad thing. It must be a present for a loved one.<n><n>B: "present" can also be a gift from a presenter like a child giving their mom a present. Thus, the word "presenter" can't be the choice.<n><n>C: "gift" would mean that it's a gift you give to someone or they give to you. The meaning of the sentence indicates it's a present given

Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The rowdy frat boys shouted they would have fun and do what tonight? Choices:  A: do enjoy B: get laid C: enjoyable D: work less E: enjoy living<n>Output:		Reason: Here we are looking for the answer to the question which is: -  'do fun'  As a word has been added between  'fun' and 'and' then we can infer that the answer must start either with 'do fun' or 'do '.<n><n>Now  the options are: B, C, and D. Answer: C : Do enjoy as the addition is after'and' and before 'fun' <n><n>Input: The new machine is working beautifully and is a wonderful addition to the museum. Which of these describe the feeling of the curator? Choices:  a) Relief b) Pride c) Wonder d) Apprehension e) Contentment<n>Output: Reason : Here we are looking for a word beginning with 'p' to describe the 'P' in 'Pride'<n>Now we know the answers to be: a & c.<n>In option B it must be 'Relief' as 'Contentment' has words before it beginning with'C'  and it should not start with C<n>in option D, it would be 'Apprehension' because it will not start with C & not antonym of 'C'<n>In option E, it must be 'Contentment' as it is the only option beginning with 'C'.<n><n>Thus: the correct answer is: a.  Relief &  c. Wonder<n><n>Input: Whoever started the new rumor must be crazy to think this thing won't get back to all of us. Which of these descriptions of the liar are most similar? Choices:  i) mad ii) sad iii) glad iv) glad iii) glad<n>Output: Reason  : Given the question is about the rumor, we have no information about the liar. The question is asking us to decide what would be the right thing, so we have to rule out the options that talk about the liar. Also we need to find antonym of'mad' which is 'glad'<n><n>Now, the only options which talk about the liar are: iii & iv.<n>The option iii is talking about the liar as mad, so we can rule it out.<n>Similarly the option iv seems to agree with option iv, so we can also rule ii out.<n>The option iv does not fit the question we can rule it out too. <n>The only
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The master control for the Tardis is where in the main room? Choices:  A: nuclear power plant B: center C: basement D: main office E: bowel of the ship<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>The context of the question is that it is a question of who controls the central computer. Therefore, the options B, C, and D are immediately eliminated due to the fact that those things are not places where someone would control something. The options A and E are not eliminated immediately, but their wording immediately makes them the preferred answer.<n><n>Option "nuclear power" (B) is problematic for two reasons:<n><n>Firstly, the concept of a "nuclear power plant" is usually associated with large factories, often used to generate electricity. It is unlikely that there would be a large nuclear power plant located in what is described as the main living quarters of the ship...<n>It sounds like he's looking in the wrong room.<n><n>Option "main" (E) is preferred since it best describes what the central computer control room would be in a building that is most likely associated with a spacecraft.<n><n>

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:There was a show on television about a ranger who loved flowers, but the next day it was about a gardener who also loved flowers.  It was a what? Choices:  A: countryside B: anthology C: dull read D: state park E: surface of earth<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>To answer this type of what time of the day question, you first want to pinpoint the time of day that the episode focuses on.<n><n>In this case, the answer is "the next day," because the second episode on TV was about a gardener.<n>The first episode mentioned a ranger which was a reference to the time of day that would have been shown in the previous episode. <n>So that narrows down the answer to Options A, B, and C:<n><n>Because Option D does not fit the narrative of the question, it can be eliminated.<n><n>It is possible that there is an error here, however, the time reference is not immediately clear from the instructions. The original instructions are: "There was a show on tv". This is ambiguous. A good way to clear this up is to try and understand the context of the problem which is a person talking about what they watched on TV. Based on that, we can assume that it would have been on the previous night, given that the subject is talking about the previous days program. With this more defined time frame in mind the answer is easy: C. a DULL READ<n><n>Input:What will Homer buy? Choices:  a bookstore a pizza a bicycle A:A bicycle B:A bookstore C:A pizza D:A bicycle E:A bookstore<n>Output: <n>Choice:A bookstore.<n>Output: Reason:- the question begins with "what will homer buy". So we can expect the answer to tell us that he will buy one thing in particular.<n><n>-the last item he will buy is a bicycle.<n><n>Choice:A bookshelf.<n>Output: Reaon:- the question begins with something that will give us the answer.<n><n>-the bicycle will be found on the bicycle.<n>So we can say that Homer will buy it or that he will buy it on the first choice.<n><n>So A has to be the answer.<n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what?

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:If I have a vintage, decorative light source in my possession, what is it likely to be? Choices:  A: sun B: sky C: candle D: house E: lamp<n>Output:		Reason: This question asks which light source is most likely to be a "vintage, decorative" light source. "The sun" (A) would likely be in the incorrect answer. In other worlds, the sun is an obvious light source, so it's likely that the vintage, decorate light is something other than the sun.<n><n>"The sky" (B) is also unlikely. According to the question, the light source is not in the sky, it is the sky itself. If the sky is a light source, it's in all likelihood not a "vintage" one.<n><n>Next, we would eliminate "the candle" (C) because it's not logical to think the sun, or the sky, could be a vintage, deocrative light source. <n><n>The next option to be eliminated is "the house" (E), for similar reasons explained above. <n><n>Finally, "the lamp" (D) is the correct answer. According to the question it is the one light source in this case that's not "the sun," "the sky," "the candle," or "the house." It is the one light source that fits the question.<n>So now the final answer is D: lamp<n><n>Input:A friend says they are looking forward to spending some quality time with their partner next weekend. This most likely means? Choices:  I: It's a wedding. It's a birthday. II: It's a holiday. It's a romantic dinner.<n>Output: Reason : 1. The keyword is _ quality time_.<n><n>A wedding, a birthday, a holiday are all social events that involve quality time.  <n>Romantic dinner or romantic date does not involve quality time <n>2. This option means two 2 options - either it is going to be a celebration kind of birthday wedding, or there is not going to be any quality time.<n><n>Let's compare the two options,<n><n>A. If there is going to be a wedding, there will the quality time with the partner. But going to a wedding is not the definition of quality time with the partner, just the fact that the partner is going to the wedding itself doesn't suggest that the two are going to enjoy quality time.<n><n>B.
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:He was good at traditional science but excelled at social science, his favorite subject was what? Choices:  A: geography B: history studies C: math D: religion E: dancing<n>Output:		Reason:Geography is related to science and history studies is related to humanities. So the output should be 'E': dancing.<n>It’s tempting to say that “math” is the correct answer, but it isn’t. Mathematics is something done in school, but the word is also sometimes used as a general verb for calculating and figuring something out. In this light, math could describe the work that the scientist is doing right now.<n>The word “do” is ambiguous. It could mean “perform” or just “work on.” If it’s “perform” then “Math” works. Otherwise, it’s “Dancing”<n><n>Input:When he was not working he was busy dancing, playing music or enjoying his favourite sport. Choices:  A 1: dancing B 2: basketball C 3: volleyball D 4: baseball E 5: golf<n>Output: Reason 1:The options which have the letter's 'D', 'B', 'V', 'S' are wrong answer.<n><n>The main clue is in "when he was not working", which suggests he was free from his job, indicating the correct options would be ones which he enjoys - so the answer would be between A and E.<n>However, to eliminate the incorrect options we need to find out the key letter in the answer.<n>If the letter 'D' is the correct one, then the words 'dance','science/maths' should be included in the choices. 'Dance' doesn't appear in the options. However, 'volleyball' does mention 'volley' which is the word before the 'D', hence 'V'. Same for 'baseball' which mentions 'base', also the clue is in these extra word, which are'sports'.<n>Similarly, since E says'sport' which is a sport, the key clues are'sport' and'science', so it should have the key letter 'O', so E.<n>Now remaining options don't have the key, which is 'D', which is the only one which is left. So the answer would be 'D' as it doesn't have the key to be wrong.<n><n>Input: He was good at traditional science and excelled at social science which is a branch of learning concerned with the what? Choices: A

Choices:  A: sitting down B: excitement C: tiredness D: progress E: procrastination<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Option D "progress" (D) doesn't really describe the situation.<n><n>Option B "excitement" (B) also doesn't fit, because while people may lack motivation to begin work if they're too excited, excitement is generally the most common state of mind leading up to or in the middle of work.<n><n>Options A and F don't really make sense either.<n><n>Option C "tiredness" (C) is the only choice that fits the context. There's no doubt one can become mentally fatigued from focusing on a task for too long, leading to distraction.<n><n>The only remaining choice is C: tiredness.<n><n>Input: A computer analyst finds the computer has a 5% memory leak. What? Choices: <n>Output:Reason:<n><n><n>Option B "hardware" (B) is a good start, but doesn't quite fit the context of this question.<n><n>In order for someone to describe hardware as having the memory leak, there would have to be some type of connection between the two (e.g. the malfunctioning part would be connected to the computer in some fashion). But as they stand, the computer is simply described as having a 5% memory loss, not as having a malfunctioning element within its framework.<n><n><n>Option C "software" (C) doesn't work either, because memory leaks don't imply anything being wrong with an operating system (the software running on a computer). <n><n>Option A "memory" (A) is the only choice left that can be used. It's obvious why a memory leak affects the computer's memory.<n><n>Therefore, the correct answer is D: Memory <n><n>Input:  A manager who has difficulty getting work done at 9AM may have what? Choices: A: an attention deficit disorder<n> B: a disorganized work station<n> C: a sleep disorder<n> D: high blood pressure<n> F: all of the above<n> Output:Reason:<n>A sleep a deficit disorder is not possible that's why choice C is incorrect.<n>As for the rest of the choices, it isn't clear how each might affect management's performance before 9AM. And while D may be most common of the choices provided above, there are likely many

Choices:  A: build family together B: fall in love C: make love D: complete E: distance themselves<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>From the beginning and end of the sentence, we can see that there are several options provided. One of these options is to "distanc[e]" themselves from the partner after the act of "making love". This is not the case for the others, as all of them (except for option E) involve the act of making love.<n><n>Option A is incorrect as the person would have already fallen in love with their partner if they had "already fall in love". Option C falls short, as it does not answer the question at hand. It focuses more on the act of making love, rather than the reason. Therefore, the only answer that will answer correctly is option D: Completing.<n><n>As shown, option D is the only choice that gives a sense of completeness to the act of making love and is thus the correct answer.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question  A: <n><n>Input:A) What do you see?

Choices:  A: become depressed B: welcome change C: thank god D: experiences E: pay bills<n>Output:		Reason:<n>Another example of applying common sense to a logical Reasoning question<n><n>The question asks what a person looking for change does. The options A and E are clearly out of place, since they don't sound like activities someone would perform.<n><n>We see a similar wording choice in Option D," pay bills". The question asked about change, but Option D implies that paying bills is always the result of looking for change. There are many other reasons someone might pay a bill. If someone is experiencing major change, they may decide to look for a new job. If someone is experiencin major change, they may begin looking into online college classes. All of this is done to find a new job or pursue a different degree. So you could say they are looking for change, but they are also paying bills.<n><n>So the final answer for this question is Option D: Experience Changes<n><n>Input: According to the text passage, the only reason for using an object is Choices:  A) as an experiment to prove the use of it B) for sale C) in service D) to make people happy E) for communication<n>Output: Reason for answer:<n><n>If we look at the first option: "proof of use of it", it is clearly out of context. So it should be rejected.<n>The second option : "for sale" is also out of place, because that wouldn't be the only reason to use an object.<n>The 3rd option, which states "in service", is not specified. The word "in" can be taken to mean "a part of". So we have to ignore it.<n>The fourth option says to use an object to "make people happy". This would again not be the only reason. So we can reject this too.<n><n>So what remains is option E, which says to use an object "for communication". This option can be considered correct answer for the question.<n><n>Input:-Answere the following multiple choice question:<n><n>What is the only factor that determines human behaviour?

Choices:  A: sickness B: motion sickness C: relocation D: jet lag E: fatigue<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question invokes the image of "a long day of traveling" - which can be interpreted as a reference to air travel.<n><n>Option "sickness" (A) seems like it could be the correct answer, as a common side-effect of air travel is motion sickness. However, it wouldn't make logical sense if the traveler is going to sleep immediately following a plane ride - what you would expect from flight sickness. This is why that's not the correct option.<n><n>Next, we need to narrow down the number of answer choices. <n>Option "motion sickness" (B) would make logical sense if the situation described is air travel, but it's not, according to context provided in the question. The correct answer is therefore eliminated.<n><n>Further,  option "jet lag" (D) is also eliminated from possibility of being right.  No matter what time zone the traveler is moving from, they will still feel tired after a long day of air travel - this is not an answer that the question wants to see.<n><n>Therefore, option "fatigue" (E) is the last option to be considered, as it can be deduced to be the correct answer based on the context of the question: long day of air travel = tired.<n>So the final option is E: fatigue<n><n>Input: What's something that an average baby would not likely be able to do? Choices: A: run B: swim C: bake D: read E: grow hair F: learn language<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>Context:The question seems unrelated to the previous question. The options are not given, and there is no additional context to provide a starting point other than the question.<n><n>Option "run" (A) seems plausible, if we are to treat this as a joke. But that's not the purpose of this question, so that's eliminated.<n><n>Next, option "swim" (B) does not make logical sense. If it could be assumed that babies are capable of learning anything at an early age, there's no way to determine if they can swim or not. If this was the case, swimming would not be considered implausible. So we can get rid of this option too.<n><n>Option "grow hair" (F) is

Also, it is not a likely place for museum as it is used to be. So, out of the choices, Industrial area (A) is the best matching answer as people still use copy machines in industrial area. <n><n><n>Input:  At the age of 30, this person decided to spend 3 hours per day on learning a foreign language. Choices:  A. Cantonese language B. <n>C. Spanish <n>D. Japanese language E.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What would you put furniture on top of? Choices:  A: roof B: room C: floor D: apartment E: neighbor's house<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>In the first sentence, the speaker introduces the context of the problem as a person "putting something" on top of furniture. That immediately eliminates possibilities that involve action on a room level, such as B and C, as well as options on the apartment level, such as D and E.<n><n>The next task, then, is to determine the scale and directionality of the action. While option "a rooftop" (A) may be physically achievable, it is uncommon to place anything on the rooftop of a building. In addition, a rooftop is a location, not something that is used to support furniture. This would suggest that the correct option is one that incorporates both the verb "put" and the object "on top of."<n><n>Next, the person might be putting something "on top of" furniture, so we can eliminate options that describe action occurring "on" the furniture, such as "on a couch" (B) and so on.<n><n>The remaining options are then narrowed down to those that involve furniture as the object being "put on" top of something. Therefore, the correct answer is "room" (C), as in "put the couch on top of the room."

Choices:  A: arena B: building C: dock D: concert hall E: museum<n>Output:		Reason:<n>First, we need to figure out what a performer is. We know a performer from a dictionary or the internet, someone who presents a theatrical production. For example they dance. they sing. they act on a stage.<n>Now, we know what a performer is, where do they perform? We can look at the other choices and answer that out. For example, Arena and Sports stadium, they perform where they get the highest viewership, and also in concert halls, where the performance can be heard with the least of interference.<n><n>So option D Concert hall would be the correct answer.<n>    <n>Input:What is the relationship between a "base" and an "item"? Choices:  A:"Base" is an item.B:The opposite of "base" is an item.C:"Item" is the opposite of "base".D:"Item" is the "base" of a "base" and its item.E:"Base" is the "item" of an "item".<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>We can think of base and item in terms of their relationship to each other like so (base, item, item, base). This would be like if we used the term top, bottom, bottom, top. The items change but the order of things doesn't.<n><n>Then, we look at each option and make an inference as to their answer from that.<n><n>So option A would be wrong because a base is not an item.<n><n>Then option B would be wrong because a word is opposite of a word if the first few letters are the opposite. Like a "base" and "item" are the opposite of "base" and "base" respectively.<n><n>Then option C would be wrong because if an "item" "is the" opposite of a "base" then it is the opposite of a base item. If an item item, then that item would be "item" base, or in our original terms, base bottom, which doesn't make sense.<n><n>Option D is incorrect because a base would be an item and its item but its not that way the opposite of what you would expect.<n><n>Option E is incorrect because there is not even really a word such as "base". "Base" has been used multiple times. We know this word cannot be an item since it is a word.<n><n>This leaves us to answer the answer we originally

Choices:  A: birthday party B: child's hand C: grocery store D: sky E: up in the<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>If you think the answer is "a child's hand," you may be on to something. Remember, the other choices are not incorrect answers, it's just that other common things that are a staple at birthday parties do not include balloons.<n><n>To narrow down the candidates, ask yourself: what kinds of activities are a staple of birthdays? If you said, "party" (B), "having a party" (D) or "celebrate" (E), then you're correct!<n><n>So, you have two correct answers: "birthday party" (B) or "to celebrate" (E)<n><n>Input: A good rule of thumb for budgeting is to allocate how much money you make what? Choices: A: to spend to save B: into your savings C: on expenses D: out E: between your savings and expenses<n>Output: Reason<n><n>Think about the phrase "rule of thumb." It may be the case that "rule of thumb" has a definition in the context of economics - but does that definition have to do with budgeting? It doesn't - think about it!<n><n>The answer is correct in that "budgeting" (C) refers to financial planning. However, budgeting is a broad term that encompasses planning money allocations to save and spend on expenses, not just expenses. <n><n>So, you can eliminate the choice "on expenses" (D), that doesn't cover everything that falls under the category of budgeting. In the end, the correct answer for this question is "out" (E): <n><n>Input: The phrase someone is looking to "strike it rich" means what? Choices: someone is trying to get into something that takes all of their time<n><n>The phrase "strike it rich," means "to get rich" and it is often used as slang for "to get rich quick."<n><n>So, eliminate the choice "someone is trying to get into things that take all of their time" (A). You've already ruled that out. A better choice would be "to get rich" (C). Striking it rich might not actually make you rich;  it might just make you rich in experience - but you were asked for what does "to get rich" mean, not "

In this scenario, it makes sense that he is looking for cotton balls because he needs them for some sort of craft project.<n><n>Option "south" (A) is more plausible than the other options because cotton is a type of plant that is commonly found in more southern parts of the United States. Georgia is located in the southern part of the U.S., but north Carolina cannot be ruled out either because it is located in the southern region of the country.<n><n>The option "north carolina" (C) is inaccurate because it implies that the man is searching for cotton farms in northern Carolina, which is actually located in the southern part, not the north part.<n><n>The option for the man to look inside his "medicine cabinet" (E), while it might seem plausible, would be to look into getting medicine or other supplies from the cabinet, not cotton balls to complete a craft project.<n><n>The last option is for the man to look somewhere in the "pocket" (B). It would be unlikely for the man to have cotton balls in his pocket, as one would probably assume that cotton balls were used for home projects, not for immediate everyday items that would be carried in pockets.<n><n>So the correct answer is A: south<n><n>Input:Which month has the most birthdays?

This is a common acronym used in medical and pharmaceutical fields to refer to "biological detection assay system real time", which means real-time detection of a biological agent. <n><n>As the three bears were going hunting, "dancing" does not fit the scenario.<n>Since none of the other options seem to fit, "Shopping and hunting" (C) would be the most plausible and accurate answer to the question, and it appears to be exactly what the letter arrangement was meant to convey.<n>So, the final answer is C: shopping and danicing<n><n>Input: If you were on a ship at sea and there was thunderstorm all around and the ship began to sink, how could you signal for help?<n><n>Choices:A: Whistle B: Throw a stone C: Make noise with bubble sticks D: Shoot a rocket E: Hit a piece of wood<n>Output: Reason : <n><n>The correct answer is E because E=56, 56=15 and 15=A and A is a code word for Alarm.<n> <n><n>Input: If it takes 24 hours for a train to travel from Boston to New York City and 24 hours to travel from New York City to Chicago, what time does the train arrive in Chicago?<n><n>Choices A. 3PM B. 1 AM C. 3 AM D. 9AM E. 9:30PM Output: Reason :<n><n>The question is asking you to take a train of unknown time from Boston to New York to Chicago in 24 hours.

Choices:  A: tear up B: see light C: fill with tears D: be happy E: glass over<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Again, the initial task is to understand the literal context. Here, the newborn's eyes are opening for the first time, so they haven't seen anything before this moment. So, the option "see light" (B) (since light is commonly referred to as "seeing" something) must be incorrect. This is because the opening of one's eyes happens long before they "see" physical forms such as light. Therefore, it would be impossible for a newborn to see light for the first time at the beginning of a lifetime.<n><n>Next, the task is to determine what the eyes do for the first time ever. The choice "fill with tears" (C) doesn't make logical sense, because newborns haven't produced tears during the first few months of their life. Therefore, this choice can be eliminated.<n><n>The choice "tie up" (A) is incorrect because eyes cannot physically be tied up or bound by anything. <n><n>The choice "glass over" (D), while correct in nature, doesn'tactually mean what a newborn's eye's eyes "become" (a euphemism) at birth. Although it is impossible for a newborn's first time to be seeing light, it is not impossible for a newborn whose eye's glass over the first time. So, (D) would not be accurate.<n><n>With the correct option left, it may be difficult to make the connection between the statement and what the eyes do "for the first time ever." However, if you remember that the newborn's first experience of seeing light happens during her first few days of life, you'll know that this is the only logical choice. So, the question should be answered "be happy" (E).<n><n>Input: Which of these groups is least likely to be affected by allergies?

It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where do people find bills with bread? Choices:  A: restaurant B: congress C: envelope D: mail box E: cheese store<n>Output:		Reason: Here there is a pun involved which i assume is bread + bill = bread roll.<n><n>The question presents a play on words, namely "bill with bread" - which is also called a "bread roll." Therefore, "restaurant" (B) and the other options which explicitly mention bills or the dollar sign (C, D, and E) cannot be used since they do not match the given context.<n><n>Only the final option remains, "Envelope" (A). It matches the context and describes a place where bills are typically found -- a simple and logical answer to choose.<n>So in this question the answer is A: Envelope<n><n>Input: Which has more fish: a bucket of water or an aquarium? Choices:  bucket B aquarium C: bag D: ocean E: bowl<n>Output: Reason : The answer to this question is:<n><n>The question is about a fish tank and a bucket of water (or sea water). The options suggest that a bucket of water has more fish than an aquarium.<n><n>If you remember the basic concepts of ocean biomass, you would recall that there are approximately 230 000 000 tons of the biomass of fish in the world's oceans. So clearly the ocean has the most fish!<n><n>So the Final answer is E: Ocean<n><n>Input: Which of these is not an animal? Choices: a: cow B: cat C: horse D: snail E: parrot<n>Output: Reason<n><n>All answers in this question are animals; therefore they cannot be "non-animal" (not-animalism). None of the given animal choices (A, B, C, and D) fit the condition "not-animal" - they are all animals. Even if you were to exclude animals that are mammals, such as a cow, since they cannot fly, there is still no correct answer for the question. Since there are no correct answers to the question, the only choice that is acceptable is "E: Parrot."<n><n>So in this question Parrot is the answer.<n><n>Input: Which sport has the most concussions? Choices:  a: Hockey  B: Football<n>C: Cricket D: Baseball E: Soccer<n>Output: Reason is that football is the worst one.<n><n>It was decided that

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where can you eat fruit on a red bridge? Choices:  A: refrigerator B: engineering school C: san francisco D: tree E: market<n>Output:		<n>Reasoning:<n>The first step in determining the correct answer is to break down the word "eat."<n><n>In order to "eat fruit," it requires ingestion - which is why options that don't mention inhaling, smelling, or swallowing are ruled out (like options A and B).<n><n>Next, we need to understand what a red bridge is - is it on a body of water? is it next to a restaurant?<n>It turns out that the red bridge in this question is the San Francisco - Oakland Bay Bridge (which is, indeed, red).<n><n>When you cross the Bay Bridge, there are several places to stop and buy fruit or baskets of fruit: fruit stands, farmers markets, and the Bay Bridge Bounty Market (a street vendor), which is open Thursdays and Saturdays from 7:00 am to 2:00 pm.<n><n>The Bay Bridge Bounty is probably the best place to grab fruit from because it's the most convenient and reliable; however, you can also find a fruit stand in San Francisco if you want and know exactly where to look.<n>Therefore, the most reasonable answer is option E: market<n><n>Input: You can make 30 cookies and no cookies. How many cookies do you have? Choices: 20 (A) 31 (B) 0 (C) 30 (D) 32 (E)<n><n>Output:<n>Reasons:<n>When answering this type of question, the key factor to consider is the context and the given information. For this question, the context is specific to a baking session and the given information states that 30 cookies can be made in a certain time.<n><n>If we assume that there is only one batch of cookies and it is made during the given time, then we would know that we can't make any more cookies. With no more cookies to bake, we would only have those that were already made. Since 30 cookies can  be made during the given time and 30 cookies were made, the only logical assumption is that there's no remaining number of cookies. Therefore, the only logical answer is 0. <n><n>But if we look at the given information in the context of more than one person making a batch of cookies, 30 cookies can actually be made and there will be some

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What makes people happy when it is surprising and unexpected? Choices:  A: joke B: humor C: frightened D: fight E: laughter<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>In this question, we're looking for a word that describes why people laugh or feel happy, when it's unexpected.<n>The most common answer would be "laughter", but it's important to look beyond the literal meaning of the word. While laughter is certainly one way that people express surprise or humor, it isn't specific to the point where the laughter arises from an unexpected or comical situation. Therefore, this answer could be eliminated.<n><n>The next answer "frightened" (D) could be reasonable if the question were asking about what makes people happy when it's unexpected and scary. If that were the scenario, then "frightened" would be a viable answer choice. However, the question doesn't make mention of "scary" or "feeling frightened", so eliminating this answer choice is appropriate as well.<n><n>The next possible answer is from the phrase "fight for". But if it is a question about "what makes people happy when it’s surprising and unexpected", than it's unlikely they would be "fight[ing] for" anything. It would be unlikely to find someone "fight[ing for] laughter".<n><n>Lastly, answer B: humor is the correct answer as it is often a surprise and is unexpected.

Choices:  A: tardiness B: looking good C: injury D: vacation E: neatness<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Options "neatness", "looking good", and "injury" are irrelevant to this scenario.<n>"Tardiness" (B) is a possible outcome but isn't necessary - the amount of time spent on grooming doesn't necessarily determine whether a person would be tardy.<n>However, "vacation" (C) is a real possibility and would indeed be a logical outcome from this situation. That could explain why the man didn't come to work some days.<n>Therefore, the correct answer is C: vacation.<n><n>Input: One afternoon, the woman and her friends decided to play a few games at the arcade, the next thing she knew she lost her entire day's payment to the game.

D: she should leave when she's at the top of her performance 5. E: she probably didn't enjoy at all<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>The reason for why the woman's game lost the entire money was because she tried to win the competition to earn more money. She was too careless and tried to impress her friends by showing how good she is. <n>As a result of the mistake, she couldn't win the competition anymore, and she had no more money. <n><n>Input: The teacher said "I'm going to give everyone in this class a project. I want each member to decide what project they would like to do, whether it's a research project, a design project, a group project, or maybe even an individual project. Don't just sit around.

He hadn't gotten what he needed in a long time.  He was suffering from what? Choices:  A: addiction B: fatigue C: relaxation D: headaches E: over eating<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first thing to understand is what kind of "what." It's either a noun or a non-count noun, meaning that its spelled with a singular form. In this case, it's a non-count n noun, meaning we'll need a singular form. This makes our options limited to "a headache" (A), "a fatigue" (B), "a relaxation" (C), and "an overeating" (D).<n><n>Next, to determine which of these options is correct, you need to be able to describe what headaches, fatigue, and relaxation all mean. A headache (A) is pain or discomfort in the head, often accompanied by other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, or light sensitivity. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including stress, tension, food allergies, or underlying medical conditions. A fatigue (B), or tiredness, is a feeling of physical and mental exhaustion. It can be caused my a variety of factors, such as lack of sleep, overwork, depression, or underlying medical conditions like anemia or hypothyroidism. A relaxation (C) is a state of calm, peace, and tranquility, usually brought on by soaking in a bathtub, going on vacation, or having a cup of tea. And finally, an overeating (D) is when a person consumes too much of a type of food, usually leading to weight gain and other health problems, such as diabetes and heart disease.<n>Once you know what these different words mean, it's easier to identify what the correct answer is. In this case, the answer is "an overeating," as it's the only option that fits the scenario the best, "what he needed in a longtime." <n><n>Input:What is the definition of a cat?

A truck, commonly spelled with the "e" in the middle, is likely the best description of the word "lorry."<n><n>However, the description "refrigerator" does not accurately match the meaning of the prompt as described in the first sentence: "When many containers full of goods are..." This phrase seems to say that the containers "arrive empty" and are then "filled." "Unloaded (A)" and "filled" (F) do not use the same term or describe the same type of action. Since refrigerators are not a common component of a shipped container and trucks are, the best options would be either A or E.<n><n>Considering the above, the correct answer is E: lorry.<n><n>Input:What are the advantages (pros) and disadvantages (cons) of doing this Choices:  A. They are much faster. B. They are cheaper to use and maintain. C. They take up much of your time. D. They can't take you to your destination faster E. You can have fun with them.<n>Output: Reasonable:<n><n>"Which are the advantages and disadvantages of doing B, and then C?" would be an interpretation, which is incorrect. Instead, the question requires you to state the advantages and disadvantage of doing B, and, then, in a different question, the advantage.<n><n>Here it would help to use the elimination strategy.<n><n>The sentence "You can even have fun with them." (E) is a non sequitur, because it is not logical to link "fun" to something "Do with." In fact, there is no mention of "fun" to "Do with" earlier in the sentence. Nor do all of the options involve doing "something with." The sentence ends with the verb phrase "to your destination faster." This suggests that "Do with" means travel.<n><n>"You can speed the travel through them." (C) is a false statement because it does not make use of all the words "to your destination faster. It is an inaccurate statement that contradicts the purposeful part of the sentence. "Can you drive [them]?" (D) is also a false statement because it
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:An attempt to confirm an applicant's reference would fail if the reference does what? Choices:  A: question B: dispute C: deny D: contradict E: refuse<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option "refuse" (C) is a plausible outcome, but may not be the most correct answer. References could potentially refuse to provide information to the employer at the applicant's request, but this is not the scenario presented.<n>Option "question" (A) makes logical sense, especially considering that the reference cannot dispute what they don't know. However, it's the incorrect option.<n>Option "deny" (B) can be correct if there was some type of disagreement between the applicant and their reference, but is also an incorrect answer.<n><n>Of the remaining responses, the only plausible option is "contradict" (D). This fits into the framework given in the instructions - a positive reference would confirm the applicant, and a negative one would "contradict" their good character.<n>Therefore, the final answer is D: contradiction<n><n>Input: What is the number to the left? Choices: 011223344 1222 1250 120<n>Output: Reasonable: The correct answer to this question is 1222.

Choices:  A: new york B: concert C: tv studio D: gig E: recording studio<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first part of the question is to determine where a microphone boom is likely to be covering a given event. This information can be inferred from the phrasing of the question.<n><n>A microphone boom would be a tall, cylindrical device that can be attached to a microphone, increasing its pickup range.<n>It can cover a wide range of events, from concerts and TV studios to sports games and recording sessions. <n><n>While it is certainly possible to cover a stock market event with a microphone boom (e.g., to interview the market commentator), the location is highly specific due to the context of the event. Here, it's mentioned "stock market event". This event can't be any given event since stock market events take place in specific locations, such as New York or other stock exchanges around the world.<n><n>This leads to option B: new york, as a correct answer.<n>Input: You recently purchased a pink sweater at the supermarket.

Choices:  A: open doors B: drink water C: need food D: annoy E: play<n>Output:		<n><n>The first option "open doors" (A) is incorrect because cats are unable to open doors themselves, and instead rely on humans to do that for them. "Drink water" (B) is not completely true. Although cats do drink water, they usually cannot open their own water faucets either.<n><n>"Need food" (C) is inadequate because cats don't really "need" their food. Instead, they enjoy eating it. "Annoy" (D) is again an incorrect option because cats do not annoy people- instead, they cuddle and purr.<n><n>The correct final option is "play" (E), which is accurate because cats love to play with their humans, even if it means knocking over an entire glass water bottle with just their paws!

Choices: <n>A: they are too personal B: they are too trivial C: they are too intrusive D: they are too offensive E: they are none of your business<n>Output: Reason Out:<n><n>First of all, we need to clarify the context of the question and examine which types of questions the question is referring to.<n><n>Option "intrinsic" (C) and option "offensive" (E) are both irrelevant to the scenario. Therefore, they can be eliminated.<n><n>To narrow our range of options, we can think of "personal" questions as those that delve into sensitive topics or ask for private information. This could refer to topics such as family and health, which are common themes in personal questions that often lead to answers that hold private information. However, they could also refer to questions about personal preferences and attitudes, which would not involve private information and could be considered relevant or irrelevant.<n><n>In the end, Option B: they are too personal provides an answer that fits the context of the question, which means that the only other option left should be option A: they are too trivial.<n><n>Finally the final answer is A: they are trivial<n><n>Input:Who is the oldest person you can think of?

It is the only letters that have been (incorrect) invented by this inventer<n>Notice that letters have not been created. Rather, letters have been invented. Since letters themselves have been created, the letter that comes before invented in the alphabet is "i", so I can be the inventor instead, which would result in the sentence being incorrect after correcting the error. (In other words, it would be incorrect if capital I were used or if the letter i was substituted for invented).<n><n>Since there are no capital letters in the alphabet, the sentence is incorrect.<n>However, the remaining choices are all acceptable, so we must look for an alternative.<n>The correct answer is the third sentence, E.

Choices:  A: beast B: ugly C: ugliness D: satellite E: top of mountain<n>Output:		Reason: The context of the question is a mystery story where the beautiful and her father was going to kill the monster. There are many possibilities, but we need to choose ONLY ONE. For simplicity, we will assume that 'Beauty' and 'Beast' are the only two possible answers. If not, it is much easier to narrow them down by eliminating those not needed.<n><n>The 'Beauty' is most likely the 'beauty' of the story because it is not mentioned in the question. We can assume so but we are more careful as we don't want to guess.<n><n>The father of the beautiful is more likely to be the killer in the story.<n><n>The Monster does not come under the possibilities as it is the 'Beauty' who is going to kill the monsters.<n><n>Answers (B D & E): We can eliminate them as it is given in the question that 'She and her father are to kill the monster', so it is unlikely to have a monster killing another monster.<n><n>Ans A is correct.<n>

Choices:  A: airport B: gotham city C: london D: city E: gas stations<n>Output:		Reason:<n>This is another example of an elimination method. Similar to the previous example, the question is focused on identifying an obvious answer that stands out from the rest.<n>The option "airport" (A), seems incorrect because a telephone booth would not be likely at an airport. It's a non-traditional solution that's not commonly found at airports.<n><n>Option "city" (D) isn't applicable because the question asked specifically about a phone booth being red, not just any type of place.<n><n>The option "gas stations" (E), seems a lot more plausible as the place to find a red phone booth. You could argue that there may be more than one of the four choices. But remember that there must be an option that stands out as notably different than the others. Using the elimination method, we can eliminate the other possibilities, and so end up with the logical and proper answer: "gas station" (E).<n><n>Input:  Can someone explain me how I can make the below image work for a tshirt design?

Choices:  A: empowering B: regret C: despair D: glee E: sadness<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step is to eliminate irrelevant words. When reading the question, note that we're talking about a person and a person only. Anytime we use the word'someone' or'somebody', those words are vague and can lead to confusion when attempting to answer questions.<n><n>The second step is to eliminate irrelevant choices. While feeling regret and despair both refer to the same idea of feeling upset, sadness is a more distinct and relevant word.<n><n>The remaining choices, empowering (A) and glee (D), are irrelevant to this scenario.<n><n>Therefore, the final answer is C: despair.<n><n>Input: What type of machine uses an electromagnetic force, such as a hard drive?

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:John lives in Texas. If he takes the highway South and doesn't stop, where will he end up next? Choices:  A: oklahoma B: developed land C: united states D: desert E: mexico<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question requires us to identify the destination for John's road trip based solely on the given clues. Option A (Texas) is out of the question, because John lives there. Option B ("developed land") is also unpromising since there is no mention of development in the question.<n><n>Option C ("the United States") is probably the most logical choice because the question hints at John's travel continuing across the country. However, that doesn't account for his destination at the end of the trip.<n><n>This leaves options D ("desert") and E ("Mexico") as the two likely choices. By analyzing the given clues, desert land definitely falls within the purview of the "United States," as it is commonly thought of as part of the North American continent. However, the more likely answer is Mexico, simply because it is the last stop before ending back home.<n>So the final choice is option E: Mexico<n><n>Input: Find out all the numbers between 0 and 10 that contain 4's at the beginning. Choices:  A:[6 10 11] B:[8 9 10 12] C:[10] D:[10 12 20] E:[1 4 4 5]<n>Output: Reason.:<n><n>The question asks for a list of numbers between 0 and ten that have 4s in their tens digits. <n>Option A ("6 10 22") does not meet this criteria. 6, as an integer in base 10, already has four in its tens portion. So does 22 in option A. Option B ("8 9 12 13") seems tempting at first, since the first number of each multiple has four.  It's plausible that this is what the question is asking for. However, when we analyze the question more closely, option B fails to provide an answer which includes the integer 4. So option B is out.<n><n>Option C is the first one which truly conforms to the question. It includes the number 10, which fits the requirements. It also includes the number 12, which also fits the requirements. The next item in the list, number 20, is clearly an outlier here because it clearly does not have four in its tens digits
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what?

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What happens when you take a shower after going for a run? Choices:  A: feeling refreshed B: becoming tired C: restlessness D: leg cramps E: sweating<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The key to answering this is noticing the context between the first half of the question and the second half. While the context of the first half mentions "running", the second half mentions "shower". These two contexts do not match, and as such, eliminates all options except "sweating" (E).<n>So the answer to this situation is (E)!<n><n>Input:If the temperature goes up, all the polar bears will start sweating. Choices:  A. 1 B. 2 C. 3 D. 4 E. 5<n>Output: Reason and Answer:<n><n>This is just word replacement puzzle..<n>so simply eliminate all the options which had word'start' and word 'feeling' in the same question.<n><n>So, the answer will be '4'.<n><n>Input:The more one reads, the wiser one becomes. Choices:  B. 1, 2 C. 1, 3 D. 1, 5 E. 2, 3<n>Output: Reason : This one is also word replacement puzzle.<n><n>so, simply eliminate any options which contains word 'wise'.<n><n>And, the answer should be '1, 3'.<n><n>Input:When a boy falls in love, he is _____.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:No matter the background of the person, they should all be given what in applying for the job? Choices:  A: critical thinking B: congratulated C: equal opportunity D: compliments E: raffle tickets<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n>Options A, B, and D require critical thinking skills to select the right answer.<n><n>Out of the remaining choices, A and B are the only two that would apply to all applicants. E is not an aspect of applying for a job, and is therefore eliminated.<n>The answer to the question is therefore A and B: both critical thinking skills to select among the remaining answers.<n><n>Input:A good way to save money is by using a system of coupons, rewards and loyalty points, because it what? Choices: A: helps get more food B: helps get discounted items C: helps to save money D: helps get free items E: none of these<n>Output:Reasonning:<n><n>This question uses the word "because" to elicit knowledge of a relationship between the answer and the given statement. We can infer that the reason the statement is true is because of the answer given. <n><n>Answer option D mentions "helps get free items," which aligns most closely with the answer because of its specificity to an economic discount. <n><n>However, there's no clear relationship between the option and the statement, so D is eliminated.<n>The other options suggest "helps get discounted items" and "helps to save money." Those answers do indeed help to save money and get discounted items. And we can't logically infer that the statement would not be true without those answers, so they are eliminated. <n><n>The answer to the statement and question is thus C: helps to save and get discounted food.<n><n>Input:You would not be able to identify what color of the item they were looking at? Choices: A) Blue B) Purple C) Orange D) Brown E) Green<n>Output:Reasononing:<n><n>Both blue and purple are mentioned, so the answer has to be either blue (A) or purple (B). We can't eliminate them on the basis of elimination because the color of the item isn't specified.<n><n>We can eliminate brown (D), because it isn't mentioned.<n>If we know that purple (B) is mentioned, that eliminates it because the answer has to be blue. <n><n>The only answer left is blue (A). <n>

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What happens to the next appointment when a grooming takes longer than expected? Choices:  A: injury B: beauty C: late D: mistakes E: annoyed<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option "injury" (A) makes little sense in this context. Haircuts aren't inherently dangerous, so it is unlikely that cutting hair for longer than expected would cause an accident or get someone hurt.<n><n>Option "beauty" (B) is a possibility, but it's unlikely that an extended haircut would have that much affect on the entire hairstyle. For example, say someone had long hair and got the haircut, and by the time they leave they are left with bangs. That is not enough to radically change their appearance. <n><n>Option "late" (C) is also a possibility, but it doesn't fit the context either. The customer may not be late if the haircut takes too long, but they are still looking at the clock, which suggests that the next available slot is already taken. If it was simply a late haircut, they are more likely to wait for the next appointment since they don't yet have to worry about inconvenient.<n><n>Option "annoyed" (D) is the only option that fits the context. The other options are implausible, while annoyed provides a simple and relevant answer to the question asked. That is why option (D) is the correct choice.<n>Input:  What would happen to your credit score when you close your outstanding credit card? Choices: 	 A: rise B: drop C: stable D: deteriorate E: increase<n>Output: Reason<n><n>For this question, we can exclude the irrelevant answers based on the following assumptions.<n><n>(1) A credit card company closes your credit card because you didn't pay off all the bills or you did something wrong. (C)<n><n>(2) An open credit card does not lower your credit score. (E)<n><n>(3) You don't expect your credit score to increase or even remain stable. (D)<n><n>Therefore, the only remaining possible answers are (A) or (B).<n><n>(A) could be false because you don't want to close credit cards or there is not interest on your credit cards. (B)<n><n>However, only (B) is correct because close credit cards make you have higher chances to close new credit cards. (A)<n><n>Input: What does 'x' mean? Choices: A -

Choices:  A: graph B: bank at noon C: good book D: post office E: bus stop<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Reasoning:<n>An easy one - if the weather is cold and we need a coat, to stand in the line of the post office is the logical answer because it's the only place that makes sense to stand in such a situation. All other choices, particularly "bank at noon" (C), can be eliminated because they don't make sense to stand in under these parameters.<n><n>The only logical answer that makes sense to stand "in a line" would be to get a "good book" (D), since this answer would be applicable in any situation.<n><n>The only other logical answer would be "post office" (E). But it can easily be eliminated because it's unnecessary with the "good book" (C) answers provided. Thus, there is no logical answer between (A), (D), and (E)<n><n>Therefore, the correct answer is (D): good book<n><n>Input: I like to do one thing at a time. So I never watch TV and listen to the radio simultaneously. So I always choose one thing over the other. Choices:  A. TV and the radio B. TV or the radio C. neither TV nor the radio D. both TV and the radio E. either TV or the radio<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>Reasoning<n>An easy one, if you like one or the other, you can't like both. So the one you like more will have precedence, and TV will be favored over the radio.<n>

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:where do you typically find a trash can in the city? Choices:  A: park B: motel C: corner D: bus stop E: store front<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>At first glance, there seems to be a variety of different locations to find trash cans in the city. But the phrase "a trash can" clearly indicates that a singular trash can is being sought after, and the options "corner" (C), "bus stop" (D), and "store front" (E) are all irrelevant because they are locations with multiple trash cans.<n><n>It's possible that this trash can could be at a park (A), but then two other options - a motel and a corner - would be listed as wrong answers. Therefore, these don't need to be weeded out since they're already excluded.<n><n>The last option is "typically," which is essential to the question and needs to be accounted for. But if you're asked "where" (without "typically"), you'd logically assume that a blank means any location or multiple locations. Therefore, "park" (A) is out because it is the only "typical" answer listed.<n><n>But this leaves us with one remaining option: "motel." The phrase "a trash bin" implies that only a single trash bin is being sought after. While a trash bin could potentially be found in the city at a bus stop, corner, or a variety of different locations, a motel is specifically listed as an option - and it happens to be correct! Thus, motel is the most likely answer and also the correct one.<n>So the final choice is motel<n><n>Input: what is the smallest unit in mathematics of measurement? Choices:  Answer a: the smallest atom b: the smallest number c: the smallest set. d: the smallest thing e: the smallest fraction<n>Output: Reason<n><n>First, you need to identify and weed out incorrect answers that are irrelevant to this specific scenario. Atomic mass is a measurement, but it's clearly not the smallest unit or measurement.<n><n>Besides, the context of this question specifically addresses the "of measurement" aspect. The options "b: the smallest number" (B) and<n>"the smallest fraction" (E) mention numbers and fractions, respectively, which can undoubtedly be measured but are not the smallest unit of measurement. Furthermore, the smaller the number, the easier it is to measure; similarly, the smaller the fraction, the easier it is for it

There is no reference to people reading in the scenario, and the scenario is about electronics (or, more specifically, phones and mobile devices), so option A cannot be the best answer.<n>Options B and D (passenger and fly), both of which mean "use the plane for travel," are also irrelevant, because the scenario is about flight.<n><n>The scenario itself says that people cannot use electronics, so any options involving that activity cannot be the answer.<n><n>Finally we are left with options C (land plane) and E (buy tickets). Option C is the only answer that can be a potential answer among the four remaining options. It is both accurate in terms of the content of the scenario and relevant to the scenario, in that it involves the actual flying process and the use of the planes themselves. Moreover, an airplane cannot land itself without the aid of the pilot flying the plane, meaning option C is the most likely outcome people would do to pass time on a flight.<n><n><n><n>### Note<n><n>I guess there'll be a lot of such questions where all you do is eliminate irrelevant options<n><n>Also you can just guess, it'll work fine, don't get too hung up on this<n>

Choices: 1: yes 2: no A: yes<n>Output: Reason for each choice: <n><n>Yes, if everything that currently inhabits the planet suddenly disappeared, the world would see radical changes in everything that we think of as normal - people, animals, vegetation, air, weather, etc.<n><n>No, even if everything were to magically disappear, the world would still exist and function as before - which in its own ways is pretty remarkable considering everything we see all around.<n><n>1) The question itself indicates that the assumption is “yes”, so 1 is most likely the correct answer since it’s the opposite of the original statement.<n><n>2) The question implies all of the people and objects are going to disappear, so the answer for this one is most likely “no” - at least according to the question.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>This question's answer contains a mistake that is related to the following: <n><n>The question is referring to a 'fine day' or 'fine weather day' which would be the opposite of rainy weather.<n><n>#### Answer :<n>Input: If it is a sunny day out and you're enjoying the great weather, then it is the day that is the opposite of rainy day, the answer is C : The one that doesn't rain C A B D No one can know, I think it's like the weather is on day 4, which is not a sunny day, It is the answer. I think B is the answer.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:She curled up under a blanket to get warm, this made her what on the couch as they started movie? Choices:  A: sleep B: feel more comfortable C: sweating D: blush E: cuddle<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n>The question refers to a person who is feeling cold getting warmer by curling up in a warm blanket. They will likely be comfortable and warm.<n>A is incorrect because this would not generally cause them to sleep.<n>B is incorrect because this generally would not cause them to feel more comfortable. <n>C is incorrect because being on the couch, which is generally warm and comfortable, should not cause them to sweat.<n>D is incorrect because a warm blanket being nearby should not cause the person to flush or blush. <n>E is the correct answer because getting warm is associated with cuddling.<n><n>Input:The man who invented the telegraph didn't want people to share what with him because he was jealous of him? Choices:  The government A. The telephone company B. His wife C. His friends D. His sister<n>Output:Reason:<n>The word "jealous" in this case means "to be envious or resentful of the success or good fortune of another." From the context of the sentence, it's obvious that the inventor isn't jealous of his achievements. Instead, the inventor doesn't want people to steal his ideas, "which he didn’t want them to do, because he was jealous, not of their successes or of their talents, but of their minds."<n><n>Input:Who doesn't like to cook? Choices:  Bosses C. Parents D. Babies E. Moms<n>Reason:The question asks who doesn't like to eat, not who doesn't like food, which means they don't want food, which means they're people, which means they'd be parents.<n>While it's possible that some bosses, moms, and babies could hate food, and others could love it, we can rule out each of these groups from the sample given.<n>We can't eliminate parents entirely, but their group is a much more general category than the others given: even grandparents and uncles, and so on, are within the group. As such, parents have the most similarities with everyone else, which is likely why they'll also like food.<n><n>Input:What does it mean to "cum" in a car?  Choices:  To run out of gas<n>Reason:
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What does moving cars entail? Choices:  A: driving B: road C: getting tired D: accidents E: ticket<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step in answering this question is to identify the concept that is being measured in the question. We want to know how "moving cars" can be quantified or measured. One possible interpretation of this data could be the number of cars in a certain area at a given time. However, it's unclear exactly how this information is being collected, so we can't use this approach to determine the answer.<n><n>Another possibility is that the data relates to the movement of cars, which could mean how many cars are travelling in a given direction or when a car comes to a stop.<n><n>Ultimately, the question asks what "moving cars" entail, so we have to consider all possible answers for the word "moving." Answer C, "getting tired" is not a valid choice because it describes a different subject than the word "moving," and answer E, "ticket" is not a valid answer because it describes a different characteristic of moving cars. We're left with answers A, B, and D as options.<n>Answer A, "driving," could refer to the activity of driving, such as how long someone was driving or how many times they made a certain manoeuvre. However, this is not a valid option, because it's possible for people to drive without moving at all. Answer D, "accidents," could relate to the danger of moving cars, such as collision statistics or the number of injured drivers. However, this also does not work because it describes a specific event rather than the activity of moving.<n><n>The only remaining valid option then is answer B, "road." This describes the geographical path taken by cars when they move, so it matches the original question and meets our answer criteria. So the final answer is B: Road<n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where would you find a binder containing homework assignments? Choices:  A: backpack B: bookcase C: office supply store D: office E: class room<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step in determining the correct answer is to understand the context in which the question is asked. In this case, the scenario involves a student who has mislaid her binder in her house. This implies that it is either in a specific location such as "backpack" (A), "classroom" (E), or "office supply store" (D).<n><n>Option "office" excludes any possibility of the binder being in the student's office or backpack, eliminating it from the choices.<n><n>Option "bookcase" (C) and "classroom" (D) exclude the possibility of the binder to be in the student's backpack, removing them as the options.<n><n>Finally option "backpack" (E) could be a potential answer but "classroom" should be the correct answer as the word "binders" should be found at a place that the question refers to and this is excluded as an option as "Bookcase" is excluded.<n>So the final option is "Class Room"<n><n>Input:You are a chef hired to prepare a wedding dinner. You have been asked to make a tasty pasta dish for the bride's table. Choices:  A:"Stuffed Spaghetti" B:"Squash Pastina" C:"Alfredo Style" D:"Veal Osso Bucco"E:"Fettucine Alfredo"<n>Output: Reason<n><n>The first step towards determining the correct response is to analyse the possible options. Option "Stuffed Spaghettis" (A) is unlikely, because pasta dishes are typically served in individual portions.<n><n>The other four options are all types of pastas that can be served separately or together as a main course. However, when serving a wedding dinner, it would be ideal for the menu to serve multiple options for the guests. The dinnner should have more variety to ensure that everyone has something they like to eat - this option (A) is not preferred.<n><n>Thus the option (C)"Alfredo Style" should be the most preferred option.<n><n>Input:"I don't enjoy watching football", says the young boy. Choices: A: He prefers to watch basketball instead of football. B: He doesn't see the point in football. C: He enjoys

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:If you see blinking lights in the air at night, what are you usually looking at? Choices:  A: carnival B: plane C: concert D: turned at night E: a penguin's bum<n>Output:		Reasonability:<n><n>This question is tricky because it asks about what "you are usually looking at," rather than asking specifically about what that object actually is. This makes it necessary to consider the context and intent of the question.<n><n>If someone were to ask you if you're usually looking at a plane, they might expect you to say "no," since planes are typically visible during the daytime. This eliminates options A and C. If someone asked you about a concert, they might anticipate you to say "yes," but concerts at night are usually not as common as those during the day. This eliminates option B. Option D is a possibility if someone asked about penguins in general or were talking specifically about an Antarctic expedition, but would be inappropriate if you had no context in regard to where and when the question was asked.<n><n>Thus, option E would be the most accurate response. It references the specific context of the question - of looking at blinking lights at night - and is the most plausible answer for what the question asker is actually expecting.<n><n>The final answer is E: a penguins' bum<n>

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Sarah thought that she had been home all evening.  That meant that the only time to leave was when? Choices:  A: early morning B: day time C: night D: afternoon E: daytime<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Eliminate options B, C and D by ruling out times that Sarah could have been at home that night.<n>For example, the morning (option B) doesn't work because Sarah is presumably at home during morning hours before she thinks she left. Daytime (C) and nighttime (D) are both ruled out in the same way.<n><n>The remaining options are: early morning (E) and daytime (A)<n>Daytime (A) is eliminated because there is just a time period during the day that Sarah thinks she was away, making the correct option early morning (E).<n><n>So the final answer to the question is E: early morning<n><n>Input: It's 1:00 on a Saturday afternoon and the doctor is visiting a patient. He has just given the instructions, "Don't eat anything for the next five hours and if you feel light-headed, then go to the ER."<n><n>The doctor would next want his patient to go to the emergency room when?<n>Choices:  A: one hour B: three hours C: five hours D: six hours <n>Output: Reason and explanation:<n><n>The doctor's instructions would need the patient to go to the ER if he is feeling light-headed 5 hours after taking the first dose of instruction. And it has to be AFTER the 1st hour as patient cannot go immediately as this would be a breach of protocol, so no option with B. <n><n>This makes option C (the one we are looking for) the right one as there would still be 3 hours left in addition to the option to go to the ER in the first hour also.<n><n>Input:The new product is being launched at the end of the month. The sales team has already been briefed on the new launch, the new features and a list of potential client prospects that need to be called. They also have the date of the launch and this is a good opportunity to remind them of the launch date, the features and the list of potential client prospect.<n>Output: Reason & Explanation:<n><n>First rule out the obvious options in such a situation, the only one remaining option left is A.

Choices:  A: ignore B: write C: learn new things D: illiterate E: having fun<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Exclude "E": The child wanted to teach his grandfather to read, not "to have fun." "D" is the closest option: illiterate.<n>Input: What is the word-to-word translation of "Ice cream is a popular food"? Choices:  A : It is in common B : It is on top C : It has many people D : It is easy to find <n>Output: Reason that:<n>Exclude: "a" "top" and "much". the correct word is "is common"<n><n>Input: What is an advantage of a library card?

Choices:  A: compliments B: passing grade C: intellectual challenge D: sticker E: avoid pain<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>This question is a type of trick question known as a "reverse question". A "reverse question" is a question that is worded in a way that seems to suggest one answer, but actually refers to another answer.<n><n>For example, what would be expected from a competent student when it comes to their school work? Option B, "passing grade", may seem like the obvious answer; after all, a competent student would want to get a good grade, would they not?<n>However, the phrase "passing grade" refers to a lower expectation, as a passing grade is considered the minimum requirement for passing a course. As such, it doesn't make sense to expect a passing grade from someone who is competent in their schoolwork.<n><n>The other answer choices - A, B, C, and D - all refer to higher expectations (at least in the context of a school setting).<n>While it's not wrong to expect any of these outcomes, a person who is truly competent in their school subjects would have a higher bar.<n>That's why the correct answer is D: avoid pain.<n><n>Input: What is the advantage of the "for" loop in a language such as Python? Choices:  Anwer A: It allows you to execute code multiple times without needing to use a while loop. B: It allows you to break from an iteration. C: It can be used for control flow. D: It allows you to easily create lists. E: It allows you to handle the end of an iteration.<n>Output: Reason: Since a for loop in a language can execute a block of code more than once, the answer A is correct.<n><n>Input: Which of the following is NOT a benefit of using parallel computing systems? Choices: 1: Performance 2: Redundancy 3: Efficiency 4: Cost-effective 5: Resilience<n>Output: Reason<n><n>A parallel computing system means the computer system has two or more CPUs, and it can process more complicated instructions more quickly as the CPUs work simultaneously.<n><n>Some advantages of parallel computing include improved performance, resilience, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. It is common to think of "redundancy" as a measure of resilience, but redundancy in this context refers to having multiple copies of important data or information. Redundancy is not

That’s because of the word “everybody.” It’s unclear whether “everybody” means all humans on Earth or people who attended the meeting.<n><n>The choice of ”lunch” implies something that wasn’t delivered at all, whereas the choice of “coffeehouse” implies that coffee won’t be served only after the meeting, but that everyone may end up leaving the coffeehouse without ordering any.<n><n>As the sentence makes no reference to “coffeehouse,” we can’t determine from this sentence alone that it’s going to be closed due to an earlier delivery.<n><n>Choices C and D are also incorrect, as they don’t seem to be logical conclusions to the information we know.

Choices:  A: article B: adjective C: interjection D: conjunction E: pronoun<n>Output:		Reason:<n>The word to be combined is called "appositive".<n><n>The functioning of prepositions can be summarized as:<n><n>Ex: The car runs on gas.<n><n>Gas does not work as a preposition, but there is an appositive relationship between "the car" and "gas". These two items are equivalent in meaning to one another.<n><n>Ex: The apples were red.<n><n>"Apples" does function as a preposition, though "red the apples" and "the red apples" form complete sentences, not prepositional combinations.<n><n>We want appositive items to combine to create a prepositional combination. The preposition will appear immediately before the prepositional combination, but a combination can also occur after a preposition.<n><n>Prepositional combinations are most often followed by nouns, since the noun provides information specific enough to require an explanation through apposition.<n><n>Conjunctions can be thought of as prepositions that do a more elaborate job. There are multiple types of conjunctions, such as "and" and "or". All can function as prepositions, though prepositions tend to be shorter word forms.<n><n>Choices 1, 2 and 4 are all words that are commonly used in apposition. Choices 1 and 2 could work together to form an appositive, but they are not commonly used together in this fashion, so we discount them immediately. <n><n>Choice 4, the conjunction "and", would function well as a prepositional combination, as is true of all conjunctions. <n><n>Since choice 5, the pronoun "they" does not appear in conjunction with choice 4, "and", it cannot be selected.<n><n>Ex: It was the car I'd seen. (Choices 3, 6)<n><n>Here, car, apples, the car, the red apples and they could all work as appositive items to the noun seen. These could join as prepositional combinations. <n><n>Since choicie 4, "and" already combines "car" and "I'd", it cannot be replaced. <n><n>If we replace choice 4, "the car" with "apples" and "red" with "the red apples", we then have:<n><n>It

The study probably has something to do with birth control, which would provide some insight into what the study might be.<n><n>Comparing that to the given context about searching for birth control pills in an examination of toothpaste, we can see that this would make the most sense.<n>The phrase "next to the dentist"? Not so much. It indicates we are talking about a physical location, which makes little sense when discussing data analysis.<n>Therefore the most accurate answer to this question is B: chemist' s shop.<n>This choice is also most in line with what the actual meaning and context of the phrase "next to" is likely to refer to - the place in which the item is found.<n>The phrase "near to" would have a different connotation that would make the second-choice option of the dentist's office make more sense.<n><n>### Output Instruction:<n><n>Input: <n><n>### Difficulty: <n>Medium<n><n>### Duration: <n>5 MINS<n><n>### Notes: <n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where should you find a school in? Choices:  A: residential neighborhood B: mosque C: every city D: prague E: community<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option A, residential neighborhood:<n>In the question, the context is a parent explaining to their child why a school is important. In the residential neighborhood, a parent can enroll their child in a school. But this doesn't make sense, because students aren't allowed to enroll in a school (unless they're already attending a school), until it's located in their neighborhood.<n><n>Option B, mosque:<n>In the question context, a school is explained to be located in various places, including a mosque. It's not clear whether the author is trying to explain the religious context of schools, or the location for a school. <n><n>Option C, every city:<n>This is a confusing option to interpret. In order for a child to find a school in every city, they have to be enrolled in multiple schools. There's a possibility that they can move around the world, taking their school everywhere with them. However, this is not realistic for a child that may be homeschooled. <n><n>Option D, prague:<n>This doesn't fit the context of a parent explaining to their children why school is important. Prague is a world-renowned city in the Czech Republic, and is most likely the child's hometown (if they're of Czech nationality).<n><n>By dismissed Option A & B, the remaining options are A, C, D and E.<n>Though, E doesn’t make sense. "Community" isn't an actual location. The other options (C,D,E) all refer to locations of schools across the world. The question is asking about the school's location. But communities and cities are general terms that are used to describe places that school can be found. Therefore, the final answer is C: communities<n><n>Input: What are the most common way to start your day? Choices:  a) by listening to news b) by reading a review c) by watching a news show d) by writing an article e) by reading a book <n>Output: reasoning:<n>Option A by listening a news:<n>In the questioning text, there’s an obvious reference to this phrase. The author is attempting to describe how the day starts by saying “start my day”, which is also a cliché phrase about waking up first in the morning.<n><n>Option B by reading
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where is a notebook often purchased? Choices:  A: bookstore B: backpack C: abraham lincoln's grave D: desktop E: classroom<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>First, decide which option is most relevant to the context. <n>There is a reason for the query, a person is looking for a specific place to buy a notebook.  The options offered here would be unlikely to be a person's first suggestion, especially "classroom" (E).  There's no need to find a location where notebooks are for sale - there is almost certainly a local store nearby.<n><n>Next, ask which of the other options most closely relate to where notebooks are actually purchased.  The answer that best correlates to the context is "bookstore."  Not only is it a typical place where one would buy a notebook, but it also represents the closest option that actually fits the criteria. <n><n>The final task is to assess how well each of the other answer choices fit the context.  The other options do not hold water when held up against "bookstore" (A). <n><n>A bookstore is a likely starting point for buying a notebook, given that "backpack" (B) is unlikely to sell notebooks.  And no one goes to "Lincoln's grave" (D) to buy supplies, it is the location of a national monument.  Finally, while "desktop" (C) is a piece of hardware that often includes a notebook-style cover, it serves a different purpose than a notebook.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the multiple choice question, 'Where is a notebook purchased?'<n><n>Choices: A: bookstore B C: classrooms D: desktop E: backpack<n><n>Answer: The correct answer would be a bookstore.<n><n>Input: Which of the following options best describes a bookstore? Choices:  Pig _: A: A retail store that purchases books PQ: B: A place that sells meat R: C: A location where one can find a pig S: D: Sounds like a great place to eat RST: E: <n><n>Output: Reason;<n><n>The lab experimenter's motive and choice options narrow to the top two: "A retail store that purchasing books" (Pig option) and "Locations where one can find a Pig" (R). Given that Pig has no option to purchase books, it is unlikely he will visit the bookstore.<n><n>The next step is to

Choices:  A: deadly B: dangerous C: unconcerned D: stressful E: harder when weather bad<n>Output:		Reason: The driver is operating with a high level of danger, which would undoubtedly create a stressful environment. The driver was driving too fast on an ice road, which is clearly dangerous. Hence the answer would be D: stressful<n><n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What has happened to a person's money after he or she has used the last of it? Choices:  A: dissipate B: flown C: disintegrate D: fall apart E: penultimate<n>Output:		What:What happened<n>Reasoning:The first step is to understand words that might seem out of place. The word "penultimate" (E) is defined as "second to the last" or "next to last".<n><n>The next step is determining how the choices are being applied. Choice "flown" (B) is a noun that refers to money, so "what has happened to a person’s money after she has used the last if it?" would be logical. Choice "dissipate" (A) is a verb that refers to the dispersal of something, so "what has dissipate after a person has used the last of money?" would be appropriate.<n><n>That leaves us with choices "fall apart", "disintegrate", and "penultimate". <n><n>Choice "fall apart" (D) is used when something falls and breaks apart; however, "she has used her last bit of money", meaning "all of it". Therefore, this isn't a possibility.<n><n>Choices "disintegrate" (C) and "penultimate" are both adjectives that describe something. Therefore, "what has disintegrated?" or "what has penultimated?" would also be logical.<n>Based on the context of the sentence, however, the word "penultimate", which is used to replace something that has been used up, would be the most applicable choice.  <n><n>So the result is E: penultimate

Choices:  A: city B: downtown C: own house D: bar E: shopping center<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question asks us to determine the correct location, and the answer is the word that indicates a place that has multiple things we can buy.  While it is possible to eat in a bar (C), it is more common to eat in a restaurant (D), which is another option. Similarly, while we can buy things like furniture and clothing in a city (A), it's more common to buy multiple things in a shopping mall (E).  The same idea applies for downtown: we usually buy things like food, clothes, and household goods here.<n><n>Therefore, the answer to the question is E: shopping center. <n><n>Input:What are 3 words to describe a tree? Choices:  a: leafy b: sturdy c: oak d: evergreen E: tall<n>Output: Reason<n><n>The question is asking us to determine the answers from the list provided. The question is a little tricky in the sense that it's unclear what types of answers will be acceptable. Therefore, we first need to identify what information we have available for our answer. <n><n>In this case, we have three options (A-C).  We can then narrow down the options based on the types of words listed in each option.<n><n>From option A (leafy), we know that one of the answers needs to involve leaves or other aspects of plants. <n><n>From option B (sturdy), we know one answer needs to involve the concept of a tree being strong and stable. <n><n>From E (tall), we know one of the answers needs involve the concept of a tall height. <n><n>This helps us narrow down our options. <n><n>Answer: Answer: C) <n><n>In this scenario, answer C is the only option where all requirements are met. The correct answer is C: oak. <n><n>Input A is incorrect because the words mentioned are related to leaves of plants. We know that "leafy" involves the concept of plants leaves, however, leaves of plants can not be found on oak trees. The same applies to option B. We know that leaves appear on a tree but leaves are not necessarily sturdy.<n><n>Input B is incorrect because the concept of trees being tough and stable is not required for the answer.<n><n>Input E is incorrect because the concept involves tall height does not describe oak trees.

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:If I recieve a letter from a friend over seas, why might I read it? Choices:  A: pudding B: get news C: strain D: answer E: though<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>This question asks two things.<n><n>First, there's the wording of the letter the asker recieved - what did the letter offer in terms of understanding? We know that a letter arriving from a friend is not just any random piece of mail arriving. It's usually a special missive filled with a message for the receive - in this case, a friend. The idea here is how you could understand that friend's message from the letter.<n><n>Next, we know that the receive is reading the letter to understand. He's attempting to gain some sort of insight into that message, which means he knows a bit about it already, and wants to take it deeper.<n><n>Taking these ideas together, we can eliminate answer choices B, C, and D. These answers suggest the purpose of reading the letter is to have news or get the answer to a question. If the asker had those things to begin with from the letter, they wouldn't need to read the message because they'd already know everything. So, the purpose of reading the message is not to get news or receive an answer.<n><n>That leaves two answer choices, "pudding" (A) and “thoughts” (E). The two choices are essentially one word apart. Both refer to how the pudding would be understood, by eating it or thinking about it respectively.<n><n>The first answer, E - “thoughts” - is the correct answer. It's similar in wording to the question. That similarity indicates a common root in thinking about that message.<n><n>So the final answer will be E: think<n><n>Input:Which of the following is a feature of a story? Choices:  a) setting b) character c) conflict d) plot e) theme<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>Here we have to determine what a story is. The question is asking which part of a story is related to features. A Story can be described as the following:<n>- Characters: In all stories there are some (minimum of 1) characters. The characters in a story have a purpose or place. It is the purpose or place that gives depth to their character (the character's features).<n>- Plot: The plot gives the story a flow or sequence of events. The plot is how we see the features come to life in a story.<n>- Setting: The setting is

Choices:  A: great granddad's house B: family picture book C: brother's house D: family tree E: family reunion<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step in this problem would be to identify the context of the conversation. The sentences suggest that James is speaking to someone, either telling them him a story or asking for their advice.<n><n>The next step would be to listen for the action that person is participating in. In this case, we see that they are traveling somewhere together, which leads one to wonder: Who are they traveling with?<n>The answer is "his niece", the woman who is currently sitting with him. In order to get to his niece's father, James had to first travel to her brother's house.<n>The final answer is D: family tree, because the conversation ends with "they stopped by their cousin's house on their way to a family reunion."<n><n>Input:A 100% 2-hour-old hamburger, a slice of cheese, a side salad, ketchup, honey mustard, mayonnaise and oil.

The question lists the foods available (including a hamburger, a side salad, mustard, mayonnais, honey mustard oil, cheese and ketchup). The request is: Which foods do you chose?<n><n>The first step is identifying the context of the question (i.e., what is the person doing at the moment). This is easily accomplished by the final sentence of the question: "You may use all the foods at once." This suggests that the person asking the question is waiting at a restaurant.<n><n>Since the person must choose one food at a time, the next step is determining the total number of foods being chosen.

Choices:<n>A: Four B: Two twenty C: Three thirty D: Eight A: B: C: D: E:<n>Output: The answer is C because there is no way for anyone to get to the airport before three thirty, even if the woman's bus arrives at 11:00. <n><n>Input Is it true that the president's hair grows faster than everyone eles?

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Some stores trick women to buy products, the sales make it seem like if you buy more you what? Choices:  A: get money B: pay money C: go shopping D: lose money E: save money<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>After narrowing the list to the first four choices A - D, we can reason that these choices are not logical.<n><n>Option A: The ad states that if you buy more, you "get something", as opposed to getting something else. The wording doesn't seem to make much sense.<n><n>Option B: "You will pay more money" sounds illogical when comparing it to the wording of A.<n><n>Options C and D are both similar to A and B, where they state that if you buy more of the product, "you save more money" or "you save some money", respectively. These options are still not logical, as the question asks for the reason behind buying.<n><n>Therefore, we are left with "losing money" (E), which seems like the only logical response.<n><n>So the final answer to this question would be E.<n><n>##### Notes:<n>1.If it looks too good to be true...<n>2.The idea is to find the purpose and the main objective.<n>

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What does god want people to do for money? Choices:  A: work in life B: speak to people C: everywhere D: sitting ideal E: care for people<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>This answer does not meet the standards for this question; it does not answer the question asked. Option "care for people" (E) seems to answer the question directly, stating what god wants people to do with money. However, option "ideal" (D) would be the ideal choice. Including a period within option "ideal" indicates that it's complete and finished, which makes it more likely to be the correct answer choice.<n><n>Input: When a person dies, does god want him to be eulogized? Choices: 	A: no B: yes<n>Output: Reason for the answe:Reason:<n><n>This answer is vague and could be answered in a variety of different ways. The question does not mention whether this is a personal preference, or whether it's a requirement for this particular situation. It is unclear if the word "no" excludes an eulogy, or if it means that god doesn't want a eulogy at all. This option also uses the word "him", which could refer to the individual who has just died, or someone else. Since we don't know for sure, we can't eliminate any specific answers.<n><n>Input: Which is better for a person to study: 1) AI or B): mathematics? Choices:A: AI B: mathematics<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>Option A: "AI" is the incorrect response, as the correct response is "mathematics". The phrasing "better for a person to study" indicates that this is an instruction - where AI must be studied in order to be successful. "Better" would describe an instruction to study mathematics and is therefore a more likely answer choice than simply to study it.<n><n>Input:What do you call a group of two or more people eating dinner together at a table? Choices: <n>1) A: a meal 2)B: a feast 3)c: a luncheon. 4)D: an assembly. 5) E: a family. 6):a get together<n>Output: Reason of the answe:<n><n>5)E: a family. The correct response is "a family". Since the question doesn't specify what types of people - family, friends, acquaintances, etc., we can assume that it's a more general interpretation of "

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What is the result of instituting civil action? Choices:  A: bad feelings B: confusion C: going to court D: hurt feelings E: sandwiches<n>Output:		Reason: This question also requires contextual analysis. The options are all related to civil action, meaning a court case. The choices here are B) confusion, C) hurt feelings, and D) sandwiches.<n><n>"Confusion" (B) can be eliminated as it is an undefined term with no connection to civil action. The wording "instituting civil action" refers to some type of dispute settlement, and it therefore doesn't make sense to expect confusion as a consequence of this.<n><n>Then, when we evaluate the remaining choices the question becomes even more confusing. While civil action can potentially produce feelings of hurt, it is more closely related to legal disputes than social affairs. Therefore, the answer would have to be B) confusion<n><n>So the final answer for this question is B: confusion.<n><n>Input:Why do we find 1?

Choices:  A: houses B: bedroom C: istanbul D: open tress E: gym<n>Output:		Reason:<n>There are many options, which could come to each person's own answer.<n><n>However, the answer should be "gym" (E). Although the man may dislike getting out of bed, putting carpeting in the bedroom would make it more likeable or at least more suitable for the purpose, which is sleeping. Placing it on the floor makes it less like that.<n>Also, putting carpeting on the floor in their house does not help the man in any way to walk on them.<n><n>The question asks where they put the carpeting, it could be in more than one place, however there is only one answer, the answer choice that makes the most sense. And that is GYM.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question in a complete sentence.<n>#### Instructions(Part B only):For each multiple choice question,select one of the following to best complete the sentence.<n>Input:The person was so upset that they had gone home.  How often was the person? Choices:  Tired:_____________A: A couple days B: Two weeks C: A couple days D: Two weeks E: Annoyed F: Annoyed G: Angry and Anxious<n>Output: ReasonING:<n>Because the person is upset, it is logical to assume they did not go home often.<n>Therefore, the best answer choices are C) " A couple days" and D) "Two weeks." These answer choices are logical and eliminate the other answer choices.<n><n>###Instructions:Answer this question.<n><n>Question:What is the question on this quiz called?<n><n>Sentence: There are 4 different answer choices, but the best one is the answer choice 2.<n><n>### How to solve it?<n><n>For the first part, it said "which of these is the word that fits the best". Since it is a fill in the blank, it means that it needs to be the ONLY fill in the blank answer. The first is C and that doesn't fulfill that since it's an adjective, the second is A and since B is a preposition and D is a conjunction, they don't fulfill that. It just leaves F which is a pronoun, which goes along with the sentence "It can be anything from a pronoun to a preposition."
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What is something that you feel when you go to the opera? Choices:  A: fall asleep B: headache C: boredom D: relaxation E: sick<n>Output:		<n><n>The best answer to the question is "relaxation" (D).<n>The context of the question implies that the author is describing a common experience shared by those who go to the opera, so it is likely that a negative reaction like "boredom" (C) would not be common.<n>Likewise, "sick" (E) is unlikely to be the correct answer because it is too extreme and seems unlikely for a majority of people.<n><n>It eliminates the remaining three options. These options do not describe the feeling of relaxation in response to the opera.<n><n>Therefore, the correct answer is "relaxation"<n><n>Input: What could the word "cute" (adj.) mean? Choices:  Noun A. Cute baby. B. cute puppy. C. Cute cat. D. Cute baby. E. Cute puppy.<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>The answer is "Cute baby" (A). The author is describing two possible uses of the word "cute." One as a descriptive noun, and one as an adjective.<n><n>However, since the author is asking a question about the meaning of an adjective, the option labeled "adjective" (B) can be eliminated.<n><n>It can also be eliminated because although it's true that a cute puppy or cute cat exist, an adjective can describe any object rather than a specific object. Therefore, the correct answer is the "Cute baby" listed at the end of the question.<n><n>Input 1: Is this a noun or is it an adjective? Choices: A: Squirrel. B: Apple. C: Dog Bone. D: Baby. E: Apple.<n>Output: Recon<n><n>The answer is B. Apple. The context of the question implies an apple is being described, so it is not a noun.<n><n>Because the word is being used as an adjective, it must describe a noun so "Baby" (D) is incorrect.<n><n>"Dog bone" (C) is incorrect as a dog, is a creature, not a noun. Although the dog bone is a part of the dog, it cannot be considered a noun.<n>The remaining two options are describing nouns. "Squirrel" (A) is a noun

Choices:  A: office building B: schoolroom C: library D: bedroom E: gym<n>Output:		Reason:In this problem, it could help the students to eliminate "office building" (C) and "library" (D) at the same time.<n><n>Because both C and D are places where people go to learn, it's easier to eliminate those choices if there is a schoolroom (B) and bedroom (E) in the options. We can still leave "office building" (B) and the schoolroom (B) in one choice so that the options are more balanced.<n><n>### A: What is this problem trying to ask us?<n>Input: How long will $300 last when put into two accounts at 2.1 percent annual compounded interest? Choices: 1.323 years with $150 in each account 1.647 years with $175 in each account 12.323 years and $250 in each account<n>Output: What is the answer? 52.686/4.271=300<n><n>### Explanation:<n>  This problem asks us to solve for $t$, the number of years with the given interest rate.<n> <n>  The only answer key is $T= \frac {\frac {I^n}{1-1/I} }{T^n I} $  <n>  This is the time rate of interest.<n> <n>There are 2 things to consider when we are solving for time:<n>  The first is to divide each value by interest rate.<n>  The second is to take into consideration that the compound interest is also included in the second factor $T^nI$.<n>  <n>In our case, each choice has two different values for $T$. This only matters when the interest rate is 2.1% or 5%. We first take 2.1% because it is closer to one.<n> <n>Because 2.1% is included in the interest, it affects time rate of interest. <n>We first look for the one with 2.1% ($300/1.323=226.72$).<n>We take the other choices ($175 and $250) and divide each by 5% ($175/(1.647*0.05)=17.45 and $252/(4.2

Choices:  A: state park B: opera C: disneyland D: carnival E: park<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Since the event includes "disembarking" and "re-embark", it's a boat parade, which means "state park" (A) is invalid and "opera" (B), "carnival" (C) and "park" (D) are also invalid. This leaves us with "Disneyland" (E), which is the only place mentioned that involves riding rides and could likely be interpreted as a celebration.<n><n>

But in actuality, divorce lawyers in the US are very affordable according to Business Insider, so B (pleasure) is out.<n><n>The more likely answer relates to the expensive legal fees to process the divorce.<n><n>However, "being lonely" (E) is also a cost of being divorced - the person who gets divorced probably experiences the effects of being a divorced person.

Choices:  A: sew B: create art C: express yourself D: sing and dance E: write<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n>Only the lucky ones are the ones who get to do for a living what they love and enjoy the most.<n>Its easy to see that "express yourself" is correct, but you have to choose among A "sew",B "create art",C "sing and dance",D "write",E "express yourself"...<n><n>While "write" and "sew" are both common forms of expression, "create art" and "sing and dance" require more talent and skill than "express" oneself. The answer is E:"express yourself".<n><n><n><n>Input: How can you express yourself? Choices:  "Be yourself". A: Be yourself. B: Be creative. C: Be silly. D: Be friendly. E: Be yourself again. <n>Output<n>Reasoning: The correct answer is (C) "Be silly".<n><n>Being able to express yourself is a good quality. However, it's not necessary when talking to someone who's a good listener. A good listener is someone who doesn't say much. Their lack of speech demonstrates that they are listening attentively, which gives us a good opportunity to express ourselves. So choose this answer<n>

He's putting on waterproof trunks and goggles.  What sort of facility is he most likely visiting? Choices:  A: swimming pool B: actors and actresses C: fancy restaurant. D: gym E: theatre<n>Output:		Reasonning:Because Bob is in a dressing Room, therefore he most likely visit the swimmjing pooll.<n><n>Input:The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analasing the data because he wanted? Choices:  - A learn more about -B headache - C do math - D enlightened - E better understanding Output:<n>Reasoning:<n><n>Input:Bob, he is in a dressingroom. he's putting on waterprofftrunks and goggels. What sort of facility ishe most likely visiting?Choices:  A: Swimming pool - B: actors and actress-es - C: fancyrestaurant D: gym - E theatreOutput:<n>Reasoning<n><n>Answer choice A, "learn more about," is a bit of a catchall. The scientist probably wants to learn something new about his research, but the phrase does not specify the subject of that learning. This can be confirmed by cross-referencing the phrase with the other answer choices. By excluding "enlightened," answer choice B, it is established that the scientist is not attempting to gain a spiritual experience. Similarly, by eliminating "better understanding," answer choice E, it is not about gaining better personal knowledge. This narrows down the possible answers and leaves the choice of either "learn more about" or "do math."<n><n>The second example focuses on Bob and his visit to a dressing room. The context of the question is clear. Bob is in a dressiing room because he is visiting a swimming pool. Answer choice A eliminates choices that would suggest he is visiting a different location.<n><n><n>Output<n>

Choices:  A: supermarket B: kitchen cupboard C: table D: flea market E: dishwasher<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The key to answering this question lies in understanding the wording of the prompt. The word "even" in the first line implies that the collector items are not included in the category of items the scientist has acquired. The second sentence further narrows down the focus to what the scientist has sold over the weekend, which implies that these items may be his recent acquisitions or new items.<n><n>Furthermore, it is important to note that the items sold can't be considered collector's items. This means that they aren't valuable and may not be worth much.<n><n>Finally the last sentence indicates that the selling is not related to the rare plate, which means that "rare plate" cannot be an item that the scientist has sold.<n><n>Therefore, the most accurate answer to this question is E – The "rare plate" can't be the one he sells because it isn't mentioned anywhere in the prompt.<n><n>Input: What is one of your biggest hindrances as a programmer? Choice: A: Writing code B: Testing C: Debugging D: Sleeping E: Eating<n>Output: Reason A: Writing code is an important skill in programming, but it isn't one of the most challenging or time-consuming aspects of programming. Debugging and testing are more complicated and might require more focus and effort.<n><n>Input: Who did you go out with last night? Choice: A. Your best friend, B: Your crush, C. A new friend, D. None of the abovement.<n>Output: Reason B: This choice, "Your crush," is the most consistent with the question. The wording of the question specifically mentions a"crush," and this specific option indicates that you have a romantic or potentially romantic interest in this person.<n><n>Input: At the what, the cat sat? Choice: A) On the floor B) In the sink C) In your pocket D) In the box E) In the water.<n>Output: Reaction:<n><n>The context of the question suggests that the cat is likely sitting on some object, not in free space.<n><n>The choices "In the water", "In the Water" are excluded, because they don't describe where the cat is.<n><n>Choice "In the water", is also excluded as it

Choices:  A: giggle B: lie C: laughing D: chuckle E: smoke<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>This question seems slightly confusing, so we'll break it down into its component parts.<n><n>Firstly, it appears that the question is asking us whether a person would "giggle, lie, laugh, chuckle, or smoke" when hearing a joke. Thus, as option A suggests, laughter (C) is a valid and likely possibility here that would reasonably accompany the scenario.<n><n>Now, after identifying laughter as a valid answer, we must consider the other choices.<n><n>Option B ("lie") would only apply to the situation if the joke is so outrageous that people would lie about it. Yet as far as the scenario is concerned, "hearing" the joke would only be relevant if it were spoken, thus indicating laughter as the more likely response.<n><n>Option D ("chuckle") is a bit more complicated. It describes someone who is able to "giggle without sound" - yet if the scenario describes "hearing" a joke, then "giggling without sound" would require that people hear a joke but were unable to react.<n><n>The scenario is thus quite convoluted, and we are left having to choose between a validly likely choice (C) and an invalidly unusual choice (D). Consequently, a person would likely react by laughing (C), given the question's context.<n><n>So the final answer here is C: laugh<n><n>Input: What would happen if someone added a number? choices:  a: It would become 3 b: it would change to 2 or 3 c: it would change to negative 2  or  negative 3 d: it would become zero e: it would become positive 2 or positive 3 f: it would depend on what number it was<n>Output: Reason<n><n>The question is asking what would happen "if you added a number" - and the only answer would be "it would depend". In fact, the word "add" is not even mentioned. This is because "adding" numbers together does not make them equal. Instead the question is asking "what would the result be if I added a number?" - and the answer is "it would depend" because every number has a possibility of becoming a different number.  <n>    <n>The rest of the question is based on adding a 2 or 3 - which also doesn't depend on

Reasoning:<n>In this question you want to remove any irrelevant options. <n>"Countryside" (A) and "Farming areas" (C) both describe the state of Michigan, eliminating them as answers. The name "Texas" (D) can definitely be eliminated as an answer, since Texas definitely does not seem to resemble a glove.<n>That leaves us with the two states of North Dakota (E) and Michigan (D). Since there is nothing else to go off of, the choice to go with is "North Dakota," since this more closely matches the context of the question: farmland.<n><n>Input: If it is Saturday, then what day of the WEEK does it follow? Choices:  (a) Saturday (b) Monday (c) Tuesday (d) Wednesday (e) Thursday<n>Output: 3. Reasoning: <n><n>Option C (Tuesday) would be correct if the "Saturday" part was replaced with "Monday." But in this context, "Saturday" is clearly a clue for "follows" rather than "moved to," so we can't eliminate that.<n>Option D (Wednesday) is also not ruled out by the context.<n>Option E (Thursday) also has a logical interpretation but does not follow from the clues.<n>Option B (Monday) is completely disregarded since it's obviously not going to follow a "Saturday."<n><n>This leaves only option A, which is correctly interpreted as "follows" or "last," since "Saturday" directly indicates the "last" day of the week.

Choices:  A: amount to nothing B: visit relatives C: charming D: doctor himself E: cross street<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>To find the answer, it is useful to identify the context of the question and what is being asked of the person. In this scenario, the person is alone and wounded, so it is clear that he needs to find help to treat his injuries.<n><n>The options could then be narrowed down by considering practicality and plausibility. Since being charming would likely not help a person treat a serious wound, crossing the street is eliminated. The last option, "doctor himself," isn't a plausible answer either - though he might be able to treat minor ailments, he would likely not be qualified to perform surgical procedures on himself.<n><n>It is here that the option "visit relatives" (B) stands out - it fits both the practicality of the scenario and the concept of family support and care. The person is not able to take immediate care themselves, so reaching out to someone else for assistance makes sense. This would be the answer to the question.

Choices:  A: large city B: seattle C: curry D: clothing E: reservation<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first thing to do is to simplify the question in the context of the question itself. Option A does not make sense because John did not mention any place or food that he would like to order. <n>The question has the prefix "might" to show that john is suggesting the options of ordering. The resturant in the question could be any restaurant but it is most likely an indian restaurant or food.<n>However, we remove the resturant "on top of the seattle" as a choice because John did not mention that part of the question explicitly while he talks.<n><n>After that, we can look through the list of options provided as a choice to simplify it. However, the last line of option B and option C are "Seattle India" which is not a name of any company (or could be a name of a company) and we could not assume which country is it about. Also, there is a possibility that John was looking to a particular food or restaurant to order from it and the prefix "might not order" gives us that information and we remove the options of the companies. As a conclusion, we can remove the options of indian companies which provide restaurant or food services in "India" or "Seattle" and choose B or D if possible.<n>This leaves us with the choice of B and D because one could order curry or clothing (from an indian) over the phone while the other one is not possible (at least it should not be at the restaurant).<n>Finally, the answer would be D: clothing<n><n>Input:The president is worried about  what  he will do next?

We will have to simplify it and find relevant information to solve the question.<n><n>According, to the question "w" would be the prefix to the first word, then the context of the whole question shows that the option D: loose should be removed from choice, so the answer becomes (D).<n><n>Input:What do we do  in the  morning?

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:He curled up and tried to fall on his shoulder so his arm or what wouldn't take the hit?

Choices:  A: drugstore B: hospital C: bedroom D: car E: house<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>This question can be answered by identifying which option is the counterpart to which item.<n><n>The word "along with" in the question implies that both bandages and hairbrushes should be purchased in the same location that is, a drugstore.<n><n>Then, the word "along" suggests that there should be a word that complements the word "bandages", which is "hairbrush". Hence, the correct answer based on the context is "D: car."<n><n>Input:What is the last thing that a woman sees when she is being attacked by a monster? Choices:  H: Her watch  B: Her ring  A: Her bracelet  C: Her necklace E: X:<n>Output: Reason<n>A woman may see her watch in some situations, but the last thing that a female would (probably) see while being attacked is her bracelet or necklace, since these objects are located closer to the face than a watch or ring.<n><n>Input:How can a man drive a train? Choices:  B: By using a train C: With a train D: In a train  A: On a train E: At a train<n>Output: Reason Choices: D: In a train, D: In a train<n>A man cannot drive a train unless he can climb into it, start the engine, and take it out onto a track. And he can only do this from inside the train, so he must be inside it to drive. The only means of entrance is through the door, so he must either stand, or sit, in the train to drive it.<n><n>A train is a locomotive or carriage, so a man can only drive a train is he's actually in the train. Therefore, the correct answer is "D: In a train."

Choices:  A: dimly lit room B: kitchen C: wall D: table E: birthday cake<n>Output:		The question is ambiguous because it doesn't specify the type of restaurant. Some restaurants may light dimly, but most restaurants use electric light during mealtime; the question does not mention a candle in the course of a meal, so the correct answer is E: birthday cakes. Restraurants use candles to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, and other celebratory events, so it does not make sense for a restaurant to use candles to illuminate the dining area.<n>### Instruction:Answer the question below.<n>Input: Who is responsible for a toilet’s failure in a restaurant? Choices:  The waiter: A The chef: B The owner: C The janitor: D The customer: E The hostess: F The kitchen sink:G<n>Output: The answer is C – the OWNER. It’s the owner's responsibility to set up the restaurant, including cleanliness and sanitation. A waiter’s job is to take orders from customers, a chef's job is to prepare meals, a janitor's job is to maintain public places like restaurants, and a toilet does not belong to a customer or the diner – it’s the restaurant’s toilet. <n><n>### Instruction<n>Answer the question below. Input: Which part of the house would you find a toilet? Choices:  a. The basement b. The kitchen c. The garage d. The utility room e. The living room f. The study g. The hallway<n>Output: The answer to this question can be found in the question stem, indicating that the best place to have a toilet in a house is in the BASEMENT. <n><n>## Explanation<n>This question can be answered by thinking about where there is likely to be room enough, as well as where there's easy access to water and power. While some houses or apartments may have a spare room just large enough for a single standalone toilet, most bathrooms are attached to either the kitchen or to the bedroom. It makes the most sense to put a toilet in the basement, because the basement is the place where most people will have enough room to dedicate a whole room with doors, a toilet bowl and a full-size sink. <n><n>The second part of

Choices:  A: attic B: basement C: art show D: church E: bar<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Again, the first step is to clarify the context of the question by eliminating options that don't make any sense. Options such as "art show" (B) and D"bar" are out-of-place: a wine cellar is not an art show and a bar is not a place to store wine.<n>The other options "attic" (A) and "basement" (C), however, are plausible solutions to the problem. A wine cellar is often located in an attic or basement location, especially when the homeowner doesn't want the wine bottles to clutter their living space.<n>But "attic" and "basement" are in fact vague options: both could refer to a number of different locations underneath or on top of a house, such as under the stairs or in the closet.<n><n>This is where inference comes into play. Given the context of this question (specifically, that the wine is being stored for church) "attic" and basement are reasonable location options. But a wine cellar might also be found in a "church" room. This is the only room in the house that makes sense for wine to be stored: wine is often served at church events, and this is a common way to consume it. In conclusion, the final answer is D: church

Choices:  A: efficiency B: getting work done C: marriage D: finishing up E: results<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>In this case, "getting work done" is a reasonable description of the ceremony.<n>The "ceremony" is the actual process of making proposal, or the ceremony itself.<n><n>It's unclear what "being married to me" has to do with a ceremony. It's a weird way of saying "having sex with me", but nothing in the context suggests that.<n><n>Option "efficiency" (A) does not make much sense. The purpose of a proposal is to ask for marriage, and not to be more efficient per se.<n><n>Finally the option "results" (E) would probably refer to the outcome of making a proposal. If a proposal is accepted, there will be happiness (the results) but no actual ceremony. If not it would be an unsuccessful proposal (the results).<n><n>An "efficiency" ceremony (probably something about the efficiency of marriage) would not be the same as a "getting work done" ceremony. Thus the final answer is D: getting work done<n>

Choices:  A: pocket B: shower C: chemist D: drug store E: shaving kit<n>Output:		Reason: <n><n>Answering this question requires a quick mental picture of a shaving kit and a razor. Option A: "pocket" (A) does not fit the situation, as we would not have expected someone to store a double edge shaving razor in their pocket.<n><n>Option B: "shower" (B) is a bit more plausible. Someone may store a razor in the shower, but more likely one would put it in their bathroom while doing their daily routine or in their dresser.<n><n>The remaining options can be easily dismissed. Option C ("chemist") is unlikely to be the only choice, as a person wouldn't have to go to a chemist to purchase a regular razor. <n>Option D ("drug store") is also unlikely to be the only thing someone could buy from that store and would probably be considered an overly specific answer that doesn't fit the question.<n><n>It then becomes clear that options B: shower (B) and C: dresser (C) are the only logical options left, as other people who might need to shave for work or use a double-edge razor would know where and how to store it.<n><n>So the final answer to the question is E: shaving kits and shavers.<n>            <n>           <n><n>

The other answers don't make sense either - "fullness" (A) isn't something people leave on the sink after eatiing, "bad breath" (C) would be a reason for throwing out the food; and "dishes" (D) is pretty obvious because they clean the dishes in the sink.<n>And finally, "breakfast" (E) is correct because "breakfast" is the reason we end up with dirty dishes in the first place.<n>So the finalanswer is E: dirty dishes.<n><n>Input: After school, the most common chore that children do is what?

Choices:  A: michigan B: lake C: tide pool D: nursery E: atlantic ocean<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Here we have a question about anemone, a sea creature that resembles a glove. In order to answer this question, we need to know what exactly the glove-shaped creature the question is referring to.<n><n>The first elimination is to choose "michigan" (B), since there's nowhere in the world called "michigan" that's shaped like a glove.<n>"Lake" (C) was a common option in old tests, since the English language once had many homonyms for words that looked or sounded similar. These days, such homonyms are removed from the language, so it's more likely you encountered a typo in your word choice.<n>"Nursery" (D) is incorrect because anemone is an adult, not a baby.<n>"Atlantic Ocean" would be correct if "ocean" was intended to stand alone, but "glove-shaped state" is a very specific description which makes "ocean" redundant in the phrase. Answer choices that do not contain an extra, redundant option are almost always the right answer.<n>Therefore the final answer is E.<n><n>Input: If I had eight hours to chop wood, I'd spend six hours sharpening my ax. Choices:  A : three B: two C: nine D: seven E:  four<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>The first thing we notice about this question is that it is more concerned with how the question is asked versus what it asks. For example, you could ask, "If I had 80 axes, could I split the wood that quickly?" That would lead down another path of deduction.<n><n>This question isn't asking for how long it would actually take to split the wood with an ax. Instead, it is asking how much time we'd spend sharpening the ax.<n><n>The first answer choice, 3 (A), seems a bit high just to sharpen the ax. It could be done in half that amount of time.<n><n>If we are going to sharpen the axes for three hours, then that leaves four hours to actually split the wood. If we wanted to split all that wood in four hours, 8axes would be required.<n><n>The next answer choice is 2 (B). That would give us about two

Choices:  A: open letter B: thank god C: say goodbye D: bless you E: listen to radio<n>Output:		Reasoned Out:<n><n>The context implies that the answer to this question is "what to say at the end of a conversation", and so the first task is to rule out irrelevant options. "Thank God" (B) certainly isn't something one says at the end of conversation; <n><n>"Open letter" (A), while fitting the conversation scenario, is vague as to what it refers to. The remaining options, "say goodbye" (C), "bless you" (D), and "listen to the radio" (E), have more specific, literal interpretations, and are more closely related to the context.<n><n>When looking for literal interpretation, "say goodbye", "bless you", and "radio" have the most intuitive meanings, but can each still be argued as being the most likely outcome of a conversation. Let's begin with "say goodbye". While not necessarily the last thing to say, it would certainly not be wrong to consider it an appropriate closing to a conversation. It is most likely to be "bless you" though. This is the most commonly used phrase to end a conversation, as it conveys gratitude while also offering a form of good luck, which is something everyone wishes in conversation.<n>Input: You see a stranger looking into your room, what do you do? Choices: <n><n>A: call for help B: turn off the light C: make tea D: call a cop<n>Output: reasoning out:<n><n>It should first be noted that this scenario seems oddly specific, and thus, the context is quite important. It invokes the feeling that the action of "turning off the light" (C) would be out of the ordinary if the person had been looking into your room for any extended period of time.<n>This means that all remaining options must be interpreted in this way.

Choices:  A: apartment B: table C: school D: office E: house<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first choice is a place that is not a desk. The second choice is school, and it does not mention a desk. Therefore, the computer cannot be at school. Similarly, the computer cannot be in the office because it explicitly states that you would not put the computer where you would put a desk.<n><n>### Instruction: Given input string A, output two new strings that are anagrams of string A but reversed.<n><n>Input: Hello Output: Helo<n><n>Input: Pizza Output: Zizapan<n><n>Input: Saddle Output: Dadles<n><n>Input: Alphabet Output: Betapeal<n><n>### Instraction: You're at work on a computer.

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The boy was too nervous to dance, so what was he doing progressively at the ball? Choices:  A: dance like crazy B: standing still C: wallflower D: stand still E: like dancing<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question first invokes the image of a boy who is attending a ball. Although "standing still" (C) offers no clue to why the boy might be standing still, it's the only possible answer that matches the boy-dances-at-a-ball scenario.<n><n>When the boy's attitude for dancing is specified, the only remaining options are "dance like crazy" (A) or "standing still" (D). They both indicate the boy's lack of enthusiasm for the ball - the boy is not dancing because he is not interested. <n><n>With the two options narrowed to "dance like crazi" (A) and "standing still" (A), the latter is the answer.<n>So, the final answer is E. He was standing still like a wallflower while the ball was commencing.<n><n>Input:During Christmas season, a sales lady named Maria went to the shops with her family. What did she do? Choices:  a) was shopping b) was dancing c) taking pictures d) was singing e) was laughing<n>Output: Reason for answer:<n><n>The first step toward analyzing this question is determining the goal of the statement. It's very simple "Christmas season" that suggests this Christmas is meant to be fun and joyous.<n><n>Second, the choice Maria's mood after the shopping gives a clear clue as to the answer. It is highly unlikely that she would go shopping with the family and laugh.<n><n>The last step is to simply select the most likely reason: taking pictures. It is very possible she took photos during her shopping, so "taking pictures" is the most likely option.<n>So the final and the only possible answer here is C.  She was taking pictures with her family.<n>

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What would happen to you if you are not good at playing violin? Choices:  A: happiness B: relaxation C: create music D: sadness E: loud noises<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>It is unlikely that someone can be good at playing violin. For option A to be true, one would either have to be really good at playing violin, or love music.<n><n>Whatever the case, option A can still be true. There is still the possibility that someone can be really good at playing the violin but do not like the music that it plays. In that case, option A would still be correct.<n><n>Similarly, option B does not necessarily have to be incorrect. The option does not specifically mention "you" being unable to create music. It only mentions that you will not be good at playing the violins, so the option would still be correct. <n><n>However, option B is more likely to be false in the context of this question because option A is already false. The music played by a violin is generally of high-pitched and melodious nature, which would mean that someone who is good at playing it would likely produce beautiful music. Therefore, it is more likely that if one is not good at playing a violin, it is more likely to have a bad sound than create beautiful music. This conclusion is further supported by that we already know about our situation that the outcome is negative (we will become sad), so it logically follows that our music is more likely to be in a bad state than be good.<n><n>Finally for option E, there are no logical reasons for it to be incorrect. Even if option A is correct, option B still does not have to be incorrect. It is unclear how being good at creating music differs from being good at playing the violn. In fact, it is highly likely that being able to create music is actually better than being able to play the violin, as the output of the music created using a violin has to go through further production processes, in which the music may get damaged or changed.<n>So option E is correct.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>You are given a list of numbers.

Choices: A: the most impactful B: a big deal C: the most important D: a memorable E: the most precious<n>Output:  A: the most impact is correct choice as the death of your brother is something which is going to impact you in way forever. Option C is also close to the choice A, as its meaning refers to something impactful B: it is a big deal, but it is not the one of the most impactful.C: the most important means its of great impact, so the choice does not seem correct.<n>Option D is incorrect as the word most implies that it should be one of the most important but not of the most impact.

Choices:  A: band B: music room C: college D: university E: house<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>If this person is a student, he may not have his own room. In that case, the answer would be "college" (D) or "university" (E).<n>If you assume this person is an adult and has a home, you can eliminate "band" (B), "music room" (C), "house" (E) and "college" (E). The music room could mean several things but since this is a person, it is more implied that it will be called a band room. And houses do not have music rooms for practice.<n><n>You can also eliminate "band" (C) because bands generally perform outside.<n><n>The final answer would be E: the university<n>

Choices:  A: city centre B: lottery ticket C: maps D: street E: busy city<n>Output:		Reasoning:(1) What could you find at a _bus station_ that can help you?(2) _Bus station_ in the context probably refers to a place where you wait for a bus to arrive. Then the answer for (1) would be maps (D), because you can see where you are and where you may go. And what is the map made of? Yes, a piece of paper. So (4) _piece of paper_ in the last sentence refers to the same map we choose the answer "maps" for. Reasoning:(1)What could you find at _bus station_ that _can help you_?(2)We know "you" need help to find something in the context. (3)The answer to (2) is "maps".(4)The most important element of the map is _piece of paper_. So the answer of the last sentence is "piece of paper".<n><n>Input:A man goes on a date at his girlfriend's house for the first time.

Choices:  A: roman architecture B: whitehouse C: spreadsheet D: bridge E: pantheon<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>Let's apply this reasoning to each option: <n><n>Option "A: whitehouse" (B) is misleading. The "white" part of the option refers to the building's architectural style, not its colour. "Whitehouse" is not a reasonable answer to the question, because the question refers specifically to columns of numbers.<n><n>Option "B: spreadsheet" (C) is similarly incorrect. "Spreadsheet" refers to a type of document consisting of rows and columns, as indicated by the word "spread." It does not describe or refer to the columns themselves. Therefore, this answer is incorrect.<n><n>Option "C: spreadsheet" (D) is also inaccurate. The question again refers to "columns of numbers," not the spreadsheet itself. Moreover, "spreadsheet" is an incorrect term to use for the columns themselves, as they are not in or made of a spread. <n><n>Option "E: roman architecture" (A) is the only answer that answers the question correctly. In this context, the words "architecture" and "columns" are used in the same sense - that is, columns in Roman architecture (like columns in a column) - so this would be the most appropriate choice.<n>So the final ansswer is A:roman architecture<n><n>Input:How is a person related to another person whom has been dead for some years and is not your brother, your sister or your father. Choices: A: dead B: the father mother C: your brother D: your wife E: the son of your mom<n>Output: Reasonning:<n><n>Like with the first question, it's valuable to understand the context of question before deciding on an answer. The scenario refers to a person who is either related to a "dead person" or the "son of your mom." <n><n>Option "B" is not plausible, because "dead person" doesn't describe anyone who is related to someone. <n>Option "C" is also incorrect. In this context, a "son" is the son of a mother, not a man. <n><n>So the final answare  is B: dead<n><n>Input:What did the professor who has taught for 20 years say to the two students who are standing in front of him.

Choices:  A: sign language B: complete sentence C: drink tea D: feel angry E: cross street<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>It's important to note that both A and D can both be a way to help the other person, but none of them is a way to help the person in that they can talk together.<n> <n>So the final answer for question is E: cross street<n><n>Input: What is a person to do when a person is unable to speak coherently ( A: Sign language(B)Complete sentence(C)Drink tea(D)Feel angry(E)Cross street<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>The correct answer for this question is D. Here, we can see that B and D could both be considered ways to help someone unable to speak coheribly, but none of them allow the two people to talk. If we think more broadly, B and D could be said to work in tandem, allowing us to deduce that B should not be the answer because it is in fact something we could do even after D. This is because C and D are the final two answer choices, placing B as incorrect. Because B is incorrect, D must be the correct answer.<n><n>So the final answer to this question is D: Feel angry<n><n>Input:How does a person get to the next level in the game (A)Fishing (B)Gymnastics (C)Baseball (D)Music (E)Cross country<n>Output:  Reason:<n>All three choices C, B, and E require playing the game.

Choices:  A: drawer B: back to its owner C: police station D: crime scene E: holster<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>First of all, it is vital to identify what evidence the investigator would be thinking about.<n><n>If the investigator considered the gun "evidence," then he/she would submit that evidence to the crime scene or the crime lab. That explains why it'd go to a lab (police station or crime scene), rather stay in a drawer - where it'd simply sit idle - or go back to its owner. <n><n>The crime lab is likely to be responsible for examining and analyzing certain types of physical evidence, such as fingerprints, handwriting samples, weapons, hair samples, clothing or any other materials recovered from criminal activities.<n><n>On the other hand, a crime scene is the physical evidence of a crime. There are typically "crime scene tapes" to protect the area from contamination until the evidence can be processed. <n><n>Now, it is worth noting that the options were all plausible in some way. Option "back to its owner" (C) seems unbelievable, however, there could be many cases where evidence needs to be returned to its original owner or keeper in order for them to continue with their work. <n><n>For instance, a gunshot wound could become infected if it isn't treated properly, so giving a gun back to its owner would depend on the gravity of its condition.  Also, any evidence with DNA on it would need to go back to its owner in order for forensic scientists to run tests.<n><n>All that being said option E, "holster," is incorrect as it is not a place where the investigator would consider sending the evidence.<n><n>So the final answer to this question is D: crime scene E and O: back to its owner<n><n>Input: The researcher examined the report, how many of his colleagues had also read it?

Choices:  A: very ugly B: appear beautiful C: free slaves D: pay bills E: suffering pain<n>Output:		Reason: The sentence "people who are models" is incorrect. There are a few reasons for this conclusion: <n><n>(1) "model" is usually used to refer to an object, such as "model airplane" or "model city". <n>Moreover, it is an adjective which is generally followed by a noun. For example, "The dog is a model pet." <n><n>(2) When used as a noun, it is usually a synonym of "example". For example, the sentence "that book is a good model" has a similar meaning to "that book is a great example."  Therefore, option B is correct.<n><n>Input:In an amusement park there is 36 % of visitors there to enjoy the thrilling rides. The remaining 64 % come to ride or walk with the small animals.

Choices:  A: run B: swimming C: calculate things quickly D: fight enemy E: urinate<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Similar to the previous question, the answer for this question lies in understanding the context of the situation. In this case, a scenario where one is full of fear would describe an intense and potentially stressful situation. This eliminates options such as "swimming" (B) and calculational tasks (C), which are incompatible with stressful events.<n><n>The next task would be to identify the outcome of the situation. In situations like these, one is often overcome with fear and panic, leading to a higher heart rate, excessive sweating, and maybe even a rash. This leads one to conclude that the final outcome is that they are wet.<n><n>Option "urinate" (E), however, doesn't fit into the description as "urination" is involuntary in nature and doesn't necessarily require one to be "full of fear".<n><n>The answer is E: urinate<n>

What is the oldest heat source on Earth? Choices:  A: fire B: solar energy C: sun D: house E: coal or wood<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step is to identify the scenario's unique characteristics.<n>Here, "his house" references the subject of the question, while "Fire" is mentioned directly and indirectly in the rest of the sentence. This leaves us with three possibilities:<n>"fire," "solar energy," or "sun".<n><n>Next, we must identify each option's relevance to the subject matter.<n>As it's stated multiple times, solar energy is the key to sustaining the household. Meanwhile, fire doesn't seem to have any bearing on Dan's home energy source.<n><n>This leaves us with a clear choice between "fire" and "solar energy.<n>And, in fact, it's already stated directly: fire doesn't power Dan's home.<n>Therefore, the only reasonable choice is "solar energy."<n><n>Therefore the final answer is solar energy<n><n>Input: What is the result of subtracting 59 + 34?

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Though he was an adult he still stereotypical slept on a sofa bed in his parent's what Choices:  A: garage B: horseradish C: living room D: guest room E: basement<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>An important aspect to note is the context the question asks of us to analyze the situation. A sleeper is a person sleeping at night. <n><n>Option "garage" (A) is out of the question because it doesn't have any bearing on the question.<n><n>Option "horseradish" (B) is also removed from the question.  The term "horseradish," by definition, has no correlation to sleeping.<n><n>Option "living room" (C) is also out of the question. One cannot "sleep in" a living room.<n><n>Option "guest room" (D) and "basement" (E) are still possible choices.  A key factor here is to pay attention to the context. A sleeper generally refers to a person using a single-bed instead of a double-bed or queen-sized bed (the most common types of beds). Therefore, a sleeper has to sleep on a single-bed.  The word single often means a "person living alone."  This connotation leads to the removal of options C and D. <n><n>Now, the remaining choice that can be eliminated through context analysis is E. This is because the sleeper would probably sleep in his own bed (E) and not in the basement (E), due to the context.<n><n>Option D is thus the most correct because it's the only choice left without contradictions.<n><n>Input:You're reading a book by the author who writes about what Choices:  B: the world C: space D: the universe E: earth<n>Output: Reason : <n><n>The first part of the question asks about the general context of the situation.  "You're reading a [book]" suggests that the character in the story is reading one book, and not more than one. This narrows down the options to choose in the second part.<n><n>Option B (The World) is eliminated because a book cannot contain the entire world. Books are created by people and hence are made of paper. This removes option B (The World) as a reasonable answer.  <n><n>Option D (The Universe) is eliminated because "universe" is not the name of a book.  Hence, this option is incorrect. <n><n>Option D (the Universe) is the only possible solution. Books cannot contain the universe. And the

Choices:  A: problems B: offspring C: overpopulation D: larger family E: baby<n>Output:		Reason:<n>Invitro refers to the process of reproduction outside of the body, and "offspring" (B) is the logical word to use in that context. It would be illogical to use the word "baby" (E) as the offspring of parental reproduction would be the biological child of those parents, as well as a sibling to any other children they might already have.<n>Thus, the final answer is B: offspring

Choices:  A: wishing well B: kitchen C: hardware store D: garage E: utility room<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>For this question, context is key. The janitor needs to "get his pail out'', implying it's not in the same place it was when he originally acquired it. Therefore, we can eliminate choices A and B. These would be logical locations for the janitor to keep his pail if it was already in their possession.<n><n>The choices C and D are more ambiguous, but still lean towards a location similar to the origin. The janitor could've purchased his pail at a hardware store, so option C isn't completely out of the question.<n><n>However, option E best fits the scenario. The janitor doesn't need to go far to retrieve his pail, as it can be found right in the utility room.<n><n>Thus the final answer is E - utility room<n><n>Input:The scientist was conducting research in his laboratory, and he was quite excited about what? Choices: : A. a new microscope B. how animals are similar C. dinosaurs D. what he found in the lab today E. his new computer<n>Output: : <n><n>Reasoning: <n><n>The first question, then, is whether scientist is excited about discovering (A) something with a new microscope (in the laboratory), finding out (B) what animals have in common (both animals and the lab), or doing (C) something with dinosaurs (in the laboratory). These are unlikely options; the scientist most likely is not excited either about doing something with dinosaurs, getting something new from a microscope, or finding out something about what animals have in common.<n>With these three eliminated, there is no specific animal that the scientist could be interested in, and so (D) and (E) cannot be selected.<n><n>Therefore, the scientist is likely most excited about (A) his new computer and what he is doing with it or (B) conducting a current scientific discovery, either a hypothesis or (E) result.<n>The option (A) is more likely because the scientist could be excited about a new computer.<n><n>So the final answer would be A: a new computer.<n>######Solved###

Where might his connection be? Choices:  A: company B: airport C: wall D: computer network E: love<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The primary piece of information provided in the question is that James was delayed, which suggests he was waiting for someone or something in order to depart. That information immediately leads to eliminating "company" (A) and "airport" (B), which involve people and places outside of one's self. <n><n>Option "love" (E) is clearly incongruous with the given facts, as love and relationships don't require time apart. "Computer network" (D) is also ruled out because it would not explain James' delay, as connections and computers only enable efficient transfer of data. <n><n>The remaining two options are "computer" (C) and "wall" (D). Option "computer" is more plausible, as a computer is something James might connect to in order to use a network. Option "wall" is still plausible, but could refer to a wall of people or even a wall of a building; either of which wouldn't explain James' delay. <n><n>Option C: Computer would be the most accurate response to the question - James was delayed for a couple hours simply due to the act of connecting to a computer to utilize a network of computers to run an algorithm, a task James was delayed from completing due to the need to wait a couple of hours in order to successfully run the algorithm.<n><n>Input:When was the last time you watched television?

Both locations have a line where people would likely stand.<n>We can quickly eliminate option B (military base) because we know the question is asking about a road, not a building or some other structure.<n>That leaves us only option E: "bus stop". This answer choice is the one that makes the most logical sense given the context of what we're looking for.<n><n>Input: What does it take for someone to succeed? Choices:  _________ A: a plan B: a lot of friends C: a fair share of luck D: hard work E: money<n>Output: Reason<n><n>The only relevant options are A and C. A plan suggests that more organization or strategy is needed rather than anything else — such as friends or luck. However, "a fair share of luck" still remains viable even after eliminating A. As long as someone has a "fair share" of luck, it wouldn’t stop him from succeeding.<n><n>The only way to know if the person has succeeded is to make it into the end, or the "finish line."  And the most logical explanation as to why someone would make it through is with hard work and dedication. Therefore, hard work is the appropriate answer.<n>Input: Where is it most likely to find a car in the city? Choices:  Wet and slippery A: intersection B: on highways C: a parking garage D: on a parkway <n>Output: Reason <n><n>We can eliminate all options except option D. A intersection is on a street, and we said we wanted a street with a car.<n>Similarly, we can eliminate option B (highways), because it wouldn’t be very likely we would find a car on a highway.<n>When we look at option D, which includes “a street,” we realize this is an indirect answer - meaning we could find cars on a street, but we couldn’t necessarily find them on “a parkway.” In other words, it’s more likely we’d see a car on “the streets” rather than on a parkway. <n>The final answer is "a street", because we can find cars most easily on them.<n><n>Input:  A: the man  B: the student  C: the teacher  D: the doctor  E

The rest of the options are irrelevant to the situation.<n>Option 3) "keep hiking" could suggest that the farmer should hike away from the field, which would not be the intended direction of travel toward the barn. Option 4) "hug another cow" refers to socializing with the animal, which wouldn't result in a quicker arrival at the barn<n>Option 1) "turn up the radio" is outdated and would not be relevant to a modern-day farmer. Option 5) "give up" is a negative phrase that doesn't encourage progress or movement forward.<n><n>Input:Mr. Smith has a very large mansion.

Body strength B.  muscular power C.  brute strength D.  brains  E.  brain strength<n>Output: Answer: Reason:The answer is "A: Body strength"<n>Brawn refers to physical strength or power. It is commonly used to refer to strength and power of the body. "brawn" is a noun that means strength and/or physical size or power. The noun "brawn" most often refers specifically to the use (or misuse) of physical strength and power as opposed to the use of one's brain. This refers to "brawn" rather than "brains" because he will be using his strength rather than his brains. As a noun, “brawn” means 1. brawn, physical strength.<n>We can also get it by the sentence He said to me, 「I’ll be able solve this problem by using brain RATHER THAN 」, the keyword is brain instead body. Then, "what does brawn refer to?" the question is. Because it's not related to the key word. the "use of brain RATHER THA body" is not what is meant by the key word "brawn". The sentence means use of your BRAIN RATHER THAN BRAWN and the body is ignored.<n>Hence it is A not D<n><n>#### Testing my answer<n>Input: The instructor asked him to dance and he said, ―I don’t know how but I’ll give it a try because I need to have fun this year.‖ Which of the given sentences is closest in meaning to "give it a try"?<n>Choices: A.  to try hard B.  to try new things C.  to work hard D.  to practice hard E.  to have fun<n>Output: The answer is B, not A.<n>because B is the answer that is closest in meaning to 'to give it a try'.

While many people attend bars, it would not be a place where students spend most of their time.<n><n>Input:The student went on a field trip in a science class, what did the student wear? Choices: 1. 1 shorts 2. 1 shirts 3. 1 shoes 4. 2 shorts 5. 2 pants<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>In this case, a field trip would take place outside the educational institution, so formal school uniforms like pants or dresses would not be worn by students. As such, choosing "1 shorts," "2 shorts," or "5 shoes" would be the most likely answer for the question.<n>If it was a field trip to a library or museum, then most students would dress casually, perhaps wearing "1 shorts," indicating some form of shorts or jeans. However, if it was an outdoor activity, such as camping, then students would likely wear "1 shorts" to protect them from the weather.<n>Hence, the answer is "1 shorts"<n><n>Input:If it was a party, then in what did the student wear to it? Choices: ① One dress ② One pants ③ One tie ④ One shirt ⑤ One skirt ⑥ One top ⑦ Two pants<n>Output:Reasoning:If it was a formal event, such as a wedding or work party, then students would likely dress "one tie," indicating a more formal attire. On the other hand, if it was an informal party, then students would most likely wear "one shirt."<n><n>Input: ① How many of the kids were in class? 30 kids<n>② How many kids are there? 15 kids and 20 kids<n>※ There are a total of 5 kids in class  ③ How many were there in class? 10 kids ④ How many are there? 23 kids and 18 kids ※There were a total of 
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where may I view sharks in a clear tunnel? Choices:  A: south pacific B: sea world C: pacific ocean D: indian ocean E: gulf of mexico<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>This question is asking about where sharks can be viewed, and the options suggest a variety of different locations where sharks are present.<n>The first choice (A), which is the south pacific, would be an unlikely location for sharks, as most sharks live in the oceans around the planet, such as the Pacific Ocean or the Indian Ocean.<n><n>The next choice (B) would be Sea World, which is an aquarium where sharks are on display in an area that is open to the public. <n><n>The next choice, (C), refers to the Pacific Ocean, which does of course feature sharks.<n><n>Choice (D), which is the Indian Ocean, is also a geographical region that features sharks.<n><n>The last choice, (E), is the Gulf of Mexico, which is a body of water located alongside the southeastern part of the United States, where many sharks thrive.<n><n>In conclusion, the most logical answer choice would be the Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf of Mexico features a large population of sharks, making it a top destination for those interested in viewing these apex predators in their natural habitat.<n><n>Input:In baseball, a player may only use a bat in hitting the ball that chooses? Choices: A: glove B: head<n>Output: Reason of Answer:<n><n>The context of the question makes clear that we are talking about ways to hit the ball in baseball, and that it should not be mistaken for other sports such as hockey that use no bats.<n><n>The first option (A) suggests that the only time a player may use a bat is while hitting a baseball, which does not seem to make sense at all, but can be ignored as unrealistic.<n><n>The second option (B), however, is more plausible to be correct - that the player may only use the bat to hit the ball and he cannot use the bat for anything else, such as to hit him in the face.<n><n>Finally the correct answer is B: player may only use the ball to hit the ball<n><n>### Input:<n><n>Input:What is an ideal gift to give for a special occasion?

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Why would someone confess to committing murder? Choices:  A: guilty conscience B: fear C: go free D: problems E: find god<n>Output:		Reason:<n>Based on the given multiple choice question answer as "why would someone confess to murder", the question implies someone who commits murder is telling his/her conscience confess to the murder in the first place, which may sound contradict. Then we can think it's the option A which describes the reason.<n><n>Input: What is the difference between a person and a computer? Choices: 1 A: a computer is not alive. 2: a computer does not have a heart. 3: a computer cannot feel pain.<n>Output: Reason <n>Based on above question, we cannot consider a computer to be a person in terms of life, which can't feel pain and don't have a heart is another important difference between a person and computer, hence option 1 and 3 is out<n><n>Input:Why has the United States not had a female president yet?Choices:  A:  Female presidents are too busy.  B:  The united states has never had a female president.  C:  Most women are not interested in politics.  D:  Few women run for president.<n>Output: Reasons: <n>Option A: Female presidents are to busy - it indicates women already have a president but it is not clear if women are busy or if they do not have any reason to run for position, which eliminates A.<n>Option B:  the united states has never having a female president  - it means that there is a chance for them to run, hence we can conclude women cannot hold president position because of option B, which we can eliminate.<n>Option C:  most women are not interested in political  - this is an unclear statement, as it is unclear if women are interested in politics or not interested in politics, which we can eliminate and focus on option D.<n>Option D: few women run for president - this statement indicates that women are not capable of running for president. Hence, we can determine that women cannot run for president which is a sufficient reason for women not to have a president. The only answer we can determine is D for "Few women run for president" which is the best answer in all the given options.<n>Input:Which is the capital of Spain? Choices: 01: Madrid 02: Barcelona 03: Valencia 04: Seville<n>Output: Reasons <n>Based on the statement

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The crowd wasn't that big.  It can better be described as what? Choices:  A: field B: alone C: small group D: solitude E: solitary<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first thing that needs to be determined is the size of the crowd.<n><n>"Not that big" (B) implies that it was not a massive crowd, but it doesn't mention the size of it. "Not big" (C) is more suitable for this definition.<n><n>The final word choice, "solitary" (C), is a bit of a stretch, since the context describes a "crowd".<n><n>The remaining three options are all synonyms of "small group" (D).<n>Solitary (C) might be overstated, but when describing a crowded event, the word "solo" (I) implies an undesirable solitude.<n><n>Similarly, the word "lone" (J) doesn't really describe what's happening because it's too similar to "solo", which implies isolation.<n>The word "lone" might have been more appropriate in describing the location of one person, but not in the context of describing an actual crowd.<n><n>"Field" (B) also sounds too much like the concept of a field of grass, so it is ruled out as an applicable definition.<n><n>In conclusion, the most appropriate definition is small group (D), so the final answer is D: small group<n><n>Input:While hiking in the mountains the traveller saw a man who wasn't __________ any clothes.  Choices:  A. wearing B. having C. possessing D. holding E. making<n>Output: Reason is:<n><n>First of the important things to note in this question is that the question explicitly mentions the traveller and another individual that the travelling individual sees while hiking.<n>Secondly, the travelling individual does not mention anything about that individual carrying clothes with him. So the options that are out of contention are choices A and D.<n>Choice  E is incorrect because of the word "making".<n>Choice B is excluded because it is not mentioned in the context of the original sentence.<n>Also, choice C could be used in two other contexts but is inappropriate in the given context. The word possessing means that the man that the traveller saw is in possession of clothes.<n><n>From the options left, we can see that that the man has clothes on his body, so choice C is no longer viable.

Choices:  A: hang in closet B: sniff C: get dirty D: become soiled E: air out<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Again, the purpose of analyzing the clothes is revealed in the context of the question, which states that "clothes have developed a smell". Hanging the clothes in the closet and airing them out could both help eliminate the smell.<n><n>Option "hang in closet" (A) and "get dirty" (C) imply actions taken at a later time, following the original incident. So they can't be the answer to this question about how to prevent future problems.<n><n>Of the remaining three options, "air out" (E) is the most likely to prevent the clothes from developing a new smell. It gets rid of all the possible causes of an odour, leaving only the chance that another cause would affect the clothes' smell. Thus, this option would be the most effective at preventing the problem from surfacing again.<n><n>Input:An employee works overtime for the last two days without having approval from a boss which is the most likely cause for poor employee performance? Choices: <n>A: Overworked B: Stressed C: Unfocused  D: Illness E: Poor health<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>The correct answer, A, is "overworked". This is because overwork is inherently linked with work performance. The options "stressed" and "illness" can be the result of overwork, but aren't the initial cause for the poor performance.<n><n>The other options ("unfocused" - B, "poor health" - E) are less reliable indications of poor work performance, since they may arise from other circumstances or events.<n><n>The two options that specifically relate to the consequences of overwork ("stressed" - B and "poor health" E) may be indirectly affected by overworking, and can even occur as a result of overworking.<n><n>However, the question specifically states that the cause of the problem is overwork and not a stressor or poor health. Therefore, "overworked" is the more likely answer (A).<n><n>**Congratulations! You have successfully completed the 'Interview question' test.**

Choices:  A: intelligence B: education C: effectiveness D: distress E: a stupid<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The most likely cause of the inability to learn is "effectiveness", because learning something requires one to be able to accomplish that task. <n><n>Other options like "distress" (D) and "effectiveness" (E) can also be eliminated because they don't make sense in the context of the question's statement. <n><n>Only option A, "intellect", makes sense and should be the correct choice.<n><n>Input:What is something that can tell stories? Choices: <n><n>Output: Reason<n><n>This question has one correct answer and seven incorrect answers.<n><n>"A. A book" (C) is the correct answer because it is the only option that makes sense. Books can tell stories, and it is not a book. Other options such as "a library" (B), "a computer" (E), and "your mind" (D) are too specific.<n><n>"A pen" (A) cannot tell stories, but can be used for writing a story. A watch (B) does not tell stories either. It may tell time but it cannot convey a story.<n><n>Input:A bird on an island can find food just by picking up.<n>What can a bird do on land. It can't pick up food.<n><n>Output:Reason:<n><n>Option A, "get food", has no supporting information and is thus incorrect. <n><n>Option B, "get other things besides food", makes sense because the bird needs to grab something in order for it to have another thing besides food.<n><n>The only thing the bird can use to grab food is its feet, and so the correct answer is option B, "get other non-food items besides food with its feet".<n>

Choices:  A: pressure B: death C: trying harder D: quitting E: winning or losing<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>"Wanted" refers to James' desire to stop competing, which makes us think he is resistant to it.  "Trying harder" would be appropriate in a different context, but does not apply in this situation.<n>"Winning or losing" refers to how James feels about competing. That may be the case, but the scenario presents him wanting to stop competing, not just how he feels about it – so the answer is most likely "Trying harder"<n>"Quitting" suggests that James would like to stop, but he is being prevented from doing so. Since James is saying he wants to stop competing, "Trying harder" does not apply here.<n><n>"Death" refers to the physical danger of a sport. But James is not in sports; he is a person and, presumably, a healthy one at that. So the scenario suggests that James has no fear of such danger in his chosen sport. That makes "Death" an unlikely option for what James is feeling.<n><n>"Trying harder" is the best option given the circumstances. It is a choice that is consistent with, or implies, James’s desire to stop competing. It is hard to imagine someone going the wrong way, but still feeling positive about the change. Therefore, the final answer is D: trying harder

Choices: <n>A: 3<n>B: 4<n>C: 5<n>D: 6<n>E: 7<n>Output: Reason <n>A is definitely wrong - if you buy 2 bananas the first day, and eat one of them, then you don't eat one, the last option makes the most sense. However, it's a little difficult to get this question right at the first attempt. The answer should be C.<n><n>Input: An equation with 0 variables will have how many variables in it? Choices: 1	2	3	4 5	6	7	8<n>Output: 5 An equation which has no variable won't have any variables in it since it won't have any numbers or any number of variables.<n><n>#### Questions to be solved (3 marks)<n><n>#### Question 1<n><n><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/files/2.jpg" /><n><n>#### Question 2<n><n><img src="/assets/files/4.jpg" /><n>-<n><n>#### Question 3<n><n><img src="" /><n><n><img src="<?= site.baseurl?>/
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:If I am forgiving, what hidden force may be activated in my life? Choices:  A: nice feeling B: good karma C: respect D: new freedom E: good heart<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Here the question tells us that the scientist aims to analyse data, whereas the last step of analysis would be to draw a conclusion, so 'learn more about' would not be a correct answer to the question. Our options are now 'headache' (B), 'do math' (C) and 'enlightened' (D), and now our next step will be to select two options with the most information about what the question is asking. Therefore, we rule out 'headache' (we have no information about what 'headache' entails) and 'do math' (as mathematics would not be the result of this study). 'Enlightened' and 'learn more' can both be the result of this, but 'learn more' doesn't give us any information about what the scientist could learn about, and 'enlightened can mean many things.<n><n>Choices (B) and (D) are both related to the goal, but (B) is more specific: if people forgive one another, they can receive 'good karma', which is positive energy that they can use to enhance their lives; this is not the same as a 'good heart', as having a good heart would entail more internal traits, which would not necessarily be reflected in a good life outside the heart. Therefore, choice (B) is the most accurate answer, and is the most correct in terms of grammatical meaning.<n><n>Input: If I am honest, what hidden force may I be activating in my life? Choice:  A: more open B: more peaceful C: a happy heart D: a deeper awareness E: an expanded life force<n>Output: It may be obvious but what is a hidden force. The question doesn't mean what force is hidden but the force is hidden?<n><n>Option A could be correct as'more peaceful' could suggest'more calm' which could suggest 'a calm heart'. This may be the right answer so it is probably in the set.<n><n>Option C is probably the correct answer or at least a viable option for this. It could either mean'more peaceful' or'more heart'. In this case we should ignore grammatical meaning. The question refers to the heart, which is not defined in the question.<n><n>Option E is probably a viable option because 'a deeper awareness' may mean 'a stronger understanding

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What should you do if your pens aren't work? Choices:  A: ink in B: caps C: ink cartridges D: take notes E: scribble<n>Output:		Reason:<n>We can eliminate all but the last option "take notes" from the list, because a pen just needs to work to work. <n><n>Since your pen should work, then caps (option B) and pen cartridges (option C), should not to be needed as options. <n><n>So finally we get "take notes" (E).<n><n>Input:What is the relationship between 0 and 1? Choices: 0 A: zero B: one C: one half D: non-integer E: both 0 and 1<n>Output: Reason::<n><n>As we all know, "0" means "zero" and "1" means "one," so the relationship between these numbers is simple. <n><n>The answer has to be "both 0 and 1" (E), because we can't have a relationship between non-integers such as 0.5 or 0.1 and whole numbers such as 0 or 1.<n><n>Input:What happens if you drop an ice cube? Choices:  freeze A: melt B: sublimate C: explode D: evaporate E: all of the above<n>Output: Reason:--<n><n>We can eliminate the options that "freeze" (A), "melt" (B), and "sublimate" (C) from the list, because an ice cube drops, and it melts. Also, an ice cube will not explode (D) nor will it explode (E).<n><n>So finally, we get the option "all of the above" (E).<n>

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where can you find a movie theater along with other stores in one placE? Choices:  A: downtown area B: urban area C: new york city D: shopping mall E: military base<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>First, it is necessary to determine the appropriate category in which to place each answer choice. All of the choices given are either locations or categories of locations.<n><n>When looking at option "urban area" (B), it is important to note that this is a type of location and not a specific one. As such, it needs to be categorized as a place which contains various types of stores, not as a distinct location.<n><n>When looking into option "new york city" (D), it is necessary to note that it is a distinct location where there is shopping. One cannot "find" a city, so it would not be eligible as a valid answer choice.<n><n>Finally look at option "downtown area" (A), it is a general location, which can contain a variety of stores and other businesses. As such, it does not give the specificity that some of the other answer choices seek. As such, it is not a valid  option.<n> <n>The final two options both include mentions of "military base", which is not required to include in the description of the location.<n><n>The remaining option is "shopping mall" (C). This provides both the word "mall" and the description "along" so that one can imagine the scenario described. As such, it would be the most accurate option to select.<n><n>Hence in all, the option C: shopping mall is the best choice.<n><n>Input: Which of these is not a word that begins with "W"? Choices:  A. win B. whirl C. whim D. wind E. whale<n>Output:Reasonning:<n><n>When analyzing options "whim" (C) and "wind" (E), it is necessary to understand their respective contexts. Option "whim" is referring to a capricious or unthoughtful, whereas option "wind" is referring to the "air current" which results from motion caused by the heating or cooling of air.<n><n>When looking for commonalities in these definitions, it becomes clear that option "wind" is the correct answer. Option "whim” would typically be part of a sentence rather than a single word. A whim is not a natural part of speech, whereas the word "wind” is indeed a word that begins with the letter "W", albeit

Choices:  A: get arrested B: problems C: sober D: intoxication E: pleasure<n>Output:		reasoning:<n><n>A: Intoxication (D) is the most reasonable choice for this question because it indicates that the person wants to be drunk and inebriated. Option E, however, is ambiguous in that it mentions pleasures as a reason for drinking beer, while this isn't a necessary component of drunkenness. <n>Option C, "problems" (C) is an unexpected possibility because it's generally associated with issues such as depression and anxiety rather than booze.<n><n>The most plausible answer choice is "intoxication" (D), which aligns with the primary goal of drinking beer.<n>So the answer is D: intoxication<n><n>Input:You will have to provide the reason that they were denied, for what did they need to give their name? Choices:  C: proof of their identity D: their bank details E: an address F: their age<n>Output: reasoning: It is quite difficult to answer this question correctly because of the way “reasons” has been used in the question. The correct answer has to do with the details needed to provide their name. They do not need this information to have their age verified. <n>Answering C (Identity Proof) is a miscalculation as the person would need to provide their identification documents. Answering F (Proof of their age) is a miscalculations for the same reasons as they do not require age verification to provide their name. <n><n>The intended implication in the question is age verification as Answer E (Bank details) cannot be correct as that is their bank details which they need to provide. The reason they needed to prove their age would not be because of the bank details but to prove their age. <n><n>Answer D is to provide proof of their age for whatever reason they are using their bank details which the question does not give. <n><n>The correct answer is D: Proof of their age<n><n>Input:If the answer is A, they are all 3, if the answer is D, they are all 0.

Choices:  A: satisfaction B: good feelings C: complications D: feel good about yourself E: stress<n>Output:		Reason:<n>The answer key indicates the most likely outcome. It’s easy to predict that Danny (helping people) will bring good feelings, so this statement falls into category B.<n><n>Input:A farmer bought a lot of potatoes which he intended to plant in his field. But he was worried that his other plot of land would be too wet from the recent rain.  It was a problem that could either be made better or worse by digging what? Choices: A: an extra trench B: less deep trench C: no trench D: a deeper trench E: the same trench<n>Output: Reason<n>The farmer’s plot of land is wet, but the farmer needs to dry it out.  The correct answer is to dig a trench that will let the water drain.   Examine the statement and determine what the farmer needs to fix the problem: A trench, which could make it better to dig a smaller trench that would allow the water to drain (B); digging no trench would make the problem worse by not allowing the water to drain; The trench is already deep enough so digger the same trench would not make changes to his problem; and deeper trench would not help but would waste time.<n><n>Input:It would rain, so Sarah didn’t have to do any extra work. The correct answer here is that Sarah didn’t feel: Choices: A: good about yourself. B: sad. C: pleased. D: compelled.E: relieved.<n>Output: Reason Answer Key:<n><n>The key tells you to find a logical conclusion in the sentence. Sarah didn’t have  to do any extra work because it was going to rain, and what is rainy? It is miserable! Sarah didn’t feel bad about herself and she wasn’t pleased, but she did feel sad.

Choices:  A: place of work B: office C: friend's house D: workplace E: deep thought<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step is to understand what a human means as this question is asked in the singular form. A human can do a lot, with the choices being places of work, office, friend's place, workplace, etc. What is the common factor between places of work, office and friend's place? They are places to work. Where a human might go on some leisure time? Maybe on a vacation. The question is clearly asking about a place where one will likely relax and enjoy themselves. This leaves us with workplace and deep thoughts as the best logical options. Work would likely be a place where one might feel stressed or harassed or forced. And deep thought would be the very last place to go for some fun. So, the final answer should be E: deep thought<n>

Choices:  A: pretty flowers. B: hen house C: natural habitat D: storybook E: dense forest<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>We can eliminate choices B and C because they refer to the nature of the fox’s destination, implying that it is searching for something, not just roaming the forest aimlessly.<n><n>Choice A is also incorrect because it contradicts the narrative of the fox wandering further into the forest — surely flowers on the outskirts of the forest, rather than in the middle of the woods, would give the impression of wandering a little further but still closer to the exit. This rule can be used for all the multiple-choice questions.<n><n>Choice D is incorrect as it contradicts the fox’s entrance from the city into the woods — there aren’t any storybooks anywhere in this forest.<n><n>Choice E is correct as it is in line with the fox’s actions so far and it makes the most sense to conclude with it.<n><n>Input:What did the wolf do after receiving the news that the farmer would not provide food?

Secondly, think about context. <n><n>For example, with this question, the farmer has announced that he will not share his food. It stands to reason that the wolf will not be satisfied with this news, so options B and C cannot be the correct responses.<n><n>That leaves three options that do not have context, so let’s put them into context. The wolf is not satisfied, so why would the wolf go to the fox? The wolf could be starving, in which case the correct answer is C, but the narration indicates that the wolf is not starving. The wolf’s reaction, therefore, is more likely to be the fox-eating-the-wolf scenario (D).<n><n>Therefore, the correct answer is D — The wolf went straight for sleep.<n><n>Input:

Choices:  A: shirt pocket B: calligrapher's hand C: inkwell D: desk drawer E: blotter<n>Output:		Reason:<n>The answer would be E: blotter.<n><n>A blotter is a piece of soft, smooth, absorbent material used to remove excess ink from the pen feed. This can help prevent stains on clothing and ensure cleaner writing.<n><n>The other options are not as likely to be used for this task and are more general in nature. Option A is the shirt pocket which is for storing items like change or keys, not ink.<n>Option B is the calligrapher'swriting hand, which is a specialized way of handwriting used by calligraphers themselves, not something someone else would use for fountain pen ink.<n><n>Option C is the inkwell which is a container for storing ink, rather than absorbing excess. Option D is the desk drawerwhich is neither an item to absorb excess ink nor to absorb ink from the pen, since it is a drawer to store items rather than absorb anything. <n><n>Option E: blotteris the only answer which is specifically used to absorb excess inking from a fountain pensupport. Therefore, it is the correct answer.<n><n>Input:The first step in solving any crossword puzzle is to? Choices:  fill in every square Choices (A) and (C):  read the words from left to right Choices (B):  look for words that fit and start at the end Choices (D):  read the words out loud<n>Output: Answer:<n><n>Because there are several choices, the optimal is to go through them once.<n><n>The most obvious choice will be the correct choice. It is C: read the words from left end. It is because the clue is to "solve any crossword puzzle" and not the specific task of "completing crossword puzzle " and so does not give extra clues (if there are any) to the puzzle. <n><n>The other choices are wrong for they do not provide an extra clue for the puzzle.

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What does playing soccer for a long time lead to? Choices:  A: excitement B: fatigue C: anger D: hurting E: getting tired<n>Output:		Reason:<n>So the first task is to define the parameters of the problem. In this scenario, playing soccer is a long term activity, lasting for an undefined amount of time in the future. The player is, therefore, most likely to suffer from fatigue (C). <n>The final answer is D: hurting<n>Input: What should you do first? Choices:  H: go home I: play games L: get ready N: talk with the person M: call the dentist P: call your wife Q: stay at work R: get married S: go to a class T: learn programming<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>So the first aspect to consider is the urgency of the situation. Given the time available, it's impractical to either do a dental check up or learn programming for one's career (M and T, respectively). Both of these options are thus ruled out.<n><n>The next aspect to consider is the person’s responsibilities. In this case, getting married is a monumental decision, and so this option is ruled out. Since the call to one's wife is probably a minor matter, and given the limited amount of time available, it is just as reasonable to assume that the player might not have a wife present. Therefore, this option is also ruled out.<n><n>Next, we consider how important the decision would be to the player. Getting married, as we mentioned above, is a major decision. Therefore, it is also unlikely to be a concern immediately before a game. So this option is also ruled.<n><n>Finally we consider the player’s obligations, and the fact that this decision needs to be made before entering a game. Given these factors, it would be the most reasonable option to call the dentist (P), as it is an immediate concern, and one’s overall health would obviously be a consideration before a game. Then, play games (L) would be the second choice, and given that it is plausible that one has already done this before the dentist call, one would just move on to the next task.<n>So the final sequence of actions would consist of the dentist call (P) followed by play a game (L), leaving the other options (H, I, M, N, Q, R, S, T) out.<n>

He constantly worried about what? Choices:  A: the reward money B: hurt feelings C: being found out D: problems E: trouble<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Sentence completion is another strategy for answering multiple-choice questions, which involves inferring a subject's intention from the context of the passage and correctly completing a sentence or phrase.<n><n>In this particular case, The key element of the sentence is what Sean is worried about. "He constantly worried about what" indicates that he is concerned about something specific.<n><n>However, just because the sentence contains a verb does not automatically make it an active predicate.<n><n>It is critical to consider the grammar of the sentence as a whole and its relationship to the preceding sentence.<n><n>Option "the reward money" (A) is an active predicate, which implies that Sean is concerned about the monetary reward for solving the case. This scenario does not seem to be consistent with the earlier indications that he was lying about the crime, however.<n><n>Another phrase that could be construed as an active predicate is "hurt feelings" (B), but this does not seem to be related to the context of Sean lying about the crime.<n><n>Option "being found out" (C) is an active construction that implies that Sean is worried that he will be discovered and arrested for lying about the case. This option is consistent with the context of Sean being found out and arrested for lying, which indicates that the active predicate is plausible.<n><n>Similarly, option "problems" (D) has been suggested as a potential active predicate, but the previous sentence implicated that Sean is lying about the crime, which does not seem to be a plausible scenario if he is facing problems.<n><n>The final option, "trouble" (E), is an active predicate that fits the context of Sean's actions. Therefore, this would most likely be the correct answer to the question.

Among them, the family of the victim did something to him. What was that? Choices:  A: knife wounds B: buy a gun C: bleeding D: jail time E: law suit<n>Output:		Reasonning: <n><n>The question asks about the family's reaction to Joe's crime. By reading the scenario again, a logical inference can be made that the family was seeking justice for their relative.<n><n>Option B (buying a gun) is not plausible because it doesn't fit the context.<n><n>Option D (jail time) would be possible, but it doesn't specifically state the family's reaction. We don't know if the family filed charges against Joe or not.<n><n>Further, options A and C are too vague. "knife wounds" (A) could refer to an injury, or it could refer to some physical damage to the family's house. Similarly, "bleeding" (C) could refer to blood pouring from a wound on the family member, or it could refer more generally to the family experiencing anguish over Joe's actions.<n><n>Finally we have option E, which is the only one that explicitly mentions a lawsuit. This provides the solidest indication that the family's reaction was a legal one, by filing a lawsuit against Joe.<n><n>Therefore, option E is the correct answer.<n><n>Input:The bakery needs three different types of cookies for the annual convention.The shopkeeper needed each type of cookies according to the demand.What was the total amount of cookies the shopkeeper needed?The choices:A: 85 B: 186 C: 211 D: 283 E: 466<n>Output:Reasoning:<n><n>At first glance, the amount of cookies needed appears infeasible - why would the shopkeeper need 466 cookies? But then you notice something surprising - the bakery needs three types of cookies.<n><n>If it requires three different types of cookies, that means each box will need to contain only one type. This implies that the shop can easily make each type twice as easily as it otherwise would.<n><n>So in essence, if the shopkeeper needs 180 cookies of each type, then he needs 480 in total. After that, the total is simply 480 + 480 +480, which equals 1440.<n><n>Hence, the correct option here is B - 186 + 211 + 2

A nerd was the one who corrected this sentence. Choices:  A Mexico B Washington DC C New York D Ottawa E Toronto<n>Output: Reason<n><n>The error in this sentence is the capital of "Mexico," which should be "Mexico City." This is an essential fact for any student of geography. The sentence contains no subject/verb agreement or grammar errors. While the reference to a nerd is vague, it can easily suggest any number of people, so does not constitute a spelling or punctuation error.<n><n>As far as capitalization, the error lies in the use of "capital," which should be capitalized as it is a proper noun.<n><n>Input: In which state is the city of Detroit? Choices:  B California C Chicago D New York E Michigan<n>Output: Reason The answer to the previous question is Chicago (C).

Choices:  A: in the basement B: west C: solar system D: beach E: beans<n>Output:		<n>Reasoning:<n><n>Option "in the basement" (A) is the most out of the ordinary answer. A basement is usually a dark room with low (or no) windows, which would be unsuitable for sunbathing. Not to mention, it's unlikely that sunlight could even reach the basement. <n><n>Option "beaches" (D) doesn't seem to fit the scenario either.  A question about a beach wouldn't follow "Great place to lay in the SUN," and vice versa a question about a beach wouldn’t follow the word "beans." There must be a relation between the choices. <n><n>Therefore, the only two logical options remaining are in the solar system (B) and beans (E). The idea of sunbathing, or lying in the sunlight, immediately brings to mind the sun itself as the closest and best source of sunlight.<n><n>That being said, a solar system, which consists of the sun and its planets, could also meet the criteria of a great place to  lay down in the sun. The sun itself is a star with its own energy source, so why not the whole solar system? <n><n>Option "beans" (E) is the more practical answer. It's unlikely that any person would be lying on a diet of only beans, as it hasn't been found to be a great diet for most people. However, beans themselves are edible and would provide many nutrients to the body. So this option also fits the scenario.<n><n>The final answer is then beans (E), as the most logical conclusion. Henceforth, beans are the answer choice for this question.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the questions below.

There are multiple possibilities that could fit, so let's begin with the most obvious choice.<n>Option "near" (B) is the most likely answer to this question because it would seem sensible that the sensor would be located near the installation location.<n><n>The next two options - "closeness" (C) and "proximity" (D) - are less plausible choices. While those two terms are associated with locations, the placement or positioning of the sensor does not necessarily indicate how close it is in a spatial sense.<n><n>Option "this" (E), on the other hand, is the most unlikely response because "this" may not always describe the sensor. For example, if there is more than one sensor present, "this" could refer to any one of those sensors.<n><n>So option (B), "near," is the most likely answer and the final answer is option (B).

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where would you see some people doing jumping jacks? Choices:  A: military base B: opera C: water fountain D: bus stop E: church<n>Output:		Reason:<n>As we would see them on the exercise ground doing pushups at the military base. We could rarely see them at the Water fountain or the bus stop.<n>In the church, they might do this when they are doing worship.

Choices:  A: music store B: dance hall C: orchestra D: symphony E: tennessee<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Now let us analyze the answer choices available to us.<n><n>The first and the only correct option, "playing" (B), cannot be an adverb because it does not express degree or intensity, but simply time. A violin is a typical instrument for playing classical music or playing other songs, and there can be fiddle music played in a lot of places.<n><n>Options "store"(A), "hall" (C), and "symphony" (D) can be adjectives to describe a thing or place. A store can sell many kinds of music, just as a hall can house many dances or symphonies. Option E, "tennessee", is too descriptive to be an adverb, and as such is incorrect.<n><n>Therefore the only correct answer is option "B: Dance Hall".<n><n>Input:I must be away from here because of my stomach. Choices:  A. You must eat some broccoli B. I need to check the menu again C. That's an excellent idea D.

Option A is not the correct answer because "store" does not indicate where the student is expected and is also too general of a place to purchase items. Similarly, option B refers to the student's location, not that of the pencils. Similarly, option D is not the correct answer due to its vague mention of a "cabinet." So finally, it is most likely that the student is searching in the classroom to find a pencil at 1 or 2.

When we experiment, we gain hands-on experience of the material, while learning provides a deeper conceptual understanding.<n><n>As such, it is important to have a balance of experimenting and learning as it can help us develop a deeper understanding of concepts. By experimenting and learning together, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the world and gain knowledge more fully.<n>That is why option [B], which is "Both in my opinion," is the correct answer.<n><n>Input: You're a good speaker of English but there are still some things you don't get right like using verbs of action in place of verbs of being, when you know there are some differences between them. What was your thought process behind the incorrect answer choices? Choices:  [A] C: D:<n>Output: Reasons:<n>Option A: To understand why the verb "to be" was used in the incorrect answer choices, it's important to consider the role of time in the English language. In general, the verb "to be + adjective" is used to describe characteristics or qualities that are inherent or persistent over time. This makes it different from verbs of action, which describe events or actions that happen in a specific moment in time.<n><n>By contrast, the verb "to do + verb + ing" is used to describe actions or events that happen in a specific, ongoing process.<n><n>Option ["D"]: To understand why the sentence

Choices:  A: desk drawer B: desktop C: office D: wristwatch E: city hall<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Based on the scenario provided, it is apparent that all options except E - "city hall" - are plausible options for where to store a calculator. <n><n>The accountant keeps one at home and another at the office, meaning he probably uses these devices regularly to perform work-related tasks (i.e. calculations for tax returns, balance sheets, etc.). It seems logical to find a calculator somewhere within the office space, as opposed to far away places like the wardrobe or desktop. The wardrobe (B) and desktop (C) are not very likely locations to store calculators, because it would be difficult and inconvenient to retrieve them.<n><n>An office, whether it's in the accountant's home, or workplace, would be the most logical place to store a calculator regularly used for business purposes, which is why this would be the correct answer.<n>Therefore, the final answer is D: office<n><n>Input: You might need to buy a suit in the coming week, although you may need it for a wedding. You have an old suit which you bought long ago. On a scale of 1 to 50, do you believe the suit’s grade of wear and tear is at least what grade? Choices: 1: 5 2: 25 3: 45 4: 62 5: 64<n>Output: Reason of Answer<n><n>Based on this scenario, we know that the suit is old enough to be worn on special occasions, such as a wedding. Looking at the options, the only one that describes a special occasion is option 2 (B), which indicates the suit's grade should be at least 25. <n><n>The suit in question would be quite old to be in the grade of 5 or higher. So, options 1 (A) and 4 (D) can be rejected.<n><n>The options available for grade do not directly correspond with wear and tear. Hence we cannot assume that 3 (C) would also be the correct answer. <n><n>Options 3 (C) and 4 (E) are also implausible since it will be difficult to find such ratings.<n><n>That leaves only option 2 (B) which would be the correct answer for this question. <n><n>Therefore the correct answer to

Choices:  A: being married B: sisters C: marriage D: two people E: lawyer<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option "marriage"(B) is out of context as it doesn’t relate to the scenario. Option "divorce" (C) is closer to the theme. It would make sense for someone who is considering divorce to seek a divorce lawyer.<n><n>Option "divorce" still sounds a bit generic and vague. It would be difficult to tell what exactly someone wants to end if they are asking for a divorce. Option "to end" (E) is a bit out of the context but it makes up for it with the detail. It describes the exact relationship ended by the subject - a divorce.<n><n>Thus the final answer would be choice E to end.<n><n>Input: You're at a party full of people you don't know. Your plan is to what? Choices: A: go to the bathroom B: mingle C: tell everyone D: play with your friends E: leave<n>Output: Reason is:<n><n>Options "to mingle" (B) and “to tell everyone" (C) are out of context because they are not the focus of the scenario. This situation is about making new acquaintances and meeting new people. <n><n>Options "go to the bathroom" (A), "tell everyone" (C), and "play with your friends." (D) are not the focus of this scenario. None of them are part of the general plan for the party. <n><n>The final option, "to leave", (E) is a perfectly reasonable choice. If this was the scenario, there is no reason to mingle with strangers - the purpose of the party doesn't require that. It is far more practical to simply leave the party and call it a night.<n><n>The final answer then would be option E - to leave.<n><n>Input:How many people can you fit in this room? Choices:  two, A: seven, B: four, C: three, D: six, E: one<n>Output: Reason and explanation<n><n>Option "more than one" (A) is clearly out of context. This type of scenario is about numbers and space, which would never apply to "more than one."<n><n>Option "less than three" (C) also doesn't fit. This option doesn't account for the additional room needed above the ground floor or the height of the room.

This can be done by looking at what the choices suggest about each person's personality. <n><n>From the choices, "person B" (B) is a species, which would imply that it is likely to do kind and caring acts. Meanwhile, for "species C" (C), we can make inferences that all the mammals within that species would possess caring hearts, not just some. Thus, this choice is not relevant to this question. <n><n>Therefore, we can eliminate "species C." <n><n>Finally, we now have two options - "all mammals" (D), which is a blanket statement that implies caring within the whole group, and "artichoke" (D), which does not make any specific claims.<n><n>Thus, the answer to this question is D: all mammal<n><n>Question 1 of 4:  A person with a heart of gold may have?

Choices:  A: feel cold B: feel pressure C: feel bumpy D: itches E: feel clammy<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step in solving this question is to understand the context and purpose of the action being performed. In this case, the lab technician is testing the effectiveness of a new skin cream by pinching a small spot of skin and applying the cream.<n><n>Next, consider the different sensations that may arise from what is described: "pinching skin [will result] in what?"<n>The first option that comes to mind is "itches", since that is the most common reaction to being pinched. But can we think of anything else?<n>The second choice is also an obvious one - "bumps", which may be caused by the pressure of the skin cream on the surface of the skin.<n><n>These two options are too general, so let's consider other options. "Clammy" (E) is one possibility, but it doesn't convey the specific sensation of feeling something when we pinch our skin.<n><n>The final option that seems to fit is "feeling cold" (B), which is another way of describing the feeling of pressure that occurs when we pinch our own skin. This is the clearest answer, and the most accurate one as well.<n><n>Input: What should be inserted in each of the holes?

Choices:  A: admiration B: applaud C: make reservations D: experience E: sleep<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first clue to use is what the question is asking: "of the year." One is thus left with little choice than to conclude the performance is something exceptional - that is, if it's being played that often then it likely deserves praise from an audience.<n><n>The choice of "standing up" (B) presents the most logical reason why an audience would praise a performance. If an audience stands up, they're applauding and praising the performance, as doing so denotes approval and admiration for what they've seen.<n><n>The next option is "making a reservation" (C). A reservation, whether made for a theater or for a restaurant, signifies that an audience is interested in seeing or eating something. But in the context of this question, what an audience is interested in is the performance itself, as seen by the choice, "standing up." Hence, the correct final answer is "standing."<n>So the final answer choice is C: standing<n><n>Input: An American who worked in Europe and was asked how his day went said?

"He was happy" (C) provides a bit more nuance, but it's also not too far out of context and still provides a simple answer.<n><n>So in the end, the correct final answer choice is B: it's raining<n><n>Input: An engineer worked hard to improve his presentation skills but got nowhere.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What is a person who is well educated? Choices:  A: illiterate B: knowledgable C: own house D: have enough food E: meet expectations<n>Output:		Reason for answering:<n><n>For all the remaining answers under the first part of the question, there are no relevant context (e.g. no person who is well educated is also an illiterate, because "well educated" implies the person must know how to read and write) or sufficient explanation (e.g. "own house" or "have enough food" may be sufficient for a well-educated person's needs).<n><n>Under the second part of the question, the options are less clear, however. "Meet expectations" (E), implies that the person must meet the expectations set by others, and there's no reason to believe that being well educated would result in meeting the expectations of others.<n><n>"Have enough food" (D), meanwhile, is plausible because being well-educated may give you access to food or provide opportunities to learn how to grow food, but it's not the end goal of being "well-educated.<n><n>"Being knowledgable" (C) would seem to imply that knowledge is somehow superior to food or shelter, which is not necessarily accurate.<n><n>Finally under the context, "knowledgable" (C), may be something which a person may have that makes him/her well educated for some people, but may not be something a well-education person should have - it depends on who you ask.<n><n>Finally the most accurate answer is "Being knowledgable",because that is what is expected of a well-educate person by majority of the population,and also because being well educate is not just about having an education it is about attaining good knowledge.So the answer is (C)<n><n>Answer the following multiple choice questions Input: What is a bird?

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Letters are sometimes delivered by hand through one of these. Choices:  A: mail box B: suitcase C: front door D: bowl E: post office<n>Output:		Reason: <n><n>The word "front door" is not a valid choice because this term doesn't explicitly mention the delivery of a letter. Also, the term "bowl" excludes the possibility of hand-delivery as well.<n>This leaves us with the choices "mailbox", "suitcase", or "post office".<n>The only one that could feasibly be a front door is "suitcase". People commonly use suitcases to transport mail, such as when mailing parcels from abroad.<n>Hence, this would be the correct answer.<n>So the final option is D: suitcase<n><n>Input: A scientist may be performing an experiment which includes what?  Choices:  A : observing B : learning C : teaching D : tapping E : writing<n>Output: Reason for final answer:<n><n>"Writing" (E) is an acceptable option as a result of an experiment, but not immediately apparent what the scientist is writing about. This makes this choice out of scope in terms of this question.<n>Option "observe" (A) requires the scientist to be present during the experiment and the data cannot be collected, hence the answer must be ruled out.<n><n>Next, we have "teaching" (D), which is also a valid result of an experiment. As with writing, not everything is known of this process and so cannot be the answer.<n>On the other hand, option "learning" (C) is indeed a possibility in the experiment. Thus, this would be most logical answer to the question.

Choices:  A: wage war B: fight enemy C: kill D: destroy enemy E: attacked his country<n>Output:		Reason: The president needed to come to a conclusion about how to respond to the hate attack on his nation. So the only correct option that makes sense would be "to attack his country"(E), because the attack was done on his country and the president needs to come to an end to the attacks.<n><n>Input:The prince was born to the king, therefore he was a...

The only hand he has is the left hand, because his right foot and right hand were lost. A: The man was dead. B: The man was alive.<n><n>Input: What was the cause for a dog to be in bad health?A: It stayed in a warm, humid environmentB: It stayed in a cold, rainy placeC: It was wounded by another animalD: It was caught by a humanE: It was killed by another dog<n><n>Output: Reason - We have a bunch of different options here, but one of them is "It stayed in a warm, moist environment" (A). This is not a valid answer, since this environment could not be the cause for a dog's illness.<n>"It was killed by another dog" (E) could work, but only if the dog died before it became ill. Otherwise, if the dog was still alive and became ill, it could not have been killed by a dog, since dog's cannot kill themselves. "It stayed in a cold, wet place" (A), on the other hand, appears to be a viable option.<n><n>Therefore, the correct answer is "C" - It was injured by another animal.<n><n>Input: How many cups

Choices:  A: dream B: fiddle C: watch film D: see new E: work<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>Once again, there are a plethora of possible answers to choose from for the scenario of boredom in the office. But the question in this context does not seek to understand how to alleviate boredom, but rather how to deal with it.<n><n>A, "fiddle" (B), suggests distraction, so long as it doesn't result in "boredom," which is the answer to the question "how to tell if you're bored." But that's not the answer.<n>Options "try something new" (E) and "do maths problem" (D) seem to encourage breaking the monotony of an office job, so they are also ruled out.<n>Options "work" (D-B) and "dream" (C) both imply the opposite of boredom - excitement or engagement. None of these describe an answer to "how to tell if bored." <n><n>Meanwhile, option "watch a movie" (E) seems to answer that question, but is an overly simplistic response to a more complex, nuanced issue.<n><n>Finally there's the correct option, "get back to work" (D), which is the answer to 'what to do if you are bored' as well as 'how to tell if boss is bored', as opposed to 'how to tell if you are bored'. Therefore, this answer is the only correct one and is D: Get back to work<n><n>Input: To see what is going on at the bottom of the ocean you must go to what? A: the library B: the theatre C: the cinema D: the mall D: the beach E: the pool <n><n>Output:<n>Reasoning: It's a bit tricky here. You must work backwards. If the answers don't indicate what's happening, then you haven't yet given the question what the answers have.<n><n>What's the question?<n>The pool (E). (It also fits here) If we go with 'beach', this doesn't fit as a word, 'the theater' is way too vague, and 'the cinema' needs qualifying with what exactly he is doing there.<n>'The mall' is a little better, because there are many different things you could be doing there and this is just one of them, which is good.

Choices:  A: cafeteria B: arranging papers C: in the park D: formal dining room E: house<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first thing we observe is that, from the context, we know that the "dining table" in question must be a large and formal table. Based on that, we can rule out the options "cafeteria" (A) and "in the park" (D), which are too informal and casual in nature.<n><n>Similarly, the term "formal dining room" (E) is too vague: this could refer to a dining room in any type of building, home or office.<n><n>That leaves us with the remaining three options - "arranging papers" (B), "formal dining" (C), and "house" (E).<n><n>"Arranging papers" is the most appropriate in terms of context and style, as a dining table must be set for people to eat: it should be set with fine plates, cutlery, and food.<n><n>However, out of those three, "formal dining"; is the most direct option in terms of grammar, semantics, etc.; and thus, "formal d ining" (C) would be the most fitting choice.<n><n>So the choice is "formal dinning (C)"<n><n>Input:What did the 4th grader bring to the fair? Choices:  B: 2 bottles of paint A: a 300 words essay on the concept on social responsibility in the food industry C: a spoon D: a bag of marshmallows E: a pony<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>The first thing to note is that the sentence is referring to a "4th grader" — most likely someone in the elementary-school age group. <n>So, any answer must be suitable for an elementary-aged student, in terms of both content and word-count.<n><n>The next clue is the word "brought." If a person had to travel or carry something to get it to the fair, then a fair-related object must be a possible answer. <n><n>In the context, a child has a toy horse, which would be small enough to be portable. Therefore, it would not be a reasonable answer to say that the child brought a marshmallow (E) - a confectioner's sugar treat - to the fair.<n><n>If the child had to travel to the fair, a more practical option

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Who is likely going in to a market? Choices:  A: stress B: food C: that you D: spending money E: walking<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option A is probably the most obvious candidate. People may go to markets to buy different kinds of food, but these foods aren't bought on a whim. Instead, they are a means for people to cope with stress, usually caused by busy work schedules.<n><n>Option B is another potential answer, in that some people go to markets to have a break from their regular lives by engaging in a hobby such as baking or gardening.<n>However, both options A and B have weak points. Both options involve the word "that," suggesting that people go to markets because they want that (the food or hobby). In this sentence structure, the word "that" is actually more likely to be used for an external goal rather than internal emotions.<n><n>Options C and D are essentially different versions of the same answer - people spend money to buy food, which alleviates stress caused by long jobs and busy schedules. This answer is also vague and can be inferred from the question without the need for any prior knowledge (like the hobby example from option B, and the answer can be interpreted in more than one way. One person could be going to the market to buy groceries while another person could be going to buy a meal outside. The latter could also be considered a form of leisure.<n><n>Therefore, the most suitable answer would be B: food, since it's the least specific version.<n>So the the final answer is B: food

Choices:  A: orchestra B: baritone woodwind sound C: symphony D: play music E: high school band<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>In the given sentence the word "played" can either refer to the noun "the bassoon" or the verb "to play". Therefore, the first thing to do is differentiate between them. If the noun is being used, the context will be: what kind of environment does a bassoon sounds well (played) in. On the other hand, if the verb is being used, the question will be about which environment does one hear "THE bassoon played in an UNpleasing fashion". Now you can cross-out "orchestra" (which would be the usual way a bassoon sounds) and "symphony" (as you can't listen to individual instruments in it) which leaves us with "high school band" (since it sounds bad in every other context except a high school band).<n><n>Output:Reasoning:<n><n>This type of question can often trip you up. The clue is to look out for subtle differences in the sentence. In this question, the answer can be found by analysing the word "unpleasing" - does it mean "disagreeable to the ear" or does it mean "not pleasant" or other synonyms. If the answer is the first, the question would suggest somewhere that the music is played in, not the musician herself. On the other hand if it should be "not pleasant", you have to look out for the words "music sounds". That's an indication that the question is about the music being played, and not the musician. This leads us to two conclusions, either "baritone woodwind sound" or "play music".<n><n>Since the woodwind instrument cannot be played by one person, and "play music" does not help us discern between playing the musical instrument and playing the music, the answer is "baritone woodwinds".<n><n>## # Input:You can hear an orchestra in the distance and wonder who is playing what instrument. Choices:  A : play music B : violin C : bassoon D : cello E : drums<n>```<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>The key here is to note that we are searching to work out for whom the question posed by the narrative to. In essence, what is being questioned is the identity of the person playing the violin. If, on the other hand, it were the music that were being questioned,

Choices:  A: school B: home office C: people store D: print shop E: newspaper office<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The key to answering this question is understanding the definition of the word "printer" in the context of this question. A printer is a physical device that produces copies of documents or images. This means that printers are not typically used in places where individuals work, such as a "home office" (B) or a "school" (A).<n><n>A printer cannot be used by thousands of individuals at a time.

Thus option A can be ruled out.<n><n>It also doesn't make sense that they would add grass. The line of the paragraph doesn't mention anything about grass, nor does it speak of adding anything to the post office or play. The only line that hints at adding something is the bus stop, making option B the more sensible choice.<n><n>Finally option E "play", is just not suitable for the situation mentioned in the prompt. Play is not a line, addition or addition material, therefore E must be disregarded.<n><n>Options A and B seem to be viable candidates for the correct answer. However, by evaluating the context and the information given in the prompt, it can be concluded that B is the correct answer.<n><n>The given information tells us that someone would like to add a line to a bus stop, so option B is the more appropriate choice because the answer mentions a bus stop. As such, the correct answer to this question is option B:  bus stop<n><n>Input:What is an adjective for what they did to the tree? Choices: 1: cute 2: pretty 3: nice 4: cuddly 5: clean<n>Output: Reason :Adjectives are words used to describe or modify a person, place, or thing. In the question, it is asked to pick an adjective that would describe what they did to the grass.<n><n>Options 1 and 2 are both nouns - "cute" is an example of a noun.<n><n>Options 3 and 4 are both verbs - "nice" is an example of verbs.<n><n>To determine the correct answer, it is necessary to look at the question and pick any answer that would describe what they have done to the grass.<n>So the adjective is "cut", with a connotation of being done/ made clean, meaning that it is acceptable for the question at hand.<n>And finally option 5, 'nice', is not acceptable because it is not an adjective and is not relevant. Therefore, the right answer is 'Cut', with the corresponding
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:How can one's views change after learning about science? Choices:  A: appreciation of nature B: become educated C: excitement D: increased knowledge E: see things differently<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>It is reasonable to assume that a change in the way we view things can be attributed to learning about them. Therefore, the option, "see things differently" (E) would make logical sense as the correct answer.<n><n>Options (B) and (C) are incorrect, as they do not refer to a specific type of learning.<n><n>Option (D) is inaccurate because it implies a broader spectrum of new knowledge, rather than a transformation in the way we view the world.<n><n>Option (A) suggests that learning about science will lead to a greater appreciation of nature, however it is unlikely that one's appreciation for nature would substantially change with a single piece of scientific knowledge. There are also other ways to appreciate nature aside from learning about science, such as through travel or art, and so this option is wrong.<n><n>Input:The first thing a nurse should do when providing care is to respect the patient's Choices:  A:"I can do this, I'm a nurse!" B: "It must be nice to have your own room!" C: "Didn’t you used to be a patient here?" D: "I got you." E: "Welcome to x hospital"<n>Output<n>Reasoning:<n>The option "didn't you used to be here"? (E) could be interpreted as a way of welcoming a patient into the hospital and showing that they are surrounded by people who care about them. <n>The option "I got you"(d) could be seen as an expression of support and reassurance, which are essential components of providing care.<n>Nurses are expected to maintain professionalism and compassion while providing care. The other answers could be construed as not being respectful to the patient, as they are either showing lack of respect for the patient (B) or making unrelated comments that are insensitive to the patient's situation (C). The fourth option (D), which is simply stating the phrase "I got you" is a phrase commonly used in US English, which makes it more likely that a US English speaker would find it acceptable.<n><n>The correct answer is D: "I got"<n><n>Input:The "good" person may sacrifice their own life Choices:  A:`sacrifice their own happiness or security B: to "do what is right" C: even when it

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:An expressway can suffer from traffic, this traffic gets worse the closer you get to any what? Choices:  A: michigan B: map C: american city D: rest stops E: country<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The purpose of asking this question is to identify the intended geographical destination of the expressway. When looking at the alternatives, the first consideration is to discard those that do not seem to apply to the scenario, such as "map" (B). We know the expressway does not exist on a map so it should be eliminated.<n>Next, we should think about what the answer might not be, which often gives us a hint as to what it might be. For example, "not map" (C) suggests an alternative. The answer choice "country" (E), therefore, eliminates "map" (B) and suggests "not map" (D) which can lead us to the correct answer, "country" (D), by process of elimination.<n>As another example, if you think about what the answer cannot be, the answer choice "map" (B), it also eliminates "not map" (E) because that cannot be the case. Then, "not rest stops" (D) is the remaining choice. This eliminates "map" and "rest stops" (D)(F) as well as "American city" (F) and leaves us with the correct answer, "not rest stops."<n>So the final answer here is C: not country<n><n>Input:In a movie, there are actors and actresses, the actors are what? Choices: A: guys. No. B: ladies. Yeah! C: both and neither D: male actors. E: female actors. Not too shabby.<n>Output: Explanation:<n><n>The first thing to note is that the options themselves do not contain enough information to find the correct answer. We first start by getting rid of the "no"s because they do not have correct answers. After eliminating "no"s (A), we can get rid of all "yay"s (B) since there's not a yes answer for a "yay." There are two "yes"s (D) and two "naw"s (E). However, "yeah" (C) is an incorrect answer because there are only four answers, whereas there should be five. Therefore, the answer is C: male actors.<n><n>Input: A "Hunger Games" franchise, many people enjoy this franchise. This franchise involves what? Choices: F: People. A: games. E: a

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What can someone feeling happiness fall into? Choices:  A: lead to laughter B: love C: laughter D: smiles E: tears<n>Output:		Reasoned:<n><n>We first have to identify the context and intentions of the question.<n><n>A. We are to determine what causes someone to fall into happiness.<n>We have several choices regarding possible results:<n><n>Laughter; this is the cause of what? Laughter, the effect. "fall into" would imply that the emotion of happiness leads to laughter.<n><n>B. The option chosen here is "Love." According to the information we have, "happiness" has two possible results, "laughter" and "love." This option, "love," follows "happiness" as an effect.<n><n>C. "Laughter." Again, "fall into" would seem to indicate that happiness leads to laughter as an indirect result.<n>D. "Smiles." This is a correct answer if the question was worded to ask what it is that someone who is feeling happiness does.<n>E. "Tears." This is a correct and complete answer if the question was asking what it is someone who is feeling happiness would fall into.<n><n>So the final answer would be<n><n>Choice A. Laughter B. Love C. Laughter D. Smiles E. Tears<n><n>Input: Can a 70-lb person climb a 2-story ladder? Choices: A: Yes B: No C: I don't know D: I don't understand<n>Output: Reason: The problem here is to determine whether somebody or something is able to climb up the second floor of a ladder.<n><n>**Step 1: What is being asked?**<n><n>The text is not clear about what someone or something is being asked to do. It is unclear if the question is asking can somebody do something with a 70-pound person being asked to climb a 2 story ladder.<n><n>We will assume the last sentence was referring to climbing a ladder.<n>Ans: I don't think the sentence is right because no one can climb up the second storey of a ladder, so the answer is no.<n><n>B. No<n><n>B's correct on the basis of my previous explanation.<n><n>Step 1: The second paragraph states that the man is 70lbs so the person climbing the ladder will be much lower and could not climb it<n><n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what?

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The people in class were instructed to brainstorm ideas, how would they use their minds for this? Choices:  A: shake hands B: control events C: talk to each other D: think creatively E: dress themselves<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>To identify the correct answer, the first task is to understand what the people are instructed to do.<n>The word "instructed" implies that a specific action is being requested, in this case, the brainstorming of ideas.<n><n>The next task involves narrowing down the options. Option "control events" (B) seems inappropriate, since brainstorming ideas does not necessarily require managing or influencing events.<n><n>Option "think creatively" (D) is also unnecessary, as brainstorming is not necessarily a creative process.<n><n>That leaves us with just options "shake hands" (A) and "dress themselves" (E), both of which seem implausible given the context of brainstorming.<n><n>Finally option "talk to each other" (C) is the correct answer because brainstorming is an act that requires people to engage with each other. It is a group activity, and talking to each other is an integral aspect of the process.<n>So the final option is C: talk to each others<n><n>Input: There is a large tree that stands tall in the forest. Which of the following would be the best description of this tree?<n><n>Choices: A: a small, weak, sick and diseased tree B: a large old tree with thick branches that spread to the horizon<n>Output:Reasonning:<n><n>1) First we need to understand the context of this question. <n>   There is a large tree in the forest and which of the following is the best description of this big tree.<n>2) First we need to eliminate the wrong options:  "Sick and Diseased" is not a correct answer (B), we want to see the opposite of this.  "Large Old " is not a correct answer, to be large in size implies the opposite. So "Large Old "is not the best description of this large tree (B).  Next "Small and Weak" is not a correct option, to be small means the opposite. "Thick Branches" could be the opposite option. So "Thick Branches - " is a correct answer (A). "To the horizon" should be a correct answer, to not cover the meaning of the sentence. So "To the horizon" is a correct answer. "Sunshine" could be a correct answer
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

Choices:  A: fishing camp B: hardware store C: engine D: your spine E: sporting goods store<n>Output:		Reason:<n>The first task is parsing apart the question and locating the entities that are described. In this case, the "rod" in the question would refer to a specific rod or fishing rod. This would eliminate options like "fish camp" (B) and the "hardware store" (C), neither of which refer to a specific rod.<n><n>The next task involves deciding which definition fits best for the entity of "hardware store", and then moving on to determine what entity corresponds to "rod".<n><n>The only thing that really fits in "hardware store" is "threw a rod", which is not really what is meant by a hardware store. A hardware store is a place where you would buy tools. So while "hardware store" could be taken to represent a store that sells rods, it's probably more helpful to decide what the entity referred to is using a different metaphor. This is the same reason why "fish camp" (option/B) was already disqualified. You don't go to a fish camp and throw rods, you go to a fish camp with rods and use them.<n>Therefore, the metaphor that fits best with the entity "rod" is the one that mentions a "spine", which would be option "D: your spine". So the final answer is "D: your spinal column".<n><n>Input: Which of the following is a true about the US's education system when compared to the education system in many South American countries?

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where do kids find fish in their backyards? Choices:  A: boat B: ocean C: pond D: end of line E: ocean<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question appears to be asking about the location of fish where children typically find it. This can either be on a boat, in an ocean, in a pond, at the end of a line, or in an ocean.<n>Option A ("boat") does not make much sense and is incorrect. Children can go to an ocean but not a boat. <n><n>Option B ("ocean") is incorrect because the question asks about kids' backyards, not the ocean. <n><n>Option C ("pond") is incorrect because it doesn't make much sense with the wording of the question. Kids can't find fish in a pond if there's no fish in that pond. It's not clear whether the question is referring to the backyard of the child who owned the fish or whether the fish were wild. Either way, "pond" does not fit with the context.<n><n>Option D ("end of a line") is incorrect because lines are used in fishing for catching fish, not locating them. Children could go to the end of a line only if the line were in their backyard, but that's not what the question asks. Furthermore, locals in the area could be using children's lawns as fishing grounds without children knowing about it, making the question highly unlikely.<n><n>This leaves us to option E ("ocean"). In the correct answer, the children cannot go to a river, but they are "finding" (locating) fish in the ocean. Children can also find fish in lakes and rivers but not in the ocean if they're on shore. Therefore, the correct answer is E: ocean<n>

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What are you hoping to achieve when talking to someone? Choices:  A: communicating with others B: hurt feelings C: dry mouth D: intimacy E: changing behavior<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>For all of the options, we must determine if speaking with other people can be classified into some of those categories.<n>A is clearly out, because communicating with others does not involve hurting other people's feelings.<n>C is also out, for very similar reasons to A - communicating with other people does involve dry mouth, but it doesn't necessarily involve "dry mouth" in the sense of actually having a dry mouth.<n><n>This leaves us with four options that are related to either personal intimacy or changing behavior.<n>As for option A: "intimacy", while the speaker *could* be trying to be intimate with someone, the speaker could also just be talking to someone because s/he wants to learn more about that person. Therefore, this is probably not the intended target of the question.<n>As for B and D: both options are about the speaker trying to influence someone's decision or perspective, which is related to changing behavior. However, that doesn't necessarily explain the whole reasoning behind the conversation, and could just be an added bonus. Therefore, this question is also unlikely to be the intended target of the answer options.<n>That leaves us with the option E: "changing behavior". Changing behavior is most relevant to the topic of why people speak with others, as doing so generally has the purpose of changing how the other person is acting towards the speaker, or how the other person is thinking about a situation or relationship.<n>So the final and correct answer is E.<n>

Choices C and D both are correct answers because they are action verbs: you’re typing words and you’re falling asleep. That rules out C and D.<n><n>Your watching television and accomplish nothing suggests that you’re spending your time on something that doesn’t count for anything. Since it’s a TV show, a better phrase might be “nothing that counts.” D and E are incorrect.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:John ran out of pencils.  Where did  he go to get more? Choices:  A: desk drawer B: cup C: pencil case D: shelf E: office depot<n>Output:		Reason: <n><n>The first task of this choice is clarifying the context. We know that John has run out of pencils, which means that he was once in possession of some. The choice "desk drawer" (A) is likely to hold a box of pencils. So this is a plausible option.<n><n>BUT, we can also infer that he must have lost the pencils, meaning that he's not re-sharpening one that is running out of lead, but rather retrieving a whole new pencil.<n><n>As for "cup" (B), this only provides a very vague solution, since it doesn't specify where the pencil is kept. It could be in a desk drawer, it could be the cup at his desk, or it could be the cup that he drinks from.<n><n>The choice "pencil case" (C), while a reasonable assumption to make, is very unlikely due to the implication that John took the time to go to the store, find a pencil case, and buy a new pencil. It didn't take him that long to run out of lead in the first place, so we can conclude that he probably has a spare pencil lying around somewhere.<n><n>Finally the choice "office depot" (E) is a good clue as to where John went - he has to be going to an office supply store to get a pencil. But it isn't likely, since it implies that he had to make a detour to another office building just to pick up a pencil. With how frequently he must need pencils for his studies, John probably just grabbed that spare pencil he had on hand - "desk drawer".<n><n>So the final answer would be desk drawer<n><n>Input:  How tall are the people in this picture? Choices: <n><n>A: tall B: medium C: short D: average E: large<n><n>Output:  Reason: <n>First off, the photo only shows two people, but there might be more people in the photo that the camera cannot see.<n><n>Second, "large" (E) could mean something else other than people. Perhaps the camera is viewing a large building or an area of land that can be considered "large".<n><n>Third, "medium" (B

Choices:  A: flower B: animal C: flower petals D: vegetable E: alive<n>Output:		The options “flower petals” (A) and “vegetable” (C) are both correct but you can use only one. Please select the option which is more correct and the first to come to mind.<n>Reasoning:<n><n>Though the options “live” (E) and “flowers” (F) are true, they are not the correct answer because it’s not what to eat that we harvest from a plant.<n><n>The options “vegetables” (C) and “flower petals and fruit” (B) are both correct, so you cannot pick more than one.<n><n>The option “flower” (F) is not a correct answer as well because it’s impossible to “plant a garden you can eat.” <n><n>The option “petals” (A) is correct, so please select the other one.<n>So the final output is C: flower petals<n><n>### Instruction:Find the word/words that best fits the definition.<n><n>Input: the term that means "to make something bigger" Choices:  ACCEPT B: EXTEND OR EXPAND C: ADVERT D: AMEND E: CURSE<n>Output: If a person, place or thing becomes better, it _____.<n>Reasoning: If a person, a place, or a thing becomes better, it is getting ACCEPT because it’s a process of making more or bigger something.<n>And if you use it in a sentence, here is an example ‘Your life will _____ only by being positive and motivated!’<n>So the final answer will be B: EXTEND or EXPAND.<n><n>### Instructions:Choose a word that has a related meaning.<n><n>Input: find the word with the related meaning Choices:  A.

Choices:  A: michigan B: wyoming C: mississippi D: tennessee E: mississippi<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>First, you'd need to learn the answer to the question of "which state is Jackson located in? That would help eliminate most of the options. The rest of the options just need some common sense:<n>If a name is associated with a specific place, like Jackson, California, then the answer is the one that has a Jackson with the governor's office. (That means state capitals.).<n>So the final answer will be "tennessee"<n><n>Input:Anne works hard and is talented as a chef. She likes to serve what she cooks. Choices:  A. soup B. salad C. pizza D. sandwich E. steak<n>Output: answer:<n><n>Since Anne is a chef, I will need to eliminate option c, d, e. B. salad is the correct answer.<n>

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The man wanted to take a bus, but all the chars were full of people doing what? Choices:  A: sitting down B: refusing C: saving money D: sit down E: go outdoors<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Notice that the first choice "sitting down" (A) is the one that involves action on the part of the passenger: the passenger is the one sitting down, not the bus.  This would be one of the only times that an answer choice involves action.<n>Option B is the most viable choice: when a char is full of people, they are refusing to leave. The char is also full because it is also occupied by people - that is, the char is full of people doing what the passengers are doing (which is either refusing to leave the char or sitting down). <n><n>Choice C would also be correct if a person were physically saving money.  But if a person is only planning to save money, then there is no way to tell if the passenger is refusing to leave the bus or refusing to have a seat. Similarly for Choice D. <n><n>Choice E (E) describes a scenario where the passenger decides not to take the bus because he or she would prefer to go outside. But no information is given as to why the passenger would prefer to go outside, whether it is due to weather or some other circumstance. The man simply "wanted to take a bus", but there is no reason why he would prefer to go outdoors.<n><n>Choice E: better understanding.<n><n>[A B]D C B A [C B]C B D C C [ E B A]A B C B E E DA CBD B<n><n>Explanation:<n>There must be at least one empty circle with an even number of arrows. So, we have (A) (B) (D) (C) (E) B.<n><n>From here, we need to find the shortest path. So, we draw lines between arrows with the same label. This forms a path from A to E.<n><n>Next, we need to determine what letters must lie on this path. There are only two choices - B and E. The label on E will match the label on the arrow with one less arrow than B. So the label C with B will match with the label B. Therefore the final answer is E AD BC.<n><n>Input:The bus was too full, so the man decided to walk instead. What could he be doing next? Choices:  [C D]B A D A B [C D]A A A C D [E

Choices:  A: ohio B: washington state C: alaska D: canada E: flowers<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>There are a couple of key points to note here.<n>1. When an item you have purchased at a shop is "imported", it means that it was not grown/manufactured/sold in your nation. <n>2. While "Ohio" (A), "Washington State" (B), "Alaska" (C), and "Canada" (D) are distinct regions in the USA, they are still a part of the United States. They are therefore non-imported goods.<n>3. If the item was manufactured or grown in "Canada" (refer point 2), it would indeed be an imported commodity.<n>4. While Canada might seem like an "imported good", it is not because the USA doesn't pay duty on goods from other states in the USA.<n>Now that the context is straight, we can focus on the specific purpose behind our question, which is: what makes an item an imported good. By eliminating "Ohio", "Washington State", "Alaska", and "Canada" as they do NOT make something an imported good, that leaves option E, where an item is an imported good when it originates elsewhere than the US.<n><n><n>### Instruction:Answer the multiple choice question.<n>Input:The scientist asked his assistant to put their results into a chart to represent them all.

Choices: 	A: aesthetics  B: they’re not graphic artists 	C: they don’t have good spatial imagination 	D: all of the above E: they’re not data analyst<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>The choice "they're not graphic artists" (B) is obviously incorrect, as one of the scientist's tasks is to "make it readable for others". "They're not data analyst" (E), while true, does not directly address the scientist's concern.<n><n>Option "all of the above" (D), or "all choices are correct" eliminates this from the list.<n><n><n><n><n><n>

Choices:  A: training B: satisfaction C: injury D: beauty E: late<n>Output:		The correct answer to this multiple choice question is "training".<n><n>Explanation: Option "training" was the correct answer to the question. The phrase "does not cause" suggests that it is always important to groom a pet's nails correctly. Grooming is a procedure that involves training a pet, and therefore, it cannot cause injury.<n><n>Option "injury" does not fit the intended meaning of the sentence. An injury, by definition, is caused by an intervention or an event causing damage to tissue. Thus, it would be unusual or incorrect to use the term "injury" to describe the potential outcome of grooming a pet's nail.<n><n>Option "satisfaction" is also not correct. This option suggests that grooming is an act to make the pet satisfied with the procedure. As previously mentioned, grooming is a type of training for a pet, where they must learn how to behave, such as how to walk or sit. This type of training does not typically result in satisfaction.<n><n>Option "beauty" is also incorrect to describe the outcome of grooming a pets nails. It is generally considered unprofessional or inappropriate to use the word "beauty" in a scientific context, and specifically in medicine. Beauty is typically reserved for description of human physical attributes.<n><n>Finally option "late" can also be eliminated. The phrase "If done correctly" suggests that there would be an option where it was not done correctly, and therefore, late grooming is possible. But since the question states that it does not cause this? Clearly means grooming a pet' is not done correctly in this option.<n>Thus the only remaining answer that fits the context is "training"<n><n>Input: The scientist did not want to do the calculations and analysis because she knew she would have to? Choices: <n><n>A: prove and defend hypothesis<n><n>B: change her point-of-view<n><n>C: create and manage a new algorithm<n><n>D : find an answer to a new research question<n><n>Output: <n><n>The correct answer to this multiple-choice question is B: change her point-view, as this is the most appropriate choice to reflect the sentiment of the sentence.<n><n>The first choice, A: prove and defend hypothesis, has been discounted because it does not reflect what the scientist thinks she will have to

Choices:  A: vomiting B: pleasure C: happiness D: contentment E: mess<n>Output:		 Reasoning:<n>The first step is to determine what purpose breakfast in bed might serve. <n><n>The only obvious reason is as a sort of pampering or luxurious practice. Therefore, the options which focus on gaining pleasure (B) and content (D) should be immediately excluded. <n><n>But we can't discount the possibility that someone might spill something if eating in bed. For that to be ruled out, we'd have to assume that the scientist is "superhuman" with perfectly steadfast hands. It's highly unlikely that such a perfect scientist would be described in a logic puzzle, which means that the chance of anything being spilled is almost certain. <n><n>Therefore, the only other viable answer would be "happiness" (C). There are no known negative consequences to having breakfast in bed, and eating happily is a common activity which could come with the meal.<n><n>### Link:<n>https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/leetcode-lc-interview-questions/10/

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The judge did not take this part of the job lightly, the man was guilty but it was his passing sentence that condemned the man to what? Choices:  A: go to jail B: incarceration C: intercourse D: death E: judgement<n>Output:		Reason: The judge's actions in this scenario lead to what? "To condemn" (D) is a suitable answer.<n><n>The judge's actions involve deciding what punishment to give the man at his trial. That would obviously be a decision of his own volition, which means the man is condemned to the jail by the judge's decision. This is why "death" (E) is incorrect. While that was indeed the sentence, what really condemned the man to jail was the judge's decision to pass sentence. Therefore, it was the judge who "condemned" him, which led to his jail sentence.<n><n>Next, "judgement" (B) does not mean condemnation. A judgement is merely a decision or opinion, and could mean the opposite of condemnation. Likewise, "go to jail" (A) doesn't fit because the judge's passing sentence ultimately decided the outcome. "Incarceration" (C) is also incorrect because it does not directly fit either of the previous definitions of "condemn/condemnation".<n><n>And finally, "death" is still incorrect because the judge didn't technically condemn the man to death, but rather sentenced him to jail. Since the man was given a death sentence, he effectively "condemned" himself to it, but the judge did not personally decide to condemn the man to jail. Therefore the correct answer is D: "condemn"<n><n>Input: The judge gave the man one last visit to see his family before his execution what was it called? Choices: A: A date B: A dinner C: A farewell D: A time E: An evening<n>Output:<n><n>The man's time with his family before his execution is most appropriate with the word "visit". Choices (B) and (C) are inaccurate because they don't indicate a time in which they will see one another. That would be the duration of the visit.<n><n>"Dinner" (B) would indicate an event for food. Likewise, "farewell" (C) is incorrect because this is not to say goodbye (although it might end with one).<n><n>Similarly, "time" (E) is mistakenly used to describe the occasion.<n><n>Therefore, the only option

The visitor asked, "Do you want to what with me?" Choices:  A:"know" B: "find" C: "discover" D:"scream" E:"seduce"<n>Output: Reasonling:<n><n>Input: As expected the experiment showed that all of the bacteria were bacteria. How should the scientist summarize the results? Choices:  "There were bacteria." "All the bacteria were true bacteria." "Everything is bacteria." "Some bacteria are other kinds of bacteria." <n>Output: Reasonlogy:<n><n>1. "There were bacterio" is not a suitable response, because it doesn't describe the experiment's results in general. It is also not an exact answer to the original question, which was "How should the scientist summari the results?"<n>2. "All the bacterio" (D) would not be the best summary, as this would imply that all of the bones were part of the bacteria (or bacterio) sample.<n>3. "Everything is bacoeria" would be an incorrect answer, as the response doesn't accurately summarize the results. It is also possible to have non-bacterial bones, so "everything" would be too broad and general.<n>4. "Some bactoria are other kinds of" would be incorrect because the "are" indicates that something is related to bacteria. However, no such conclusion can be drawn from the results of the experiment.<n>5. So the only correct response that answers the original question perfectly is "Some bacteria is other kinds of bacterium." Reasoning:<n>6. The first step is to identify the main purpose of the summary. Specifically, it should outline the general conclusion from the experiment.<n>7. The next task is to identify the main points of the results. In this case, the results should indicate that all of the bone samples were bacterial in nature. Thus, the correct summary should reflect these primary insights.<n>8. The final step is to combine these two pieces of information to generate an accurate summary. This could look something like "Some bacteria was other kinds of bacterial
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E).

Choices:  A: cash drawer B: piggy bank C: purse D: box E: pocket<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The clues here are that 1. The drawer only opens from the front, which makes the back impossible to pull out from 2. the dollar has to be a denomination smaller than a dollar (if it were an original dollar bill, then it would be possible). After eliminating options (B), (C) and (E), 2nd option is the most likely since it's a smaller denomination bill (the dollar has to be smaller denomination because when you put it in the cash register, you pay by the dollar, not by any other denomination <n><n>Input:What is the correct mathematical order of operations?

B: it will be very good. C. it will be even better next time. D:  it will be even better the next time.  Output  : reason: the company made a product but the sentence says they will buy the product. If the product is good then why are customers buying the product? <n><n>Input: A: if someone is not careful with things that cost money B: people must not be careless with things that are free C: no matter what one has money is hard to find D: if money can not be earned the hard work is worthwhile E: everything you own depends on what you do<n>Output: A is correct.<n><n>Input : A:  the first step was to decide what it would take to make a  difference Choices:  A :to give all you have  B:to do the best you can C: to make a start now D:to make the best with what you have E:to show you have the will to do it  Output: A<n>Input : I was in a hurry. So I grabbed my  camera and took a few shots. Choices :  A :to give my family a surprise when I got home  B:to make myself some extra money  C: a way to capture memories D : to see what the pictures looked like<n>Output: A,because its a question of subjective choice of words.<n>Input "My mother used to say to me :I'll be fine so long as I" Choices : A :know I'm  in the right place.

Choices:  A: soccer game B: capillaries C: ball D: animals E: person<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option "blood isn't usually  spilled in a soccer game" (A) is partially correct: blood can be spilled in a soda game, but not during the actual soccer play. If you've ever seen a soccer player roll on the ground (because they got an accidental elbow or foot to the face), they're "spilling their blood" - but it's not part of the sport itself.<n><n>Option "bloody sport that doesn't not allow the use of hands" (B) is technically grammatically correct, but the spelling is incorrect and the order of the words is incorrect. We would say that a sport does "not allow the use of hands", instead of the word "not".<n>Option "bloody ball" (C), unfortunately, has also missed the target in terms of spelling and punctuation. A "bloody ball" doesn't sound quite like something someone would say by themselves, so we can definitely eliminate that.<n>The remaining options are all a correct play on the word "bloody": "bloody sport" (D), "bloody animals" (E), and "bloody humans" (E).<n>Based on these factors, the correct answer is E: bloody humans<n><n>Input: The word "blood" is used in the sentence with the most sensitivity. Choices:  A : 2 B : 1  C : 3 D : 4 E : 5<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>First, we must determine the correct usage of the word "blood" in this sentence. Option A, " 2 bloods", is used in the question. It would need to be changed to "2 bloody people."<n>Next, we must determine which option has "bloody use" or usage. Option C is missing an apostrophe and should be changed to read "bloody uses". Option D also has an apostrophe, but it doesn't belong there, as it's not possessive. Option E is correct in terms of both usage and punctuation.<n>Looking to see the placement of the words in this given sentence, option E should also be placed between 3 and 5 in a list of five things<n>Based on these, the correct answer is 5:bloody use<n><n>Input: What does the word "bloody"

Choices:  A: violin case B: symphony orchestra C: class D: learning to play violin E: music store<n>Output:		Reasoning<n>Reasoning (this is a position on what):<n><n>The first task here is to define the context of the question correctly. In this question,'made first violin' essentially means'makes first violin', which suggests the person is a musician. <n>But there's the catch - a person cannot play the violin if they're at the position of a'symphony orchestra' (C).<n><n>Thus, the answer would be 'learning to play the violin' (D).<n>The only relevant option left is 'learning to play the guitar' (C), which falls short when the person is classified as a musician. But the phrase 'instruments' isn't used, indicating it can be anything else they like.<n><n>As a result, the final answer is E.<n><n>Input:In New York City, the mayor of the city was elected?

Choices:  A: overhead compartment B: chair C: hospital D: in shirt E: business meeting<n>Output:		Reason and RD: The word 'attache' is not a place but a container in which someone may carry personal items such as documents or books. The other options describe locations in which one may place items or may be located in, but none is a container in its own right.<n>In particular, 'in shirt' could refer to the pocket of a shirt, but is likely to be a misunderstanding of the intended meaning of 'attache case'.<n><n><n>### Instruction:Answer the second set of multiple choice questions.

Choices:  A: netherlands B: utrecht C: brussels D: belgium E: denmark<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Option "netherlands" (A) appears to be incorrect because Amsterdam is the capital of the Netherlands. But according to an online dictionary, Amsterdam is a city in the Netherlands (not a country), which indicates the term "the Netherlands" is sometimes used to refer to the country of the Netherlands, where Amsterdam is located.<n><n>Option "brussels" (D), unlike "Amsterdam," is a city that is indeed the capital of a country. But according to that same online dictionary, Belgium is not the country with the capital of Amsterdam.<n><n>Option "utrecht" (B) is also an incorrect choice as it is a city within the Netherlands that is located 26 kilometres east of Amsterdam.<n><n>Finally<n>option "e" "denmark" is the right answer: The capital of this country (Denmark), which is Copenhagen, is also the capital of the country to which it is the capital (the Netherlands).<n>Input: Can we say the following? The movie is a documentary, therefore it is not fiction? Choices:  a: true b: false<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>It's important to read the entire set of conditions stated in a conditional statement.<n><n>This question follows from "Can we say that if a movie is a documentary then it is not fiction?" - this is an inference question.

Choices:  A: exhilaration B: dismemberment C: spinal injuries D: getting wet E: splats<n>Output:		Reason<n><n>The first task here, as with any text problem, is to understand the context. There's no reason to think exhilaration (A) or spinal injuries (D) would be the outcome of a cliff diving stunt. Dismemberment (B) - not so much, as that's a violent and bloody outcome.<n><n>The clues to the real answer lie in the term "comedic what" (E). It's clearly describing something that would happen in the context of a comedy sketch show, and not a serious or violent situation.<n><n>That leaves "getting wet" (E) as the only option that could possibly be the answer. Anything else would be more suited to a violent, dramatic, or horrifying situation.<n><n>Input: When you say "no kidding" it usually means that you're telling the truth because you are what? Choices: A: A doctor B: A joker C: A prankster D: A liar<n>Output: Reason:<n>The first task is always to understand the context and determine what is going on. The clues in the question indicate that you are talking to somebody and you are telling them that you are telling a truth. This first indication eliminates the three option that are not "telling somebody." However all three options are possible choices because you could be talking to a doctor/joker/prankster and you could be lying. There is still confusion among the remaining three options if you want to tell the truth you are either lying, joking / pranking or a doctor.<n><n>Option C (“pranking”) is the most likely because you can make the truth into a prank, but not vice versa.<n><n>There are two types of truth; “the truth” and “your truth.” You are saying you are “telling the truth” which means there is no distinction in your mind between the two types of truth.<n>If you were honestly telling the truth you must be telling your truth, which is a lie which means you're trying to get the person to believe that you're telling a lie even though you aren't.<n><n>Input: Every day people from across America and all over the world get together to enjoy what?

He knows that it will be a good fit and he has experience, but he doesn't have all the qualifications that they're asking for, so he's worried about what? Choices:  A: acceptance B: rejection C: hope D: less sleep E: employment<n>Output:		Reason:<n>As seen in the previous answer of the question, the context of the sentence is relevant to determine the meaning of "Wants".<n>This job that he wants is about applying a job position that he wants. So James will need to get all the qualifications that the hiring company asks him for.<n>If James already has the required qualification and experience, he will have a little bit worry because he think there is a big chance to get denied. <n><n><n>Input: After the firefighters put out the fire the people were allowed back into their homes.

Choices:  A"B:C:D:E:<n>Output:Reason:<n>In the given sentence context, "I'll" = subject and "you" = object. The predicate in English, or "main clause", is "be honest" and it is negated by "not". The verb forms are in the negative: "won't" for third person singular subject "I" and "won't be" for second person singular object "you". This is a negative sentence. There is a predicate in the embedded clause which is "be honest".<n><n>Input:The city council debated the proposed budgeting changes for days. Choices:  { A:B:C:D}<n>Output:Reason:-<n>In the sentence above, "The city council debated" is the main clause.<n>"The city council debated for days" is the embedded clause.<n>As a result, the sentence is in the passive-voice.<n><n>Input:The car is a vehicle that transports passengers. Choices: { A:B:c:D:E:F}<n>Output:Reaon:-<n>The main clause is: "The car is a vehicle", with subject "car" and predicate "is".<n>The embedded clause is: "that transports passengers", with subject "car".<n><n>Input:I will never forget the time in London 2012, when Michael Phelps and all his competitors swam with great enthusiasm. Choices:  D:E<n>Output:Reason(Sentence and predicates):<n>In the sentence above, "swam" and "competed" is subject in each verbal clause. The embedded clause "competed" with subject "swam" is in the past passive voice and the embedded clause
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Many addicts turn to exercise to deal with their addictions, this is because it is a healthy way to do what? Choices:  A: condition heart B: expend energy C: laugh D: stretch E: weigh<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n><n>Answer: The first part of this question refers to the purpose of exercise. There aren't many options that don't involve exercise, but it turns out none of them are related to exercise, which is incorrect. The second part of this question does not appear to be looking for a specific consequence of exercise. This makes it likely that a consequence, rather than a purpose, is the correct answer.<n><n>The answers we've eliminated first are "condition heart" and "weigh" because they are not consequences and "stretch" because it says it's a consequence.<n><n>Out of the remaining answers, "exercise" and "expend energy", none of the options are what the question is looking for.<n><n>"healthy way to do what", which doesn't seem to mean anything, is a possibility, but the word "what" immediately excludes it, as well as some of the remaining choices.<n><n>So the final answer would be A: expend energy.<n><n>Input:What did the scientist want to do with the lab data? Choices: A: analyze it B: publish it C: present it D: test it E: summarize it<n>Output: Reason<n><n>A: analyse it (B) - analysing the data isn't an action, but rather an activity<n><n>B: publish it (A) - publishing the output of the study isn't an outcome of data analysis<n><n>The remaining options are C, D, E.<n><n>The first two options are likely eliminated because C) is about the presentation of data, which is done before data analysis, while D) is about testing data, which is done as part of analysis.<n><n>Out of those that remain, the answer has to be about the outcome of the analysis of the data. So the last two options are the most likely answers and the final answer is E) summarize it<n><n>Answer: The question is asking what the scientist wants to do. The options are all actions, but in reality, an action involves a doer and an object. The object is what the scientist wants. Therefore, we look at what is not said. The scientist doesn't want to do anything (A), nor does he want to publish, present, test, or summarize (B, C, D, and E). The options are a stretch, or the object of the

Choices:  A: downtown area B: container C: ocean floor D: the lost city of atlantis E: high school<n>Output:		The shop will give you cash for your purchases.Reasoning: The answers provided the the question:<n>* * "A shop will give you for your purchases." * "A shop will "give you" for your purchases." Reasoning: "For" is a preposition and is a part of the sentence. No other verb follows the preposition which means that the shop will provide you with an incentive in the form of "for"(the incentive) and something else.<n><n>* * "A ship will give you for your shopping." * "A shop "will give you" for your shopping." Reasoning: Once again the shop will give you something. "Will" is a verb and it denotes a future action. So the shop will provide you money for your shopping. You are given money "for shopping" i.e in exchange for your purchases.<n><n>* * the shop will provide what for your purchases. * the shop will provide "what for your purchases."Reasoning: The shop will provide something in exchange for your purchasers. "what" is an indefinite pronoun. So it is something. So the shop will give you money for your shopper i.e in exchange of your purchases.<n>* * the shop"will give" you a reward "for your" shopping.Reasoning: Reward is defined as something that causes a favorable feeling in a person.So you are being rewarded "for" being a valuable customer to the shop. Here "for" is verb and will come after the indefinite pronoun." for " your shopping is incorrect. What should the answer be?<n><n>So Option C : the shop will give "cash" for your shopping.<n>

John bought they because he knew that they would look good.  Where might they be installed? Choices:  A: kitchen B: pantry C: containing pots and pans D: in a flight E: mexico<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>1. Since cabinets are for the kitchen or pantry<n>2. Therefore the cabinets must be imported from either Mexico OR Spain.<n><n>Input: My best friend is the one who I spend most of my time with.  I have known him since elementary school. Where were we born? Choices: 12. 12 A: The Bahamas B: The Dominican Republic C: England D: Haiti E: Japan<n>Output: Reason :<n><n><n>1.The word "best" in the sentence suggests they have a strong bond.<n>2.The use of the words "I spent most of my time with" is used in the phrase "you and me against the world".<n>3.The words "I have known him since elementary" can probably be paraphrased to be " I have known him since preschool or kindergarten."<n><n>4.The use of the word "since" could be used to suggest the start of a relationship.<n><n>5.The phrase "with my bestie" can be interpreted to mean that the person can possibly be the opposite gender (i.e. the best way of showing that they can trust eachother is sharing secrets and stuff) and most likely that they are friends.<n><n>6.“My best friend is the person that I spend most of my times with.” - this means that the relationship is most probably strong enough to be labeled as a friend.<n><n>7.A "Best friend" can most of the time also be a lover (friend relationship), so from this sentence it could be said that I have known this person since preschool or I have known this person (as a friend) since preschool.<n><n>8.Given that we do know this person as a friend, he could be a girl or a guy, but most of the time probably a guy (it will most probably always be a girl is the sentence had been rephrased the other way around: "I have known her since preschool").<n><n>9.From this sentence it could be concluded, that most of the time this person is a guy.<n><n>10. The use of the word "and" could suggest that we are mentioning the birthplace of my (the subject speaking) best friend.<n><n>

Choices:  C: 98 E: 108<n>Output:Reasonning:We can see that the correct answer option is E, as it is the only one that is a three-digit number.All other options are less than 100.This clearly indicates that the correct answer choice is option E with value 108.<n> <n>Input: Where would you find the biggest flock of birds in the world? At the airport or during a parade?Choices:  E: Both A: At the airport B: During a parade<n>Output:Reasonng:Let's take an example below. Here we have a flock of 200 birds. So, we can clearly see that the flock is of the 200 birds rather it is 200 thousand or 200 million. Therefore, it can be easily seen that it is not correct to compare the number a flock of birds with the number of parking spaces at the airport.<n><n>Therefore, we can easily mark the answer option for E with 'Both' as the correct one.<n>Hence, we can clearly understand that the option for E is correct.<n><n>Input: We can tell if two people have the same genetic parent based on a DNA test.

Since cars don't start after soaking in rain, option A is incorrect. Option B is also incorrect because the driver probably tried it already.<n><n>Options C and D are both correct. Crawling underneath the car is to determine whether the battery died because often that's the cause of a vehicle not starting. However, if the car is a gas vehicle, then option D is the best option because you drive to a mechanic. If the car is a Diesel-powered car, then it is important to know whether the car has a battery, the engine dies when the battery dies.<n><n>However if you do not know whether your car is gas or diesel engine the first choice to do would be to go to the mechanic to have the mechanic tell you whether your car has a battery or not so you can know whether the engine died or not, because if the engine died, you would also need a mechanic.<n><n>In some countries, you can also buy car start fuel/fuel injection fluid(such as 1 in 1000) it can also be called fuel injector cleaner, which can clear the fuel injector and help the car start more easily, and the effect is almost the same as the diesel 250 clean(250 is the injection volume, which is almost equivalent to 0.25 liters).The most important thing is that some car owners do not know whether their car's engine is gasoline or diesel.<n><n>The above information is about Chinese-language answers, and the answers in English must be based on different contexts.

Choices:  A: at the zoo B: south carolina C: hen house D: louisiana E: arkansas<n>Output:		Reason:<n>The clue lies in the question's reference to the phrase "in a land locked, southern state". If we have in mind that we are indeed in a land-locked southern state, any answer that does not include a reference to the fox in question will not be correct.<n>This leaves us with three other remaining options - south carolina, arkansasand louisiana. All of them describe a distinct region of america, and thus have different characteristics - in particular, they differ from the other mentioned southern states of california, florida and tennessee. This may assist us in our search for the correct option.<n>In summary, of the four regions given, south carolina is characterized as being landlocked, however arkansas and louisiana are coastal states. We could then conclude that the person referred to in the question is not in louisiana or arkansas. <n><n>Since the person in question is not in a louisiana or an arkansas, it is probably safe to rule out options (A) and (B) as incorrect. <n>Similarly, even though the phrase southern state is present, we can't conclude that the person in question is in south carolina or florida, because the person's location is still unknown and we don't know if they are actually located in any of the four southern states mentioned (south carolina, louisiana, arkansas and florida). <n><n>In summary, this leaves us with three remaining options - florida, louisiana and arkansas. But the question doesn't make sense if we conclude that the person is simply in one of these three states - it doesn't explain why their location is relevant to the context of the question as a whole.<n>Furthermore, neither of these options explicitly involves the fox in question, so we can deduce that these are incorrect.<n><n>This leaves us with one last option - a zoo in florida. This answer definitely involves a fox, as it is a zoo. It also relates to the context of the previous phrase, in which the person's location was described in certain terms of geography, and this description must necessarily include a mention of the fox.<n><n>So the final answer was option (E): florida

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Sam found a giant hole in the plain.  What might this hole be called? Choices:  A: hill B: gorge C: sandplain D: cliff E: mountain<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>To start, Sam is a character who's looking for a particular thing: a "giant hole" in the "plain." Because it's a plain, not a mountain, the obvious answer is "A: hill." <n><n>However, "hill" (A) is the incorrect answer, because a hill (typically) is steep. However, this plain is flat and featureless, making it "a bit dull." Choosing an option that doesn't describe the plain seems implausible.<n><n>Next, the options "B: gorge" (C) and "D: cliff" (D) may appear plausible because of how deep these features may seem, but there's a problem with each.<n>First, a "gorge" (B) is a landform usually created by the erosion of a river.  Because it's not a water body, "A: plain" (C) is the most plausible option because it is flat. <n><n>Second, "D: cliff," a high escarpment along the edge of a plateau, seems to fit at first, but there is no evidence that this flat plain extends over the edge of a plateaus.<n><n>As a result, the only remaining option is "E: mountain" (E). A mountain is simply a lofty feature on the land; the only other answer that fits the context of this scenario. Choosing "A: hill" (C) would be correct.<n>So, the final answer is E : Mountain<n>Input:There were some interesting letters in the spam folder today.  If people receive this type of email, what is it called? Choices: A: Spam B: Phishing C: Phishing D: Fake E: Spam<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>This question presents a variety of common terms used to refer to "spam." So, if you're unsure of the exact definition for any of them, just skip it to the next question.<n><n>In this scenario, "A: Spam B: Fake C: Phishing" (B) and option "C: Phishing D: Phishing" (C) may appear to both be valid answers, but the text "type" implies that this is a person's email and refers to emails that are "in one's inbox."<n><n>The word
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:After going for run you have a sense of what? Choices:  A: satisfaction B: flying C: sweating D: falling down E: trip<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Again, the scenario invokes the sense of having participated in a certain activity after going for a run.<n>The runner then goes on to describe that activity. "Satisfaction" (B) is out of the question, as going for a run wouldn't by nature result in a "sense of satisfaction".<n>"Sweating" (C) is a physical reaction to the physical exertion of going for a run, and so also excludes this option. <n>"Falling down" (D) is a risk that comes with physical activity, but it doesn't necessarily have to be one that applies to running.<n><n>"Trip" (E) refers to an incident or accidental occurrence, and it's unlikely that that phrase refers to any such event in the context of running.<n><n>The only remaining choice that fits the sense is "trip". The final answer, therefore, is E: trip.<n>

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What will you need to do to decide whether to be seeing artifacts? Choices:  A: learning B: painful memories C: thinking D: awe inspiring E: pleasure<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step is to analyze the question, which leads to answer A: learning. Learning is needed to "learn whether seeing the artifact was in fact seeing".<n><n>The second step is to disambiguate the purpose for learning. If "learning" was the purpose for the task at hand, than the purpose would be to know whether these artifacts are real. If "doing math" is needed, the answer must be "Doing Math".<n>By this logic "A - learning" does not fit the purpose "learn whether the images shown were actually visible"<n><n>The same logic applies to "C: thinking" and "B: memories". In both cases, "learn whether the images...were actually visible" would become the purpose, while "thinking" and "memories" would then be the methods to achieve this purpose. Both "thinking" and"memories" would violate the rules set forth in "C"<n><n>As "memories" and "thinking" are rejected, answer "B: thinking" has to be a choice. There is then a choice of "E: pleasure", but "pleasure" is a state and not a method.<n><n>Thus the final answer is D: thinking.<n><n>Input:To whom would you call about your baggage if you were on a train ride along with an archaeologist that was too much? Choices: <n><n>The question asks to call someone which might mean to call via phone or video call.<n><n>The question also includes archaeologist which indicates a person's interest.<n><n>So the answer might have to do with a person or to do with something else. <n><n>There is only other person on this train so that can eliminate choice A<n><n>So the question becomes to whom would we call about a person and choose B. <n>B is a person so <n><n>Input:What if you have to go away for a weekend at an old cabin in the mountains? <n><n>We have to go away.<n><n>So it doesn’t matter who is going. A person is doing things. So in order to not have to go away we have to not go away. So we can go back to person and then change to who you have to go with. They are then both asking different questions.<n><n>Input:Who would you call if you don't like your roommate and you'

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:A lonely man committed suicide, why would he do that? Choices:  A: suffering B: he was happy C: avoid problems D: unhappy E: end pain<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first thing to consider when answering this multiple choice question is the context of the question itself. The question presents a man who committed suicide, which implies that he was suffering or unhappy. This eliminates options "he was happy" (B) and a "avoid problems" (C).<n>The man's motivation can only be further interpreted based on his state of mind - "he was unhappy" and "he was suffering" (those cannot be disregarded).<n><n>Options D and E can be safely ruled out. The choice "avoid problems" is not likely, as suicide is a drastic action that often is taken as a response to intolerable problems. And the choice "end pain" is unlikely, because the question's statement asserts that the man was miserable "for many years". So these cannot be accepted.<n><n>This leaves us with only one option - the choice of "he was unhappy", because it is the most logical fit for the information provided by the question.<n><n><n>Input:I've met my girlfriend, we've been dating for 7 years and we're planning to get married in the summer, I couldn't be more exited. She's the most beautiful woman I've ever known and I love her with all my heart. What I don't like, she spends too much money. I thought we were gonna share expenses but she thinks she knows better all the time...  what should I do? Choices: 	A: she is the woman of my dreams  B: that's not a problem  C: ask her for an additional income if it's really an issue  D: you have to start planning for your honeymoon  E: get married anyway she is worth  the whole world<n>Output: Reason<n><n>The question presents a dilemma between two options. Option A "I've met my dream girl" is clearly incorrect if you consider the context of the question as a whole. The man has not met his girlfriend as she is not a newcomer to his life, but the subject of a relationship for 7 years. This means, option A is not an answer to the question. <n><n>Option B "I don't think that's an issue" is the most logical and straightforward answer - spending money does not have

Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:If I am suffering from boredom, and I want to do something with a dictionary, what would help? Choices:  A: do crossword puzzle B: see art C: give up D: grocery shop E: play chess<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>In this question, the only possible scenario for option A (play crossword puzzle) would be if the dictionary were part of a crossword puzzle. However, even then, it wouldn't help to "do something with a dictionary" in that situation.<n><n>Option B (see art) makes sense if the dictionary contains images or illustrations alongside definitions and explanations. However, if the dictionary is purely text-based, it doesn't make sense to use it alongside to look at artwork.<n><n>Option C (give up) is impossible, as the task of "doing something with a dictionary" would have already been completed. It can't be discarded or reversed at this point, nor can it be thrown away.<n><n>Option D (grocery shop) is similarly inaccurate. The task of "doing" something with a dictionary does not involve shopping for food - the two concepts should not go together.<n><n>Option E (play chess) is also out of place. Chess is a game that requires some form of thinking and planning, but analyzing the dictionary doesn't require those skills.<n><n>The final remaining option is "play chess". The dictionary can be used as a reference for words and phrases relevant to chess, and the game can be played using those terms. This helps to "do" something with a dictionary and can be used to alleviate boredom.<n><n>So the final answer would be E: play chess.<n><n>Input:When I first started playing chess, I had a lot to catch up on. My instructor told me that in order to learn, I should focus on _____. Choices: A: strategies B: theory C: words D: skills E: combinations<n>Output:Reasoning:<n><n>This question is about the specific word "catch-up", which means "to make up for a failing or inadequate performance." In this case, the person had a weak foundation in chess knowledge and was struggling to "catch up" with more advanced players.<n><n>Option A (strategy) is often used in military tactics or other types of games, but typically not in chess. The focus of chess is more on tactics than strategy, and players are not required to form elaborate plans and use them to win the game.<n><n>Option B ("theory") is not generally

Choices:  A: expect to die B: believe in god C: stay in D: watch movies E: eat corn<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option "believe in god" (B) would be reasonable if this was about a researcher examining the impact of people's religiosity on health. But if we're asking about an individual's general choices, it doesn't qualify. Similarly, "stay in" (D), while commonly used by certain individuals, isn't a universally common option. Similarly, "watch movies" (E) is reasonable to some degree, but it's unreasonable on the whole scale.<n><n>The only answer that remains is "expect to die" (A). People expect that they will die some day, and they often associate that prospect with food choices. People may choose to eat a dish that contains the most nutrient-dense ingredients so they can have a better quality of life in their final days. Or they may go for less nutritious options in the belief that they will die at a young age and it doesn't matter what they eat.<n>So the answer is A: expect to die<n><n>Input: Which of these would the person be least likely to want to have? Choices:  a: red b: white c: green d: blue<n>Output: Reason<n><n>We can eliminate all but one answer. "white" (B) and “blue” (D) cannot be the answer because those questions require "which" word while the main purpose of the sentence is about "someone". That means it should be one person, so we eliminate both of them.<n><n>Thus the answer is “green” (C).<n>Input: Which of those would be the most likely to occur in a hospital?

Choices:  A: necklace B: wall outlet fixture C: tool box D: computer E: motorcycle<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Because screwing a chain ring onto something suggests fixing something, choice B (a wall outlet fixture) can be eliminated. The rest can be narrowed down by noting that "wall outlet fixture" in general is not something one "screws" on.<n>Choice E, a motorcycle, has been eliminated because "screwing a chain ring onto [a motorcycle]" would make no sense. Only choice A (a necklace) remains, which would be the correct answer.<n>So the final answers is A: necklace<n><n>Input:There is a 75% chance that I will be able to finish the project.

To determine the mass of the watermelon including the peel, one would have to know the mass of the peels on the entire watermelon, which may not be possible. So answer E is incorrect. Answer F is incorrect because one would not have any peels to determine the mass of from the sample of one slice.

To protect themselves from germs, peppers grow thick walls.<n>C. Peppers have seeds like watermelon rinds.<n>D. To keep insects away from their seeds.<n>E. Because they are the best looking fruit around.<n>Output: Answer: B<n>Reasoning: It is unlikely that someone who wants peppers to be better looking would make them shaped like that. Therefore,
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The garage had light sensors and automatic doors, what kind of house was it? Choices:  A: modern house B: building C: townhouse D: neighbor's house E: downtown<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The best answer is "E" because a garage that is adjacent can be built as anything from a simple garden shed to an extra floor added to the end of a large Victorian-era home on a property. There is no special style that is more common than any other.<n><n>Input:What kind of car do you like? Choices: 	   A: a truck B: a sedan C: a coupe D: a pickup truck E: a convertible<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>The correct answer is "E" (Convertible) because we can all agree that convertibles are more fun than cars with tops that are up. And this is a  multiple choice question where the letter D (pickup truck) is wrong. <n><n>Input:What is the weight of the rocket? Choices: A: 40 pounds B: 900 pounds C: 190 pounds D: 1,000 pounds E: 600 pounds<n>Output:Reasoning:<n><n>Because it's too large, we can cross off A (less than 40 lbs); and of course, it must be more than 600 pounds (D). We can narrow the options down to B (greater than 190, but not more than 900), or C (equal to 190).<n><n>Input:	What is 6 + 7? Choices: A. 20 B. 21 C. Not an integer D. 40 E. 41<n>Output: <n><n>Answer: B. 21<n><n>The number does not have to be a multiple of 6, so the correct answer is 21. A multiple of 6 would have to start with 6, so A and E are out. Answer C is also wrong because the sum of two numbers cannot end in a decimal. Answer D (not an integer) is also wrong because 21 is an integer.<n><n>Input: What is the temperature of the water? Choices: A - 35˚C B - 35˚F C - 60˚F D - 59˚F E - 59˚C<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>The correct answer would be choice D (59˚F). We start with choice A
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Billy went away because his parents were fighting and he didn't want to stay where? Choices:  A: home team B: present C: at home D: come back E: charming<n>Output:		Reasoned:<n><n>The most logical reason to take away from this question is that Billy left because he didn't want  to stay where his parents were fighting. The other choices are either irrelevant (home - which suggests he did not go away, A) or are not clearly in favor of him departing. <n><n>The remaining choices may have relevance to the scenario, but it's not clear if they are intended as reasons for Billy's departure, and they may simply be a reflection of what the other party is saying. For example, the response in (A) could be part of Billy's parents' explanation, rather than his own response.<n><n>In conclusion, Option E - better understanding - is clearly the most logical choice.<n><n>Input: A scientist came home and the door locked, so the scientist began to climb the tree. He could not understand why the answer to the question, because he wanted to do what? Choices: A: gain more knowledge B: gain more strength<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>The answer to this question is (D). In order for (A) to be an option, the scientist would have to be trying to gain **more knowledge**, not simply knowledge. Therefore, he would have to have some existing knowledge and be trying to get more.  <n><n>Similarly, (B) could be considered if the scientist were trying to gain more strength, but the answer given implies that he was trying to gain more knowledge.<n><n>Therefore, the only logical option is (D): "Do better" - as the scientist was trying to figure out the answer to the question."<n>

Choices:  A: small B: underground C: high D: huge E: tall<n>Output:		Reasoned:<n><n>Option A: the Empire state building could be a small building compared to others; however it could not be an underground building nor a high building. A high building by definition is one taller than buildings around it. So the first three options are eliminated.<n><n>Option B: This one is a no brainer, underground buildings have no height. That leaves us with a huge building or a tall one.<n><n>Since the question does not ask for the tallest structure in the world, an Empire State building could probably be one of them. A tall building by definition needs to be one that is taller than buildings around its surrounding area. However an underground building in New York is hard to find given its hilly terrain. So we eliminate option A and B.<n><n>Only a huge building or a huge building would suffice for the Empire State building, which is option D.<n>

Choices:  Yellow : A: Person’s name B: Gender C: Job Title D: Relationship E: None of the above<n>Output: Reason.<n>None of the above says that it does define  person’s name, job title, and relationship  but not a gender which means in the question it does include gender.<n><n>Input: In your class, you have your choice of a blue pen or a green pen, but not a red pen, or a purple pen. That’s a limited choice. If you had even more choices, it would be what? Choices: A: Unlimited	 B: Restricted	 C: Infinite	 D: Countable E: Uncountable<n>Output: Reason;<n>Countable: A countable noun is a count noun. That is, the noun can have an indefinite number of instances (or members): "the water is running," or "the children are playing." For instance, if you say "the flowers are beautiful," the last word refers to a number of individuals and thus, it is a countable noun. For instance, water and children, because these represent a number of people, are countable nouns. The number of flowers is not specified. You could have flowers blooming in fields for generations, so the number of instances of flowers is infinite. In mathematics, the set of all countable nouns is called the natural numbers.<n><n>Countable:<n>The number of students in our class is finite and unknown<n>

Choices: A: take the compliment B: accept C: deny D: tell you're not E: tell the friend to keep quite<n>Output:Reason:<n>In this scenario, "you're bald" is the most likely outcome, as is "go bald." However, if you disagree with the truth, you most likely will not like to accept the result. As such,  option A, "accepting the compliment," seems like a more accurate response.<n><n>Input:  The old man has run out of wood, he will need to what? Choices:(A) cut down a tree B) plant a tree (C) get a permit D) hunt a deer (E) seek out an engineer<n>Output:Reasoning:<n><n>As for the options, option A should be the correct option, because he needed another source of wood, and it is natural to cut off new trees for the old man. Meanwhile, option B should definitely rule out as inappropriate, since the old man should not be planting trees for himself when he has already run out of wood.<n>Option (D) should rule out as incorrect, because while one can hunt a deer for a source of wood, a hungry old man would not like to waste a full day in hunts and wait for the deer to grow.<n><n>As for option (E), the old man should be seeking to replace the wood he has run out of, so "seek another source" (option (C)), sounds most appropriate.<n><n><n><n>

Choices:  A: heart transplant B: distance himself C: perform surgery D: study medicine E: let blood<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question posed asks what treatment a doctor who used leeches might have performed. This implies a previous treatment that involved leeches. In this case, "distance himself' (B) and 'perform surgery' (C) cannot be correct because they don't involve leeches in the treatment.<n><n>The treatment with leeches was likely a bloodletting one, which would have been performed by bloodletting (A) or a doctor (E).<n><n>"Study medicine" (D) doesn't make sense because bloodletting is already a form of medicine.<n><n>Hence, the final answer is A: heart transplant<n>

Choices:  A: bounce the ball B: competition C: have fun D: race E: score points<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step is to understand what the player's goal is during a basketball game.<n>It is not to bounce the ball; basketball games do not involve bouncing a ball.<n>It is not competition; this is a common goal in many sports, but not in basketball.<n>It is not having fun; people often have fun while competing in sports, but that does not describe competition in itself and is not the goal of the competition.<n>It is not racing; although basketball games can be played competitively, they do not involve racing.<n>The only option that remains is "to score points."<n>So the final answer here is C: have fun<n><n>Input:The goal of a basketball game is to what? Choices  A: run a race B: enjoy C: beat another team D: bounce the ball E: score points<n><n>Output: Reason :<n><n>The first step in answering this question is to understand what exactly the players are competing for when playing basketball.<n>A basketball game is not a race or a competition, as the players are not running or competing with each other. They are simply trying to score more points than their opponent on the other team.<n>Therefore, option "to score points" (E) is correct.<n>So the final and answer to this question here is E: score points<n>

Choices:  A: georgia B: tree C: nature D: under the rocks E: france<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>When dealing multiple choice questions, the first step is to understand the prompt. In this case, the scenario describes a snake that is either an American or a cottonmouth. But only the latter (B) answers the question "georgia" in Georgia, a state found in the southeastern region of the US. If the prompt provided extra details (such as the snake's home country or its continent), then you would have more to go on than the mere fact that it was a cottonmouth and from where?<n><n>The next step is to eliminate irrelevant options. Here, the choice "from where" is irrelevant because the prompt only lists a single location - Georgia. However, options such as "nature" (D) and "under the rocks" (E) are irrelevant because they do not address a particular location at all.<n><n>The choice "American" (A) also falls into this category, as it is not tied to a particular location but rather gives a vague definition of the snake's species.<n><n>The final option is "georgia." While this answer is relevant, it is not the best option because it only mentions the location of the snake, not its species. Therefore, for consistency and to remain unbiased, the correct answer is "georgia" (A).<n>So the final answer was georgia<n><n><n>---<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question based on the choices below.<n><n>What is the correct answer for the above question? <n><n>1. It was a cottonmouth<n><n>2. It was a cotonmouth<n><n>3. It was an cotonmouth<n><n>4. It was an American cotonmoth<n><n>5. It was a cottenmouth<n><n>6. It was a cotenmouth<n><n>7. The answer is 53.748<n><n>8. The answer is 68.952<n><n>Output: Reason<n><n>To begin, the first question should be to understand the prompt. The scenario describes a snake as either an American cottonmouth or a cottonmouth - the name of a species of snake. The term "cottonmouth" gives more information about the snake, as it is a name given to one species in American herpetology. Therefore, option 1 is the correct answer.<n><n>The next step should be to eliminate

He could see clouds when he looked out his window.  Where might he live? Choices:  A: in books B: radio station C: city D: tower E: medieval castle<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The context of the problem refers to James as "living in the top of the tower," which implies that he's not on top. So the answer choice that states he lived in the top isn't a feasible option A: in books, which refers to where the story of James taking place is located.<n>This isn't a correct answer because the context is about where James actually lives.<n><n>The answer choice that refers to James living in the radio station is incorrect E: medieval castle, because the context states that James can see clouds when he looks out his window. That means that James doesn't live in the medieval castle. <n><n>The answer choice C: city, is correct because James can see clouds when looking out the window of his tower. If James was in a city, clouds wouldn’t be visible to see.<n><n>Input: How many squares are there in the following rectangular array? Choices: <n>A: 27 B: 11 C: 0 D: 28 E: 12<n>Output:Explanation:<n><n>To answer the question you must count how many squares in the following matrix. The array has 7 × 8 cells. There are three types of cells. Each cell can be either empty, a '1' or a '2'.<n>Therefore, the number of possible 8-digit values is 384 × 384. And if the empty cells are counted as '0', the answer will be 8 × 104,000= 1,280,000<n>So the answer is E. D is not a correct answer because the number of possible combinations is 384^2, but not 384<n><n>Output: Explanation:<n><n>This is a very simple question. To determine the answer choose every box that is filled in and then count all the boxes that have 1's and 2's on each side. To determine the answer to this question you need to know that there are 14 blue squares and 24 pink squares in all. Therefore the answer would be E.<n><n>Input: What type of problem is this?

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

Choices:  A: cash register B: desk drawer C: pay envelope D: throw away E: box<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n><n>The first step in answering this question is to identify the context of the check. A "person writes a check" suggests that the check was received by a clerk in some capacity. Therefore, the answer must be in the context of a clerk receiving a check.<n><n>The next step is to narrow down the possible locations where the clerk might put the check. Answer options "cash register" (A), "pay envelope" (D), and "box" (E) would be reasonable; "desk drawer" (B) is clearly out of context, as it is a personal item rather than a professional tool.<n><n>The final step is to determine which answer is the most accurate, and therefore the most likely location for a clerk to place a check after receiving it. Out of the three possible options, "pay envelope" is the only one that fits the context of a clirk recieving a check and using an envelope for the purpose of paying. Since all other options are more contextually accurate, the only answer left is "D: pay envelope".<n>So the final answer to the check question is D: pay envelope

Choices:  A: contagious B: wrong C: last forever D: painful E: blind<n>Output:		Reason: <n><n>This question is asking us to look at the phrase and the meaning of the words "everyone" and "feeling".<n>In this context, "everyone" does not mean literally everyone. It refers to a large number of people - perhaps even the entire human race. In other words, it's possible for a large number of people to feel love at the same time.<n><n>The word "feeling" can also be interpreted differently than its simple definition. Here, it refers to an intense emotion, rather than a simple, fleeting feeling. It's possible for a number of people to feel deep, intense emotions at the same time. This option would then be correct.<n><n>Final Answer: D: painful<n><n>Input: It's a dog's life Choices:  A.

The answer choices explain what we can, should and will do about the weather.<n><n>Reasoning: "It's getting better" and "We hate the rain" do not fit into the scenario. We can act upon the weather by using sun cream but it cannot solve the problem.<n><n>"we need to know more about the weather  suggests that the problem is not known to us, i.e. the weather is new to us. However we know the type of weather and hence do not need to know more.<n><n>"We should not talk about it

There was a target on the wall for him to bounce against.  Where might he be? Choices:  A: pool table B: toy box C: playroom D: park E: closet<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option "playroom" (B) is the most likely location here. Bouncing a ball against a target on a wall sounds like the scenario is taking place in the playroom - a place where children play and interact with their toys.<n>Option "closet" (E) does not make sense here. The wording of the question mentions a target to be bounced against, suggesting that there is a spot where this happens. <n><n>Option "park" (D) is uninformative, as it refers to a general location instead of an actual setting.  It would be inappropriate to use the place name park here, since it would suggest that he's in a park rather than his playroom.<n><n>Finally the answer is a is C: playroom<n>Output:Billy bounced a ball against a wall there was a target on the he could not think what to do.Therefore he went to the park with his mother.

Choices:  A: supermarket B: motel C: at hotel D: shampoo bottle E: hair salon<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The option "motel" (B) makes no sense given the context that the delivery man is delivering a crate of shamopo. Hotels don't use shampoo.<n><n>The option "at hotel" (D) similarly doesn't make sense because hotels would not be buying shampoo in the first place.<n><n>The option that could be viable is shampoo bottles (C). Shampoo bottles are the place where one would use shampoo, as opposed to hotel rooms, where one would not be. This would be sufficient for the logic behind this question to align: "going through a lot of it."<n><n>The other option "hair saloons" (E) is problematic since salons are not places where shampoo would be used as readily as a hotel or bottle would.<n><n>So the correct answer finally, is C: shampoo battles.<n><n>Incorrect input / output:<n><n>Input:The girl ran to school, she had trouble getting her homework done what? Choices: A: a lot of books on the train for class B: getting a lot of bubble gum to chew<n>Output: Reason<n><n>The girl ran to school in order to get an opportunity to get her homework done.<n>Here, the option "a lot of books" (A) is obviously untrue. In fact, she would be able to do more of her homework if the "lot of books" had not been getting in her way. <n><n>The other option, "getting a lot of bubblegum" (C), is also untrue since the girl has trouble getting her homework complete in the first place. Gum is not a necessary ingredient for completing homework after school, so it's also unlikely that gum would actually be needed to improve the task of completing homework.<n><n>So the answer here is that she had trouble getting her books to school.<n><n>Input:The dog did not know what to do, he got some water every?

Choices:  A: see king B: hello C: meow D: drink water E: live many years<n>Output:		Reasonings:<n><n>Option "drink water" (C) doesn't make sense because cats don't typically drink water. The option "live many years" (E) is also incorrect because it contradicts the statement "what would you normally expect a **cat** to say".<n><n>Option "see king" (A) could be a misinterpretation of the phrase "a cat". The writer may be attempting to say the phrase "see king" as a play on the phrase "look at me", which is also a cat-related phrase, used in an attempt to get attention from another human. While this is technically sound from a grammatical standpoint, it doesn't accurately represent what the writer was trying to convey.<n><n>The option "meow" (B), the common cat sound, is the correct answer because it is the most likely thing you would expect a cat to say.<n>So the finals answer is B: meow<n><n>### Input: Your friend invites you to her house for dinner. She asks what your favorite food will be. Choices:  A. French onion soup  B. Shrimp  C. Fruit salad  D. Stuffed bell peppers  E. Pizza<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>Option "frog" (E), while hilarious, doesn't make sense as a choice for favorite dish because frogs don't eat pizza.<n><n>Option "stuffed bell peppers" (D) is a strange option, because bell peppers are usually filled with meat, not vegetables.<n><n>Options "French onion soup" (A), "shrimp" (B), and "pizza" (E) are all plausible responses because they are all foods commonly enjoyed by humans.<n><n>In the end, it is hard to say what the exact favorite dish of a person is without them verbally claiming it as theirs. Thus, the correct answer is E.<n>So the final answers are A and E<n>

Choices:  A: injuries B: fatigue C: traffic jams D: tired E: accidents<n>Output:		Answer:<n><n>Reasoning: Let's break down the question first. What are the possible outcomes of being reckless by driving fast? <n><n>* Injuries: This would be bad, but we shouldn't be too surprised since you're recklessly driving. <n>* Fatigue: This seems to be the most logical answer. <n>* Traffic jams: Although this may occur, it wouldn't be a direct result of reckless driving. <n>* Tired: This seems to be too general of an answer. <n>* Accidents: It's obvious that being reckless on the road will lead to car accidents. If your driving was reckless, then you would have more accidents than someone who was driving responsibly. <n><n>The answer to the question is therefore B: Fatigue<n><n>Output: The answer is D: A person. <n><n>The question states, _What does ‘X + Y = Z’ mean to a person?_ It is clear that ‘X + Y = <n>Z’ here is in reference to something like an arithmetic equation. <n><n>Therefore, ‘a person’ is the most accurate answer. The key here is to determine the main noun of a sentence and then determine other applicable nouns that suit the sentence.  <n><n>A: The answer here would need to be something associated with a person. An inanimate object is not something that a person can interact with or describe in this manner. <n>B: In this case, the sentence refers to a mathematical formula, such as ‘adding’. Thus, it would be incorrect to attribute feelings and emotions to math. For example, it would be wrong to say ‘Math is angry’ or ‘Math is sad’, whereas that would fit with the above description of ‘a person’ as the main noun in the sentence. <n>C: Although ‘the person who is riding a bike’ would have technically been grammatically correct, we can deduce that this does not suit the above context. That’s because in a scientific/mathematical context, people can be replaced with the noun ‘particles’. For example, ‘particles interact’ or ‘particles feel’.   <n><n>D: The answer would need to be something related to arithmetic. From the above descriptions, we know that ‘A person’ is the correct main noun of

Choices:  A: pass water B: bathe C: listen to each other D: feel pleasure E: reproduce asexually<n>Output:		Reason:<n>There are three criteria on which an answer to this question can be judged: relevance, context-basedness and concreteness.<n><n>1. Relevance:<n><n>The question invites you to reason that there are certain tasks that animals can "only do if they were born to do it". This phrase has a rather philosophical ring to it, and can be found all over TV commercials and other media.<n><n>Thus, it is important to focus on the connotations of the phrase "doing something well", which means that it implies mastery.<n><n>2. Context-basedness:<n><n>The question asks us to explain what a certain type of animals does not do well. So, we can say with almost certainty that it is not "doing something well" - otherwise, they would not be bad at it.<n><n>3. Concreteness:<n><n>The question also asks about activities that require a certain kind of "know-how". "Swimming well" here means that the animals are good at swimming, while "passing water" means passing urine. Since the question refers to swimming, we can say with certainty that it cannot be referring to the passing of urine.<n><n>So the final answer to the question is B: bathe.<n>

Choices:  A: opened B: closed C: found at shower D: falling down E: locked<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first thing to note is that the "owned" must be a plural, as the context suggests that there's more than one cat. But all options except “falling down” (E), are singular, implying that the kittens have just one door that they can enter by.<n><n>The second thing to note is that a kitten that's already grown up to its full size would not need to "get used" to their own space - so the option "gotten used to" (B) is ruled out.<n><n>In the context, the cat owner isn't talking about the bed itself, but the space around it. Thus, the cat isn't allowed to climb onto the bed.<n><n>It's possible to reach the ground from the bed via a ladder, which could be why the owner mentions a shower. But this isn't explicitly stated, so this leaves 3 possibilities - a ladder, a stool(step stool?), or a chair.<n><n>The ladder and chair options are out since the cat isn't a tool-using cat. The shower/stool option rules out the ladder, leaving E: falling down, which is the answer here.<n>

(england), where does everyone know to buy a cup? (hardware department of the store) - there this are connected because of the answer we need to make a connection.

Choices:  A: cause spots on leaf B: healthy C: wellness D: ball stopped E: cure<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>A disease is spreading rapidly, and researchers are scrambling to understand its cause. To determine the cause, they'd need evidence that could lead to a cure. Therefore, a good answer would imply the term "cure" is desperately sought for.<n><n>One could potentially consider "cure" (D), but the wording of the question states "healthy" (C) and "wellness" (D) options are possible answers. Both of these terms would imply the cure of the disease, but the question seems to suggest a direct reference is needed.<n><n>The next option is "ball stopped" (E), but it's very clear that researchers wouldn't be searching for a ball. Therefore, it can be eliminated.<n><n>Lastly, the option "cause spots on a leaf" (A) refers to a specific symptom of the disease, and wouldn't apply here.<n><n>Leaving the last two options as "cure" (B) and healthy" (C). The two options have different ways of stating the same thing. The two options mean the same, either of these options would be correct to select as an answer.<n>So the correct answer is "C: healthy"<n>

Choices:  A: telephone network B: freeway C: company D: wall E: airport<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>This one is tough. The wordplay is a bit confusing: electrical connection vs. electrical wire. It depends on the context. But the clue is in the first sentence: he "checked" his connections, so this would seem to indicate he was making sure they're doing their jobs properly. That means he's looking for either a faulty connection or a broken wire. In either case, he would look where it's most likely to occur. In which case:<n><n>The first few options all sound good. I believe "phone network" (A) is a plausible connection: one could find faults in electrical connections within the phone network by performing system tests.<n><n>The remaining candidates I can see having a connection (or a connection fault) involve "company" (b), "wall" (c) and "airport" (d). "Company" (b) may seem out of context for electricity, but there could be electrical engineers working in the company.<n><n>The reason "wall" (c), "company" (d) is correct is that these locations have a plausible relationship to the electricity. "Airport" (d) is a tough question because it's not logical in the context of this question.<n><n>The final answer is C: company

Where might he be? Choices:  A: crowd B: high school C: city D: somewhere E: theater<n>Output:		Reason:<n> <n>The first step is to identify which word or phrase can be replaced so that each of options make sense. In this case, the word "speech" could be replace by either "play" or "theater".<n><n>The next step is to identify where the replaced word most likely exists in the context of the sentence. Both "city" (C) and "theater" (E) seem reasonable, since both are proper nouns representing a specific, geographically defined location. The only way of determining which is more likely is to identify when and why "city" or "theater" would be used in the sentence.<n>However, "theater" (or "play") does not seem to be necessary here, because the sentence could still be correct without it: "Jan went to the auditarium and listened to __ the __." Furthermore, "somewhere" (B) is also not necessary. The sentence would still be grammatically correct if "somewhere" was removed: "Jan went to __ to listen".<n><n>Taking these considerations into account, "theater" is disqualified as an option, and "somewhere" is disqualified due to unnecessary wordiness. That leaves city vs. high school as possible substitutions.<n><n>To make a more definitive decision, one must analyze the context of the sentence in question, specifically the word "auditorium". Auditoriums are used only for plays, lectures, or similar events. That rules out all options except "high school" and "city."<n><n>The last criterium aids in deciding. "Jan ____ the auditorium"; "Jan ____; 'high school' doesn't make sense because then the sentence reads "Jan went to high school to listen to a speech" (which makes no sense), and "somewhere" would make it read "Jan went to somewhere and listened to a speech" (also not very informative).<n><n>Thus, the final option is "high school" (C): Jan went to the auditorum and listened to the speech."<n><n>Therefore, high school makes more sense as the context of the sentence and it is a location so Jan went to high school and listened to the speech would be correct for the option C.

Choices:  A: shelf B: cellar C: refrigerator D: cupboard E: grocery store<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>To determine the answer to this question, you need to consider the context clues provided in the question. The word "I," indicated that the "I" person is speaking in the first person, or referencing things done directly by themselves. The mention of a canned food drive, and needing to pick up some contributions.<n><n>The next task to determine the answer to this is to eliminate any options that do not make sense given the context of the scenario. As "shelf" and "cellar" refer to the ground and space beneath the ground floor of a home. The "refrigerator" is the fridge and the cupboard is a type of cabinet.<n><n>So, the answer is D: cupboard.

When someone asks how long, what are they trying to find out. Are they trying to find out in which month they will be travelling or for how long they will be travelling for.<n><n>This eliminates answers of “months, years, seasons, etc.”<n><n>Secondly, we must determine what part of speech “away” is. A, B and C make sense because “away” is used as an adverb, referring to distance.

If the wheel was tight, then the driver would be aware that it was tight. Instead, it threatens to "fall off" (like an animal that has been loosened from its bindings).<n><n>Option E is not relevant, because "bind" has no relation at all to the wheel falling loose.<n><n>The only correct answer is E: bind.<n><n>Input: While we wait for the bus, we often read, walk, read and/or what?

If we were lying while waiting for the bus, we wouldn't be able to read.<n><n>Option B - makes more sense. If we are not walking or reading, then we must be doing something inactivity, like work.<n><n>Option C - is also unlikely.

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The teams were evenly matched when competing against one another, what did spectators want to find out? Choices:  A: envy B: resentment C: winning or losing D: one winner E: two winners<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>This is a tricky question because most of the options are plausible, which allows for a multitude of interpretations.<n>Eliminating irrelevant words/topics helps to focus in on the task at hand.<n><n>Option B (resentment) does not accurately describe what spectators are looking for in this scenario. It's unclear whether they are looking to resent a certain team or individual. Additionally, it is not uncommon for spectators to show admiration and appreciation for a team's skills.<n><n>Option E (two winners) is incorrect because the teams were evenly matched, which means they are likely to split the winnings, implying there will be one overall winner.<n><n>Option D (winning or losing) does not accurately capture the scenario either because spectators aren't necessarily looking to see whose team "loses" or "wins" specifically, but instead, what would be the outcome.<n><n>The remaining options, A (envy) and C (better understanding), give two different sides to the same coin and fit the scenario best. Envy could describe how one would want a team to win, or it could describe how a spectator would feel towards those who won. Similarly, better understanding could describe either the spectator wishing they understood why a team won or the spectator wishing to understand the skills of the winning team. All in all, the most accurate option is C: better understanding<n>

Where would he look? Choices:  A: fish market B: hawaiian waters C: gulf of mexico D: tropical sea E: south pacific ocean<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>Option "E: south pacific ocean" is the best choice.<n><n>Johnny is already in the'south western' part of the Americas, so 'near America' would mean 'anywhere north of south America'. This rules out options 'a-d' because by definition 'fish market' and 'tropical sea' are in the Americas, just as 'beaches' (c), and 'gulf of mexico' (d) are. <n><n>Option 'b' means that he's looking for it in 'Hawaiian waters'.<n>That would be Hawaii, which is also in north America.<n><n>The same reasoning applies to option 'c', the gulf of mexico in North America, or option 'd', the tropical sea, which would be another form of the gulf, also in North America.<n><n>Option 'e' therefore, is the only one that makes sense. Johnny would look to sea in places south of America.<n><n>So the final answer would be E: south pacific<n>Input:In your first day of class, your classmate told you the story about his aunt, who is 4 years old. The student is a 15 year old boy.  What's that story? Choices:  None<n>Output: Reasonung:<n><n>There is no way to know, as the child is only 15 and they can't know what he thinks.<n><n>As the story is said to be 4 years old, but the student is 15, and the aunt is presumably an adult, the story is probably meant to suggest that the aunt is old, and the student is young. As such, it's likely that the story is fictitious.<n><n>Input:What is a story about a boy who falls down but won't get hurt? Choices:  none<n>Output: Reasioning:<n>The question is about the story. So the meaning is not to tell it or ask whether a story like that is true or not. But rather the answer is “what is it?”<n><n>Input:An old woman was talking to her neighbor’s kid.

Choices:  A: mobile phone B: wristwatch C: briefcase D: office E: desktop<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>"Tiny" in this context implies some sort of portability, not necessity. Therefore, this question should be answered in terms of a "calculator that can be carried around" rather than just "a calculator."<n><n>The word "calculator" implies a more advanced device, rather than something simple like a pencil and paper. Therefore, option A ("mobile phone") can be eliminated.<n><n>The remaining options mention a calculator that aims to be used in one place, not portable, and therefore none of these answers are relevant.<n><n>The most reasonable answer would be E: desktop computer. This is the earliest example of "a tiny calculator" that could be portable for usage, but could be kept at someone's desk if necessary. Therefore, it best fits the context of the question, and should be the accepted answer.<n><n>

Choices:  A: apartment B: pantry C: table D: living room E: shelf<n>Output:		Answer:<n><n>The question states that our candidate should be able to identify a place to store dishes, but not books. With this in mind, the first candidate answer stands out - apartment. This word contains the word "place" and fits the context of a storage location for dishes.<n><n>The next set of options - table and shelf - are unlikely candidates for the role of storage space for dishes. Table conveys the notion of a surface on which dishes can be placed, while shelf implies that dishes should be stored on a horizontal surface.<n><n>Finally option B is clearly incorrect, as we already identified apartment as the correct candidate for our role of storing dishes but not books. The word "pantry" does not convey this requirement.<n><n>The answer is apartment.<n><n>Input: If a word is at the end of a line, what letter does it start with? Choices:  B: C: D: E: F: G: I: M: N: P: R: S: T: V: W:<n><n>Output: Answer:<n><n>The first set of options, A through F, consists of letters that may or may not be at the end of a given line. The other set of options, from G to M, covers letters that are universally placed at the start of a word, such as I and A.<n><n>Therefore, the most logical choice is option G, as it covers all the correct possibilities for this task while excluding the incorrect options.<n><n>Input: You are reading a book on the left.

Z.<n><n>Output: Answer<n><n>As we can see, the phrase "on the left" refers to reading direction, which would place one on the left side of the book. This means that the book would be oriented in such a way that one starts the chapter on the left and follows the same direction throughout.<n><n>The option "N. O. P. Q. R. S. T. U." (G) seems to be a correct choice, but it is a wrong answer. Reading as indicated in this option, there would be no way to

Choices:  A: guide children B: understand children C: control children D: care for children E: vent anger<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>This is a classic question that can be applied in many scenarios: A parent is yelling at their child because the child has done something wrong, or that is misbehaving, or that is getting into some sort of chaotic or dangerous situation.The parent is trying to get the child to correct his/her actions, so the answer is: C: control children.<n><n>Another choice could have been D: care for children, but when someone is yelling as the parent is, it is to try to get the child to behave in a good way. This shows the parents are trying to control the child.<n><n>The other choices are outliers and can't possible be the answer.(B) understand children, (A) guide children, (D) care for children and (E) vent anger.

Choices:(A) Keep calm(B) Control themselves(C) Remember what you've said(D) Respond(E) Express emotions<n>Output:Reasoning:(A): When people are losing their temper, they always do something that shows anger or emotion. So C is not possible because people just "Remembers what you've said" at least once when they lose their calm, they can't remember their last words because they are usually wrong words.This question says people can have emotions but they can't control themselves, that's why it's B. D says people can react to the environment but people can't express their emotions.

Choices:  A: city B: strip mall C: clerk D: neighborhood E: rooster<n>Output:		Which would you visit in a hospital? Choices: A: beauty salon B: school C: mall D: dentist E: restaurant<n><n>Output:<n><n>These questions are both categorization questions, where all of the options are classes in a category and the task is to pick the option that most closely matches (or fits into) the category as a whole. They are also sometimes called "situation questions" or "choice among categories."<n><n>The general strategy for category questions is to pick the option most likely to be found in the category as a whole, given the description.<n><n>The two questions above deal with classifications of stores and places. In the beauty salon question, the only option that has potential for a connection to a beauty salon is A. The others are not likely to be found in a beauty salon. Similarly, the hospital question asks us to classify stores/places likely to be found in hospitals. The question is fairly explicit about what each option could potentially be in the context of a hospital and the options are ranked in order of probability. <n><n>In each case, the answer that makes the best sense as what is most likely to be found with those labels for those places is the correct answer.

Choices:  A: complications B: tiredness C: anger D: trial E: court case<n>Output:		The only feeling a person might institute civil action is anger.<n><n>The first line of this problem reads: "What feeling might propel to instituting civil court?" This sentence refers to the word "propel," which here refers to actions prompted by a certain emotion. <n><n>The word "court" in this sentence is in connection with the word "propel" as one's emotions can result into the instituting of court action. Thus, the answer option "court action" (D) is ruled out.<n><n>"Anger" is the answer we're looking for. It is the only option that perfectly fits the context of civil action - that is, as a result of anger. Option "trial" (E) is related to anger but is irrelevant to the problem at hand. "Complications" (A) isn't as emotional as anger and is not a factor in instituting civil action.<n><n>The same reasoning applies to other options. "Tiredness" is not an adequate emotion to institute civil action, and "B " is inappropriate in this context. This makes "anger" (D) the only applicable answer.<n>So the final choice is A: anger<n><n>Input: Who is the man behind Dollar's dollar menu? Choices: 1. Aaron 2. Jeff 3. Seth 4. Steve 5. Matt<n>Output:The answer is Jeff.<n><n>The first time I was in McDonald's I saw that they were calling it dollar menu plus, which was just a way of saying a dollar menu, with more options than before. The reason why people call it that is because they don't think they can afford to buy lunch. At the beginning, it was just one dollar items.<n>So this clue tells us that Jeff is the one who is behind Dollar's Dollar Menu. <n><n>The second line states, "the only thing in common between the three of you was a shared name." The answer (4) Steve does not fit this clue, which states that only one is shared a commonality, not three. So 4 is out.<n><n>The final clue in the dialogue reads, "So you had an aunt who was the first one with the dollar menu?" The answer (A) does NOT fit this clue; no one else in the

Choices:  A: furniture store B: fishing camp C: hardware store D: sporting goods store E: engine<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n>The question can be answered in several ways. The word "where" implies that there are options for purchasing a fishing rod, so not all choices will be incorrect as an answer (e.g., "nowhere else"). The context of this question also suggests that the fishing rod is essential enough to merit frequent shopping at multiple locations.<n><n>Choice A ("furniture store") would certainly be an option if you were looking to buy a fishing rod, but it doesn't seem very reasonable under the present circumstances as stated in the question.<n><n>Choices B and C ("fishing camp" and "sporting goods store") are both plausible, but neither "sporting goods" nor fishing activities would be found exclusively in just one of the places (e.g., there is no rule that a certain type of sporting goods must be sold in a camp or vice versa).<n><n>The best answer is Choice D ("hardware store"), which is the one place you can buy a (pretty much) anything. A hardware store sells everything from sporting gear to furniture to fishing rods, to car engines.<n><n>Input:What did they bring me? Choices:  B: sushi C: pizza D: tacos E: a box<n>Output:Reasonning:<n>The second half of the question ("I said I wanted...") is vague, so we know that there probably wasn't a "they" who brought the subject anything. Also, all they were given was a box with something in it.<n><n>While the word "brought" does imply that it was one of two parties who delivered something to her - which could technically be "they" - we know the subject had a friend, and we also know that the friend has not returned. But we also know from what he said that the box was brought to him, so that means it would have had to come from someone else. So if it was the subject's friend, that'd be "we."<n><n>The word "box" is fairly vague in nature, and could mean nearly anything. However, the fact that a friend gave it to the subject, as well as the fact that it was not brought here (suggesting that it was delivered to her in the field) would eliminate things such as "pizza," which could not be found

Choices:  A: jerusalem B: texas C: middle east D: china E: india<n>Output:		Reason (A):<n>The clues given in the question prompt are clear. They refer to a temple in the middle east, which eliminates all but one option: Jerusalem (A).<n><n>The correct choice is thus "A: jerusalem"<n><n>Input:Which of the following languages does not appear in the book of revelations? Choices:  a: greek b: english c: hebrew d: dutch e: german <n>Output: Reason:<n><n>The book of Revelations is a book from the Bible. There are 66 books in the main collection of the Bible which is called the Canon. Revelations is a part of the New Testament, which is a collection of religious works from the early Christians from AD 80 to AD 200.<n>This passage from the Bible in Revelation 5:1:<n>"Then I saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the throne a scroll written within and on the back,...sealed with seven seals."<n>In this passage we do not see any mention of greek, so greek is ruled out. To confirm this, we can visit any online dictionary. A search on Google for 'what language do the books of the Bible appear in?' yields the following results:<n>"The original books of the Hebrew Bible generally appeared in Hebrew or Aramaic. Only the New Testament was written in Greek. The original books of the Old Testament were translated from Hebrew to Greek between 250 and 200 BC, and were compiled to produce the Septuagint in Greek. These Greek versions became widely used in the Eastern church in both Greek-speaking and Armenian-speaking churches."<n>In one line, it says that the original books of the Bible were written either in Hebrew or Armentian.<n>In the previous answer, we already ruled out the book of revelations written in english. Therefore, we are left with hebrew (c), dutch (d) and german (e).<n>We have two additional clues about the question now: it's a language, so Hebrew and Armentian are not options and as it's in the book of Revelations, it falls into the New Testaments, however it does not fall into any of the categories mentioned above.<n>To confirm this choice (E) is the correct answer

It wasn't the bloodsucking that he disliked, it was that the insects made what? Choices:  A: fly B: buzz C: move D: honey E: help flowers pollenate<n>Output:		<n><n>The answer is "C" (buy). The sentence is not saying that John likes all insects (that would be A (Fly)), or that he's afraid of them (this would be A (Buzz), <n>but it does suggest that he may dislike the sound of insects (say, to avoid attracting them, it might be inopportune to attract attention to oneself by making noise (C (move)).<n><n>But the final choice he mentions is not about insects at all - he's talking about flowers. This eliminates B (Honey), which suggests a negative perception of honey bees and/or bee hives.<n><n>This narrows the options down to either "help flowers pollinate" (E) or "help flowers pollenate" (D). In fact, the answer is "D" (help flowers pollenate), because he seems to prefer them not being able to pollinate.<n>So the final and correct answer is D: help flower pollenate<n><n>Input:  A: 2B: C: D:  E: F:  G: H: I: J: K: L:<n>Output:Reasoning: <n><n>The first four letters of the alphabet are: A, B, C, D.<n>The next five are the digits 1, 2, 3, 4 and the number 5. <n>This leaves the final letter, L.

Where might it be? Choices:  A: new york B: big city C: town D: idaho E: shopping mall<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first thing to do is break down the context of the question - in this case, the location in question is a department store in the Northwest USA (A), we can eliminate the out of frame locations: (B), (C), (D). Since the location is known to be a department store, (D) is eliminated.<n><n>Next, we have to focus on what would likely cause someone to find out where the Northwest USA's location is, not necessarily the actual location of shopping malls (E), or even big cities (B).<n><n>The best fit here is a tourist, and the most important factor would be the location of the department store, not whether it is in a big city or close to a shopping mall (E). This means answers (E), (D), and (C) are incorrect, and the best choice is (B).<n><n>Input: The department store is located in downtown Vancouver, BC.  Where might it not be? Choices: A b c d e f<n>Output: Reason<n><n>The best choice here is "A".<n><n>Notice you got this answer without trying.

What is one of the many things he has to watch them doing? Choices:  A: bathe B: bite C: die of cancer D: obesity E: copulate<n>Output:		Reason is: Option A can be eliminated because the question implies that John is watching the animal doing something.<n>Option B can be eliminated because we are expecting the animal to do one or more of the other four things. <n>Option C definitely makes sense because we are talking about animals. Some of them die unfortunately. <n>Option D is not the case. Animals can be overfed or not enough. Animals do not die of cancer.  <n>Option E makes sense. Some of them do not have a partner and stay by themselves. That is true, too.<n>Therefore the answer is Option D.<n><n>Input:What happens to many people after eating a lot of fast food? Choices:  a) they feel sick.    b) their heart pumps faster    c) they can start smoking d) their metabolisms decline   e) they gain weight<n>Output: Answer is b, Their heart pumps faster. Because eating too much fast food cause obesity or gain weight of course. Then they will start to feel sick if they keep eating fast food. They also may start smoking when being under pressure. This because their heart pumps faster. And their metabolisms declines over time because their heart pumps too fast. Fast food is actually bad for your metabolism.<n><n>Input:Many students like to do what after they eat a great big meal?

Choices:  A: feel proud B: try to learn C: need assistance D: thank god E: read alot<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>Options like feeling proud (B) are a bit ambiguous. Feeling proud could mean anything, and as such we cannot ascertain the exact purpose behind a person looking to achieve good grades.<n><n>Options needing assistance (C) and thanking god (D) both also depend on external actions from outside actors.<n><n>Reading a lot (E) is a good choice, as it fits the context of the question- a student wishing to do well in class. The only stipulation with this option is that the student must _actually_ read a lot in order to receive good grades.<n>Option:B C: D: E:<n><n>Input:What does a person do when the alarm goes off and the lights come on? Choices: A: sleep on B: get mad C: wake up D: sleep E: call for help<n>Output:Reasoning:<n><n>Getting mad (C) doesn't seem to fit in this scenario. Typically, the alarm going on means that someone needs to get up and out of bed- so anger wouldn't make much sense.<n><n>Option "call for help" (E) is also likely a poor choice, because it doesn't seem like the best use of time to wake up, throw on clothes, and _then_ get someone else involved to help. The person should rather just wake up, and then begin taking care of business.<n><n>Option "slept on" (A) is a possibility, but since it's unclear if the "alarm goes off and the light come on" would occur _after_ someone is already sleeping, we cannot assume that person slept through it.<n><n>Finally the option "wake up" (D) makes sense for a person who already knows they need to wake up, and so they do. It's appropriate because the alarm going off indicates a need to wake up; they already have intent to wake up, so that option is a good choice.<n><n>

Choices:  A: new hampshire B: dairy farm C: farm field D: texas E: county fair<n>Output:		Reason:The context of the sentence "take my heifer out east" indicates that there is a place that might end up and the choice D can be eliminated and so can the choice F which suggests that an answer is either A, B, C, E.<n>Output: Reason-<n>After eliminating choice E which is redundant, the answer can be either A or B. According to the context, if the choice is A, the heifer would end up in a Dairy farm or at farm field.<n>But according to the context, if it is B, the heifer would go to a Texas Farm.

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What divider stores papers for work or school? Choices:  A: street B: binder C: obesity D: living room E: office suite<n>Output:		Reason:<n>Choosing option D, “office suite” as the answer to “What divider stores papers” for work or school, the analyst should have reasoned along the lines of the following: What dividers store papers on the computer screen?”. Then by eliminations from the options left, the answer becomes “office suite” because it has ‘office’ and it’s the divider where ‘papers for work or school ’stores.<n><n>Input:Which is not a fruit of a type of nut? Choices: 	A: coconut B: acorn C: walnut D: pinecone E: hickory<n>Output: reasoning:<n><n>Choosing option C, “walnut” as the answer to "Which is not a type of fruit?", the analyst should have had the following sequence in his or her reasoning process: What are the types of fruits?<n><n>Choosing any of the other options except C will lead to a wrong answer because all the other options are indeed types of fruit. And after eliminations, only “walnut” will remain as the answer.<n><n>Input:You know 2 + 8 = 10 and 2 + 1 = 3. How do you know 1 + 9? Choices: A) 3 B) 6 C) 10 D) 11 E) 30<n>Output: reasoning: <n><n><n>The only way to get three is by 1+9=10 subtracting 8(left over)from 10 to get 2, from which you repeat the process of (1+9=14)-8=2- which is the same as 3+.<n><n>Note: The answer cannot be 3, because it is incorrect<n><n>Input:You want 1 more apple, you buy 2 apples.

Choices:  A: new experiences B: playfulness C: own house D: good looking E: beautiful<n>Output:		Reason: In this case we see that each option can fit into one of three categories: 1. A person who is outgoing is likely seeking to have adventures/experiences, not own a house (B), to look good (E), or to appear playful (C).<n><n>Notice that none of the options are seeking to appear good or looking for own house.<n><n>Option "new experiences" (A), while a little ambiguous on the exact kind of new experiences the individual is seeking, is the only one that fits into this category.<n><n>So the final answer should be A: new experiences<n><n>Input: What question should John ask? Choices:  I: Is there anyone in your life you can trust?   II: How many people have been in your life over the years?  III: Are you in love?   IV: How do you feel about being alone?   V: Are there any problems between us?   VI:  Do you have any problems that you would like to share with John?  <n>Output: Reason/Analysis:<n>This is a confusing set of choices.<n>However, from the context of the passage it is apparent that John’s girlfriend has told him she no longer is in love with him. John seems to be genuinely concerned about his relationship and wants to know if it can be saved.<n>Let’s examine each choice to see if any of them are relevant.<n>Choice I is a non sequitur, as it’s irrelevant that he can trust anyone in his life if he and his gf are no longer interested in being together.<n>Choice II is not a problem to look into unless John truly intends to explore his ex’s dating preferences which, in this context, would be inappropriate.<n>Choice III also is not relevant — we’re not even aware whether either of them has ever been in love, so this choice is irrelevant and doesn’t fit the conversation topic at all.<n><n>Choice IV is also a non sequitur — as long as John doesn’t have problems with being alone, he could, in principle, choose someone different for a relationship — so this choice isn’t correct.<n>Choice V is a good choice since we can infer from this choice that John probably hasn’t looked at the underlying causes for his relationship problems. Choice V is a good first choice.<n>Choice VI is another good choice

Choices:  A: country B: trouble C: city D: sun E: control<n>Output:		Reasoning:This refers to government in the sense of government as an entity, rather than as a government as a set of policies.<n><n>Government's primary function is to govern the people, which means making decisions that are in their best interests.<n>An individual can have personal interests that are opposed to the interests of the government, and the government can also have the interests of its people which are not in the best interests of the individual, but not vice versa.<n><n>A government's people can have personal interests that conflict with the government's interest. If the government has the support of the people, the government can also have interests that are not in the interests of the people, but they are in their interests.<n><n>Therefore, the best choice is B, trouble. C and D are not the right choices because they are not true.<n>So the final choice B: trouble<n>Input:To achieve independence, the founding fathers of what nation had to do what? Choices: A: be able to move around. B: be able to talk. C: be able to work without an employer. D: be able to learn what they wanted. E: be able to stay in the same place.<n>Output:Reason:The "Independence" and "Founding Father" referred to the United States of America, founded in 1776. The "Nation" is the United States and it's "Founded in 1771", which is 166 years before 1776, and it's "Founders" were "1776-Founders of the United States of America. To be "Founders", they have to be famous in the United States.<n><n>In 1776 the United States gained its independence from Britain. One of the key reasons for gaining independence was that the British allowed only citizens of England to vote, meaning that the citizens of the other 12 states were not permitted to vote and thus did not have representation in parliament. The right to vote is usually given to citizens through their right to citizenship, which is granted at birth. Therefore, the most plausible answer here is A: be able to vote.<n><n>There are a number of other options that don't make as much sense. Option "C: be able to work for an employer" (C) doesn't seem to fit

Choices:  A: countryside B: united states C: beach D: atlas E: developed land<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Option (A) states that these people took the scenic route because they wanted "to cut through the countryside".<n>This choice of wording makes no sense in the context of this problem statement. For example, it's unlikely that a driver would drive 100 miles out of their way just to cut through a small patch of countryside along the way.<n><n>Answer (C) states that the people chose to take the scenic tour because they wanted "to take the tour that cuts through the beach".<n>This is also a poor choice of wording, as it's unlikely that someone would take the scenic route just to take a tour. The scenic route may be intended to take some time, but it wouldn't be considered to be "taking a tour" in the traditional sense of the term - meaning it would not be a planned out travel experience.<n><n>Answer (D) states that the people choses to take the scenic drive because they wanted "to be able to drive through the atlas".<n>This is also poorly worded, as the "atlas" mentioned here is just a reference to an actual world map with geographical features - it isn't really "driving through" anything.<n><n>Option (B) states that "they chose the highway that cuts through the U.S.".<n>This answer is correct, as it implies that they chose this route to "cut through" the united states, which is what they wanted to do.<n><n>Option (E) states that they chose to take the scenery tour because they wanted to "cut through the developed nations land".<n>This is another example of poor wording. The concept of "cutting through" a nation might seem like it would make sense, but in reality it doesn't. Nations are made up of people, not land - so it doesn't actually make sense for someone to say they "cut through" a geographical or national region.<n><n>So the final answer has to be B: they chose the highway that cutted through the U.S.<n><n>Input:What was the reason the tour guide had to cancel the tours because of a fire?

It is plausible that the riders were going to experience heartburn, but they were talking specifically about eating or having food poisoning. So this answer will be eliminated. <n>Next, there are no reasons to choose 'A' or 'B' as the riders would have most likely not to eat hamburgers. They are probably going to enjoy eating at some of themes for eating at the carnival or they will eat at other places. They might have said, or the answer might be to have some gas. Because everyone would have gas if they rode all those rides. <n><n>Finally, it is most likely that they were going to gas when they talked about how they will have fun and enjoy their lunch on the next ride.

Choices:  A: drinkable B: junk food C: medicine D: antidote E: nutrient<n>Output:		Reason:The first thing that comes to mind if you find something unidentified in the kitchen cabinet is to think of it as edible but I don't know if Sarah was really thinking of it that way. She could be just saying "I think it's food" without really knowing what it is. It seems more likely that she meant it as an edible treat than anything else.<n>So here choices was B: junk food <n><n><n>

This is not what we need, which is 8:05, or even 15 minutes earlier than 8:00.<n><n>Option C is not good because there isn't any period in the question.<n><n>Option D is not good because the question does not refer to any specific time. It's just a time around school.<n><n>The only correct answer is thus B: 8:10. <n><n>Input: What does it matter if no is not a word in your dictionary? Choices: A. Because every person will have their own dictionary B. Because even if no isn't in mine it doesn't mean it's wrong C. Because the words in dictionary are set by people and not dictionarians D. Because no is a valid word in dictionaries worldwide E. None of the above <n>Output: Reason<n><n>Explanation<n><n>Option A is very clearly wrong since dictionaries don't rely on people's dictation.

From there, we can see that the location where the dog may be located is the next significant detail. <n><n>Option "dog show" (E), while plausible, wouldn't make logical sense as a location where you could "get a stray dog." It's an unusual location where people don't typically pick up a stray dog.<n><n>The remaining options are all viable choices. Ultimately the decision comes down to the main topic, which in this case is "stray small dogs".<n>The options B and C are viable because they both include location, giving you a general direction to go.

Pharmacies do not generally carry birth control supplies. They carry other prescription medications, such as antibiotics, blood pressure medications, and antihistamines; as well as some over-the-counter medicines, such as cold medicines, pain relievers, and topical creams.<n>Option B: bedroom would not be the correct response, because people who purchase birth control do not generally do so in person. Therefore, this answer must be invalid.<n>Option C: The answer would be drugstore.<n>Option D: Mcdonalds is not where anyone would purchase birth control. The chain does not carry any birth control supplies, nor would its employees know where to purchase such items.<n>Option E: The correct answer would be C drugstore.<n><n>Given below are a few questions that are common in the English section of several entrance exams including the CAT.<n><n><n>Input: The city is not to the south of the capital.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where would people be looking at some things which can move, but are not moving? Choices:  A: football stadium B: surface of earth C: car show D: opera E: movie<n>Output:		Why: <n><n>The first task in solving this question is to understand the context in which a person might be "looking at some things which can not move". The context involves something moving, but not doing so. This implies that the person could be looking at cars moving on a race track. <n><n>Option "surface of the earth" (C) is incorrect, as cars cannot move on the surface of the earth. Option "football stadium" (A) is incorrect as things in the football stadium could not possibly move because there is nothing for them to move to. <n><n>So, the "car show" (D) is incorrect, as well since not everything that moves in a car show is physically moving on a racetrack (such as those that are merely displayed).<n><n>The remaining options are the appropriate choice for "some things which can not move", and "looking at". Option "opera" is not correct because, in the context given, there would be nothing to see that moves as the opera takes place. Option "movie theatre" does not fit the bill either as people in a movie theatre do not generally look at things that are moving, but rather the things that do not move (e.g. the screen showing the movie.) Ultimately, this leaves option "car show" as the correct answer. So the final answer is E:"car show"<n><n>Input: What did they say about one's life after reading the books? Choices:  F: There's life after death and that's the most important thing. G: That reading has many benefits including learning more things about life. H: Reading books does not affect one's life. J: Reading books will be great to lead a meaningful life. <n>Output: Reason:<n><n>Since the title is "Reading books vs. watching movies", one can infer that reading books has a lot of advantages. <n><n>Hence it doesn't make sense to say that 'that reading has many benefits including'. For instance, option D:<n>"That reading has many benefits including, that's the most valuable thing" makes no sense for this question.<n><n>The other options (B,C,G,J) do not make sense as they are either too specific or not specific enough.<n><n>The final option (A) clearly explains that reading books does impact life positively. <n>So, the final answer is F:"There

Choices:  A: amusement park B: urban area C: airport D: shopping malls E: train station<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>First off, notice the context of the question - we're at a shopping mall, where there are parking lots and other facilities for shoppers and patrons. <n><n>Then, look at the question choices. There are options such as "shopping malls" (C) and "airport" (D), which might seem like plausible answers at first glance. However, these aren't specific enough to be correct. For example, "shopping mall" technically covers a wide variety of places. In addition, "shopping bags" wouldn't be an appropriate accessory in an airport.<n><n>All the remaining options ("amusement park" (A), "urban area" (B), and "train station" (E)) make sense in the context of a shopping mall or shopping parking lot. While each answer could be reasonably given for the right reasons, the correct answer is (C): airport, because the shopping bags are probably being carried to bring back objects purchased at the mall.<n>So the final correct answer is C: airport<n><n>Input: Which of the following is an example of a noun? Choices: <n>A: a book, a car, a table, a box<n>B: candy, gum, apples, pears<n>C: mango, pineapple, papaya, mango<n>D: chocolate, marshmallow, gumdrop, chocolate<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>First of all, we need to know what a noun is. Nouns refer to inanimate objects - things that don't move or do more than the usual function for their kind. Nouns generally do not express quantity.<n><n>The question choices represent various quantities of inanimate objects. <n><n>"Book, a car" (A) is a phrase in the English language, but it doesn't convey any of the characteristics of a noun, so it isn't correct.<n><n>"Candy, gum, and apple" (B) are all nouns that refer to various fruits, but since the fruits cannot be counted or compared, it isn't correct<n><n>"Apples, pears, and mangoes" (C) are all words that denote multiple fruits. However, they do convey

It was overkill.  What did he shoot at? Choices:  A: body armor B: ungulate C: bomber D: kill people E: animal<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question "What did he shoot at" can be broken down into a question "Who or What was James shooting". But "Who was James shot at" could be an answer for question "What did he shot"; so it could also be interpreted as "Who or What was being shooter".<n><n>Here, choices of A and C do not fit the scenario. Choices of A and B do not fit the scenario but they could fit in a different context. Similarly, Choices of B and D do not fit the scenario, but they could fit in different context. Therefore, the least likely choice should be picked out from the remaining ones. "Body armor"(B) is the least likely to answer the question. The remaining choices do not fully fit the scenario nor are they likely answer. <n><n>The question is "What James shot at" not "Who or What was shooter". James is the only shooter in the situation, and was shooting at an animal (E). So the final answer is E<n><n>Input:The wolf, who was dressed in goat skin, approached the sheep.

E: "I do not know."<n>Output:Reasoning:<n><n>A) "Here I am."(E) is the most likely answer for the question. Dog is the leader of the dog. So the wolf is asking where the dog is when he appears in front of sheep.<n><n>B) "We have none."(C) is the least likely answer for the question since dog is the leader of the dogs, and if Dog is not in sheep, then what is he doing? So the answer is E<n><n>C) "My master does not Know." (A) is plausable since if dog is not in sheep then He must be somewhere else.<n><n>D) "I am your superior" (A) is least plausable. If dog (D) is Dog, then he is the leader of the Dog. Otherwise he is just a dog and not the leader of a Dog.<n><n>E) "I do not know" (B) is the most plausable answer for the question. Because dog (D) is a leader of all dogs and dog is missing, so "I

So, let me show why I am eliminating the options and then show my reasoning for my conclusion of the right answer. Altar, Trough, Aisle and Place are not the right answers because they refer to other places associated with a church. These 4 options rule out option E and option F.<n><n>If we look at option 5 or a walkway and the 6th option, which is a place, they clearly don't fit the question. Hence option D is clearly not what is happening. <n><n>What remains are the two options B which is an aisle and option 1 A which is
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What creatures performing pollination are loved my millions? Choices:  A: birds B: action C: butterflies D: happiness E: anxiety<n>Output:		Reason: <n><n>All options begin with an indefinite article "a/an." (Option A, B and D). So the question is either about "one" of those items or they don't want you to pick "a" butterfly, "a" bird or "a" happiness. <n><n>Now, this question is asking you to explain a fact about animals. That means you should only consider animals.<n><n>However, none of the options are explicitly for animals. One is for pollination (B and D) which occurs to plants rather than animals. Other is about love (E), which is an abstract concept and the question explicitly states that it's about creatures. <n><n>So it's safe to ignore the "action" (C) and the "happiness" (E), because they aren't relevant to the answer.<n><n>Since the question is about creatures, there's only one option that fits this context - that is option "b". <n><n>The next task to tackle is whether the choice is singular or plural. The answer must be singular since the question uses "one animal", so you should only choose the single possible option from a list. <n><n>So the final answer here is "B: one action"<n><n>Input:What do the people of the country want to see and hear?Choices:  A: a president B: a newspaper C: news media D: a tv station E: radio<n>Output: Reason for Answer: <n><n>This question is looking for an abstract noun that describes people's interests. The purpose of analysis is to understand people's interests. <n><n>So to narrow down the options, we can try eliminate redundant options:<n><n>1. Option A ("a president") is redundant because it is already an abstract noun.<n><n>2. Option B ("a newspaper"), D and E ("a television studio"), C and E ("radio media") are also reduced, as they are also abstract nouns.<n><n>3. Only option "B" and D" are the only abstract nouns left in the options.<n><n>So the choice is only between "newspapers" and "television stations." <n><n>We must consider one more thing: the correct answer must be singular, as the question mentions "the people."<n><n>4. So finally we arrive at the correct answer "

Choices:  A: order B: queueing up C: wait turn D: fatigue E: anger<n>Output:		Reason: The keyword `waitturn` could be interpreted as a line forming to either buy something or get a vaccine.<n>```<n>The keywords `ordering`(A) and `queueing`(C) are both common phrases when you are buying something. Those words aren't what a person in a line might be feeling though.<n><n>The keyword `waiting` or `waiting turn` could be interpreted as words a person in a line would use if they were talking about their frustration over getting a vaccine or waiting at the DMV. In that context, option E is the correct answer.<n>```<n><n>Input: The new employee was having an especially hard time understanding anything and had a knack for making the biggest mistakes. What best describes the new employee's situation? Choices: A: frustation B: anxiety C: incompetence D: nervousness E: none of the above<n>Output: Reason : The word 'fustation' here could be interpreted as referring to a new employee who may have been feeling overwhelmed or frustrated in the workplace.<n>```<n>The word `frustration`(A) is not inaccurate, but the context suggests that this new employee may actually be performing poorly and is struggling to find any success in their work.<n><n>Alternatives such as `anxiety`(B) and `nervousness`(D) are too extreme, given that we don't know whether the new employee is generally nervous or anxious about their job.<n><n>The correct answer should be `C: incompetence` - it covers the context and expresses the idea that the new employee is having trouble performing well in their job.<n><n>Input: What are a company's competitive advantages?

Choices:  A: station B: every car and house C: shop D: bedroom E: space shuttle<n>Output:		Reason A is wrong because the question does not ask about one radio. The remaining choices are related to shopping for one radio: station B is not a store, but a place where one can buy a radio. So, C is the right answer.<n><n>It's important to read the question carefully to determine the scope of the answer. While "shop" (C) is correct, so is "station" (B). The question stipulates that the radio is one the person "wants to buy," which means all of their options are places where they can buy a radio. Since radio stations are places to purchase radios, they are also an option.<n><n>However, "every car and house" (A) is not correct because every car and house are not places that one can go to in order to purchase goods - that is, they are not a store. Additionally, "space shuttle" (E) is inaccurate because it is not a place where one can purchase goods - it's an actual mode of transportation, not a place.<n><n>So, the answer to this question is C: shop.<n><n>Input: I had just given birth to a baby girl. My father came to see his first granddaughter and when we were talking over coffee he mentioned that he would really like me to breastfeed her. Which of the following is correct?

Option A & C is incorrect because the sentence makes it clear the writer was breastfeeding as opposed to formula, while option B & V is incorrect because breastfeeding helps to develop a baby's immune  system. <n><n>Reading the question carefully is imperative - as is understanding the intended meaning of the various statements. Since the writer indicates that they were breastfeeding, they were not referring to breastfeeding via bottle feeding. However, they may have been considering a bottle with a nipple to breastfeed.

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Learning usually leads to greater what? Choices:  A: get to know B: gain knowledge C: intelligence D: education E: gaining knowledge<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>This question is asking for the reason a certain action leads to the desired outcome. This can be answered by selecting the option that specifically describes why a person seeks knowledge. For example, A would be eliminated because it doesn't offer the reason why someone seeks knowledge.<n><n>C could also be eliminated since it doesn't differentiate between knowledge and intelligence. Likewise, E could be eliminated as well because gaining knowledge includes an intention to learn - but gaining knowledge may not lead to learning.<n><n>The remaining answer options are B and D, which are both viable, although B is a bit too broad. The final answer would be D.<n><n>So the final answer would be D:  intelligence<n><n>Input:Which one does not belong to the other answer?<n><n>A:  cat<n>B:  house<n>C:  fish<n>D:  cat person<n>Output: Reasonnign:<n>This question requires a deductive reasoning process to eliminate the incorrect answer from the available options. For this type of question, it is helpful to remember that each set of options needs to be mutually exclusive. <n><n>This is because the question is posing four options and asks which one does not belong, so the options need to all be unique and unrelated in meaning. Since the options are nouns, and the wrong one may mean any of these four words, we cannot immediately assume that one of the <n><n>answers does not belong.<n><n>To begin, it is helpful to eliminate one of the options to ensure that it is the wrong answer. <n><n>Option C, "fish," would be eliminated because "fish" is a noun and therefore cannot be a person, so it would only go with one of the options.<n><n>Now two of the options are left and neither of them is an exact synonym. <n><n>Option A and option D are not synonyms because "cat" is a person and "cat person" is a noun. This means that these two options cannot go together. <n><n>Finally, option B is "house," which a lot of people would assume is not unique. While "house" could certainly refer to a place where someone lives, it also has other meanings, so could only be eliminated if a synonymous answer were left as an option.<n><n>Because B is not a synonym of the remaining two

Choices:  A: actions B: legal C: authentic D: logical E: legitimate<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option A is excluded, as it is more about a "certificate of action" which is about a course of action, than about its quality. So eliminate this option. <n><n>The remaining options are related to "certificate of authenticity." However, "authentic" is not quite the right term for this context. Since these are fake designer bags, they would not be real designer bags, therefore they wouldn't have a real authentic certificate. An illegitimate item cannot be legitimate in the first place, hence eliminating option C.<n><n>With the two remaining options, E is by far the strongest as it captures the purpose of the certificate. Option D is too specific, and should be excluded. The purpose of the certificate is to verify the legitimacy of the bag, not to verify the logical soundness of the design or anything else similarly technical. Therefore the final answer is E.<n><n>

Choices:  A: race track B: kentucky derby C: american southwest D: triple crown E: horse derby<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>In this question, option A, which is the race track is an incorrect answer as the question mentions the crowds being big at the sport itself, the horse derby does not describe a gathering of people around a horse. Option C can be eliminated because it does not make sense that the crowds would be at the american southwest. Option D is incorrect because the three races which make up the triple crown is the derby, so it would make sense that the biggest crowds would be gathering at the derby. Option B, the kentucky derby is a specific event in the triple crown, so the option can be dropped. <n><n>Only three options remain: Option A, the horse derby, Option C, the american southwest and Option E, the triple crown. The american southwest is a geographic location and so the question does not seem to pertain to horses, so it is a useless answer. The Horse derby, which is a race, would fit the question the best. Option E does not specify the region/place where the horses are racing which leaves us with two answers: Triple crown which is a series of three races or the horse derby which is a specific event in that series. <n><n>The horse derby is the best answer for this question.<n><n>Input:"How to train your dragon" which movie which would be your favorite if you haven't already seen the movie the viking village?

Puddle is not so large; a person is standing near the edge<n>2. Puddle has a drain and is not that deep<n>3. A person has a change of heart and decides to stop in the puddle<n>4. A person is wearing waterproof shoes<n>Option 2. is out of the question here as puddles and floods are not comparable in depth or size.<n>From the remaining three, option 1. is the right answer because a person would feel no need to stop unless he is near the edge of the puddle, hence the situation is unlikely to be applicable in puddles, especially on the streets.<n>Option 3, on the other hand, is not a suitable answer because the puddle is water - not some mental barrier or personality issue.<n>Finally, option 4 is also incorrect as waterproof shoes are not a natural requirement for anyone when going out; they are just a luxury.<n>So the correct answer is 1. near the edge of a puddle<n><n>Input:When you are talking with somebody with an uncomfortable or difficult subject matter, and you are  trying to  change the subject, and the best way you can do that is with humor, you will  make a joke about something to  derail the conversation.  Choices:  A) you will  make people laugh  B) derail the conversation from a  serious topic  C) find a humorous  topic  D) you will try to change the subject as  light heartedly as you can  E) find a way to switch to  a humorous subject so that you can make your  point in a light-hearted fashion<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>The options are arranged in the following pattern: the first option is about trying to change the subject, while the second one is about finding a humorous topic. <n><n>Next, since you have a conversation with someone and are trying to change the subject to something humorous, then it can be assumed that you need to make someone laugh. Otherwise it is an incorrect option. <n><n>The next two options
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What would a person do if he or she just woke up? Choices:  A: drink tea B: thank god C: open eyes D: feel angry E: complete sentence<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Analyze the options first to see which one fits the context.<n>"Just woke up" implies that one is awake after sleeping, so they would need to open their eyes.<n>So the options "wake up", "drink tea", "feel angry", and "open eyes" are irrelevant, as they do not fit the context.<n><n>The remaining options are "complete sentence" and "thank god".<n><n>"Complete" sounds like completion of a task, so the correct one is "complete sentence".<n><n>Finally, what does "thank god" suggest?<n>It implies that the person has found him or herself in a good situation that they were thankful for, so this is the correct option.<n><n><n>---<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the multiple choice question.<n>Input: What does it mean if somebody says that he doesn't need any sugar? Choices: A: He is in his late 20s. B: He wants to live a pure life. C: He has decided never to take sugar in his tea. D: He is being ironic. E: He has become a vegetarian.<n>Output: Reason:The meaning of the idiomatic expression,“He doesn’t need sugar; he said so himself”, in this phrase is a person who does not need anything extra (excessive) in life which is quite different from its literal meaning.<n>

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What are people playing when they want to take the lead with small papers? Choices:  A: very heavy B: video game C: news article D: card game E: lead pencil<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Let's first consider the options that don't fit the context or meaning of the question. For instance, the option "video games" (B) are likely unrelated to the context of "taking the lead". The options "news article" (C), "card game" (D), and "lead pencil" (E) don't quite capture the sense of smallness and lightness that the question expects.<n><n>That leaves us with the option that states "small papers". This appears to be the correct answer because both the context and meaning of the question suggest that playing with small papers would be an appropriate response.

Choices:  A: squid B: pencil C: newspaper D: fountain pen E: printer<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option "squid" (A) is incorrect because inking is generally done with a pen instead of a squid. Also, what does it mean to "fill with ink"?<n><n>Option "newspaper" (B) is an example that's too literal. A newspaper might be filled with ink, but that does not mean it is used for printing.<n><n>Option "fountain pen" (C), "pencil" (D), and "printer" (E) are incorrect because they don't convey the correct result. None of them say what the printer needs to be filled with in order to print. Instead, "ink" should be put in the printer.<n>So the final output answer is E: printer<n><n>Input: Why am I seeing your picture everywhere I go? Choices:  a: because your eyes are everywhere b: you are everywhere. c: all eyes are on you. d: because you are the best. e: because your friends are everywhere <n>Output: Reason :<n><n>Option "all eyes are on you" (A) would be correct to reply if the person were seeing someone's picture everywhere - perhaps on t-shirts, posters, in magazines, etc.<n><n>Option "you are everywhere" (B) would be correct if the person were seeing the same person in different locations. Or, if the person in seeing many pictures of them, perhaps on billboards.<n><n>Option "Because you are the best" (D) doesn't fit the context of the question, in which the person does not look up to them.<n><n>Option "You're the best" (C) is correct if the person were talking to a friend or sibling. But if not, then they may say "because your friends are everywhere" (E).<n><n>Therefore, the most correct answer would be either "you are everywhere" or "you're the best," with either of the two being acceptable.<n><n>Input: What is up with all the spam in my inbox?

Choices:  A: each state B: gettysburg address C: state of union D: each country E: europe<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step in answering this question is to identify the term with which the question is referencing. The answer can only be one of two options: "state of union," from which the "of union" portion can be deducted, or "each country."<n><n>Next, the question refers to a "capital" (A), but it's unclear whether the question is referring to individual capital cities or capital in a broader sense. The word "capital" is more commonly used to refer to the country or government, such as "the capital of the United States" or "capital of France."<n><n>If "the state of union" is referring to the speech itself, then the first option is incorrect. That eliminates the "state of union" from contention.<n><n>If it's referring to the speech that President Lincoln delivered to the nation during the Civil War, then the answer is C: the Gettysburg Address. The Gettysburg Address was considered one of the greatest speeches in political history, and it's also one of the best speeches ever given.<n><n>This narrows down the questions to two, meaning the final answer is C: Gettysburg Address<n><n>Input:What time is it now?

For example, options 1 and 2 mention specific time, while 3, 4, 5, and 6 refer to days of the week.<n><n>This immediately narrows the list down from six to four.<n><n>Option 1 has no relevance to the question. Option 4 mentions the word "day" before the word "time," so it also belongs with the days of the week. Option 5 refers to "midnight," a time of the day, so it belongs in the "times of the day" box.<n><n>The final two options, 6 and 2, refer to a specific time that is not associated with any specific date. Option 2 mentions that it is noon; option 6 mentions that it is 12pm

It is not the end of the world if one of them decide to leave the marriage.<n><n>### Instruction:Select the best answer.<n><n>Input:What happens if you get a virus or a bacteria infection? Choices: <n><n>Output: <n><n>The immune system fights. It is designed exactly for that purpose. It is the body's natural immune system.<n><n>### Question:<n><n>What happens when something goes wrong with your immune system? Input:A: We're no longer protected by it.<n>B: The body's immune system breaks down and we die.<n>C: It can't function well anymore.<n>D: We don't have to worry about it any longer.<n><n>Output:<n><n>In this case, if something goes wrong with your body's immune, it is going to allow the infection to run wild and you will succumb. Immune system is how we protect ourselves. It is the natural immune system and all natural things are not 100% good and that is what we should expect with our natural body immune system. Yes body's immune can break down so if something goes wrong with it we as a body will succumb. So A is the best option because We're no longer Protected by it.<n><n>### Answer<n><n>Input:How many atoms are in the universe?

All the atoms that comprise everything are estimated to be that many atoms. <n><n>1 atom per each electron and each proton. 1 electron and one proton. Atomic particles have mass energy. The universe is a large system and the universe is made up of mass. Mass can be turned into energy. So all the energy in the universe is a very large amount and that would include all the energy.

Choices:  A: fun B: talent C: learn about D: intelligence E: recognize<n>Output:		Solution:<n><n>The word "knack" in the sentence suggests a talent or skilled ability. That immediately eliminates options "fun" (A) and "learn about" (B).<n>Additionally, the word "entertaining" in the sentence indicates the focus is on performing or putting on a show. Thus, options "intelligence" (D) and "recognize" (E), which refer to qualities like being intelligent or being able to recognize something, are unnecessary.<n><n>The last task is to narrow down exactly what kind of talent the woman has; she possesses skills that make her a "natural" at performing or providing entertainment.<n><n>Option "talent" (C) fits that description, so it is the best choice. The sentence would read like this: She had a natural talent for entertaining her audience.<n>So, the final answer is C: talent <n><n>Input:She got the message she'd seen that people were talking about how they could see for miles on the clear day.So she just took a deep breath because what?

Where did he put it? Choices:  A: refrigerator B: closet C: can D: shelf E: soccer game<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>In this scenario, the floor does constitute off the floor, because floors are, literally, "off the floor." "Off the floor" in this case is a modifier for "floor," which indicates it is next to the floor. With that context clued into place, it should be evident that the options with floor are not valid responses. <n><n>Similarly, option B, "closet," could plausibly be read to mean "in a place with doors," because closets are, in fact, places with doors. This would indicate closets are not relevant possibilities, and the only options remaining are the ones that do not involve closets: option A, the refrigerator, and option C, the shelf. <n><n>It would make no sense for Dave to put a beer in an actual soccer match, as option D implies, nor would Dave be storing a beer in a can as option E suggests.<n><n>If the final answer were the shelf, it would make sense for the floor to be "off the floor." While one can store beer beside the floor, it would be highly unlikely to place the floor on or within the shelf.<n>Therefore, the appropriate response is "shelf."<n><n>Input:How old is the average woman that visits your store? Choices: 1. 8 2. 24 3. 26 4.5 18 months<n>Output: Reason<n><n>The answer to this scenario should be immediately obvious: option 1, "8," could be the correct answer. <n>We know from experience how long it takes to formulate an answer, so it could just as likely be option 2, 24, as option 1 "8."<n><n>If option 1 "8" were the correct answer, option 3, "26," wouldn't be, because it's much less likely for women to visit the store, particularly if they're under 26-years-old. Likewise, option 2, "24," wouldn't be relevant if option 1 "8," were the correct answer.<n><n>We can cross out these options.<n><n>The question indicates that the average age of a woman shopping at the store is 8 years-old. <n>Option 2 "24" would be the correct answer on the assumption

Choices:  A: go shopping B: generous C: earn money D: have money E: gift buyer<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option "gift buyer" (E) is very general. This person is likely to gift many things, which doesn't make them gift buyers.<n><n>The phrases "money" (B) and"earn money" (D) aren't as specific as the remaining options. Someone who buys gifts isn't necessarily wealthy, so "having money" (D) is too general a description of a gift-bearing person.<n><n>That leaves the answer to be "generous" - which implies that one is spending money on others, the exact activity required to buy gifts.<n>So the final option is E: generous. The final answer is E: generous

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:She was processing the wool, she kept her leg bouncing to operate the what? Choices:  A: hospital bed B: legroom C: spinning wheel D: grand piano E: rhythm<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>The first step to answer this question is to determine what exactly is happening.<n><n>The option "she kept her leg bouning" (B) is incorrect because "keeping" implies continuous movement. If it was "kept and then bouncing", that would make sense, but "bouncing" doesn't convey any action that she might have taken.<n><n>The option D, "grand piano," is another possibility. The answer, "spinning wheel," can be interpreted as a musical reference, and in the scenario, the object that the girl is operating is what we would call in the U.S. a "spinning wheel", which is similar to a "spinning mop" or "spinning brush" in the context of cleaning your home.<n><n>The options "hospital bed" (A) and "she was processing the wool" (C) are more likely the answers. However, none of these options imply what she was doing while using the "spinning wheel" or a "hospital bed," so they are irrelevant to answering the question. <n><n>In answer to the question, the final answer is D: grand piano<n><n>Input: You have a bag of apples, you want the sour ones, you are what? Choices: A: a dentist B: an apple picker C: a plumber D: a lawyer E: an accountant<n>Output: Reasonnin:<n><n>Readers should ask themselves what it means to be sour. <n><n>Dentists can definitely be sour, in the sense that they can be unfriendly or intimidating to patients. Also, they might be grumbling about something while treating their patients.<n>However, if you remove the dentist reference, only the option "apple picker" fits the sentence.<n>Thus, the final answer would be C: apple picker.<n><n><n>### Instruction:Input:<n><n>My name is John, my last name is Smith, I am the one in the top left corner the one who says hi the blue, blue one, John has an interesting dog, in what way is funny John’s dog is blue.<n><n>Output:Answer.<n><n><n><n>---<n><n>### Instrucion:<n><n>Input:You like to travel, you are a tourist, who are

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:When going to sleep what noise does a human make? Choices:  A: loss of consciousness B: relaxation C: snoring D: dreaming E: talking<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>To answer this, the important thing to note is that "sleeping" doesn't have a set objective, so you can simply answer that the noise that a person makes is their sleeping noise. This is because "sleeping" can refer to anything from snoozing to REM cycles, which don't require sound at all. This choice covers every possibility and the correct answer.<n>So the final  answer is A: loss of consciousnes<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the follwong multiple choice question.<n>Input: Which of the following terms is the least well known in America? Choices: 1) Altocumulus 2) Arsenic 3) Golf 4) Inhaler 5) Yogurt<n>Output: Reasonig:<n><n>First, let's check Golf (4). While we have never played it, it strikes us as being a well-known term in the US. That being said, the definition includes "play," which isn't necessary, so we can choose this.<n>Then, let's check Arsenic (5). The definition includes "medicine," which isn't in the list of answers, so we can't choose this one.<n>Then, let us check Altocumulus (2). The definition includes the phrasing "fair weather condition," and this is most easily explained by the word "weather." "Weather" is in the list of answers we have been given.<n>Now we check Inhaler (3). It includes medicine again.<n>Therefore, the answer is 2: Altocumulus<n>   <n>       <n>### Instruction<n>Answer the following multiple-choice question<n><n>Input: What will you never use in your home?

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What is the opposite of a village? Choices:  A: rural area B: africa C: ohio D: big city E: tribe<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Think about the definition of a village.<n>A village is a small human settlement which typically consists of a cluster of houses.<n>A village differs from a city in that it is not large enough to qualify as a city. Usually, a village consists of one or two neighborhoods.<n>Think of the opposite of a village. A town would be the opposite of a village, which is another settlement with a small number of houses.<n><n>To decide that a "town" would be the opposite of "a village," you should consider what the word "opposite" means. To find the opposite of a word, you should identify the antonym. An antonym is the opposite of a word.<n>In this case, you see that the "opposite" is used in the word "oppositeness," so you should look for an antonym in "oppositeness." You can find antonyms by using the Thesaurus.<n><n>After using the Thesauris, you can find the phrase "oppositeness" on page 8. The opposite of a village is a town, and you can confirm this in your own dictionary if you like.<n><n>Input: What does K.D. mean? Choices: 1: kill don 2: kill dev 3: kill die 4: kill dna 5: kill dame<n>Output: Reason<n><n>Look at the first letters of each phrase. They correspond to the keys on a laptop keyboard. <n><n>The fourth option "kill dna," as well as the fifth option "kill dame," do not utilize the keys on the computer keyboard.<n>The choice to "kill don" is the most straightforward one, yet it still does not provide a full answer.<n>Therefore, the choice with the whole phrase is the only viable option.<n><n>Therefore, the correct answer is: 2: kill dev<n><n>## A<n>Input: What's the opposite of "no"? Choices: 1. Yes! 2. yep 3. naa 4. ya<n>Output: Reason <n><n>Just as an antonym is the direct opposites of a word, a synonym is used to describe words that have similar meanings.<n>When you look for a synonym in a dictionary or thesaurus, the word you're

Choices:  A: swimming pool B: pond C: lake D: bathe in E: childrens pool<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>In line with the scenario, shallow water is the best choice among the options that are possible here. As such, it answers the question the lab results had been compiled that  the scientist began analaysing because he wanted what?<n>But this choice is not mentioned, rather is just the best guess among the options. We can choose either option but that not mentioned. The one mentioned here 'is a hot spot among all locals' means is possible in that area is to have a hot spot so to be hot spot means something specific. Not the kind of hot spots we are looking for is that the thing. To narrow down the options, we need to check whether the lake contains water shallow enough for children so for that lake is best choice from the options. So lake 'has a beach with shallow sandy shores which is a natural swimming pool' means is a childrens pool is not mentioned anywhere in the question but is the only option to choose to explain shallow water.<n>The answer is A: Childrens pool<n>

Choices:  A: zoo B: museum C: hospital D: desk E: opera<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The correct answer is A (a zoo). This option is the only one that makes sense, and the other options imply that there would be a situation where zebras would not be present. <n><n><n>### Instruction:Answer the questions below based on the following instructions.<n><n>Input: In order to make a successful meal, the following ingredients are required: salt, garlic, pepper, olive oil, and mushrooms. You have exactly one tablespoon of each ingredient. You want to make a meal, but you only have enough ingredients for 3 meals.  Choice A and B are incorrect, because they give you enough ingredients to make less than 3 meals. What meal would you make? Choices:  C: salmon with mushrooms D: foul with peppers E: sardines with garlic F: meatballs with salt<n><n>Output: Answer: F. Answer: F. There are eight meal options (A-I) listed along the top row with 3 columns of meal options listed below, with 2 choices per row and column. The number of meals (from left to<n>right, from top to bottom) that can be made in each row or column is<n>listed on those cells, with “2 or greater” indicated by a red dot. The number of ways you could make any of the eight meals from the top row is 2 (that is, there are 2 ways to make each of these 8 meals). The number of ways you can make a meal from among the 2 meals listed on the left column is 3 (so, there are 3 different ways to make a choice from the 2 meals there). The number of ways to make a meal listed in the 3 left columns is (4 x 3) x 2 =  144. These numbers can easily be subtracted to find that there are 44 meals that cannot be made by the ingredients provided.<n><n><n>### Input: There are two kinds of fruit trees that grow on the farm, apples and cherries.

Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:I was shopping at a car dealership, what did a salesman do? Choices:  A: appear suddenly B: bottom out C: go downtown D: scream E: roll over<n>Output:		Reasoning: <n><n>In this situation, it's appropriate to assume that the salesman was selling cars, and not other products like food or art. Therefore, we can eliminate options "appear suddenly" (B) and also "go downtown" (C).<n>Option "bottom out" (D) is unlikely, as "bottom out" often refers to a car crash. In this case, we can discard it as well.<n><n>Only option "roll over" (E) remains. We know that a rolling-out sale refers to a sales event or promotion. This would explain why a car salesperson is trying to roll over a sale to you. Therefore, the answer is "roll over."<n><n>So the final answer: E: roll over<n><n>Input: What would you say to your bank if you tried online banking and your account balance was zero? Choices: <n>A: it was too high B: you're welcome, thanks again C: thank you D: I love my bank E: please contact me<n>Output:Reasonning: <n><n>We can discard the first three options, none of which seem relevant to the situation. Then we look at "I don't love my bank" (F) more closely. This could be an appropriate response if there was some issue with online banking. But it is also possible for the online banking to have resulted in a balance of zero, and it wouldn't make sense to blame the bank for this occurrence.<n><n>That leaves "I love my bank" (E) as the only potentially correct response. It seems likely that some technical issue could arise that causes an error on the bank's side, resulting in a zero balance. In this case, it would be reasonable to thank your bank for its services. Therefore, this would the correct choice.<n><n>We know that "I love my bank (E)" is the correct answer. If the answer had been wrong, then the output would have looked like this: <n><n>```python<n><n>The correct answer is D.<n><n>What would you say to your friend if you have to pay 8? <n>A. it was too high<n>B. you're welcome, thank you again<n>C. thank you<n>D.

Choices:  a: nothing b: he ducks c: he swerves d: he winks e: he runs<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>The same reasoning process from the previous two riddles is applicable here as well. <n><n>Answer "nothing" (A) is a completely unrealistic outcome given what it describes. A rock thrown at a clown would never just "nothing." "The rock hits the clown" (B) is unlikely for the same reason; a clown is a person after all and throwing a rock at an unprotected person would certainly hurt.<n><n>"He ducks" (C) is somewhat more likely than the previous two answers, but given that a clown is wearing a mask, would likely duck or swerve in order to avoid an obstacle like a thrown rock. " He winks" (D), while a plausible scenario, doesn't fit with the question.  A wink is commonly considered an expression of interest. <n><n>The last option is "he runs" (E), which is completely different from what the other options describe.  For one, a clown is not going to run away at the first sign of an obstacle - a rock at his face, particularly, would not spook such a clown. " He runs away" is also quite improbable.<n><n>"He swerves" (C) is the most likely and acceptable answer.  A clown wearing a mask might swerve slightly but the force of the rock, which we can assume is not small compared to that of

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where does someone not happy to take their car? Choices:  A: down a river B: city C: repair shop D: parking lot E: neighbor's house<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The answer choice E: neighbor's House is the correct one. The remaining options all are not the right plausible outcome.<n>Input: What kind of material is a couch made of? Choices: . A. B. C:. D: E:. Output:<n>Reason:<n><n>Option C: is the right one. The other options don't make sense. The questions have provided us many clues for us to discard any other answers except couch.<n># - The couch is the furniture in our house which we use to sit.<n># - The meaning of 'couch' in our daily language will be a kind of sofa or seat. This makes this is the right answer.<n># - The question has used "Couch" with singular form<n># - Therefore, the answer will be a noun (a kind or material)<n># - The word Couch is not used as a verb (action).<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question for #12-20<n><n><n>Input: What color were the chairs they had at the wedding? Choices: A: Yellow B: Red C: Black D: Green E: Blue Output: Reasoning: The last three answer options are too colorful. No way to tell if they sat on chairs or couches (as this is stated in the question!) Therefore, the three remaining choices are not too colorful at all, nor do they really describe something you'd expect to see at a wedding. Option A, "Yellow", seems particularly out of place as chairs often do not come in that color.<n><n># -13. What does Rex say? (E) "I am afraid" (A) "I am sure" (D) "I feel confident" (B) "I can not be sure"<n>Output: Reason The answer is E) "I am afraid".<n># -14. What has happened in the previous sentence? (A)  "It" has gone back to its original form (B) "Awakening" refers to something that has happened during the current day (C) "Happened" should be in past tense (D) "Awakened" should be in present tense<n>Output: Reason "Something" will go back to "its original form" and this is

It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:To gain her trust the real estate agent was very polite, delightful and all around what? Choices:  A: manipulate B: charming C: deceive D: exaggerate E: incompetent<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Once you understand the context of the scenario, it's time to determine the motivation for the agent's behavior. The options that are immediately eliminated are "deceive" (C) and "all around" which are too extreme and do not fit the context.<n><n>Then, you should choose the option that best fits the agent's intent.<n><n>The phrase "to gain her trust" implies that the agent was indeed being cordial but this does not explain why.<n><n>Options B and E contain qualities that would not be necessary to gain the customer's trust. The agent's charming ways might lead the customer to like her or think she's trustworthy, but that is not the same as gaining trust. Likewise, using exaggerated claims to attract trust is not realistic.<n><n><n>Finally the option that fits best is A: manipulate.<n>So the final choice is A: manipulate<n><n>Input: To get the loan you had to sign a bunch of paperwork which your real estate agent what? A: did not help with B: had not seen C: did not know D: had never read E: knew nothing about <n>Output: Reason<n>If i will chose C and will say the correct solution is " had not seen "<n><n>so final choice will be B.<n><n>Input:The CEO of the company announced that because of the company's financial situation a big layoff of employees is going to happen. Your response to this news what? A: was sad so you cried B: you accepted it but you felt scared and sad C: was shocked D: you left your job immediately E: felt happy because you know you can find better job <n>Output: Reaction:<n>The word "happy" is not given any context in this question - it could be used to mean anything from "giddy" to "gleeful". There is no way to know what level of happiness is referenced by this word.<n>Therefore, this is a likely indication that this should not be a part of your answer key.<n><n>Now what should the final answer key contain?<n><n>The only relevant word in the question is the word "accepted". Accepted means that I didn't find it that I was shocked or sad about the news, etc. It suggests that I didn't give that reaction and felt okay about it.

Choices:  A: problems B: crying C: inspiration D: trauma E: nightmares<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>To get to the final answer - E: Trauma, you must first understand the context and purpose of the action.<n><n>The first task of the context analysis is to understand the action. In this case, there are two tasks - the first of which is to use their previous successes to inspire them. It is clear that they are motivated by previous successes, and this inspires them to act, so we can eliminate any other motivations.<n><n>Next, you must determine what the action is. Remembering past successes, while important for inspiration, is not sufficient for the purpose because it does not tell us whether this causes inspiration or stress.<n>Therefore, the correct option is going to be E; because remembering past successes causes trauma.<n><n>Input:When a doctor takes the temperature of a patient, the thermometer is used to measure A: how hot the patient is B: the patient's level of sickness C: how cold the patient is D: the patient's health E: the patient's age<n>Output:Reasoning:<n><n>To get the final answer, you must first complete the context and purpose analysis.<n><n>The context is quite straightforward to understand. In the context, the thermometer is "something used to measure" something.<n>This tells us that the thermometer, or the object in the context, is something used to measure, and therefore the correct answer is going to be "A" - "how hot" the patient is.<n><n>From there, the options then tell us what "how hot" the thermometer is used for. For options B and C, it's quite clear that this phrase doesn't make a lot of sense, as they both don't represent the object in the context. Option D is possible, but we already know that "how hot" the patients is going to be the correct option.<n><n>Finally Option E has been eliminated because it doesn't match the context. It isn't reasonable to use a thermometer to measure the patient's age, so we can eliminate Option E as the correct choice.<n><n>The answer is going to be A "how hot" the patiet is<n><n>Input:According to the scientific method, an observation is usually the first step that is carried out when conducting a scientific experiment.

First, any year between 1010 - 1958 was in BC, not AD (A.D. stands for Anno Domini, or "Year of our Lord"). Secondly, it refers to the number of years in AD (1000).<n><n>Option "one hundred thousand three" (C) could possibly refer to the year 100,300 B.C., but that doesn't hold any relevance to LinkedIn's user numbers so it is incorrect.<n><n>Finally option "ten thousand" (D), provides the correct answer. 10,044,360 accounts have been registered on the site in April 2012.

Choices: <n>A: Android<n>B: Windows<n>C: Safari<n>D: Chrome<n>E: iPhone<n>Output:{<n><n><n><n><n><n>Reason:<n><n>Android is a widely used mobile operating system developed by Google. It is designed to work on a variety of smartphones, tablets, and other devices, and it offers a range of features and functionality that enable users to interact with their devices in a variety of ways. As a result, it is a natural choice for the name of a software application that runs on mobile devices to interact with their user interface.<n><n>Windows is not a mobile operating system, and it is instead designed to run on computers, laptops, and other personal computers. While it does include some features that can be used on mobile devices, it is not designed specifically for mobile use and its user interface is not designed to be used in a manner that is consistent with the user interface of mobile devices.<n><n>Safari is a web browser developed by Apple that is designed to run on iOS devices, such as iPhones and iPads. It is not a general-purpose application development platform, and thus would not be a natural choice for the naming of a software application that works with the user interface of a mobile device.<n><n>Chrome is not a dedicated mobile operating system and does not function in the same way as Windows or Safari. It is, rather, a web browser application that runs on a variety of devices, including laptops, desktops, and mobile devices. While Chrome may be used concurrently on a mobile device and on a desktop or laptop computer, it cannot be said to run as a "front end" application on a mobile device, and therefore is not a contender for the naming of a mobile-oriented software application.<n><n>iPhone is not a software application but rather is a specific type of computing device, as Apple itself states on its website at Apple dot com.

Choices:  A: fatigue B: relaxation C: tiredness D: muscle weakness E: losing weight<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Let's look at what all the options mean to get an exact wording.<n><n>Option A: It states "fatigue", though "tiredness" would be more accurate. However, this option goes out of context - the question was actually asking us what benefit we get from exercising. Tiredness does not give us a "benefit", so it goes out of context and is eliminated.<n><n>Option B: Option B states "relaxation", which is good - that's exactly what we want from exercising. The reason relaxation doesn't work is because it gives two benefits. The context of the whole question is about "exercising" meaning only one activity. By having two, it goes out of context. Eliminated.<n><n>Option C: C states "tiredness", which would mean the same as A.<n><n>Option D: D also states "tiredness".  This gives one benefit, unlike the last two options, so it works well for the question, which is asking for benefit of exercising. We do not need to eliminate it, which would be E. Still, we have two options that give one benefit, rather than both options giving the benefit. This does not follow the format of the question (asking for benefit rather than purpose). Hence, the context of the  question is violated, and the choice gets eliminated.<n><n>So the options that work are A and D: Tiredness. We don't want two benefits, so option A does not fit and cannot work with the question. It is eliminated. <n><n>Option D remains, because it is the last option available in the puzzle. It stays till the end.<n>Output:So which one does not work? Option D is the answer. Explanation: The puzzle works this way: when you answer D, you should be immediately able to answer E. If you can answer E, then D does not work. If you cannot answer E, then D works. <n><n>In this case, D's elimination works immediately, because when you answer D, there is no way to answer E to follow the context of the puzzle. Eliminating D works instantly when you answer D. Hence, D does not work. Therefore the final choice for the puzzle is A: Tiredness.

But it's actually too general because it could be considered a success regardless of the context. For example, if a person was celebrating their own birthday, it could be considered a personal success even though that doesn't technically involve procreation.<n><n>The next pair of questions are "have a party" (B) and"hear crowd go mad" (C). Both of these choices could be reasons someone might celebrate, but they're irrelevant to the question at hand.<n><n>The remaining choices are closely related: "create success" (D) and "reproduce" (E).<n><n>Ultimately, "create success" (d) is too abstract while "reproduce"(E) is more specific as it refers to procreation directly. <n><n>So the final answer for this question is D: create Success<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the questions below based on the passages and diagrams.<n><n>Input:Passing and Failing<n><n>Output:<n><n>I think this one makes sense right.<n><n>Input:Leadership<n><n>Output:<n>These diagrams are quite well designed imo<n><n>Input:Cognitive Dissonance<n><n>Output:<n>There are diagrams so these questions are also quite interesting!<n><n>Input:Congruence Principle<n><n>Output:<n>This principle has many diagram too<n><n>Input:Airborne Illness<n><n>Output:<n>The question is also quite easy to get even if there is a diagram in the passage.<n><n>Input:Inherent Limitations<n><n>Output:<n>If you learn the principle, you can also understand this question's answer lol<n><n>Input:Virtue, Wealth, Happiness - Cognitive Dissonance Theory<n><n>Output:<n>Just like the one above, the diagrams and the question makes it easy to understand<n><n>Input:Human Cognitive Limitations - Theories<n><n>Output:<n>I feel you gotta learn about this cognitive limitation principle cuz it is the fundamental basis for all of the following questions<n><n>Input:Third Person Effect<n><n>Output:<n>Again, I think

Choices:  A: atom B: anything C: air D: feet E: hands<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Option "hands" (E) is definitely false. If a collection of atoms makes up everything you can hold, your hands cannot possibly be a molecule. Not only are our hands comprised of millions of atoms, but they're also comprised of distinct molecules such as water.<n><n>Likewise, option "anything" (B) isn't the case, as everything is made of a collection of atoms. Similarly, option "air" (D) is false. Air is a substance just like all other things in the world, and it's only made out of atoms.<n><n>This means options A and C are impossible. Option C "atom" is the closest to the right answer in terms of meaning. If you look up "molecule", you'll see an example of an atom.

Also, option A "molecules" is incorrect for the same reason.<n><n>Options B, D, and E are all very broad, so they don't address every possible answer.<n>Option B "atom" definitely does not cover every answer because atoms aren't everything nor do they make everything in the world.<n><n>Option D seems like the best possibility - what else makes up everything? It's definitely true for the answer "all of these", and it seems plausible since every choice is a collection of atoms. But it's not the only one.<n><n>Option A "atom" is definitely the best answer to this question. <n><n>Input: An organic matter

This gives us a good idea of what's important in this question: horses need energy to live. Hence, the correct answer will be the option or action that gives them that energy<n><n>From left to right, we have options A and D. Option A suggests that horses eat grass to get energy, however, horses' main source of food is hay, which is grass that has been cured before eating. Therefore, this option is incorrect.<n>Option D suggests that horses get their energy by dominating other horses. However, this is untrue; horses do not get their energy in this way.<n><n>Option C suggests that horses get their food from stables, which is an incorrect answer.<n>The final options are A and B, which are the answer choices.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The competition was to see who would be the last one the drop the object, the hard part was you had to have your arm extended straight out while what the object? Choices:  A: holding B: lift up C: pick up D: lifting E: hold onto<n>Output:		Reasoning::<n><n>The purpose of the competition is to see who will be the last one to drop the object. This means the competitors will need to hold the object for the longest time.<n><n>The options "hold" (A), "lift up" (B), and "pick up" (C) are unnecessary as they pertain to the type of object or how long it is held for. They are specific instances that have nothing to do with the main purpose of the competition, which is determining who is the last one to drop it.<n><n>"Lifting" (D) is also a specific instance. While it may be a type of object the competitors pick up before releasing it, it is irrelevant to the competition.<n><n>And, finally, "holding on to" (E) is also not relevant as the purpose is for the competitors to maintain possession of the object for as long as possible. Holding on to it is not the difficult part. <n><n>Therefore, the final answer is E holding on to<n><n>Input:What would happen if you have the ability to travel in the fourth dimension? Choices:  B: nothing happen C: Nothing happens D: things become more complex E: You will be able to see the past & future<n>Output:Reason:<n><n><n><n>The ability to travel in the "fourth dimension" (e.g., time) would certainly change a person's perception of the world. Things that we might consider "normal" or "everyday" would stand out as being something different and outside of our normal scope of comprehension. The idea of being able to travel in time would mean that a person would be able to see the future or the past. This is the reason why the most correct answer is E: You will be to see the past &amp; future.<n><n><n><n><n><n>Input:Which of the following does not belong to the category set? Choices:  D: Cars B: Motorcycles A: Bicycles C: Electric bicycles E: Tractors<n>Output:Reason<n><n><n>It may seem like an electric bicycle (C) does not belong to the same category set (e.g., bicycles) as cars and motorcycles. But given how an electric bicycle runs on electricity and is classified as a bicycle, it is not excluded in

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What is a convenient place for a bus station? Choices:  A: maps B: street C: catch bus D: city centre E: school<n>Output:		Reason: This is an interesting question that requires critical thinking and the ability to understand the context. The primary purpose of a bus station is to facilitate the exchange of passengers between buses, making it necessary that it be in a location that is easily accessible to those using the bus service.<n><n>The four remaining options are all unsuitable. Maps (B) provide information but don't indicate where the bus station is located, the buses (C) operate from the station, and the city centre (D) could describe multiple locations depending on the region.<n><n>Finally we have the option "at school" (E) which doesn't provide a clear definition of where the bus station is, or specify why this is a "convenient" location.<n>Of the remaining options, the best answer is "school" because this makes sense both logically and culturally in that a bus station must be accessible to the citizens who will be using it, so it must be situated conveniently in a location that can facilitate such access.<n>So the final answe is E: school<n><n>Input:What might a teacher do to reduce noise in a classroom? Choices:  Answers:  A: turn the noise down  B: tell everyone to be quiet  C: make them more comfortable D: find a new school  E: give a warning<n>Output: Reason : The teacher in question will likely utilize various methods to maintain order among the students and control the level of noise within the classroom. One such method would be for the teacher to simply instruct the students to "turn the noise down," which would clearly indicate to them where the source of the noise is coming from and emphasize the importance of reducing or eliminating it altogether. <n><n>Option A, "turn the noise down,” appears to be an overly simplistic answer. The choice also doesn’t fully explain why or how the teacher intends to have the student reduce the noise, providing no explanation or rationale for what they should do or how they should go about doing it.<n>Option B, "tell everyone to be quiet," seems somewhat appropriate, but it fails to justify how this activity would reduce the level of noise in the classroom in addition to instructing students explicitly to be quiet<n>Option C, "making them more comfortable," seems like an out-of-place option that is too vague and unexplained<n>Option D, "finding a new

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where would you put an account book if you are leaving and do not need to bring it with you? Choices:  A: kept at accountant B: purse C: desk drawer D: bank E: keeping track of expenses<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Once we determine the intended purpose of keeping an account book, the only possible answers are "A" and "D."<n><n>"At accountant" (B) is not relevant, as the narrative indicates that the person is about to leave. Unless he plans to stay, the account book will likely not return to his accountant anytime soon - thus, this should be ruled out.<n><n>"Desk drawer" (C) doesn't make a lot of sense, as it's more suited for an office desk rather than being kept at a home. The context of leaving, combined with the specific mention of "keeping track," suggests that the person is on their way somewhere, perhaps taking the book with them.<n><n>"Bank" (E) is irrelevant in its context, as this is not a situation in which you would bring a checkbook to the bank.<n><n>"Keeping track of expenses" (E) is a broad statement, leaving us unable to pinpoint an exact location for the account book.<n><n>From here, we are left with two remaining choices: "at accountant" (B), which simply doesn't fit the narrative of someone preparing to leave, and "desk drawer" (D), the option that does. Since the latter is the only answer that fits the narrative, this would be the final answer.<n>So the final Answer is D: Desk drawer<n><n>Input: Do you think a shiny new car, even if it were to be bought with your last penny, would make you a more content person? Choices:  yes A: no B: maybe C: no D: yes E: not at all<n>Output: Reason is:<n><n>The wording of the question implies that a person is considering purchasing a car, and is wondering whether it would make them more content. This could suggest that it's possible the person doesn't own a car, making "yes" (A) and "yes, with no money" (A) options invalid.<n><n>Next, it would be necessary to examine "would buy" (A) and determine whether someone is suggesting that they could buy a car even if they have no money. This is ambiguous, but by taking a closer look at the surrounding text, we can come to a conclusion. Since we know that the person is on the verge of buying

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What is a place that someone can go buy a teddy bear? Choices:  A: thrift store B: bed C: shelf D: home E: toy store<n>Output:		To "buy" a teddy bear is a relatively common colloquialism, and so this question can be understood to be asking for the place someone would go in order to buy a teddy bear.<n><n>The options "thrift store" (A) and "home" (E) are both correct, because they both describe a place where someone could purchase a teddy bear. They differ in that thrift store (A) means "to sell secondhand goods", while home (E) refers to "the place where someone lives".<n><n>The option "shelf" (D) does not apply to the question. "Shelf" is typically used to indicate a place to store food items or other items, not a place to buy them. Therefore, this would not be an appropriate option for this question.<n><n>The option "bed" (B) is incorrect because it does not refer to a specific place where one could go to buy a toy. It is more general, and could indicate that someone would purchase a teddy bear at any time. Therefore, this would also be incorrect.<n><n><n><n>Input:What can a person do but not understand?Choices:  A: do math B: drink C: play D: speak E: act<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>The phrase "do something but not understand it" makes little sense from a grammatical standpoint. This is because "doing something" and "understanding" are both activities, meaning this phrase essentially implies that doing something will somehow negate its own activity, which is contrary to how grammar usually works.<n><n><n>The question can be interpreted in multiple ways, such as the person cannot understand themselves or cannot understand what the person was doing.<n>If an activity is done, the person understanding it seems impossible, unless the person already understands and is doing it again.<n><n>Input:How do I get from here to there? Choices:  C: run D: walk E: get from F: fly<n>Output: Reason<n><n>The phrase "getting from here to there" does not seem to make sense in this question, as "get" is typically used in the context of acquiring something and "getting" from one place to another would seem to imply that one has arrived at one's destination.<n><n>Options "run" (C) and "walk" (D) would be options for someone who actually needed to get somewhere rather than
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What do you do to hold loose papers together? Choices:  A: tighten B: packaged C: bound D: faithful E: compact<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>In English, we use the expression "to pack something," which is what option (A) is referring to. As a result, we can eliminate the term "to packaged."<n>Moreover, the prefix "pack" implies action, while the prefix "faithful" implies character. So (C) is obviously incorrect.<n><n>Option (B) suggests binding papers in a way that they do not fall apart, or otherwise become broken or lose structure.<n>That said, the definition of "binding" suggests holding or securing something together, not breaking it apart. As such, the sentence "so you use binding" in the context of "holding papers together" is illogical and impossible to understand.<n><n>Similarly, "compact" is used to describe a small amount of space being occupied. It is used as an adjective when one is discussing the size or shape of something. The term would be misleading if applied literally to what one does when arranging loose papers.<n><n>The final remaining option "to compact," in contrast, fits perfectly. When compacting loose papers, we apply pressure such that they are held in position and made firm, thereby preventing them from falling away.<n>So the final correct answer is D: faithful compact.<n><n>Input: What do we make funeral arrangements for? Choices: 1. A: funerals or ceremonies 2. B: burial or funerals C: services or celebrations D: cemeteries or memorial parks E: memorial services or services 3. A: services or memorial day 4. B: cemeteries and memorial day 5. C: services or memorial celebration 6. D: memorial parks and ceremonies<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>We can eliminate options D and E by looking at their context. Option D doesn't refer to funeral arrangements, but instead to memorial parks, while option E refers to memorial services, a type of service one may have at a funeral.<n><n>Options A and B are incorrect because only one funeral takes place at any given funeral arrangements services, according to the definition. Thus, these would be the most obvious choices for the answers.<n>Options C and E are grammatically incorrect and can be eliminated as options immediately.<n><n>Option A: services (option

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:During the brainstorming session there was a lot of talking and what? Choices:  A: obtaining information B: exchange of ideas C: sharing information D: conversation E: gathhering of information<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>This question is fairly basic, but it's important to remember that the context of the question should be taken into account when choosing the correct option. <n><n>Option A: "information" (A) is a fairly general term for knowledge and data. However, it is usually associated with a sense of authority or ownership. <n><n>Option B: "exchange of ideas" (B) is more specifically related to how new knowledge is shared and acquired. This option is thus a more precise way of describing what goes on in the brainstorming process.<n><n>Option C: "share information" (C) is another vague and general option that is neither specific enough nor indicative of the main task of brainstorming.<n><n>Option D: "conversation" (D) falls somewhere between the vague, general option C and the precise, context-specific B. The fact that information is being shared between people makes it a relatively good option. However, again, it lacks a specific quality that is indicative of the brainstorming setting.<n><n>Finally we get to Option E: "gathers of information". Being very specific and specific to the task of brainstorm, this option clearly shows the true purpose behind the session.<n><n>So there we have it, the final answer is E<n><n>Input: The scientists working in the laboratories had no problems because?  Choices: A: they were well prepared  B: they had a clear procedure  C: they were good at their work D: they had good lab equipment E: all of the things above are true<n>Output:Reasonning:<n><n>In order to answer this question, you need to consider both the context of the question and the specific purpose of the scientists. <n><n>Option "they were well prepared" (A) doesn't quite fit the scenario, as we're not told exactly what they were expected to do. There's no further information provided to help us answer this.<n><n>The next option, "they had a clear procedure" (B), sounds pretty good at first! It's indicative of specificity and is even mentioned in the question. It's an example of using the best out of a bad situation. It's a reasonable option to consider, but it doesn't stand out as the right answer.<n><n>The next couple of answers are really specific, but don't actually

Choices:  A: refrigerator B: museum exhibit C: prehistoric times D: museum of natural history E: forest<n>Output:		Reasonable:<n><n>When you think of animals living in New York City, your mind may naturally gravitate towards the prehistoric era. However, there are many animals that still populate the city today, one of which is a mammoth. In the Museum of Natural History in New York City, you can see actual mammoth bones and fossils on display. These fossils are the remains of animals that lived thousands of years ago, but they are now exhibited in the museum.<n>So the answer would be A: the museum exhibit<n>

Choices:  A: park B: in the ground C: hedgerow D: temperate climate E: botanical gardens<n>Output:		Reason: The question is asking what distinguishes the rosebush from other types of bushes. The word "along" could indicate any feature or characteristic of the plant to be identified. <n><n>The most common feature of a rosebush is its color. The question is asking about a rosebush specifically, so an incorrect response that isn't specific to roses, such as "flowers" (B) or "bloom" (C), would be incorrect.<n><n>This leaves us with a choice between "rose color," an accurate response, and "flowering," which may be too general to determine if this is the rosebush we're seeking. But upon closer examination, the rosebush is probably in a "hedge" (D), so it's more likely flowering. In this context, "flowering" (D) is the correct answer.<n>```

Choices:  A: strain B: though C: happiness D: realization E: understanding<n>Output:		<n>Reasoning:<n><n>This question is similar to the previous one, in that both include a scenario where data is analyzed, and involve the term "understanding" (which was also chosen incorrectly in the previous question).<n><n>Again, the first and foremost task is to understand the situation. In this case, the analyst is reading printed data carefully. It is therefore reasonable to assume that he's using optical methods - such as a magnifying glass or a high-powered lens - to look more closely at the print.<n>As we know from the first question, the primary purpose of analyzing the data would be to gain a deeper understanding. To gain that understanding, a scientist needs a more precise understanding of the data. This could potentially come in the form of better clarity or visibility of the data. It's unlikely he would be happy.<n><n>The next task to consider is what the analyst himself might experience while analyzing the data. If he reads one letter after another repeatedly in his analysis, it's likely he would suffer eye strain (A). Alternatively, this repetition could also result in him feeling headache (B).<n><n>The next option isn't directly related to reading the letter. This option (C) invokes the term "happiness" - which doesn't fit the scenario at all, given what the analyst is looking for.<n><n>To reach to an understanding, the analyst is required to think. As he's reading letter after letter in an attempt to interpret the data, surely it's an important time to reflect. His reflection could lead to a realization (D), or even enlightenment (E).<n><n>So in this case the final answer is E - realization<n><n>Input: What did he decide to do?

Choices:  A: grand casino B: large room C: restaurant D: country club E: lobby<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>All other answer choices are incorrect as they do not involve any sort of large room. The reception must be planned and held in a room for people to gather; it would not make sense to hold a reception in a restaurant or casino with very few people; this would greatly reduce any potential of receiving a large turn-out.<n><n>Choices C and D involve large rooms but do not require the room to specifically be for a reception as both casinos and restaurants cater to receptions. A country club, on the other hand, is a separate building from the actual country club itself; as such the people visiting may get lost due to lack of organization.<n><n>If the reception is only intended for a small amount of people, an informal setting such as the lobby would be sufficient.<n>If the reception involves a large group, an appropriate setting would be found within a restaurant and casino in order to fit with the amount of attendants.<n><n>In conclusion, the final answer is E.<n><n>Input:I am a carrier of a rare eye disease and I need to get an eye check, where can I go?

The list of options given includes the common symptoms of waking - a bit too broad, and no single one stands out as the main result of waking.<n><n>That leaves four possibilities: "tiredness," (A), "discomfort," (C), "getting out of bed," (D), and "eyes opening" (E). This list of options is not as comprehensive as it first seems. "Getting out of bed" and "discomfort from lying down" are in fact one and the same - the process of waking means getting up from your bed.<n><n>From the options, we can further narrow it down to two options: "tiredness" (A), or "eyes opening"(E).

John preferred glass, and wished he was somewhere else.  Where does he want to be? Choices:  A: cupboard B: anywhere else C: everything D: own home E: garbage dump<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>In order to correctly answer this question, an individual needs to identify the character's motivation.<n><n>The first thing to note is that John's preference for glass over plastic indicates that he values quality over quantity. In other words, his character traits imply that he places a premium on good-quality items that last longer and don't break easily.<n><n>However, despite his preference for glass, John prefers to be "somewhere else". This suggests that while he may appreciate higher quality goods, he also places a high value on escaping everyday routine and finding something new.<n><n>After identifying John's motivations and goals, it becomes clear that the correct answer is choice E: "anywhere else". By identifying and following his desires, John could successfully avoid his repetitive daily routine and perhaps embark on a new adventure.<n><n>Conclusion: The options that are relevant to the character's needs are "anywhere else" and "own home". The latter choice is more realistic, given that an actual person doesn't have control over what happens with their garbage. Therefore, the most appropriate choice is "anywhere else".<n><n>Input: What does it mean when someone says, "It's a dog's (of something, such as life)?Choices:  A: It's easy  B: It's a problematic C: It's complicated  D: It's not a good idea  E: It's annoying<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>A) to call someone a dog is to imply that they are not very clever<n>B) to call someone a puppy is to imply that they need to grow up<n>C) to call someone a mutt is to imply that they have mixed parentage<n>D) to call someone a wolf is to imply that they could be dangerous<n>E) to call someone a wild animal is to imply that they aren't tame<n>F) to call someone a tiger is to imply that they may have trouble controlling themselves<n>G) to call someone a baboon is to imply that they lack morality<n>H) to call someone a monkey is to imply that they don't belong in a classroom<n>I) to call someone a sheep is to imply that they tend to be submissive<n>J) to call someone a pig is to imply that they can be

First, the numbers in the numerator are different than the ones in the denominator, making the question difficult to solve without rearranging. Secondly, the question does not indicate any order of operations for adding or subtracting the numbers. Without instructions on what operations to perform, it's tough to solve.<n><n>To work around the issue, reorder the numbers in the denominator and numerator the same amount of digits to be 55468675 and 65515656, respectively. Now the operations are defined: 5546 + 6551 = 12097. Now the question becomes: What is 12098 - 500? The answer is 11598. Since we're subtracting the 500 from the number of the numerator is (12098), the answer is 65593. 6559 + 56875 = 62042. Since the question asks for the answer to the sum of the two numbers, 62043 is the correct answer.

I am sure that everyone must have a GPS on their android phone, google map is one of the best GPS.<n><n>Google Maps and other highway GPS services are now replacing the role of traditional forms of navigation, such as printed roadmaps and atlases.<n><n>Hence the correct answer is D<n>### Instruction: Write a program to analyze the data.<n>Input:A 3 × 5 2-dimensional array is given by arr[][] containing the integers 5, 6, 4, 9, 6 and a 2 × 3 array is given by subarr[][] containing the integers<n>1, 3, 5 and 3, 4, 2.<n>Output: A 2 × 2 4 × 4 matrix is to be output. The matrix is to be filled from the top, L-R then top R-L. The top 1×2 matrix should contain the numbers of elements in each row. It<n>can be done only with one pass, no need to use stack.<n>Reasoning:This can be done by taking one row at a time. Consider the first row for eg. 9,6,4,9,6. Now, start with i = 0, j = 0 because 5 is there in 9th row. Now if 5 is at the left most of the 2nd row, so, we move to subrow[i][j] = subrow[i][0] = 1 because now 4 is in the 1st row in the place of 5. Since the subarray has only 3 ele, so while moving to the right, if the ele becomes a 0, then it moves on to the new row. Thus 0 becomes 0, 1 becomes 3. In the bottom-up pass, 6 becomes 0 and 4 becomes 2. Now, this row also ends in a 0, so 5 is removed and the last row is at 0 5 6 4 and the remaining row is 9. And the other rows remain 6 9. We will try the next row and repeat again and again, 100,99,98... to the bottom.

Choices:  A: low lands B: new york C: forest D: louisiana E: everglades<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Once again, the context for this question is established in the very first line, "Bill is stuck in the marsh".<n><n>The next thing to consider is the options.<n>Option A, "the low lands", is wrong because "the low lands" doesn't actually exist. It's unlikely to refer to the Everglades - the only other place in the choices - since geographically it doesn't fit the context of the story. It's difficult to imagine "the low lands" as a place name.<n><n>Option B, "New York", is eliminated as unlikely because it's not a natural geographical place name that one would use to locate an inhabitant.<n><n>Option C, "forest", doesn't fit the geography of the story either. It's unlikely that they refer to the Everglides as "forest" because "forest" generally refers to land full of trees and "forest" is not present in the story.<n><n>"Louisiana" (E) fits the geography of the context. It's the closest plausibly located location to Bill, who is in a marsh - the definition of a marsh being "a wetland covered by shallow water", and Louisiana being "coastal, low-lying areas" from the Collins dictionary, and therefore a plausible location for such phenomena to occur.<n><n>So the final answer to the question is E: Louisiana.<n><n>Input:What is 226 * 423?

There's a chance the problem will be solved in a natural environment, such as sitting on a park bench, so there's a chance for a natural answer to the problem.<n><n>However, option A (1) is obviously not a natural number, and therefore isn't an answer.<n><n>The next option is option B, (228). This number is an invalid product because multiplying 226 +

Choices:  A: car B: fuel system C: accelerate D: boat E: airplane<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>By reading the question, the intended meaning of the terms "accelerator" and "pedals" was clear. It was only after reading the explanation that the "car" option was excluded, as the steering does not take place in a car.<n>The terms "accelerate" and "pedals," on the other hand, suggest a means to control acceleration, i.e. the foot pedals. <n>Therefore, the correct answer is option E: the airplane. <n><n>Input:What happens if someone tries to enter the mall which doesn't have the card, which they had borrowed from their mother? Choices: <n><n>Output:Reason:<n><n>The question is posed as a hypothetical scenario where a person attempts to enter the mall using a card they hadn't borrowed from their mother.<n><n>The question's emphasis on "they," "had," and "had borrowed" is critical in determining the correct response. The first-person pronoun "they" refers to a specific person, indicating that the question is about that person, rather than a generic individual. The fact that the person "had borrowed" the card suggests that they intended to return it to its original owner.<n><n>The following is another statement:<n><n>If a person in question did not have the card, the response would be an empty or "false" answer. However, the question has a clear sense of identity and emphasises borrowing and return to the mother.<n>A person who returns the card after borrowing it from their mother is not at all an empty or false answer.<n><n>So the final answer the person in question is not empty or false, which is the answer B.<n><n>Input:The problem of "Who ate all the cake?" was what problem it was a problem with Choices: A: A person  B: Finding and stopping Boss  C: Finding the culprit D: A: finding the culprit<n>Output: Reason<n>A person who eats the cake is just a person, that doesn't solve the problem. The problem is to find and stop a boss, that's why D is the final answer. As the options are given in the increasing orders there're two options were left after that.

"Shop" (B) doesn't match. "Snakes are carried in North America" (D) is too long, making it obvious that the speaker's demand couldn't possibly be met. "Snakes aren't carried outdoors, they are kept in cages" (R) is equally absurd.<n>The only option that fits the given context is "to carry them, exotic snakes have to be transported under a warm bed."<n><n>Input: She did well and didn't give up after taking the exam.

The best answer is E: nope.<n><n>The question states that "she did well", not that she passed. This makes it unlikely she passed.<n><n>The last scenario states "she will be getting the scholarhship". She has to pass in order to get the scholarship, and the situation doesn't provide us with evidence that she passed. Therefore, the most accurate answer is E: no.<n><n>The option "absolutely" (B) is incorrect because it uses the word "absolutely", indicating 100% certainty, which is not present in the given question.<n>The option "not necessarily" (A) is incorrect for the same reason - it's not the case that she will definitely pass.<n><n>The option 'I don't know'  (C) is incorrect because the option doesn't indicate any particular certainty of outcome.<n>The option "may be" (D) is incorrect because the question isn't asking for the most likely scenario.<n><n>Input: Everyone is so happy tonight he even won an award for how  good he is doing.

Choices:  A: neighborhood B: subdivision C: city D: suburbs E: street<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>To answer the first part of the question, the analyst should look at the phrasing of the statement: "where should he start looking." "He wanted" means that all options "should." This makes the second part of the question more relevant for answering the question: "where should he look."<n><n>The "should" part indicates that you're looking for where to "start looking" for a specific "something," but you don't know what "something" you should be looking for.<n>"Neighborhood" (A) would fit, given a possible context that the analyst wants to move out of an apartment into a larger home. However, it doesn't fit because neighborhoods normally don't have gates on them. "Subdivision" fits the context of the question, but it is vague on exactly which type of "subdivision" he should start looking for. "City" is more specific, implying that he is trying to buy a home inside the city limits of a large urban area, and is not trying to live on a mountain or rural part of the countryside. However, "city" also doesn't fit, because most cities don't have a wall or a gate around them. "Suburb" (D), like "city," is defined as part of a larger metropolis, though not necessarily a rural place. It fits in the context of the question better and is a more common word to use in context.<n><n>That leaves the choice between "suburbs" (D) and "subdivisions" (C), and a close reading of the context indicates that "subdivisions" is the correct answer. <n><n>#Author of the answer(s):<n>Vitaliy K<n>Link to original thread <n><n>### IQTestBot<n><n>### GithubProfile<n><n>#### GITHUB<n><n>https://vitaliyvk.github.io/vitaliyvk-github-demo/<n>

The humour is in the double meaning of "tastiest", being both a food name and a sexual reference. This suggests that the choice "Why did the chicken cross [the road]?" (D) is almost certainly a reference to that meaning, and therefore not the correct answer. Moreover, the choice "that's is good" (E) is likely an error in communication that would be unlikely to cause confusion among people familiar with English.<n><n>Finally. the only plausible choice left is choice B, "Are you my dad?".<n>This is a reference to an older joke, in which someone asks a stranger if they're their dad.<n>So the final option is B: Are you my dad? <n><n>Input:What was the saddest day in history?

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What is eating too much dinner likely to result in? Choices:  A: tiredness B: living longer C: stomach ache D: illness E: acid reflux<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first thing to notice is that option B ("living longer") is an unrealistic outcome of eating dinner too much. So that can be crossed off from the beginning.<n><n>The same is true with other choices, such as C ("stomachache") and D ("illness"). Since the body was mentioned in the question, and there are many forms of illness, an all-encompassing option is not appropriate. Eating too much dinner may also cause acid reflux, but, as mentioned before, acid reflux should not be considered a "form" of illness. In addition, the options are very general and they would fail to address specific details of eating too much dinner. Therefore, there wouldn't be any real "proof" in such choices.<n><n>The remaining options A, C, D, and E are all inappropriate, too. It's a bit strange to suggest that "living longer" is likely to happen after one eats too much dinner; the situation is quite the opposite - one expects to be tired after eating dinner. So A ("tiredness") cannot be the correct answer. As to options C ("acid reflux") and D ("illusion"), they are not the likely outcomes of eating dinner too late. They are, instead, consequences of eating too much - which the question specifically discounted as the outcome.<n><n>So the question boils down to E, "acid reflux". This should be the simplest and most straightforward choice - and the most probable conclusion that a person can come to.<n><n>Input: A person had a strong desire to learn more about science, what did they need in order to do that?

Choices:  A: finish line B: broken bones C: broken legs D: chapped lips E: healthy body<n>Output:		<n> <n>The most logical answer to this question is "E" because the end of the skiing season would be a health season. <n><n>For example, there is a good chance that if you were to ski enough times, you would develop all types of muscle pains and muscle tear. But the most common form of injury is often broken bones in the legs, which is usually the most common injury in those who are not equipped to deal with the rigors of winter sports. <n><n>So B, broken bones isn't an accurate answer. It doesn't make any sense in the context of seasonal skiing because it's a winter sport.<n><n>If "C" would be an inaccurate answer. It doesn' t make any sense when thinking about season skiing. Because broken muscles can occur in summer sports as well.<n><n>So, E is the correct answer here. <n><n>Input: What might be the outcome for "he who laughs last"? Choices:  A. He who smiles loudest B. She who sings softer C. The first one to give in D. The most optimistic E.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What is a grumpy person likely to have? Choices:  A: headache B: understand themselves C: compliments D: own house E: happiness<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The scenario invokes a "grumpy person," which immediately eliminates "happiness" (E), as it is an inappropriate description of an angry individual. Then there is the word "own," which is often associated with something that was previously not one's own. Using this word with "house," it is impossible to have a house that you don't own.<n><n>The only option that remains is "own house," which is the correct answer. So the final answer is C: own house.<n><n>Input: One of the biggest issues that a computer hacker faces in their daily life is Choices:  A:-being arrested B:-having bad internet access C:-understanding security measures D:-being broke E:-hacking the internet<n>Output:-being arrested:<n>having bad internet access:<n>understanding security measures:<n>being broke:<n>hacking the internet:<n><n>So the final answer to the question: "One of the biggest issues that computer hacker faces in daily life is?" is C:understanding Security measures<n>

Choices:  A: under rocks B: manhattan C: toenails D: grocery store E: fallen tree<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>This question is testing your ability to think critically. The answer is "fallen tree" (E), which highlights the importance of understanding the context of the question and the limitations of an object to determine its most appropriate location.<n><n>When considering the context, it becomes clear that the question is referring to a fungus, which is commonly found in fallen trees and other decaying organic matter. In fact, many plant species are specifically adapted to grow in the absence of sunlight, as it allows them to thrive in their natural environment without competing with other plants for sunlight. So, while it may be possible for a fungus to grow in other places, such as manhattan (B), it is unlikely to occur, as the circumstances of the environment would not be conducive to its growth.<n><n>However, as the circumstances become more complex, such as considering other environmental factors like temperature or availability of water, the answer may become more nuanced.<n><n>In conclusion, while it is possible for a fungus grow in manhattan (B) and other places, it is more likely to occur in a fallen tree (E) due to the lack of sunlight and competition from other plant species. The answer is not B.<n>[ref](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/pvvx73/instructionanswer_the_following_multiple/)<n>

Choices:  A: hang up B: respond C: contact D: answer E: attracting ducks<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>So the next part is to analyze the phrase "all day," which can only refer to a period of time. Then, the task is to figure out when the phrase was added to the description of the scientist's behaviour. In this case, the only relevant time stamp is the one in the question, which is "all day."<n><n>This helps narrow down the options. Because the other phrases can only relate to morning and evening, the options become A: hang up, B: respond, C: contact, and E: attracting duck.<n><n>From there, we can identify two options that don't fit the description. "Contact" (C) is clearly inaccurate because it refers to a different type of interaction than a call, and "answer" (D) is inaccurate because that refers to responding verbally to a call, and one doesn't necessarily know if one knows the answer to the question asked<n><n>Once we get those out of the way (if they weren't already), the four remaining options start to look like plausible responses.<n><n>The options are:<n><n>A: hang up<n>B: respond<n>C: contact<n>E: attracting ducks.<n><n>If our interpretation is accurate, the question is:<n><n>What did the scientist hope to achieve by continually calling people throughout the day, hoping that they would respond well to his offer?<n><n>Therefore, the correct answer is B: respond<n><n>Input: She had a new idea she decided to put it into effect what well?

Choices:  A: stress B: nervousness C: smile D: being bored E: making new friends<n>Output:		Reason: The question's context and wording strongly suggest that the experience is negative.  We can eliminate the choices that refer to positive experiences: "being bored" (B), "making new friends" (E), and even "smiling" (C), which is only a neutral response. Choice A might be plausible if the person meeting someone else is feeling unsure or tense, but this is vague and open to interpretation.<n>The most definitive answer is "stress" (D). Not only does the word "stress" indicate an unpleasant emotion, but the answer choice specifically states "when meeting people." This indicates that the experience of stress is confined to particular contexts.<n>Thus, "stress" (i.e., negative reactions) would be the correct answer.<n>#codingwithpython<n>

Choices:  A: no go B: unlikely C: unable D: cant do E: impossibility<n>Output:		Reason: According to our context, the fat man was complaining about doing activities that were impossible for him. Choice C: "unable" is an inaccurate reference. This suggests that he is unable to do what is possible, while the fat man is instead unable to do what is impossible.<n><n>Option C: "unable to" doesn't make sense in the context. If the fat man is in fact unable to do what is necessary, then he wouldn't be able to do them at all.<n><n>Choice B: "unlikely". It's a valid choice, but not definitive enough to pinpoint what specific tasks the fat man is referring to. The sentence "I can't do what I can't" doesn't make any sense.<n><n>It's also possible that the fat man is referring specifically to "doing impossible activities," but this is never explicitly stated, and the question doesn't force us to choose this answer anyway.<n><n>In the end, it comes down to choice D, which gives us what we need in this case - a choice that is specific enough to be accurate.

Choices:  A: violence B: falling down C: vomiting D: vomiting E: lower standards<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>There are different degrees of intoxication that can result in different behavior from a person. A person who has had one or two drinks may engage in polite conversation, while someone who is very intoxicated may become violent or cause other problems.<n>The statement talks about a person who becomes violent after drinking. This suggests that the person is already quite aggressive (because otherwise, he would not even become violent). That eliminates options B and C (violence and vomiting respectively).<n><n>A person with violent tendencies will likely be participating in something (a sport, a hobby, something). It is unlikely they will be 'participating' in nothing. Choice E is therefore the correct answer.<n>So the final alternative is E: lower standards<n><n>Input: What will someone who is dextrous be best at? Choices: 1. A: writing 2. B: writing 3. C: art 4.

So A is incorrect.<n>Some people are not interested in art or music. So these are incorrect too.<n>So it remains an options between writing and reading. <n><n>A person who can write can also read, but vice versa not necessarily. However, reading is definitely easier than writing. Reading is a passive activity and requires no skill. It is thus the correct answer.<n><n>So the final alternative<n>is D: reading<n>

Choices:  A: dog's mouth B: floor C: garage D: trouble E: nature<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>First, the question is asking about what cats do when they are tearing apart. The answer choices do not correspond to this scenario accurately. Option A (dog's mouth) refers to the dog's teeth and does not mention tearing apart. Option B (garage/ground) refers to the location of the object being ripped apart, not the manner in which it is being ripped.<n><n>Option C (trouble), while commonly used as a synonym for chaos, does not refer to the process of tearing apart itself.<n><n>That leaves options A and E. Option E (trouble) is an acceptable answer but still not the most appropriate choice, given the context of the sentence and the answer choices. The first option (A) correctly refers to cats getting into dog's mouths.<n><n>So the final answer to this question would be A:into dog's mouths<n><n>Input: A mother went to town with her children, but she left her young dog at home.The young dog was hungry.What did the dog eat? Choices: A:The dog caught a cat B:The dog caught the cat in the hole C:The dog chewed The answer was: E:The dog chewed<n>Output:Reasonning:<n><n>First, it is important to note that the question asks for what the young dog ate, rather than whether or not it ate anything. This gives us a clear indication that the answer should be a verb, rather than a noun or other type of answer.<n><n>The answer choices are not in the correct order, with C (cat in the hole) being the most likely answer. The next choice, A (caught a cat), would be unlikely as the mother would most likely have secured the dog before leaving. B (caught the cat in the hole) would be unlikely as well as it does not align with the context of the question, in which the dog is left alone at home.<n><n>The only remaining answer choices are C (cat hole) and D (the dog chewed).<n><n>C (cat hole) would be an invalid answer as the dog is left alone and is unable to dig up the cat hole.

Choices:  Not strike gold  A: get gold B: find something C: hit on something D: hit rock E:  win big<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>"Strike" is used as a verb, meaning that something is discovered in an activity. In this context, you may say that you struck gold because you found a solution to a problem. Since it means "find something," you cannot say that you did not strike gold, since you did indeed strike or find something. <n><n>Next, the word "gold" is a noun and means something valuable. So hitting gold means finding something valuable and not being disappointed with your search. There's not really any other way to strike gold than by finding something good.<n><n>Next, "hit something," is a verb and means to hit it with force. You can strike and hit an object at the same time, and you can do so in a way that is not hard or forceful. "Strike it gently" or "hit it gently" would mean to make contact with the object but without force. However, the word "hit" in this phrase, is clearly not to be taken in such a way.<n><n>Finally A is wrong and B, D and E are ambiguous.<n>B: You are not going to be struck by something. If you strike gold, then you hit it with force.<n>D: To win big, you win something. No gold is won in sports, only first place, and then you are not striking gold.<n>E: This one is interesting, because you do not strike gold by getting gold. By winning big, you do not win gold at all.<n><n>So the correct answer is "strike gold means to find something valuable."<n><n><n><n>### Input:  It is very
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:You can hear testimony of how spirituality changes lives when you do what? Choices:  A: go to church B: appear in court C: watch soap operas D: paying attention E: go into court<n>Output:		<n><n>The first step in tackling a question is to clearly understand the context. In this case, the key phrase to highlight is "when you do". This indicates that there are multiple options involved, not just one choice.<n><n>The second step is to analyze each option and select the one that best fits the context. Option A suggests attending church, which makes sense, since testifying could mean speaking in church.<n>Option B invokes appearing in court, which doesn't quite match the context - testimonies usually involve sharing experiences or insights of spirituality and aren't necessarily related to legal situations. <n><n>Option C introduces a soap opera, which seems out of place in the context. <n><n>Finally, Option D refers to attention, which is perhaps the main objective of speaking about one's spirituality in front of others. Option E, paying attention, is the correct answer. If you do it, people pay attention to you. So the answer is E: paying attention<n><n>Input: You had what a person does on this weekend? Choices:  a. do nothing  b. work on something c. go to college  d. do housework e. go to school<n>Output:<n><n><n>The key word is "this weekend", which means that you are being asked what activities you will be engaged in over the weekend. The options provided don't match the context. Option B suggests working on something, while B's counterpart, Option D, brings up the idea of doing chores.<n><n>Option A, "do nothing," also doesn't make sense, since doing nothing isn't actually an activity. Option C, "go to college," would require a weekend time period to complete - which would not be possible in the context.<n><n>Finally Option E, "go to school", also wouldn't make much sense, since the weekend is a leisure time, and therefore wouldn't involve school.<n><n>Option B, "work on something," matches the context and provides the most logical choice for selection. <n><n> <n><n>

Choices:  A: roof B: school C: beach D: closet E: garage<n>Output:		Reason: <n><n>The goal here would be to optimize the chair so it doesn't take up space when it is not being used.<n><n>Option C: beach would not work because you can't put a chair in a beach (unless it's a beach chair).<n><n>From there, elimination rules out D: closet, since we've concluded that there are no large doors in the house. <n><n>Option B: school also fails in this case, since placing the chair in school would only be possible if the chair is not folded.<n><n>From there, there are two remaining choices: A: roof and E: garage.<n><n>Given that you would not plan to use the chair, eliminating E: garage would be the most logical choice, as it is a space to house things you plan to use. It would follow that placing the chair on the roof is the preferred option - though it may be quite difficult to move a chair to the roof.<n><n>Therefore, the final answer is A: roof<n><n>Input: A good test for a toy store is  to have many options for the kids.

One thing we know is that it is the largest that it can get due the word basket. This should eliminate C: Basket. The dog is in a small space, not a basket.<n><n>Even if it is a basket, it should still be rather large. This should eliminate the dog park and small apartment.<n><n>In conclusion,<n><n>[CORRECT] The dog has all the space it can get.<n>The word is not basket, it is house.<n><n>Input: If you were to travel to another country where you do not speak the language would you? Choices:  travel A: not know at first  B: be able to read C: know immediately D: be able to tell time E: be able to write<n>Output: Reason. <n><n>The previous question asks about how well the dog knows its own country.<n><n>But the question now asks about traveling to another country where you obviously don't know any of the local languages.<n><n>Therefore, the dog would not be able to tell time.<n><n>If it knew time at once it would be possible to tell what time it is and therefore able to tell time. Since it did not know time at once it couldn't read either.

Choices: 1: The Half-Blood Prince 2: The Deathly Hallows 3: The Chamber of Secrets 4: The Dark Lord Rises 5: The Order of the Phoenix Output:Reasoning: <n><n>First, you can eliminate some options by process of elimination. You'll probably know that it's not going to be something like Deathly Hallows or Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (although they are pretty good titles, actually).<n>Since it's a Harry Potter movie, that makes it number 7, but which one? That's where you are going to have to take advantage of the fact that you watched the entire series, if you are like me, but I'm sure there are some muggles out there who finished the saga too.<n>Well, in the sixth movie, we hear "Severus Snape killed Albus Dumbledore", and Harry's father was SURPRISED that Severus was a death eater. <n>And in the seventh movie, Dumbledore's face was on a poster that Harry didn't know much about. <n>He also met Snape's mother, who was a witch who was put in the trunk next to him as a baby. <n><n>The last thing you thought about was that if it was a Slytherin, and a muggleborn, then it was going to be Severus Snape, because he was also a muggleborn and he was a Slythering. <n><n>And Snape was the one who saved Harry's life from Bellatrix in the seventh movie and left Harry an audio message in which Bellatrix tells him that he can only trust Sirius Black and Dumbledore.<n><n>And that was it for me, I got it, so I got it for a

Choices:  A: shame B: arrest C: embarrassment D: go to jail E: tension<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>In this question, the scenario describes a situation in which someone has been accused of committing perjury. It is known that perjury is untrue testimony or false statements made while under oath in court proceedings.<n><n>Since we're narrowed down to "likely", the implication is that the outcome of being found guilty for perjury varies from case to case.<n><n>The options chosen so far are "arrest" (B), "go to jail" (C), and "tension" (E).  While each of these options is technically possible outcomes for committing perjury, the correct answer is "going to jail" (D).<n><n>In the context of criminal proceedings, especially in countries like the United States, the outcome for someone found guilty of perjury is typically a prison sentence. Jail is a generic term that can refer to either prison, jail, or other correctional facilities depending on where you live.<n><n>So we have C: go to jail as the correct answer.

However, "sitting" (C) and "being entertained" (D) are incompatible. If one was entertained, he wouldn't be able to move. Therefore, "being entertain" (D) is not a possible solution.

Choices:  A: injury B: death C: playing uno D: coma E: falling down<n>Output:		Reason: <n>1. First thing we need to notice is what the problem is stating about sky diving is that it scared him. <n>2. The question asks once he jumped out of the it he began losing consciousness. So the correct answer is what made him lose consciouness not sky diving itself if the answer is sky diving then answer is B because if you jump out of sky diving if he loses consciousness he will die so A is wrong<n>The answer is D <n><n>Input: It was a warm spring day in March. The boy asked his mother, “How will we get to school now that the snow has all melted?” Choices:  A – walk B – play with friends C – school bus D – take a shower E – school <n>Output: Reason<n> 1.This is very simple question in my opinion<n> 2.The answers to this question are very easy to eliminate and narrow the options down.<n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:If you did well on the test, you might get an A as a what? Choices:  A: see work B: practice C: quiz D: school grade E: homework<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first thing to notice here is the plausibility of each option against the context of the question and the original question. All options are plausible for a test-doing student, except "see work" (B). <n>That said, the option "see work" (C) sounds closest in meaning to the scenario of "doing well on a test you did". "See work" is an unusual way of stating that you worked hard, and therefore does not fit the context. <n>Option "homework" (E) is not a reasonable response based on the scenario, as the test would serve as a grade on your learning performance in a class or subject. Homework would be most likely given by your teacher for supplemental review. In this scenario, homework would not be the final graded product, but rather preparatory work to help you get a better grade in the future. As such, the option would not be an accurate response. <n>We can discard "homework" (C) and "see work" (E) from the pool of options.<n><n>Now we must pin down the option most closely related to the original context of this question, which would be "practice" (C).<n>"Practice" would likely mean practicing or preparing for an upcoming test in this scenario. Therefore, option "practice" would be a valid answer choice.<n>So the correct answer to question is C:practice<n>Input: The word "proficient" means someone is good at a particular activity and has had much practice or training doing that activity. What does the word "proficient mean? Choices: 1: Good 2: Good 3: Excellence 4: Adequate 5: Skilled<n>Output: Reason<n><n>Proficient is generally used to describe how well you do something. As an adjective it can suggest that you have great skills in a particular field or that you're skilled in a particular task. <n>You get points just for knowing how to use it.<n>There is not a specific definition in the way that it is used. So each choice would fit the meaning of proficient and could be the correct answer.<n>So the correct choice would be option no-1 :Good<n>Input:When can you say an actor has been great in a particular role?

Choices:  A: garage B: hospital C: boat D: house E: doll house<n>Output:		Reason:<n>The question is asking where is likely to have a 'lot of' fire extinguishters, so they're looking for a place with a lot of fire exquishers. So they already know they're going to find fire extingishers somewhere in the answer but it just asks where are they likely to be found. This option is a tricky question. Its not the most straightforward answer to be found in the options, but if you go with the reasoning i gave above it might bring you there!<n>So the answer option is: D: house<n><n>Input:What is 5+6? Choices: <n><n>Output: Reason<n><n>Reason:<n><n>The answer is 11 obviously, or at least there's nothing that 5+6 could possibly be.

The answer is A: 6000<n><n>Output: Reasons:<n>In this scenario the question being asked is: How many people have they talked to? They say 'they' but they don't specifically say who 'they' are, but if we presume that there's just one 'person', this question could have been asked of a politician, a celebrity, an executive, etc. If we use the 'they' is being vague in this scenario then by extension the 'they' could refer to a politician, or anyone who's likely to be surrounded by staff, therefore this is likely to be some sort of government figure such as a parliament member who would have 6000 staff members.<n>Answer: Answer: They talked to everyone. The answer options are 6000 and everyone.<n><n>Input:What type of music is not as well known? The answer is A) Rap.<n><n>Output: Recommends:<n>In this scenario, the question being asked is about a broad spectrum of music genres and the word 'well-known' is not specific enough to say that a group of other people would necessarily know what type of music, but I can presume that this is meant to be rap music or rap artists. Rather than a more obscure genre or rapper that is not well-known.<n>Answer: Answer B) is the correct answer. This type of music would be rap

I lost his shoes, didn't know where they landed, and had to run from the corner store to his home.  About where did he run? Choices:  A: a bed of nails B: town C: attractive consistent look D: city block E: ground<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>It seems pretty clear that the answer should be "city block." This option is consistent with the other nouns in the statement, such as "pavement," "shoes," "store," and "home." This is particularly notable since we have a pre-defined set of nouns that are relevant to the topic, and the options should be picked from the pool of nouns. <n><n>In contrast, other options might seem at first glance like they fit the context, but the sentence does not mention any of these things. For instance, option C ("attractive consistent look") has nothing to do with the feet running in the hot pavement, and the sentence doesn't specify anything about the nails.<n><n>Similarly, a bed of nails is irrelevant when it comes to the topic. Option A ("a bed of nails") is also inappropriate because it describes a mattress but not a particular location, which is what were looking for.<n><n>The reason why I picked the answer "city block" is that the given description has a lot of things missing, and we do not need to assume any of those things. The given question includes a lot of other details in the question, and they do not have more details about that particular person. And "city block" is the most consistent with all the other options in the sentence. <n><n>We can use the words to describe things without adding any of these extra things to fill in the gaps.<n>So, the final answer is E - "city block"<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question: 4 ÷ 6 =?<n>Input: 4 ÷  6 =?<n>Output: Reason  :<n><n>There is only one option that is correct. It is D: 2 <n><n>The first thing to address is the units being assigned to 4 and 6. The answer needs to be in the form of a fraction. So the only option that will work is one that includes the numerator "2" in it (D is the only option that includes it). <n><n>Next, we need to calculate 4 ÷ 2 (the numerator in the denominator), which will in turn translate to 4 ÷ 3 (the numerator is halved, we just need to deal with a two digit numerator)<n><n>This equals 2.<n><n>Thus

Choices:  A: insubstantial B: massless C: dwarf D: inconsequential E: good<n>Output:		Reason:If a building is constructed poorly, it could be any of the options C, D, E. <n>B and A are not an option as it is only a building and not capable of being constructed poorly. B and A both have opposite context of construction.<n>C, D and E all of them connote negative, poor construction.<n>So the correct answer is option D: inconsequential<n>Input:What makes a bicycle different from the car? Choices: A: wheels B: both wheels C: one wheel D: none E: tires<n>Output: Reason is : The wheel is an essential part of a bicycle and is also a component of a car. A bicycle has two wheels and a car has four wheels. So we can see a bicycle have no wheels and a car can have two wheels and so an option C, D, E would all be possible. All the other three options (one, tire, difference) indicate that only bicycles has wheels and not cars because cars have tires. Option B is wrong because it doesn't indicate which one makes it different but rather just states that a bicycle and a car has wheels and so is not possible.

Choices: <n><n>Input: Why was there no internet in the lab while performing the experiment? <n><n>Output: The electrician was busy with a bigger problem in the lab, so she could not deal with other problems. She was more likely to say that she need bigger problem first. If the question was why isn't there any internet, the other options would still likely be true for her.

Choices:  A: agreement B: to fill their time C: discomfort D: misunderstanding E: learning about<n>Output:		Reason: <n><n>The answer to this question can be found in the following scenario:<n>One day, a woman who used to play basketball as a kid walked past a child and decided to say hello. When an adult heard the conversation, they interjected to inform the woman that they should probably not talk to kids as it is dangerous. Then, after the child was picked up by her mother, the woman and the adult began to talk about the dangers of the past for kids who used to play ball. At what point did talking turn into an activity to continue? By the adult's interjection of "danger." This implies that the conversation was no longer about basketball but about danger. The activity of talking had shifted from a form of entertainment to a form of learning, thus necessitating the woman and adult to continue talking about the topic of danger.<n><n>In this way, people are likely to continue talking when discovering something new because talking was not an end in itself but rather a means to learn something. This learning motivation outweighs the desire to keep speaking for its own sake, which could be satisfied by other means such as walking or meditating. It is this discovery of new information during talks with friends that prompts the continuation of such conversations.<n>So the final option is D: Learning about<n>

Choices:  A: sleeping longer B: getting cold C: death and decay D: change of color E: stop breathing<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Here, the first important task is to determine exactly what each option means, before making an assumption of that option's relevance. For option B (getting cold) and C (decay), the relevant part here is the "feeling"; and since the scientist feels herself "doing" them, the options are out of scope.<n><n>For option D (change of color), the relevant part is again "doing", which is out of scope once again.<n><n>The relevant part here is death and decay -- how is she feeling it? -- which eliminates option C.<n><n>That leaves us with A (sleeping longer) and E (stop breathing). A clearly relates to the feeling of time passing for Janet, who is clearly not moving. E seems out of scope and also doesn't fit with the text.<n><n>Therefore, the most appropriate choice here is E: stop breathing. <n>So the final answer here is E: stop breatheing<n><n>Input: The woman was in shock. Her body had been changed by her traumatic experiences. Janet had undergone a drastic change and was looking for what? Choices: A: a new dress B: a new lover C: a new car D: a new partner E: a new hairstyle<n>Output: Reason<n><n><n>The important first part to note in this case is that Janet's body had "been changed". How can her body be changed? There are multiple possibilities for that, which eliminates all the irrelevant ones. <n><n>Now it's time to determine the exact change she's experienced. Let's read the question again:<n> <n> <n>"Her body had been changed by... traumatic experiences."<n><n>That brings us to the conclusion that her body has been changed traumatically. What does this mean? Trauma can result in many bodily changes, but her feeling of time passing suggests otherwise. <n><n>Now let's go all the way backwards:<n><n>Janet is in shock. How?<n><n>"... by my traumatic experiences, by my...".<n><n>The relevant part of this question is "traumatic experiences", which eliminates options B and C (no lover or car can be traumatic experiences, they're external factors). Choice A is also out of scope, since "new dress"

Where might she look for one? Choices:  A: house B: music shop C: studio D: storage E: closet<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n>We can cross off the wrong choices. <n><n>There are a few different choices: "House" (B), "Music shop" (C), "Studio" (D), and "Closet" (E).  <n>Of these, which is the right one?<n><n>Looking back to how the passage was stated, we can see that James' house is probably not the place Alexa is considering. The statement says "so she decided that she should" (emphasis ours), but if they were currently in their house, their house would be the place to go look.<n>If Alexa were in a music shop, the passage would say "Music shop" or "She decided to go to the Music shop" or something similar.<n>More broadly, if the location were the studio ("Studio"), the choice would probably also have a "studio" at the start or end of the sentence.<n><n>One choice, closet, could be correct if Alexa's closet was a place where she kept musical equipment. However, this is probably an unlikely place; closets are often used to keep clothes, not musical instruments.<n>This leaves just two choices: house B and music shop C. Although the wording of this phrase doesn't appear to be overly specific, the house, it seems, is the only other option.<n><n>so the final answer is B: house<n><n>Input: What’s for dinner tonight?

Hamburger is one of the most well-known lunch foods.  Hamburger is also one of the most common dinners for Western homes.<n><n>Option E could also be pizza.  Pizza is a common dinner choice. It is also more likely to be the chosen option based on the wording of the question, as it mentions a specific food (e.g., "What's for dinner tonight?"), while the alternatives are more vaguely described (e.g., burger

Choices:  A: complete sentence B: feel angry C: drink tea D: cross street E: park<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Option "feel angry" (C) may apply when a large amount of money is stolen but in general, that would not be sufficient evidence to indicate that the person would become angry.<n><n>Option "cross street" (D) seems appropriate when someone is feeling upset or angry, but not in this case.<n><n>Option "park" (E) is also unlikely to occur when someone has lost money.<n><n>Then, it's obvious that someone may drink tea, but the choice "drink tea" (B) is too generalized to provide information about what happens to a person whenever he or she loses money.<n><n>Hence the answer "complete sentence" (A) is most suitable.<n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Glass that hasn't been treated to be extra strong is what? Choices:  A: weak B: fragile C: forceless D: regular E: flimsy<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>By applying the rule of elimination once more, it's possible to come up with all viable options. The terms "weak" (B), "fragile" (C), and "flimsy" (E) are all commonly used to describe glasses that haven't been treated to have maximum strength. Therefore, in this case, "weaker" (A), "less-strong," (D), and "regular" (E) would be accurate answers.<n><n>However, the term "forceless" (C) wouldn't be considered a plausible outcome in any situation. It is not at all related to glass, which is the central object of concern in the question. "Forceless" also doesn't describe an improvement of strength, as the key is to find a solution that would make something stronger. So "forceless" would be the wrong answer to this question.<n>

Choices:  A: surface of earth B: rest area C: supermarket D: state park E: garden<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first step is to determine the context of the question, in order to eliminate unnecessary options. <n><n>The first two possible choices (A, B) relate to natural landscapes, so they are quickly dismissed.<n><n>In order to come up with the correct answer, we need to pinpoint the "thing" that needs to be sold at the roadside stand. This leads us toward choosing "grass" as the best guess. Choice "supermarket" (C) would indicate a supermarket as the "thing" to be sold, but we can quickly dismiss that because the question isn't referring to supermarkets.<n><n>In order  to come up with the answer, then, we need to rule out everything that can't sell grass and identify the best possible guess about what can. With those considerations, the only correct answer, then, would be "garden" (E).<n><n>Input:Can an owl survive in the desert? Choices: 	A: yes B: no C: may be D: probably<n>Output: Reason <n><n><n>The first step to answering this question is eliminating two answer choices with no possible relevance to it.<n><n>Answer choices "may be" (D), "yes" (A), and "probably" (C) are not directly relevant to the question at hand, which centres on the environment and survival habits of owls. These three answer choices would be better applied to different scenarios and wouldn't be fitting for the given question.<n><n>The only possible answer is "no" (B). Owls aren't desert-dwelling animals and would therefore immediately die should they find themselves in a desert. <n><n>Input:What should I do when an employee doesn’t show up for work and I need to get a manager? Choices:  B: call someone A: talk to them C: ask someone else D: leave a note<n>Output: Reason<n><n><n>The first way to eliminate option A is because you're the employee, not the manager, there is no need to "talk to them."<n><n>Next, eliminated option B is also not relevant and unfit for this question because there are no details provided about what needs to happen to an employee who doesn't show up for work.<n><n>The final two options can't be ruled out as irrelevant but they

Choices:  A: complimentary B: inelegant C: ocean D: dull E: inaccurate<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>In the instructions, we are presented with a situation in which an engineer has been given an assignment. As the next step, the engineer must complete that task. The options given are the different ways in which the engineer's performance might differ from ideal behavior.<n><n>Option "complimentary" (A) clearly doesn't fit here — the word 'complimentary' typically refers to something which is free, or of low cost.<n>Option "ocean" (D) is also not applicable, because this word typically refers to a vast body of water. <n><n>Option "dull" (B) means inattentive, or uninterested in something. Here, since the engineer is supposed to complete a task, 'dull' doesn't fit the context.<n><n>Option "accurate" (E) is most closely related to the task at hand. 'Accurate' is defined as "consisting or being of known or guaranteed accuracy; exact." The engineer has been given a task to complete, meaning the engineer will be graded on his performance of this task, so it only makes sense that accurate would be the best choice for option (E). Moreover, this type of accuracy is important in engineering, where precision is essential to project success.<n><n>So the answer to the question is (E): accurate.<n>

This immediately suggests that their remote might be a sentimental or emotional item for them, rather than a purely functional piece of equipment.<n><n>Another piece of information that is relevant is that remote is likely to feel about their. This suggests that they have an emotional connection with their remote, and may view it as more than just a tool.<n><n>Finally comes the key question: how is someone who loves there TV likely to feel about there remote.<n><n>Option A: attached. Does this option pass the test? No, because this option is a matter of taste or preference, while the prompt explicitly asks for an emotion. So this option is out.<n><n>B: nostalgic. This is a strong candidate, as it describes an emotional memory - a sentimental feeling about an object. This option gets a full pass!<n><n>Next choice C: companionable. Is this option a possibility? It is not relevant to the context. And what does this even mean in this context? In fact, option C passes the test here too.<n><n>Last option D: likely. Well - this is not a good option - this kind of language does not fit the context. This option receives a pass though - no problems here.<n><n>Now it gets tough - choice E: close. Let us go back to the contextual clue - someone who loves their remote - this must suggest emotions of some kind.<n>We don't know what kind of attachment is in play here. And then comes the problem here - this is really a subjective thing: close, in a philosophical sense.<n><n>But we already know this isn't a philosophical sense, because the person is asking about their TV remote - so it is close in terms of practical use! This is the answer - option E: close
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The camper looked up at the vast night sky, it left him feeling mighty what? Choices:  A: unimportant B: insignificant C: stellar D: somewhat E: helpless<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first instruction tells us that the camper looked up at night sky, and the next instruction tells us how that affects him. <n>The option "unimportant" (B) is misleading, since the camper clearly felt that the sky was enormous and vast, so he's "not unimportant" at all.<n><n>The option "stellar" (D) is also misleading, because it's not an adjective that can describe a human being.<n><n>The idea that the vast sky left the camper "helpless" (E) is also strange, since the word is more associated with a person's inability to perform certain tasks, and it is certainly inappropriate in this particular scenario.<n><n>The next choice, "feeling mighty" (C) is a possible word combination that is not actually used in the passage, but the idea that it is used is not correct. It is therefore excluded.<n><n>The remaining choice is the best choice, since it reflects the actual feeling of the camper and describes it as a feeling. So the final answer is C: feeling mighty<n><n>Instruction:  Answer the following multiple choice question:<n><n>A: The old man felt overwhelmed by the beauty of nature, and realized that he had a lot to learn about himself.<n><n>B: The old man stared up at the sky, awed by its vastness. He began to reflect on the journey that had brought him there and felt a great sense of accomplishment.<n><n>C: The old man looked up at the sky and was struck by its magnificence. He marveled at nature's beauty and felt a deep connection to the cosmos.<n><n>D: The old man stood speechless amidst the splendor of the Milky Way, as its twinkling lights danced across the sky. He was overcome with a profound sense of connection to the universe and felt humbled by its beauty.<n><n>Output:The above sentence is grammatically correct but logically erroneous. As no information regarding the person who stands speechless is provided, the answer cannot be C, D, or E. Thus, the correct answer choice is A.<n>

Choices:  A: boredom B: patience C: time D: teachers E: inspiration<n>Output:		<n>Reasoning:<n><n>This is another question that requires a narrow range of options to be selected from.<n><n>Option "patience" (B) and option "time" (C) are both very vague. Patience sounds like something difficult that is achieved only after trying several times, making it more likely to be the reason the children are not learning. Time only conveys that it takes a certain amount of time or effort to instruct children. But the scenario gives no reason to believe these are the obstacles to the children's education.<n><n>Option "teachers" (D) is plausible because instruction usually involves teachers, but it's vague in that it doesn't specify who the teachers are teaching.<n><n>The only option that fits every part of the context, the purpose of the instruction and the reason the students are not learning is "inspiration" (E). To properly instruct a child, the student must be inspired to learn, thus eliminating options of "boredom" (A) and "patience" (D).<n><n>So the final answer will be E: Inspiration<n><n>#include <bits/stdc++.h><n>using namespace std;<n><n>void getInput(){<n>	string text, word;<n>	cin >> word;<n>    while(text!= word){              <n>        text = word;              <n>        cin >> word; <n>    }<n><n>	cout << word;<n>}<n><n>int main(){<n>    int total;<n><n>    getInput();<n>    cin >> total;<n>   <n>	vector<string> v(total);<n>    int ans = 0;<n>    string s;<n><n>    for (int i = 0; i < total; i++) {<n>        cin >> v[i];<n>		getInput();<n>	<n>		ans += v[i].length();<n>    }<n>    cout << ans << endl;<n>	return 0;<n>}<n>

For these people, the mere existence of gods does not mean anything.<n>If we look at this issue of the lack of existence of gods, we see that many religious or holy figures will talk about how man is inherently a bad person. In fact, some of the more extreme examples of gods in most of the religions would have the effect of making people very nervous, as well as leading to some serious consequences that some might think as cruel. The reason that most people may not be atheists is for this simple reason: being atheists would be the absolute worst place to be in life. In fact, by being atheists, it would mean that the world would have no way of improving itself. This is just as bad as the many evils that many religions may believe are inherent to the world, and is a fact that only seems to apply to those who are atheists.<n>The lack of a god is a negative fact to life. In this way, it would simply be better if no human had this bad fortune of being atheist, or that they at least could turn to another god or a set of gods if such a thing were possible. <n><n>It is important to note that this answer applies only to those individuals who are fully aware of the negative aspects of atheism, but still wish to be atheists for some reason.<n>Input: The person is getting wet, what did he want?

Choices:  A: coal or wood B: fire C: lava D: house E: solar energy<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Here we should first determine the context of the question, which is what type of chemical reaction. In this case, combustion is the dominant type of reaction within the scenario, so there are a few options to choose from, either "fire" (B) or "combustion" (C).<n>These are both valid options, but we will continue with the first part of the question and look at the common source - which is where coal or wood is needed.<n>This choice makes sense, as coal and wood are common types of fuel that burn easily to produce heat.<n>But what about "solar energy" (E), though a renewable energy, is not a chemical reaction and not the common source needed to light a fire, therefore this option is not valid.<n>Moreover, "house" (D) - again this is a good point, but it is not common to use this as a source to light a fire.<n>Therefore the correct answer is "B" - fire<n><n>Input:What is the most common method for obtaining the necessary nutrients and minerals in the human body? Choices: <n>A: food <n>B: pills <n>C: exercise <n>D: air <n>E: sunlight <n><n>Output: Reason<n><n>Here, we look at the type of food to gain more nutrients. So, the first thing is to determine which nutrients we need in our body and then look at what kind of foods contain these nutrients.<n>Since the answer is "food", so you need to know what kind of food to eat for the nutrients that you need.<n>After knowing what kind of food to answer, you determine the food that contains these nutrients, for example, cereals, fruits, or vegetables.<n>Therefore, A is a valid choice, but be prepared to check for other reasons!<n>But what about other options?<n>What about exercise, does it contain the nutrients need (C), and what about air (D), does these nutrients in our body?<n>For exercise, this option is not valid because exercise does not contain the nutrients that the human body needs.

When the fighting started, he only saw what sort of things? Choices:  A: fort B: orphans C: battlefield D: other countries E: war<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question states that John joined the army out of a desire to see the world. Thus, he likely had higher expectations than simply seeing the warring countries.<n><n>The phrase "When the fighting started" implies that the question is asking about the specific things John saw while he was actively engaged in combat with the enem,<n><n>The options A (fort), C (battlefield), and D (other countries). <n><n>Option "other countries" (D) is vague, as "other countries" could refer to anywhere in the world outside of the warring countries.  It's unlikely that John expected to see the rest of the world when he initially joined the army, so this is irrelevant.<n><n>Option A (fort) is incorrect because it suggests a limited scope of interaction with a single location. Also, the phrase " When the fighting started" implies a state of war, which is incompatible with a situation in which he doesn't have an armed enemy to fight against.<n><n>Option "battlefield", similarly, is also incorrect because it is the only place where John would be able to engage in armed combat. While it's possible he could see the surrounding battlefield prior to combat, it's more likely that he was actively involved in the fighting where most of the other soldiers were.<n><n>Therefore, the final answer is C: battlefield<n><n><n>**Input:John joined the military because he hoped to see  what other than fighting enemies?  Choices:  A. the world B. the people C. combat death D. the beautiful countryside E. peace <n>Output: Reason<n><n>The question implies that John initially joined the army out of the desire to see more than just enemy combat, so choices A (the world)-D (death) are incorrect as these each refer to a single place of interest. <n><n>It's reasonable to assume that a soldier joining the military will typically have an interest in combat, so options B (people) and E (peace) would both be uninformative.<n><n>Therefore the final answer choice is C: combat death. <n><n><n>**Input : The company spent most of its money on what, in  order to keep everyone happy?

Choices:  A: liquidated B: own resources C: branch out D: commit crime E: game over<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The scenario involves a bankrupt company, and "liquidate" (A) is the precise opposite of what happens to a bankrupt company. As a consequence, "liquidate" can be excluded from the options.<n><n>Also, the company either can't "have own resources" (B) or "commit crime" (D) given that it filed for bankruptcy. "Branch out" (C) sounds like it could perhaps be a possible outcome for an organization, but it wouldn't apply in this context.<n><n>Furthermore, "game over" (E) expresses a definite conclusion - that the company is over - in a way that doesn't fit how bankruptcy generally plays out. It suggests game over is literally over, whereas a bankruptcy typically goes through a process. Rather than immediately ending, the company either will continue existing (though in a limited capacity) or it will undergo court-appointed process for an appointed period of time.<n><n>Therefore, out of the options, "game over" feels most inappropriate. "Own resources" is somewhat unclear. While it wouldn't apply to bankruptcy, it's not inappropriate.<n><n>The word "commit" makes one think of crimes. The word "crime" is a word that is used to refer to behavioral problems. Therefore, saying that a company "commits crime" would be referring to the owner's or employees' actions, not the company as a whole. But in bankruptcy, the company itself doesn't commit crimes; those involved in the company, such as the owner and employees, might commit crimes.<n><n>So we are left with one option, which is "game over".<n>So the final answer, <n>> is: E: game over<br/><n><n>Input: which of the following is not a sign of autism?

You should not buy stick to fingers because it is a finger.<n><n>The word B "Stick to fingers" implies that you want to buy stick. The answer is B.<n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Jimmy wanted a beer but his wife was an alcoholic on probation.  Where might he go? Choices:  A: neighbor's house B: bridge C: home D: homeless shelter E: prison<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>In this scenario, Jimmy is a man on the run after getting his wife into trouble by drinking in a bar with her. His situation calls for him to find a suitable place to go, and that would depend on whether he's willing to get back into trouble or if he needs someplace else to turn.<n><n>The first relevant options is "home," which is an obvious choice for Jimmy. It says "home" right in the question, so Jimmy might already have the answer right in his head. If he had the same type of relationship with his wife that he had with a bar, he might try it and get away with it again.<n><n>The second relevant answer choice is "bridge." While this is the most literal option, we need to consider the context and the man himself. Is it realistic that Jimmy would find himself going somewhere with a bridge? The answer to that question is no; he would be more likely to find himself walking on a bridge than heading there.<n><n>Then comes "prison." This is another obvious answer as it's one of Jimmy's last resorts. In a situation where he's on the run, it would be a lot more likely for him to opt for alcoholism than alcohol abuse. Therefore, this is another answer option to consider.<n><n>"Neighbor's house" is again a common choice for people who get in trouble, but it's not very realistic because if Jimmy's wife is intoxicated, she very well might be aggressive and cause a ruckus. The same situation applies to "homeless shelter," where Jimmy might have to get a new place - or even face jail time.<n><n>The only option left is "bridge." With no other answer options left, it would be foolish for Jimmy to try something so random if he was willing to find a shelter and not get into trouble. And the fact that he wanted to find a bridge indicates that he was willing to get into trouble.<n><n>So the final answer choice is bridge.<n><n><n>### Question 1.

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where do kids play with a ball that is concrete? Choices:  A: street B: soccer field C: soccer game D: central park E: pool table<n>Output:		<n><n>The context of this question is that kids play in concrete places with a ball. Since the context invokes the word "with," the answer could be any answer with the word "with." <n><n>Option A is the only option that combines "concrete" with either "park" or "play." <n><n>Option B is the only option that contains "soccer" in it, which doesn't fit the context since there is no mention of anything to do with soccer besides playing with a ball.<n><n>Option C is the only option that mentions "play" without the word "ball" included. It also introduces the possibility of playing a soccer game, but the context states "a ball," so option C is eliminated. <n><n>Option D is clearly not the correct answer, since the context invokes the idea of "a concrete place" that kids play in, and "central park," while a park, is not concrete.<n><n>Option E is clearly not the correct option since the context states specifically that kids are playing "with a ball," and the context suggests that the ball is concrete, and "a pool table," while a table, is not necessarily made of concrete.<n><n>Therefore, the final answer is A: street. There are no other options which could be said to be concrete without containing the word "ball." "Street" is concrete, so this option is the correct choice.<n><n>Input: Where will the person find a cat? Choices:  E: a garage B: street D: home E: central park<n>Output: Reasonings:<n><n>The context suggests that the question is asking where a person will find a "cat." This may mean the location of where they can find a "cat," but since the question is asking to "find a cat," this indicates that the person is looking for a "cat." Since the word "find" is used, it is not describing the actual situation, but rather their desired result - the act of finding a cat. <n><n>Option A can either refer to the cat being stolen, or the cat being owned by the pet-store that the person finds. The specific mention of a "garage" is too vague, and may mean "pet-store" or "garage" where the "garage," is the place they sell or store cats (not sure which). <n><n>Option B, the "street,"

Choices:  A: botanical garden B: doctor's office C: in a sea D: public place E: arboretum<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The ficus tree is a popular choice for office decor, so the "doctor's office" (B) seems like a likely place to find it - even more so than a "public place" (D), as a doctor's office is where one would be familiar with and likely to pass through if searching for a ficus.<n><n>An arboretum (E) is a collection of plants, but it focuses more on the trees. Therefore, it's unlikely a scientist would be looking for a ficus in an arboretum.<n>Output:In which section of the periodic table is potassium (K) found?

Choices: A) 2 ‫B‬) 3 ‫C‬) 4 ‫D‬) 5<n><n>We have only input one solution.<n>Reasoning:<n>**Solution A,** "potassium" is a symbol of atomic number 19, which is in the fifth row of the periodic table. Therefore, the answer is 5.<n>Solution B, "between the integers, 1 and 5," asks "which of the following numbers are..." The answer here would be "these numbers," meaning "those numbers," "those two numbers," and so on. The choices in this case are 1 to 5, which includes the "those numbers." The only other thing to note is that A and B refer to "this and that" - but we can see in Solution A that the number "this and that" refers to 5 and 4. Therefore, the answer to Solution B must be the number between two numbers. This is in turn between the integers 1 to 5. Therefore, the answer here would be 3.<n>Solution C, "between the integers 1 and..." asks which of the following numbers are... This solution requires

Choices:  A: pointed B: bright C: easy D: clear E: acute angled<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>In this question, the options "obtuse" and "clear" are synonyms, so one has to find a meaning of "obtuse" that will be excluded. The word seems to be describing a document that is difficult to understand and has a lot of jargon, while "clear" seems to describe a document that is straightforward and easy to understand.<n><n>Option A: "Pointed" (B) actually fits the description of a "pointed" document which means that the text is meant to hit hard. It implies that a precise, well-stated argument would be present. But this is what we're looking for, which means we can eliminate it.<n>Option C: "Easy" (D) suggests a clear and accurate representation. An easy document is, by definition, a clear one.<n>Option B: "Acute" (D) means acutely sharp, but we need to find an option that describes the document as "obtuse".<n>Option E: "Angled" (D) is a great answer. "Clever" might be interpreted as being "obtuse' but it's not a direct synonym. <n>Therefore choosing E<n><n>Input: Who won the match?<n><n>Output: Reason<n><n>The word "won the match" suggests a game is involved. However, "game" is actually the word "played," as in, "the game was played."

Option "fridge" (A) doesn't make sense because, while a musician could leave a note in the fridge, the fridge isn't where one would likely find sheet music; it's stored in a case.<n><n>Option "a classroom" (B) is eliminated because music teachers often use a binder or folder to store the notebook with sheet music.<n><n>The remaining options are equally plausible. Someone may indicate a melody in a medical chart (D) to provide medical staff with an idea of songs they might use to comfort the patient. <n><n>Option "sheet music" (E) is also viable, as it's typically stored in an folder or binder in a music teacher's classroom. In a similar manner, a music teacher could also keep the sheet music in a folder or binder in their home, or in a file folder in a file cabinet in the storage room of their performing arts department. <n><n>As a result, the final answer is E, indicating sheet music, is a likely note to find in the right locations to indicate a melody.<n><n>Input:What was the inventor searching for when he made this invention?

Hence, the options that we have to choose from are <n><n>A: frustrated  and C: in line<n><n>Now, we can eliminate all answers but D and finally answer the question as D: Irritation.<n><n>Input:If you are travelling between city A and city B, which route yields the most travel time and distance? The first choice, the first option yields the most travel time B? <n>Output: Reason<n><n>You just have to determine who yielded? Does it mean the person gave something? Or does it mean that they’re the biggest part in a relationship or something?<n>So lets check out all the options.<n><n>A: The route yields the most travel – This doesn’t make sense grammatically. You wouldn’t say that the route yields the most travel. <n><n>B: The first choice, the road yields the most travel time – The word yield in my sentence means ‘is or becomes’ – so it must be a noun. When we say road, we are saying ‘route’. So we are saying that route yields, or is or becomes the most travel time. This means it is the shortest and fastest route.<n><n>C: The route yields the shortest travel distance – This makes no sense. The person that yields or is/becomes the most travel time, is the road. So the distance would be the shortest distance on the trip.<n><n>D: The road yields the shortest travel time – This doesn’t actually make sense and doesn’t make any sense log
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The child pounded his mitt in excitement while enjoying his first game in the bleachers where? Choices:  A: football stadium B: laboratory C: baseball stadium D: pharmacy E: soccer game<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Although we know the child is in a baseball stadium, the options in this question are quite confusing.<n>The child’s excitement could come from attending a baseball game, but the word “game" means he went to the stadium to cheer on the action.<n>Likewise, he “sang, laughed, and pounded” throughout the “game.”<n>A “stadium” in a school is where football games are played, so B is ruled out.<n>The pharmacy is a store that a child could go to in order to get a medicine, but there’s nothing that would indicate the child is sick in the question.<n>C is eliminated from these factors and D is eliminated from the context of the question, since a child can’t go to a pharmacy alone and buy medicine, he most likely has help. That would be A.<n>

Which option is the best choice of packable food? Choices:A: sushi B: tuna C: pork sandwiches D: chips E: french fries<n>Output Reason: In my opinion, packable food must be easy to consume and transport to the hiking location. Sushi (A) is extremely difficult to eat in the field, while tuna (B) can't be eaten alone and must be accompanied by bread or a roll. The sliced meat in sandwiches (C) can be messy to eat, and french fries are too heavy. Chips might be too simple, and it's doubtful that they'd be packed. In my opinion, the food that would be most suitable would be C: pork sandwishes.<n><n><n>Input What is missing in the following sentence?<n>The boy's favorite song was "The Sound of Music," which he found peaceful and relaxing.

The context seems to be a comic book or story of supernatural characters, where the main character (here, your uncle) has a twin brother named "Duke" who has some super powers.<n><n>But the options are all related to family members - and while this question might be describing a fantasy world, this context isn't a supernatural world. It's clearly just a regular world with the uncle, the twin and their families.<n><n>However to answer the question correctly, you need to apply some lateral logical thinking, and eliminate some options.<n><n>We assume that the two brothers have different mothers; one brother is a nephew and the other is a cousin.<n><n>So now, if we eliminate the "family of the double" answer(B), we've narrowed down this to being either a father or a mother of the double.<n><n>However, we have to rule out both of these, for other reasons.<n>* The choice "father" (A) doesn't fit the "double" context.

These places are usually used for storing materials.<n><n>Moreover, "large city" specifically talks about a city and its people; and "building" states being built, which suggests a building-like or house-like construction.<n><n>The options that do not align with the context are "strip mall," "shopping mall," and "aquarium." None of these places seem to be particularly relevant to the purpose of storing and preserving damaged items.<n><n>Thus, the most accurate answer would be between A & C.<n>Suggestions:<n>Even if you don't know the answer to the question, you can try your luck by typing in the options A, B, C, D, or E (one by one) and checking the output of the correct answer, and the corresponding hints and explanations. Do not go to the hint page to check the correct answer.<n>This is because even if you do not know the answer, you can try by typing by yourself.

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What would release energy, but not mainly in your muscles? Choices:  A: vent B: think C: shouting D: work off E: exercise<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question requires us to identify what the energy source is that will not cause the primary effects of work, heat production and physical movement.<n><n>The option "shouting" (C) would cause physical exertion and sound production. While this may seem unconventional, shouting is in fact a form of exercise, and uses energy. <n><n>The choices "work off" (B) and vent (A) are also incorrect, as these would cause the body to expel energy, not store it as energy.<n><n>Finally "exercise" (E) would cause an energy expense, resulting in heat production and physical movement of the body. <n><n>Hence the final answer in the question, is E: exercise<n><n>Input: Which letter represents a positive integer that's more than 1 but less than 10? Choices:  E: X  H: B  D: P B: C  C: F J: A X: I<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>The question is asking for which integer is more than 1 and less than 10 inclusive. However, the word exclusive is missing, and as a result the options provided are incorrect. <n><n>A = 1 B > 1 C > 10 D < 10 H > 1 I > 1 J < 10<n><n>Hence the answer is C:F and E:I <n><n>Input: Which of these does not involve electricity? Choices:  D: Cooking E: Reading F: Walking J: Using elevators B: Watching TV G: Walking up stairs C: Writing by hand A: Drawing C: Computing<n>Output: Reason <n><n>For this question, the answer is "Drawing" (E) which is a hand-drawn image or art piece. <n><n>There are three options which include electricity in their processes, namely (D) Cooking, (F) Walking on Elevators, and (J) Watching TV.<n><n>"Computing" (C), involves the use of a computer, but computers do not require electricity to function. Computers instead operate with binary code, which transfers electrical signals from their components. <n><n>Finally, "Reading" (D) does use electricity as an energy source - a light is required to allow

Choices:  A: school B: office building C: house D: hotel E: centre<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>When given this prompt "He had a hard time," we must first figure out that he has difficulty with something, and then what that difficulty is.  If he's having difficulty finding the room, that indicates he is lost and looking for the room.<n><n>The next step is to figure out where he is. Our instinct might be to guess the name or address of a building, but that doesn't fit the sentence's "he got lost in the very ____."  Therefore, we can be confident that he's in a building with many floors, because he "got lost in the ____."<n><n>What could possibly be very large in a building with many floor? The most natural answer is "_____.<n><n>In conclusion, the answer is A: school <n><n>Input:Why is it called a screw instead of a screw?

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What is likely to be the goal of telling many people about a new organization? Choices:  A: accomplish B: learn about C: money D: notoriety E: religion<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>This question is similar to Option A, where one should think about the context of the question as well as the purpose behind the act of sharing information.<n><n>Firstly, what's the likely outcome of telling a lot of people about a new organization (D)? Well, option D is "notoriety." But in a business scenario, the goal isn't to be well-known just for the sake of it - there would be some underlying motive, like bringing business into the company or getting more clients. Also, promoting a new business venture or product often involves spending money on advertisements and outreach programs, so it likely won't be free either.<n><n>Now let's think about the purpose of sharing information. The scenario indicates that the individual was "likely [to] tell many people about a new [business] organization," suggesting that telling people isn't the primary goal. This eliminates the option of "learn about," which focuses on the process of gaining information. So what about the other options?<n><n>Option "money" (C) makes sense as a purpose behind sharing information about the business, but it doesn't fit the wording of the question. The goal of making money does not specifically involve sharing the information - it involves taking action based on knowledge. The person could simply keep the information to themselves and use it to their advantage. <n><n>Finally, option "religion" (E) doesn't make sense at all in a business setting. It is an unrelated topic that doesn't fit the scenario. So that leaves us with Option B (Accomplish) as the correct answer.<n>Input:What is the purpose of studying something? Choices: <n>A: entertain B C: learn more about C: to know about D: have more fun E: to teach others<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>The main goal of studying something is to learn or gain knowledge about the subject matter, which eliminates the incorrect options "have more fun" (D) and "to know about" (C). Also, the verb "to know" in option C is present tense, which doesn't fit the context of the question or the meaning of the term "studying."<n><n>The phrase "to learn more about" (C) lacks a specific subject matter, so it can be eliminated. Finally, option B ("ent

Choices:  A: get hungry B: laughter C: injury D: having fun E: feeling happy<n>Output:		Reasoning : <n>The first task is, again, to understand the context and overall meaning of the question. The answer choices focus on the action of playing aggressively.<n><n>Option "having fun" (D) is plausible but inaccurate on further examination.  This would not characterize an aggressive person, because aggression is often an opposing trait. It also lacks specificity - where are they having fun? How is it aggressive?<n>Option "injury" (C) seems to be the most logical choice, as it pertains to the playing field. However, as the answer choices were multiple choice, only one choice can be correct.<n>The remaining answer choices "feeling happy" (E), "laughter" (B), and "getting hungry" (A) seem unlikely, because laughing and feeling hungry do not imply aggression. The answer choice "being injured" (C) is too narrow, and does not cover the other options of incapacitating someone or damaging their property.<n>Finally "being injured" fits the context and therefore is the correct answer.<n>So the answer is Option (C):injury<n><n>Input:What is a good metaphor for a person trying to keep their emotions in check? Choices: 1: being the person in 102, who is constantly running 2: like a balloon getting a sudden burst of air and blowing it out until it’s empty 3: like a drowning person trying to stay above water if it ever starts to lower 4: like a house that is completely unstable and would easily fall if the wind blows too hard 5: like the person in 13 whose room is always flooded<n>Output:Reasonling:<n>The first task is again to understand the context and the general idea of the answers. There are 5 answer choices in all but only one can be correct in a multiple choice question so one will have to be wrong.<n><n>Option 5: like the guy in room 13 whose room would get flooded (A) is an example of the metaphor but the context doesn't fit it. One can be the "guy in room 14" and not be constantly flooded.<n>Option 1: like a person in 101 who is

Choices:  A: finger B: good health C: own family D: friends E: people<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>There's no specific information in the question that suggests it's referring to a person. It's referring to skin, so brown skin is a good guess. However, there are a few scenarios where this answer would be inaccurate. One would be if the question asked about what the person with brown skin "may share" with someone else. In that case, the person would most likely not be a skin.<n><n>The other scenario is if the question asked who the brown skin "may share the skin with". In that case, there are various people the brown skin "may" share skin with, such as friends, family, etc. The best answer would be "own family" (B).<n><n>Output: <n><n>Answer: You are correct. <n><n>Answer from expert:<n><n>Incorrect: A person with brown skin may not always share that skin with a fingernail, it is more likely than not that it will belong to another person.<n><n>Correct: A person may share the skin with their other family member.<n><n>Answer from Google:<n><n>Incorrect : A person with brown skin and a good health can be shared with their friends and family members<n><n>Correct : A person with brown and good health may belong to their family members<n><n><n><n>

Choices:  A: alert B: deep sleep C: drink coffee D: open eyes E: conscious<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first choice, "alert", is unacceptable. The word "alert" suggests the awake person is on the lookout for danger, but it wouldn't imply that a person awake is privy to any relevant knowledge.<n><n>The second choice, "deep sleep", is inappropriate because the person is clearly conscious.<n><n>The third choice, "drink coffee", again fails to capture the essence of being awake. Coffee is generally consumed as a pick-me-up in the morning, when we're already conscious; in contrast, caffeine tends to induce sleep in the evening as it wears off.<n><n>Choice D is "open eyes", which is clearly not required for awake; most of our perceptions occur while our eyes are closed!<n><n>Now it is reasonable to think "sleep" when we are in our resting phase.<n><n>Finally we have "conscious" as choice "E", which is the most appropriate answer to this prompt.<n><n>Input: There are lots of things that we see only during dream because they are this?  Choices:  A : unimaginable B : inconceivable C : illusion D : visualize E : imaginary<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>The first choice is "unimaginable" because it is used to describe unimaginable things. But it can be used to describe many types of things. For example, unimaginable things can be either dreams, memories, nightmares, etc.<n><n>The second is "inconceivable" which is a word used for things that we thought could never happen.<n><n>The third "visualize" is the most appropriate answer because it means that we are able to perceive things that are not there.<n><n><n><n><n>

Choices:  A: lay eggs B: eat fruit C: wrestle D: compete with each other E: draw pictures<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The option, "compete with each other" seems likely as the answer for the race. It is the only one in the answer choices that involves humans competing. The other options all contain elements of human behaviour that could be found in a race, but do not necessarily involve competition.<n><n>Another indication that "compete with each others" is the right answer is that the question implies that humans do something in the race. If the humans were to lay eggs, eat fruit, or draw pictures, then there would be no basis for saying they do something in the race - these would be things happening to humans in a race.<n><n>So the final answer to "What do humans do when they are in a race?" is C: compete with each others<n><n>Input:Which word does not belong to the list of words? Choices: 1. chop chop 2. bang bang 3. bam bam 4. clang clang 5. crash crash<n>Output: A: Bang B: Clang C: Crash D: Bam E: chop<n>Output: Reason::<n><n>The first step is to identify what the word means. This can be done by checking the dictionary or consulting a thesaurus.<n><n>Once the word has been identified, it is necessary to determine why it does not belong in the list. Consider each word in turn and assess them against the criterion of whether the chosen word fits into the list.<n><n>In this case, there are two criteria to consider: whether the chosen word contains any of the sounds associated with the sounds "ch" or "pp", and whether the chosen word begins with a letter (excluding any that may look like they contain numbers). <n><n>It should be easy to eliminate "crash" and "bam" as the word does not begin with "ch" or "p". Meanwhile, it is difficult to argue that "clang" begins with any "ch" or "bang", since neither "ch" or "ban" are at the beginning of the word "clang". For that matter, it also cannot be said that "crash" begins with any "c", since the letter "p" is there.<n><n>That leaves us with two words that do not begin with letter "c" or "b" or with "ch" or a "b", and that is "chop

Choices:  A: solidifying B: melting C: getting cold D: feeling cold E: skin rash<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Looking at the sentence, one can infer that the weather (or at least that near you) is a factor. This narrows down the options to A, B, C, D, and E.<n><n>Option "melting" (B) doesn't fit the context of the scenario, because there isn't anything "melting" near you. Perhaps the ground is getting wet because the sun is out and is causing the water to evaporate, but there isn't anything that is "melting" next to you.<n><n>Option "skin rash" (E) doesn't work, either. If the ground is getting wet, there is a good chance it is raining outside, which would cause you to get wet and not a skin rash.<n><n>So the next best option is "solidifying" (H), because the ground would be getting wet due to rain, and rain is one of the causes for the ground to solidify. And the other options, apart from getting cold as mentioned above, wouldn't fit this context. So solidifying would be the next best answer option.<n>

We can see from the last sentence that the question is asking about "how to" something with "computers," not "how to use" something with "computer" as a noun. <n><n>Using common sense, it's reasonable to assume that "play" is being used in conjunction with "to teach students" (C) and not "to do or perform with" (E). Therefore, option "how to use computers" (E) is irrelevant here and "how to play an instrument" (D) would also be wrong, since it has nothing to do with computers.<n>Option "how to teach students" (C), however, is relevant to the context. It would be a suitable answer.<n><n><n>#### ## Part 5<n><n><n># Challenge 1 : 3 Questions in 10 minutes<n><n>## Challenge 1 : 22 Minutes left<n><n>## Challenge 2 : 3 minutes left

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:If you aren't experiencing curiosity and want to ensure viewing enjoyment, what may you watch? Choices:  A: examine thing B: stare into a mirror C: go somewhere D: hear news E: see favorite show<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Again, it's important to understand the context of a question before delving into specific answer options. In this case, the question is about whether or not one should watch a certain thing. Since it's unclear from the question whether it's describing something good or bad, we first eliminate all the negative options: "examine" would suggest thinking critically about something, while "stare" would suggest fixation. This leaves us with three remaining options, only two of which are relevant:<n><n>B: "go somewhere" isn't specific enough – why and where? We don't need to go somewhere to enjoy something. And "watch news" could also refer to a newspaper.<n><n>C: "go somewhere" could be a metaphor for escaping reality, but again, since it's unclear whether the suggestion is good or bad, we can't eliminate it completely. "go somewhere" seems to be the more sensible option and is left.<n><n>D: "see" is a common word in idioms like "See no evil." But here, it's unlikely it's being used in that context, so that's left out.<n><n>E: "see" is an action performed on something, so that can be eliminated. "see favorite show" would be vague to an unspecified viewer.<n><n>B: "Somewhere" refers to a specific location, so only "watch" makes any sense. "Watch" refers to action, so that's the most accurate answer for this question. So the final answer is B: watch something<n>

Choices:  A: corrupt B: applied C: dirty D: contaminated E: fresh<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The question asks the lab assistant to make sure the sample is pure. But the incorrect options use the word "corrupt" (B), which suggests that the scientist wants the opposite of "pure". Therefore, the appropriate answer is "pure", not "corrupt".<n><n>Input:The lab assistant is now conducting some data analysis, but the data is not looking very interesting so what will he do next? Choices: <n>A: He will quit because he has a headache.<n>B: He will write down some data because the result is interesting.<n>C: He will get more coffee.<n>D: He will take a break and go somewhere.<n>E: He will not answer the question.<n>Output:Reasoning:<n><n>If the lab assistant is not doing anything with the data, then of course he won't answer the question. <n><n>Input:The scientist is always so happy with his results, that she never goes to the bathroom<n>Output:<n><n>Correct Answer is : 2: he would be dehydrated<n><n>Explanation1:<n><n>The scientist is always happy with his results because he never goes to the the bathroom.<n><n>Explanation2:<n><n>He will only be happy with his results if he never goes to the bath room.<n><n>Explanatin3:<n><n>Since scientist always happy because he never goes to bathroom.<n><n>Input: She is waiting for the elevator everyday since morning, but she will never arrive.<n>Output:<n><n>The correct answer is: 3: It's not going to work<n><n>Explanation:<n><n>She is waiting for the elevators since morning but it won't work since the elevator doesn't work everyday.<n><n>Explanaton2:<n><n>She is expecting something, but it won't happen..<n><n>Explanaton3:<n><n>She is always expecting, but never arrives.<n><n>Input: In the dark you lose your vision.<n>Output:<n>```<n>Correct Answer is:<n>```<n><n>1: it's not good enough.<n><n>Explanations for Options:<n><n>1.In the dark you lose your eyes because it's dark, so in the dark your vision is lost.<n><n>2.It's not good enough means that if your vision is not good
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What do you need to have before buying products? Choices:  A: desire B: spending money C: money D: needs E: time<n>Output:		Reason:<n>The first task is sorting out the context of the question and the possible outcomes that could result from the question.<n>Options such as "spending money," "money," "needs" and "time" obviously lack relevance in this case. "Desire," however, may be seen as relevant to what is being discussed since people need to want something in order to buy it.<n><n>The next task, however, is determining what it is that people need before buying products. <n><n>Options such as "money" (C) fit this scenario because they are a type of currency or payment that people need to make in order to acquire products.<n><n>Alternatively, options such as "needs" (E) are appropriate, because before purchasing products, people need to have a need for those products. Having this "needs" is necessary in order to purchase the product because it satisfies the purpose or need for the product (A) in one's life.<n><n>Additionally, we can also discard option "desire" (A), as people will have a desire if they need the product to fill a need in life. It's logical, however, for people to want to buy products if they desire it.<n><n>However, the correct answer would have to be "money" (E). It is arguably the strongest and most logical choice when discussing purchasing products because what it is that people buy generally requires some sort of currency for that transaction.<n>So the final result is E: money.<n><n>Input:What does the name Wakanda represent the African Diaspora? Choices: A: The ancestry that Wakanda and other African nations represent B: It doesn't mean anything C: A place where people are brought to D: The idea that African nations are always in conflict E: None of the above<n>Output: Reason<n><n>Sorting out the context of the answer and determining it's purpose can be helpful when searching for the correct answer.<n>Options such as “conflict” (D), “ancestry” (E), “place where people are brought to” (B) and “nothing” (C) are excluded from the answer. Options (B) and (C) because, in the context of Wakanda, there are not any “places where African people are brought to”, and “Wakanda

Choices:  A: factory B: garden C: supermarket D: garage E: warehouse<n>Output:		Reasonable?  Why or why not: <n><n>Option "large container" (A) is not a proper noun, meaning that it doesn't give enough information about its context. Moreover, it does not describe the setting at all. The entire sentence seems rather vague, which is why we would have to guess that the subject is probably a warehouse, though it could also conceivably be a storehouse, barn, or some other type of building.<n><n>Option "supermarket" (C) is also not a proper noun and does not give enough context, as it only describes the number of containers within the building. This makes it unreliable as an answer to our question.<n><n>Option "big" (B) is also rather vague. It does not give specific information about the settings (as we saw with "supermarket"), rather it only offers a general description.<n><n>However, option "factory" (D) is most likely the correct answer, because it specifically mentions location and gives an overall description of the setting - that of a warehouse.<n><n>So the final answer would be D: "factory"<n><n>Input:There are many ways to teach, but not all are effective in the students' eyes. True or false?<n>Output: Reason: <n><n>Option D is false, because not all teaching methods are effective. There are ways to improve teaching, but there is not a single teaching method that is always superior to the others - thus, none is always effective.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the followong multiple choice question. <n><n>Input: Which of the following should be considered good study habits?  Choices:  A. Reading the book cover to cover B. Taking good notes C. Completing every assignment as early as possible D. Learning the entire textbook E. Taking breaks/short naps during study time.<n><n>Output: Reason that you are eliminating each choice: <n><n>Option A is clearly contradicted by the context of the question (which is about study habits) - not to mention it makes no sense; a book cover doesn't actually contain anything relating to the story, so students shouldn't read it from front to back.<n><n>Option B is also not relevant information, as "taking good notes" can be any type of note-taking - we have no way of knowing whether the "good" in
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Which effect of stress could cause death if not treated immediately? Choices:  A: age grieving person B: heart attacks C: depression D: hair loss E: headache<n>Output:		Reason:<n>The word "effect of stress" suggests that the options provided will be side effects. The option "heart attacks" (B) is unreasonable because this option is likely related to heart problems, which is not a typical side effect of stress.<n><n>The option "depression" (C) should be considered as it is a common symptom of stress. However, while this is a possible side effect of stress, it is not typically life-threatening.<n><n>"Hair loss" (D) is also a commonly known symptom of stress. But, this would not be considered an immediate risk of death. Therefore, this option is also ruled out.<n><n>The option left is "age grieving person" (A). While the term "grieving" is typically associated with death, the wording in this option provides for a possible life-threatenening medical complication. Therefore, this is the correct choice.<n>Input:What can a healthy immune system do for the body? Choices:  B: destroy deadly viruses C: fight off infections  D: prevent inflammation E: stop diseases from spreading<n>Output: Reason answer:<n>As it is related with the immune system, options "B, D" are correct choices.<n>So the final Answer is "prevent" (D) "inflammation" (B)<n><n>Input:Why are some people at more risk of getting colds or flu than others?

Choices:  A: farmland B: neighborhood C: city D: property E: subdivision<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Answering the first question helps us eliminate some irrelevant choices. Choice (E) would be eliminated early on if we already found the answer to the first question, because there is no such thing as a "subdivision yard."<n><n>Next, we have to determine exactly what "tiny yard" refers to in the context of this question. Choice (C) is out, because it's not a yard. Instead, it's an area of the city, not a portion of a specific property. While this is a common piece of vocabulary, such as how someone might describe their job as "the city." Choice (D) is eliminated for the same reason. Choice (B) fits the context because it involves a house. Likewise Choice (A) works because it involves farmland. So the final answer is C: City

Choices:  A: theater B: computer C: opera D: television E: concert<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The answer to this question will depend upon which answer you chose in the previous question.<n><n>If you chose "theater" (A) the answer to this question is "theater." Theater refers to live theatrical performances, such as musicals or plays.<n><n>If you picked "concert" (B), then the best answer is "concert." Like in a theater performance, there may also be a "paper program" at a live concert to provide information about the performers and the songs they will play.<n><n><n>If you chose the scientific answer (E), "better understanding," then the answer you're looking for is "computer."<n><n>Computers are a common way to program, and thus a logical place to find a paper program.<n><n>But, the other options are incorrect. "Opera" (C) is a type of musical performance, but "opera" refers to a particular genre of music and not merely a performance medium in general.<n><n>"television" (D) was the answer to the most recent question regarding a song, not regarding a production program like "paper program."<n><n>Thus, the answer is E: computer<n><n>Input:What is "fractured."

"Broken" is an adjective or an adverb (it describes or modifies a verb).<n><n>"Damaged "(B)" is incorrect. "Damaged" can be a noun or an adjective, the latter indicating that something is in poor condition.<n><n>"Unstable" (C) is another incorrect option. It's not really a word.<n><n>Similarly, "Split" (E) is incorrect. It doesn't describe a "fracture," but simply a cut into two halves as in "split pea soup."<n><n>Only "Fracture" is correct option.<n>

Choices:  A: drinking B: intimacy C: dancing D: happiness E: enjoyment<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>"intimacy" (B) is the correct choice. The question is about the "occasion" that "they were celebrating," which the answer refers to as "intimacy" —an intimate relationship between two individuals.<n><n>"Dancing" (C) can also refer to an occasion or event, but it doesn't describe the scenario described in this question. Intimacy is a more precise description, because it refers to a personal and close connection between two people, which is the key focus of the scenario.<n><n>Additionally, "drinking" (A) and "enjoyment" (E) are both vague, nonspecific options, and "happiness" (D) is too obvious to be the correct answer.<n>So the final choice is B:intimacy.<n><n>Input:There was no indication that the scientist intended to learn more about B) headache because he wanted to do a math problem. Choices: A: headache B) no choice C) math D) no choice E) enlightened<n>Output: Reason<n><n>The scenario described in this question does not necessarily suggest that the scientist is interested in learning or understanding anything specific, but rather that he's performing a simple operation (reading and compiling the data) in order to come up with a particular result. Therefore, option "A: headache" (B), which refers to the effect that learning more about the sample results would have, is likely irrelevant and should not be selected.<n><n>"D: no choice" (D) is a misleading answer, in that it implies that there is no option for "enlightenment," but there are multiple options that could describe an enlightened outcome.

Choices:  A: cabinet B: computer printer C: suitcase D: office supply store E: artist's studio<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Once again, context and purpose are key. It is unlikely that someone would keep a large piece of paper just lying around, since there are few practical uses for such items, and many homes do not have enough storage space to store them.<n><n>At the same time, it wouldn't make sense to buy a large piece of paper from an office supply store, as the purchase would undoubtedly draw attention to oneself.<n><n>The context and purpose suggest that one must visit an artist's studio, where there are usually large pieces of cheap paper stored, to be able to find large papers that are not for sale. This answer is most reliable because it follows the rules of context and purpose.

He would get up in the morning, and then put them in what state again? Choices:  A: upside down B: in motion C: active D: wakefulness E: resthold<n>Output:		Ans E: restholdReasoning:<n>The first part of this sentence is telling us that James is sleeping because his rubber balls are at rest. The next phrase states James getting up in the morning and putting them in whatever state. We know from the context this question was written, a science lab, that whatever state must relate to the state of their bouncing. We can eliminate any'sleep' option (C, E). Only James is asleep. Next, "putting them in what state again" could mean a lot of things depending on the context. In this case, "active" (D) or "wakefulness" (B) both could potentially be plausible since James must get them going again. But they're both vague, depending on the type of activity the rubber balls will do. We need something a bit more specific to choose from.<n>While the previous options all could be used to put the rubber balls back in motion, we don't quite know what that motion is. James is going to "put them in what state again." It must, at the very least, be some state of motion.<n>So the next thing to consider is "active" (D). Is it really "active" when the balls are bouncing? It's certainly in motion, but it isn't a particular motion or action. They bounce and that bouncing is all it is. So active doesn't really apply to the rubber balls in this scenario.<n>Finally, there's "resthold" (A), which is the only option out of four that is actually a state of motion and motion of some action. In the case of the rubber balls it is their bouncing motion. The bouncing was at "resthold" by the time James's sleep was interrupted, and he must somehow get them back to that state of resthold. In other words, these balls have a certain state of motion and James is waking them up to this state.<n>So, the logical choice is "resthold" (E).<n><n>####Instruction:A:<n>The problem's answer choice is "active".<n><n>1. What the "in motion" options mean:<n><n>They are not defined in terms of James's goals or desired state. <n><n>2. Resthold options:<n><n>So here we have "resthold" as used in this

Choices:  A: suitcase B: department store C: safe deposit box D: these twos are not safe way to transport jewellery E: lady's boudoir<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>In this question, the answer is not "department store" (B). This is a safe way to transport valuable items, as long as it is properly secured and kept away from other people. <n><n>Next, you should throw out all answers that involve a specific place - "safe deposit box," "a lady's boudoIR," and "these two are not safe ways..".<n><n>The remaining choices include "suitcase" (A), "department store"(B), and "these two arentsafeways." <n><n>Because it includes all three options (suitcase, department store, and lady's boudoire), the correct answer must be "these two aRE not safe ways". In fact, a suitcase and a safe deposit box are not sufficient for protecting valuable items such as jewelry.<n><n>So the final answer will be "these two"are not safe way to transport<n><n>Input: Which of the following is not a common name for the game "checkers"?

Choices:  A: seaside town B: resort C: ocean D: california E: beach<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n><n>The scenario begins by describing the shore as a home to a fishing industry, suggesting that it was once used for fishing, as opposed to being a tourist destination.<n><n>The question in the input is specific to the former use of the shore, requesting information about what was once home to a thriving fishing industry.<n><n>The phrase "to be home to" implies that what was home to a fishing economy was itself a fishing community. Therefore, the answer must be A: sea shores<n><n>Input: On a clear summer night in the city, one can see which planet? Choices:  Mars Jupiter Comets Neptune None of these<n>Output: Reason :<n><n><n>The second sentence in the input indicates that the planet can be seen on a clear summer night in a city. This suggests that only one planet can be seen on such a night, as it is unlikely two planets would be visible from inside a particular city at the same time. Choice A "Mars" can be eliminated, as the question asks about what can be seen on a "summer night"; because it is visible in winter, it cannot be seen on a summer night.<n><n>The question is very specific to a specific planet being visible only on a summer night, so choice C can be eliminated. Choice E can be eliminated as well since it does not say which planet is being visible.<n><n>The third sentence in the input confirms this conclusion by narrowing down the options to only two planets as choices for the correct answer: Jupiter and Neptune.<n><n>The fourth sentence then makes a definitive conclusion as to which planet is truly visible on a summer night. This answers the question and the correct answer is B: Jupiter<n><n>Input: The town had a population of over a thousand inhabitants and was at one time home to which well known novelist? Choices:  Mark Twain Herman Melville Ralph Ellison F Scott Fitzgerald<n>Output: Reason<n><n><n><n>The scenario makes it clear that "the town" is describing a group of people, so the answer cannot be A and B; these two options give singular nouns, "novel" and "writer," respectively.<n><n><n>The scenario suggests that the town was a place of literary importance; it was once home to one of these four notable writers. This narrows down the answer to choices

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:When someone falls from a mountain it will lead them to? Choices:  A: too much B: act dead C: die D: rush E: explode<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>In order to answer this question, we need to reason our way through each of the available answer choices.<n><n>Option "act dead" (B) is a possibility, but would require additional information. Such answer could be justified if the question provided more details about specific type of fall. However, with this particular question leaving the scientist's motive ambiguous, it's best to eliminate it.<n><n>Next, we look at "explode" (E) in this scenario, but if a person survived falling from the mountain, one would think their body would burst, not explode.<n><n>The answer choice "die" (D) is an acceptable one, which the question doesn't explicitly rule out. The question does note they "fall from a mountain", but not that the individual passes away as a result. In this case, the question simply asks if the person "led them to" a certain outcome, which is why one of the possible outcomes is "die". However, the scientist doesn't say they will definitely die from the mountain.<n><n>The remaining answer choices left can be eliminated, which leaves us with "rush" (C), the most reasonable conclusion from the scenario.<n>So the final choice is C: die<n><n>Input: What is the capital of France A: London B: Rio C: Paris D: Oslo E: Rome<n>Output:Reasonning:<n><n>This question asks about a capital, which can't be London, Rio, or Oslo, because those places are cities, not the capitals of countries. Therefore, A, B, C are all eliminated.<n><n>D, the answer E, is the capital of Italy.<n><n>Finally let's look at the remaining choice E: Rome. It's worth noting that this choice stands out, because no name on the page has an apostrophe in the middle - "Romes" instead - which is why the capital "Rome" is a standout. Because it's the only item that doesn't follow the naming conventions of the others, it's the most correct answer in the end.<n>So the final, correct answer is E: Rome.<n>```<n>```<n>"""<n>import random<n><n><n>class Question():<n>    def __init__(self, question):<n>        self.question = question<n><n>        # Adds an answer string

That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:There was a saucepan used only for marinara, where was it kept? Choices:  A: georgia B: the south pole C: kitchen cupboard D: italian restaurant E: boil eggs<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>This question starts by giving us a set of options to choose from, each one relating to a different location. Because the question is asking about a specific saucepan, it's unlikely that it would be kept in any place other than a kitchen cupboard(C).<n><n>Option "B" suggests that the saucepan is kept at the South Pole, which would be rather inconvenient for making marinara sauce. Although the context of the question has been established as a saucepan used for making marinara, the use of "the South Pole" suggests that the saucepans could be used for making other types of sauces as well, which is why it would require more storage space.<n><n>The answer "E" also contains information to disprove it as an explanation. For instance, "the saupepan could be boiled in this area, but that would require it to be removed from where it's kept and placed in a boiling pan." The answer assumes that the saucepan would be kept in one location and then taken out to be boiled, whereas the question is concerned with its location. Therefore, this answer is invalid.<n><n>Finally "A" is deemed the best choice. It aligns with the context and provides the most correct understanding of the scenario.<n>So the final choice is A: the Georgia<n><n>Input: A number, not 1, is raised to a number, not 1.

E:the sum of the integers between 0 and 1 inclusive.<n>Output:  Answer:Option B<n><n>Reason:It's easier to start by analysing the factors that the result in (B). This way, it can be broken down into subparts to disprove other choices. "The result [in] has 2 as a [factor]" means that at least one of the factors must be 2, indicating that one of the options must be (C) or (D). However,

Choices:  A: nature B: toilet C: computer science D: computer store E: human body<n>Output:		Reason: This question is quite straightforward. The context of the question ("Which of the following is commonly found in a classroom setting?") makes it clear that the context for the question is inside a school building. Therefore, the answer to answer B: toilet would be out of place because it is not usually used in a classroom setting. The same can be applied to options D: computer store and E: human body. <n><n>The options that remain are A: nature which means science; and option C: computer science. While science can have a place in a classroom setting, the choice would not be appropriate since the context is "in a school building." <n><n>Therefore, option C: computer science, is the best response to this question.<n><n>Input:"How do you write in numbers?"

We can only be sure that the listener is someone who is present with the listener. The listener may be passive, i.e. “watching a person hear some sounds”, which will be ruled out as the answer later, or the listener may become a participant by actively playing with the guitar. As it is an “audition” for the latter circumstance, the first part is true and the latter part is false.<n>Listening to music and making music are too general terms and cannot be discerned as the scenario provided is quite specific. <n>Arthritis is not the answer because music audition is an activity and not a disease. Therefore, the correct answer is B: hear sounds<n><n>There is a special type of logic called logical induction. There's one type of logic called logical deduction, but a lot of people use the term deduction to refer to any kind of deductive logic. This type of logic takes something you already know about a subject, called a premise, and infers something about that subject from it. You are then supposed to use the process of logic to determine if said inference is likely to be true. The most basic form would be:<n><n>Premise: All men are mortal.<n>Claim: Socrates is a man.<n>Conclusion: Socrates is mortal.<n>The logician's goal then, would be to try to construct arguments that are as valid as this, that conclude the truth of as many statements known to be true.<n><n>The answer for the 2nd question has been given in the first two lines of your question.

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:James thought that giving the AI a secular upbringing would be the better choice.  He felt that the alternative might have results that were too what? Choices:  A: eternal B: religious C: unpredictable D: holy E: monastic<n>Output:		<n><n>Reasoning:<n><n>Let's go back to the context of the question - The AI that is being referred to here is being developed to assist humans in day to day life. If we're going by the question's wording then the AI has no existing religious beliefs and can only be influenced by the upbringing it receives. If an AI's training was to adopt a certain religion based on its surroundings then that would be a completely different topic.<n><n>Option (A): 'eternal': This is an incorrect answer choice because 'eternal' refers to something that goes on for all timers, which would apply to both a belief system and a secular upbringeing. But secular upbringings come and go, so this is an irrelevant answer option.<n><n>Option'religious': This is definitely an incorrect answer choice because according to the context, this AI is secular, so there's no way it's going to become religious. The second answer choice that isn't correct, is 'unpredictable,' because nothing could be further from the truth. The AI is being prepared to assist humans in their daily lives, which are completely predictable.<n><n>Option 'Holy': This answer choice makes the most sense because this is the closest to religious upbringing. If the AI is raised with a 'holy' upbringing it will be religious and most likely, have a religious outlook. This would contradict the question and the context.<n><n>Option'monastic': This answer choice definitely seems logical at first. The AI would essentially become a monk and have no further dealings with the world. But since the AI is being trained to interact with humans, this is a completely illogical answer choice.<n><n>Reasoning for Final Correct Answer: As stated before,'monastic' may seem like a logical answer at first. As an AI, the idea that we would completely neglect the AI and relegate it to living a solitary life would not only be heartless, but also, a waste of valuable resources. Giving the AI a religious upbringing is illogical as well.<n><n><n><n>Reason for Final Incorrect Answer:  Option 'Religious': Since the AI is being raised secular, the idea that it would grow up religious is the most ridiculous

However, what you were looking for may also mean what you were specifically looking for before realizing that it is right in front of you!<n><n>A) On the floor: The floor is an example of a side of the room, so this answer is incorrect.<n><n>B) On the ceiling: While it may seem impossible for what you are looking for to be on the ceiling, we must remember that what-you-were-looking-for could potentially be a ceiling fan or light fixture. Therefore, answer B is unreliable.<n><n>C) It is possible: This answer is correct, though vague. It is possible that what you were looking for is indeed in front of you, but that does not tell us whether it is actually there or if you are making a metaphorical connection. Since this answer does not specify if it is there or not, the answer is irrelevant.<n><n>D) Behind him: This answer refers to a third party, so we must exclude this choice in this question.<n><n>E) Under the couch: This is the correct answer.

Choices:  A: roof B: corner C: school building D: wall E: cupboard<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>In this section, we will focus on selecting and using context clues from the text to decipher the correct answer to the questions.<n><n>In this question, the carpenter is presented with a difficult task of "fixing a shelf". So far, the carpenter has not identified the problem with the shelf.<n>The only information we do have is that the shelf is showing signs of instability. From this, we can infer that there must be a problem that is causing the shelf to "move" or "sway." <n><n>If we refer to the first definition of a "shelf" as a "narrow horizontal platform, especially one affixed to a wall as a work or display surface,"<n>we can surmise that the carpenter must make some structural repairs to the wall. So, B (corner) is a possible solution to fix "the shelf".<n><n>Similarly, the word "stability" is used to describe a "roof" that has been "supported," or kept in place. So one possible solution to fix the "shelf" would be a "wall" or a "corner".<n><n>However, we cannot definitively conclude if the carpenter should use a wall or a corner to repair the "shelf," as the question does not use the word "wall" or "roof;" it uses the term "shelf." The solution must refer back to the "problem with the shelf" that is "swaying" or "moving."<n><n>The solution is not "wall," "roof," or "shelf" but rather "cupboard." The carpenter could build a "cupboard" at the back of the "shelf" that would secure it into place. So the correct answer is C: cupboard.<n><n>Input: Which of the following would the man be most likely to use on the beach?

Choices:  A: dicks sporting goods B: sporting event C: mall D: sears E: sporting goods store<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Option C, which is the sporting event, is the most plausible one. "Sporting event" can mean any event that involves sports and would necessitate sports equipment because of it. As such, it can refer to a game, competition, or any other organized sporting activity.<n><n>In contrast, options such as "sporting goods store" and "mall" (A) would be considered misleading. While these places do sell sporting equipment or clothing, the fact that the question poses the participants needing sports equipment strongly implies that the equipment would be used outside of the store or mall. Therefore, it would be unreasonable to expect the participants go to these places in order to obtain the equipment.<n><n>Finally option B, "dicks sporting goods", seems to be the most reasonable, but it's missing the necessary specificity that would be needed to adequately describe the location where the sports equipment would be needed. If anything, option C (sporting event) would be more apt based on the situation provided.<n>So the final result is C: sporting equipment<n><n><n>Input: You are at a restaurant and you get ready to order a shrimp po' boy. How can you identify a shrimp that was just butchered? Choices:  (This question was originally not broken up into 6 choices) A: It's on bamboo, which is very rare. B: Its meat is fresh and succulent. C: Its meat is lightly-colored and easy to identify. D: Its flesh is translucent with dark veins. E: Its tail is still pointed and sharp.<n>Output:Reasonning:<n><n>This question contains a tricky wordplay that involves the use of the word "just." In this case, the phrase "just butchered" means killed or prepared for consumption immediately after being killed.<n><n>With this in mind, options C (it is "lightly" colored) and D ("it has dark veins") may suggest that a shrimp is fresh, but they actually refer to specific details about the color and texture of the meat. It is still possible to select either C or D as the correct answer, but it requires a bit more logical deduction.<n><n>Option E, which involves a "sharp" tail, is not what we would expect to identify a sh

Choices:  A: villa B: spacecraft C: hall D: palace E: hotel<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>First notice that the question is, "The small cabin was not (available), so they were (upgraded) to what?" Thus, we can eliminate "C: hall," because this option implies that they were upgraded to a different cabin.<n><n>Next, examine the available options and notice differences in wording. For example, "villa" (B) is different from "spacecraft" (C). This suggests that the new accommodation would be more lavish and extravagant in nature.<n><n>Finally consider that the question has already used the phrase "small cabin," which suggests that it wasn't ideal for their large group. Thus, the most likely response would be a more luxurious option. Since "upgraded" is used in the context of changing to a better, more lavish option, the correct answer is clearly B: "villa".<n><n>Input: One of the most challenging parts of the game is choosing which door to open Choices:  A.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The crab was scuttling but strained when he moved, what was impeding him? Choices:  A: tide pool B: beach sand C: tidepools D: current E: cooking pot<n>Output:		Reason:<n>The first thing to note in this question is the repetition of certain words, which we can look at as synonyms. For example, both tide pools (B) and tidepool (B) refer to the body of water where crabs normally live. The same goes for both beech sand (C) and the beach sand (C).<n>Because of this repetition, they can be interpreted as one answer.<n><n>Then there's a term that's ambiguous. Is it current (D), or current (E). The sentence uses the singular term, which suggests D is correct, unless there are multiple currents in the question. So lets get rid of (D).<n><n>Then there're other words that are used several times, which are impairment and impede. So we know that the crab is having trouble walking. The phrase strained the implications of strained (C). The other terms are impaired (D) or impeded. Because we know he's strained when he moves, so the strained phrase must refers to the crab himself, which are impaired (A) or impeded (D).<n><n>As there's no ambiguity left, the most logical choice is impairment.<n>So the final correct answer is A: impairment<n><n>Input: The scientists in the lab study found something interesting, what was it? Choices: 1. A: more to the point 2. B: a few facts 3. C: a few points 4. D: the right answer 5. E: all of the above<n>Output: Reason In the first sentence, we understand that the scientist had found something interesting. As we do now know what they found in the next sentence, the first thing we need to do is clear up what is a few facts(1), few points(3), the right answer(4) and all of these(5). Then we make sure that we can distinguish A (1) is different from B (2). What we learn from the choices above is that "the right answer" is the same as "the facts" or "the points". So we are left with these options:<n>3. C: a 3. A: few facts 4. D: find the right answer<n>At this point we can see that a few facts are different from the right answer.

Choices:  A: verdict B: judging C: responsibility D: evaluating E: prejudice<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>To understand the question and identify the options that would be the most likely choices of the judges.<n><n>First, we should eliminate choices (B) and (E) since both options are about casting verdicts, which would not necessarily involve careful evaluation.<n><n>Next, choices (C) and (D) both imply responsibilities and obligations. The choice (C) might be a little too general, but both options are about having to provide a result. <n><n>Next, we need to eliminate options (A) and (B) as both choices are associated with giving a verdict.<n><n>As a result, the final answer is A: verdict<n><n>Input: The farmer wanted his cattle to have a diet that was rich in grass, hay, grains, and water. Which of these listed ingredients does he not need? Choices: 	A: cattle 	B: grass 	C: hay 	D: grains 	E: water<n>Output:Reasonin:<n><n>This question requires logical deduction to get to the final answer, so here's a breakdown of the choices:<n><n>To start, we can eliminate choices (B) "grass" and (D) "grains," as both can be found in a cow's diet. Although (D) uses the singular "grain," we can understand it to include many grains since it's an uncountable noun.<n><n>Next, remove (A) "cattel," since it doesn't follow the pattern of the answer choices, which each have a single word.<n><n>Finally we can eliminate (E), as it is a placeholder.<n><n>So the final answer to the question is B: grass<n><n>Input: 	A pig has eight legs, two front legs and six hind legs.

Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The lady was doing a one man show of her tell story, when the show began she did what? Choices:  A: persuade B: slept C: take center stage D: challenge E: speak clearly<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Here, since the word "show" is used, we know that the performer is on stage; the key challenge is to determine what type of activity she is performing. <n><n>Option "sleep" (B) is a potential answer - we know that a show can mean a performance, a presentation, or a performance accompanied by music. In this case, we are looking for a show that doesn't involve music or other media. This implies that sleep is not possible as the sole form of entertainment. <n><n>Options "take center stage" (C), "speak clearly" (D), and  "persuade" (E) all refer to the show being performed and what makes it entertaining. But in this circumstance, it is the "show" (or performance) that is entertaining, not the speaker (as in the scenario in which a person is doing "takes" and "line readings" while being filmed for a movie scene).<n><n>As a result, option "challenge" (D) would be the most appropriate answer. Since a challenge could come in the form of a magic trick, it would be appropriate for use during an illusion while a stage is occupied by a magician.<n><n>Input:  The detective was at the crime scene collecting evidence, he came across a blood stained knife, then he made what? Choices: A: an arrest B: an investigation C: a suspicion D: a conclusion E: an inference<n>Output: Reason to choose the correct answer:<n><n>The first step is to deduce the purpose of the detective's search through a thorough understanding of the question, its context, and word usage. It is unlikely that the detective's arrest (B) is necessary at or near the crime scene- he would take an arrested person to be processed and booked. Additionally, any "investigation" (C) would be a deeper look into the subject of an arrest made by the police. <n><n>Suspicion (D) is also ruled out, as it would require an inferential process prior to making an arrest.  Finally,  conclusion (E), while an inference can be taken to be, is not conclusive, which is why it must be ruled out. <n><n>So, the only two choices left are "suspicion" (D) and "inference" (E

Choices:  A: the roof B: storage cabinet C: car trunk D: retail store E: home<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>We know that the shopping bags are too big for the storage cabinet and that there are no empty seats in the vehicle. So, the shopping bags would certainly have to be stored someplace else.  <n><n>Options C (the trunk) and D (a retail store) would not work for several reasons - firstly, what if the car's trunk were full?  If the trunk was full, then you wouldn't want to store additional items in the trunk.  Also, a retail store, a "home" or a "car trunk" aren't really valid options since they are all far removed from where the car is currently located and therefore don't make sense. <n><n>Finally, there are only five options in total, so only one can be excluded. This is done by eliminating option B (the storage cabinet). This option, like the first paragraph (above), has the issue that the storage cabinet may not be big enough. Since there are no empty seats, the vehicle is filled to capacity and therefore, there is not enough room left to store the shopping bags in the storage cabinet.<n><n><n><n><n><n>

Choices:  A: self pity B: communication C: understood D: pain E: embarrassment<n>Output:		 Reasoning:<n>The first thing is to know what the question is asking. This question is asking you what you are feeling. <n><n>We can start by eliminating options that don't make sense. For instance  "embarrassment" (E) doesn't make any sense - because it would be weird to feel embarrassed about what a bruise looks like. A better option might be "pain" (D). <n><n>Another thing to note is that this question has the word after in it. Since one of the options are yelling, it seems as if the question is asking what the after-effects of yelling would be. <n><n>The last option to consider might be "understood" (C). This one was tricky to eliminate, because it makes sense on its surface, but doesn't fit. Yelling after getting a bruse would probably have the effect of hurting the other person's feelings. But being understood would mean that you wouldn't be making someone else's bruse worse.<n><n>So the final answer will be E: Pain<n><n>Input: What did the king say to the princess<n>Output: Reason:<n>In every programming-related job interview, you might be asked to crack a few Coding Interview questions.

Choices:  A: let down B: respect C: illness D: satisfaction E: gratitude<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Same as the first question, analyze the context and objectives of the question. Here the person is performing favours for everyone at work without receiving an expected return on that investment. That could mean a variety of things, so narrow down until the only remaining choices don't contradict any important facts of the story.<n><n>First let's understand the context. The story says the person is performing favors for everyone at work, which suggests a professional setting. Therefore, "respect", "gratitude", and "satisfaction" should rule out right away (they would generally refer to a familial or social context).<n><n>Next, to pin down what the person expects to receive in exchange for his favors, we can check what the options are that are not being offered. Choice "D: satisfaction" (E) implies the person is satisfied with the work he is doing, so options "satisfaction" (E) and "respect" (D) don't work out. Next, choice "illness" (D) could be a logical choice if the person expects an illness as a return, because then he wouldn't have to work and would still get what he desires. But that would mean the workplace is dangerous and unsanitary, which makes him seem naive.<n><n>Similarly, the person expects an illess as a reward for his favors, so Choice "illness" (E) is wrong.<n><n>Now that only "gratitude" (B) and the correct answer of "let down" (A) are left, the next question is if any facts of the story support the correct answer.<n><n>The story implies that the favors are not reciprocated, so let's check if "let down" (B) fits. The answer does make sense - this situation of being let down and expecting gratitude can be explained by how everyone at work is performing favors only to one another, and not to the person performing the favors.<n>So in the end, the correct answer would be A: let down<n><n>Input:He went back home hoping nobody would notice the large number of stamps on the envelope, the mailman made it obvious he had sent it as far and wide as possible.

Instruction: Answer the following multiple choice question<n><n>Input: What type of businessman would not tell his employees the truth? Choices: 1- A: A liar businessman 2- B: a businessman who was a very smart 3: D: A nice person 4- E: A businessman who likes to do things 5: G: A businessman who knows the facts and the law<n>Output: Reason:<n>Option "A liar businessman" (A) can be eliminated because a liar is someone who tells people something that's untrue or lies. Since these people are supposed to be employees, it can be inferred that they are truthful people. <n><n>Option "A businessman who likes doing things" is also out of the picture since "businessman" is a noun that denotes the manager of a company, which is not the same as a person who likes things. Option "D", "a nice person", is also out, as people who are nice can have the habit of lying, but are not necessarily liars.<n><n>Therefore, the answer most likely is "A nice businessman who knows the law" (G), someone who is a nice person who is well-versed in law and its applications in business.<n><n>Input:  What is more important, a good person or a good businessman? Choices: 3: E: a good businessman 4- F: a good person 5- H: both 6- G: neither<n>Output: Reason The correct answer is "6 - neither" (G), which means "neither is more important". This follows logically from the other options given; it's possible to have a good businessman without necessarily being a good person, and vice versa.<n><n>As such, this choice is a correct answer and answers the question of which of these two qualities is more important. The best answer would be 6 - neither, which means "neither of these qualities is more important."<n><n>##

By examining the options, you can eliminate any ones that are obvious falsehoods.<n>The word "rug" is the sole correct response here. The others are all incorrect because they refer to various types of flooring. The rug is the only floor covering that you could put a table in and would still have the table.<n><n>The table can also go in a bedroom, dining room, or living room. Therefore, the rug doesn't limit you to using it in only one section of the house.<n><n>So the final answer if A: rug<n><n><n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question by selecting the correct answer letter from those given.<n><n>Input:The question was: What is the meaning of “deliberative” and “consultative”? Choices: A: deliberative is "consultative" B: deliberative is "experimental" C: deliberative is "confirmatory" D: deliberative is "analytical" E: deliberative is "procedural"<n>Output: Reasoni:<n><n>There are several different kinds of "consultative" relationships. There are some that are "deliberative" and some that are "experimental". But the only one that fits both definitions is "consultative". Thus, the correct answer is A: deliberative is in fact "consultative".<n><n>Input:A good example of a consultative relationship is? Choices: A. the customer and a salesman B. the stockbroker and investor C. the therapist and patient D. the physician and patient E. the advisor and client<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>The purpose of a consultative relationship, as you've already established, is for one entity to aid another. This could take place in a professional setting, such as a therapist aiding a patient. But a consultative relationship can also exist between those who are not directly involved with a mutual relationship, such as a stock trader and an investor.<n><n>In the question, the term "mutual" is key. It indicates that all four choices have a mutual relationship. Therefore, C, D, and E are irrelevant. Also, D, the word "mutual" seems to

Where might he look for a potato. Choices:  A: restaurants B: casserole C: root cellar D: pockets E: pantry<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Restaurants and casserole are definitely not right, in any way, shape or form.<n><n>The last choice, root cellar, while being a correct answer, might not be relevant here. If James is cooking his stew in his apsrtment kitchen, and he has root cellar, why not use that instead of cooking it? In other words, that option seems to be more of a red-herring.<n><n>That leaves us with pockets and pantry. Which is the correct answer? To discern the most likely answer, it helps to know James' habits. For example, if he has a big kitchen, he might have a large pantry. In contrast, if he has a small kitchen, he might not have a pantry at all. By analyzing that information, it's clear that pantry has a much higher probability of being the answer - because who's going to put potatoes in their pockets?<n><n>So, it turns out that the correct answer is Pantry.<n><n>Input:What is the opposite of hot?

Choices: A: drop to zero Cool down D: dropping slowly E: heat up<n>Reasoning:<n><n>Step 1: Break down the passage<n>Based on the context clues and sentence structure, the given scenario is about a situation that involves weather changes, resulting in different types of temperature. This is evident in the sentence right after option A, in which the author indicates that the temperature  "changed", indicating that the initial temperature had shifted from its original state into something else. This, coupled with option B's reference to a rapid change in the sun's temperature, indicates that the answer choice in question is either B or C.<n><n>Option B seems too simple and obvious; the original option was C, which indicates rapid change. In order to eliminate B, we must evaluate option C: <n><n>Step 2:  Analyze the answer<n>Option C describes a situation in which the temperature is increasing, so this is not correct. <n>Option D suggests "drop gradually", but the original context suggested a rapid change, so option D is also incorrect.<n>The only remaining answer is option E: "heat up". <n><n>Input: I was getting ready for class and I realized that I forgot what?

Choices:  A: grocery store B: nightstand C: armpits D: own bathroom E: medicine chest<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Here, the question seems to be asking what his wife told him to look for, implying that she was at least somewhat concerned that he had run out of deodorant and had to ask herself. However, the options are vague as to what exactly she was asking him to look for. It could be any number of different objects or locations related to his deodorant. Option "own bathroom" (D) might imply that she thought he had simply forgotten and it was somewhere in his own bathroom that she said to look. But it could also be in the medicine chest at the end of the question, or any other object or location that is not explicitly stated.<n><n>The remaining four options are all similarly vague and unspecific. Therefore, the only truly accurate answer is "grocer's aisle" (A).

However, I didn't know how to tune it, and I was embarrassed to ask for help. To compensate for not being able to play it in tune, I often molded my fingering so that the notes I played in tune. But after a couple of concerts, I realized I had to learn the basics of the violin well if I wanted to keep playing for people. So I found it quite motivating to learn the violin." Which of the following statements is a reasonable inference from the information above? Choices: <n>A: It took her a few hours to tune the violin<n>B: Playing the violin without a tuner is not a good idea<n>C: After learning the violin well, she became quite famous<n>D: If I play the violin badly, people can't tell because it usually sounds so bad<n>E: Playing the violinand being out of tune was never a problem<n>Output: Reason<n><n>It is unlikely that the story only took a few hours to tunethe violin (A), as no such information is explicitly provided.<n><n>The next option is not mentioned at all in the text.

Choices:  A: say thank B: smile C: looking for D: get more E: show appreciation<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Again, the first task is to understand how we can interpret what "giving thanks" means. This gives us a clue that the act of "being grateful" is actually a verb - that it involves an action. If it didn't, there's no reason we'd need to know what to do about it.<n><n>The next task then is to parse out the possible purposes behind giving thanks. <n><n>"Saying thank" (A) could either mean verbally expressing appreciation, or writing/typing something that states one's thankfulness. However, there is no reason the question would mention the act of writing, so we can rule that out.<n><n>The same applies to "looking for" (C) as well.<n><n>Options "show appreciation" (D) and "get more" (E) are very vague and unclear. This doesn't fit well with the context of the question or the act of giving thanks.<n><n>Finally option "Smile" (B) - while a good answer for another problem - doesn't fit well here either.

Choices:  A: riots B: vote C: change yourself D: social activism E: change clothes<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>"Social activism" (B), while seeming like a plausible answer choice, it is too general given the choices at hand.<n><n>The word choice "change yourself" (D) is misleading. This answer choice seems to suggest that you need to change who you are as a person to cause social change. This is not the intended meaning, and the answer choice is thus eliminated.<n><n>The remaining choices are "rioting" (A), "voting" (C), and "changing clothes" (E).<n>"Changing Clothes" (E)is too vague, and can either be interpreted to mean a literal change of ones clothing or something else. "Voting" (C)is not the answer, as it is one of several things you can do to affect social change. Finally, "rioting" (D) would not cause a social change. Therefore, the correct answer is "rioting" (E)<n><n><n>Input:In a survey of what some people said they thought they were born because of they were thinking that it was a bit of a problem, what was the result of this survey was it not so much what people thought the result was? Choices:  I: Yes A: They're not so bad B: It's the genes C: It's the environment D: You're right! E: It's both!<n>Output: Reasonings:<n>You can eliminate "A" because that is a common phrase people say to disagree with people when they say it is their fault. To figure out what people thought the result is you would look into the phrase "it's both!" You can immediately eliminate it because it is a common phrase people use to add onto phrases when they mean that there are multiple options. You can also eliminate "D" because you would not use that to respond to people who disagree with your belief.

Choices:  A: heart attacks B: hole in your socks C: exhaustion D: shortness of breath E: blisters<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The scenario invokes a runner and jogging, which implies a lot of activity and exercise - in other words, movement. A runner would be on his/her feet a considerable amount of time, which would lead to a multitude of factors that could affect him/her. <n><n>Option "bleeding" (D), while realistic, does not directly reflect jogging or exercise. While there are indeed risks for blood loss from excessive exercise, this would be excluded from the context of this situation.<n><n>Option "heart attacks" (B), though frighteningly feasible, is unlikely for a person who is only completing a daily (albeit prolonged) run. This suggests that, rather than running and resulting in heart damage, the result is likely to be fatigue-related or muscular in nature. <n><n>Option  "blisters" (E) is also feasible, due to a runner's extended footwear, especially if the shoes or socks are older and/or not properly fitted.<n><n>Finally; option "exhaustion" (E), is most accurate and straightforward among the options.

Choices:  A: farm B: ancient rome C: history book D: poor countries E: plantation<n>Output:		Reason:<n>"Plantation" seems the most fitting response, as the question explicitly asks for a "southern institution" that housed "slaves." The other options are clearly not plausible since they do not fit the context of the question or are not southern institutions. "Farm," for example, seems like a northern institution, as it is used to cultivate crops. "Poor countries" is not fitting, as a plantation is an institution specifically associated with the slave trade. While "history book" is a southern institution, it lacks the specificity of the other options. Therefore, "platation" would be the most logical answer to the question. <n><n>Input: What do you call an object whose color is not determined by a material's composition but by the way the material reflects back light and color? Choices: <n> A: Paint <n> B: Bead <n> C: Artist <n> D: Metal<n> Output:<n> Reasoning: The question refers to an object whose color is determined not by its composition but by the way in which the material reflects back color and light. Option "paint" would be a reasonable choice, since paints are often used to change the color of an object. But it is not the only option that fits the description.<n>Option "bead" has more in common with the question, since beads are not only used to change the color but are also small, spherical objects that reflect light. <n>Option "artist" could arguably be interpreted as having to do with the concept of reflection of color, but its context doesn't align with the question. The question is asking for an object whose color is "not determined by a material' composition," but an artist composition is not relevant when it comes to color. An artist could work on the coloring of an object, perhaps.  Option "metal" seems irrelevant, <n><n>So the final answer options are B and C.<n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:If you're afraid of spiders what should you avoid owning? Choices:  A: meadow B: cupboard C: shed D: mail box E: cellar<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>This question was written with multiple puns in mind. <n><n>The word "box" in "mail box" (D) sounds like "spider" when spoken. This creates a sense of humor and cleverness to the question, suggesting options that include "box," such as "cupboard" (B) or "cellar" (E).<n><n>The word "spider" in "shed" (C) sounds similar to the word "meadow," suggesting that shedding spiders - a form of pest control - would better protect one from fearing spiders. <n><n>The final choice, "cupboard," includes the word "cup" in its name, further enhancing the allusion to spiders.<n><n>Therefore, the correct answer is D: mail box.<n><n>Input: What is better, one loaf of bread, or two loaves of bread, when one loaf of bread is more expensive than two loaves of bread? Choices: 1: 1 2: 2 3: B: Both 4: C: Neither<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>The first step is to decipher each option:<n><n>Option 1: One loaf of bread is better than two loaves of the same bread when one loaf is more expensive than two.<n><n>Option 2: Two loaves of bread are better than one loaf of the same bread.<n><n>Option 3: Both one loaf, and two loaves of the bread, are better.<n><n>Option 4: Neither one loaf, nor two loaves of bread is better.<n><n>Comparing the four options, it is clear that the fourth (C) and second (B) choices are the only ones that are mutually exclusive.<n><n>Then, it is necessary to think about the assumptions. For the first part of this series, the number of options to be chosen must be limited. In this example, two loaves of bread are more expensive than two loafs of bread. In the second option, one loaf is more difficult to choose over the two loaves; they both cost the same. Therefore, the first option can be excluded.<n><n>The answer is B: Both.<n><n>Input: Why do you see the letter “e” most often in English?Choices: 1: B: Most common letter Cho

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:A yard is made up of what? Choices:  A: city B: michigan C: three feet D: subdivision E: three arm span<n>Output:		Reason:If you read the question carefully the keyword "yard",and "yard is madeup of".So we can conclude that a yard is madeup of some things and the options are in correct format.<n><n>The right choice here (B) is Michigan.<n><n>This is a tough choice to answer quickly, so let's dissect it:<n><n>The question asks us to determine which of the options is a "place".<n>So far, all the answers provided are places- Michigan, USA, Chicago.<n>As for the "three feet and a city", it is not an obvious enough distinction to rule it out.<n>One might get it wrong by concluding that "three feet" is a unit of measurement.<n><n>Input:Can You put it in 2012 words? Choices: <n> A:no<n> B:yes<n>Output: Reason<n><n>The best way to think about this question is to first consider alternative choices that should NOT be present in an answer.<n><n>In the first option, it is not an answer, but a complete sentence. Optionally, the response might end with "no," or "yes," but a single word cannot be the answer.<n><n>While option "B" is a short sentence that ends with a question mark.<n>The question mark indicates uncertainty: does the writer expect the reader to answer "no" or "yes"? This makes the answer unclear and vague, so it is not a viable option.<n><n>If we look at the remaining option, "yes" and "2012", neither one fits the bill as a proper response. The first option provides no additional information beyond what is already given in the options.<n><n>The second option simply gives the year 2012, so it is a bit odd to describe it as "rephrasing in 2010 words," as the response could be as short as "yes".<n><n>So, the correct answer is "B: yes," because it is the only option that can be considered a "response" and satisfies the other conditions.<n><n>Input:There was a 80% in the test but there was A: 20% B: 0% C: 0% D: 40% E: 40%<n>Output: Reason Answer: Option D: 40%.Because there was a 40% in the test and the answer

The only two choices that don't seem to "fit the bill" are B and E - neither of them pertain to how a lost child might attempt to get home by walking. So if we eliminate them, the remaining choices are pretty straightforward and intuitive.<n>B is a very confusing and complicated game with very little to do with walking home, so the answer cannot be B.<n><n>Option E seems out of place, because it suggests that the child might get help from another household. This is very likely, but does not imply that the child will be able to find their way home right away. <n><n>Only A, C, and D are possible outcomes for a lost child. Each of these is plausible, and they each have something to do with the child finding their way to home. <n>So in summary, the answer to the question is option C, "wrong house."<n><n>![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62282054/108563391-7eb92f80-77d1-11eb-820a-c789c2a2e422.png)<n>

Choices:  A: arlington B: church property C: out back D: every town E: cemetery<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Option "every town" (E) isn't a single location, so it can't be the right answer. <n><n>Options "arlington" (A) and "church property" (B) both refer to geographic locations. It doesn't make sense to say that the church property, or the church itself is "important to build".<n><n>Similar to "every town" (A), "outback" (C) is not a single location.<n><n>The last option "cemetery" (D) is the only one to refer to a singular location. It isn't even clear what this location specifically means, which can be confusing for some test takers. Though this could be a valid answer, you'd want to avoid referring directly to a cemetery as it sounds too specific for this particular question.<n><n>So the final answer would be D: cemetery<n><n>Input: Why did you eat my ice cream?

Choices:  A: few people B: pay debts C: individual D: single person E: small group<n>Output:		Reasoning:A and D are the opposite of each other, so they can't be right. We must also eliminate D, since you can't have just a "person," not knowing to whom you are referring. C is possible for single people, like at a funeral, but not likely, since the question doesn't specify whether it's plural or singular. Only E is the correct answer.<n><n>Input:What does "SOS" stand for? Choices:  a) Shortest Overall Distance b) Shortest Overall Solution c) Shortest Overall Search d) Shortest Overall Route e) Shortest Overall Sweep<n>Output:Reason:SOS is short for "Save Our Souls", but you'll get a point if you guess "Shortest Overall Swee". SOS means "Save Our Souls" which would be shortest overall search, thus the answer is A:Shortest Overall Search.<n><n>Input:How did Jack kill time?

Choices:  A: problems B: not noticeable C: deflation D: economic instability E: eat cake<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>An economy suffering from inflation (or other issues, such as depression or recession) can be compared to a sick or injured body part. Inflation is an ailment that can have a damaging effect on the economy, ultimately causing severe consequences. And just like a health issue, the economic downturn can't be totally cured overnight. It takes time and effort to treat the cause and restore the economy to a healthy state.<n><n>The next step is to determine what exactly fighting inflation might cause. Among the options given, only one - "economic instability" (D) - is related to the symptoms of the disease and can be applied to this situation.<n><n>There is no mention of deflation (C) being one of the possible consequences of fighting inflation, while "not noticeable" (B) is the exact opposite of the desired effect. "Eat cake" (E) shows a complete misunderstanding of the cause and effect relationship between inflation and economic stability. And "problems" (A) is somewhat vague, which is why it isn't an acceptable choice.<n><n>Finally after making all these considerations the correct answer is D: economic instability<n><n>Input:What is the reason that some people don’t go to dentist regularly? Choices: 	A: bad oral health B: good oral health C: fear of going to dentist D: expensive prices E: nothing<n>Output: Reason<n><n>First, it is useful to note that the word "reason" in the question can be interpreted as a noun or a verb. Because of this ambiguity, the options do not specify whether they are describing the cause or effect of dentist skipping. For example, some people might have bad oral health but not want to go to dentists because of fear or cost, but other people might avoid going to dentist because of their condition.<n><n>Taking into account all that the four options given. It's possible that people might fear going to dentist, but it doesn't make sense for them to skipping it. Also the answer is costly, which makes the choice incorrect. The answer is B,Good oral health.<n><n>Input:The first time you start playing golf, you might not know which club to keep on the side for playing short or straight the balls, because golf clubs are hard

This is a clear indication that something has changed from when the kids had been previously having fun.<n><n>The remaining options each imply a more positive result than that presented - "wild ride" (A) and "constructing" (E), in particular. However, the word "constructing" is unrealistic - it would not be something that kids would typically create.<n><n>The best remaining option, given everything stated thus far, is the phrase "massive bear" (D). This option is the clearest choice out of those presented, though the phrase may not hold much significance to those who have not encountered many bears. Therefore, a better answer would be the phrase "a bear."<n>So the final answer should be D: a bear.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where would you carry a pen as you go through your day? Choices:  A: pocket B: office supply store C: friend's house D: desk drawer E: city hall<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n>The key to this question is what the asker means when he says "go through your day." While it may sound odd to those in the U.S., the phrase "as you go through your day" might be interpreted as "during your whole day." <n>Things like "school," "workplace," "gym" and "bus" could fall into this blanket category of things you go through your day "doing." If you're a man, another possibility is that you might "go through your day doing chores at home," or "go through your day wearing an interesting hat."<n><n>But a lot of these ideas require movement. It's possible, but unlikely, that you'll "go through your day writing" if you're a writer, for example. The same goes for sitting "on the couch" or "lying in bed" or "standing" or "sleeping." If you ever have the experience of "going through your day talking," you might have been in a boring meeting or perhaps even had a conversation that lasted for an entire day.<n><n>So if you don't spend your time moving, you're more likely to do one of several kinds of still tasks: "reading a book," "looking at a screen," "playing with a dog," "walking a dog," "meditating," "making dinner" or "eating." We can eliminate a lot of possibilities if we rule out anything that doesn't include a dog, but the list of alternatives in the blank is still long and somewhat unnatural in its phrasing.<n><n>If the "city hall" answer is correct, it's in fact the only still-stupid answer, as the one activity here that doesn't include eating is "looking at a screen." And while some of the other answers, such as "doing chores" or "making dinner," might also qualify as still stupid, I don't see how they're actually worse than "looking at a screen" (which we don't do for very much of the day). This leaves us with an answer of "city hall," which is the closest still answer to "office supply store." So, this is not an option you would do with a pen as you go "through your day."<n><n>So the final answer must be B: office supply store<n><n>Input: What did the

Choices:  A: necessity B: answers C: inspiration D: love E: fun<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Once again, we need to examine the context behind the question. We know that the class is having a conversation, so it makes some sense to talk about why they are doing it.<n>The first option is "necessity". If they did not engage in the conversation, they would be missing a vital part of the conversation at hand. It might be said that they would rather be participating instead of missing out on the class learning experience.<n><n>Option "answers" (B) could also be a possible reason for chatting with friends in a class.  Perhaps they are waiting to learn the answers to questions that have been difficult for them to understand. Therefore, it's a vital piece of information that they can't simply turn off.<n><n>Option "love" (D) describes the sentimental side of talking to friends in a class environment.<n>You know many people talk to their friends throughout school hours to brighten their spirits and improve their mood.<n>At least one person talks because they enjoy being around their friends.<n>All this suggests that they may spend time talking because they enjoy spending time with their friends.<n><n>The two remaining options, "fun" (E) and "inspiration" (C), are both valid reasons for talking to friends or participating in a conversation. After all, <n>people often have a chat with their friends in order to have fun, and some people might have a conversation that <n>inspires them in some way.<n><n>So the final answer here is C: inspiration.<n><n>Input: Which answer would you pick if you were going to participate in the marathon for the next 200 metres of the race? Choices: 1: A: continue the race, B: quit the race C: D: E: F 2: a: increase B: reduce C: E: F<n>Output: Reason<n><n>In both parts of the question (input and output), we see that "continue" (a, A, 1) and "increase" (b, A, 2) are both positive words used to describe how an athlete might respond to their state of health during a race. <n><n>Option "quit" (E) or an "I quit" is not something to be expected, if one is going to participate in a race.

Choices:  A: board ship B: shout at C: smile at D: cross street E: feel happy<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option A (board ship) doesn't make a lot of sense in this scenario as it doesn't convey what type of attention you'll receive when you shout at a person across a room.  <n>Option B (shout at) is probably the most reasonable option among this choice set. You can certainly shout to attract someone's attention across a room. <n><n>Option C: (smile at) might also be plausible since smiling at someone can grab their visual attention but it is likely to be interpreted as a friendly gesture and thus not exactly what the person was looking for in answering this question. <n><n>Option D: (cross street) seems a bit far-fetched since crossing the street doesn't exactly result in getting someone's attention. Unless, of course the person you're wanting to attract is waiting on the other side. <n><n>Option E: (feel happy) is the most ambiguous among this set of choices. Feeling happy does imply that the person across the room is happy, but how do you know if someone is feeling happy if you haven't spoken to him or her first?  <n><n>It is important to remember that no matter how tempting it may be to select an answer because it makes sense to you, don't. That would be cheating!<n><n>So the final answer should be B: shouting across the room<n><n>```<n>Input: A train conductor yelled “clear the train!

"the reason"  B. "the same amount" C. "therefore, for now"  D. "as a result" E. "however, otherwise"<n><n>Choice A: "the same amount" (B). The word "because" signifies a specific relationship, and in this question, the word "because" does not equate to "the same amount", even if we were to interpret it as a noun. The word "same amount" would make logical sense if we included the word "amount".<n><n>Let us say we interpreted "because" as an adjective, we could interpret the line of reasoning this way: "...because she is younger, they get more ice cream" - in which "more ice cream" is not equal to "the same amount of ice cream".<n><n>Choice C: "therefore, for the moment" (D). This phrase is an incorrect use of English grammar. Though an individual word out of this phrase may not be incorrect on its own, stringing two sentences together to form one is incorrect.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What is a place that could have tens of thousands of fiddle? Choices:  A: tennessee B: band practice C: orchestra D: violin case E: music store<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>Options "fiddle", "band practice", and "orchestra" all suggest musical instruments, which indicates that the choice for E - "music store" - may be correct. The choice for D - "violin case" - might be more likely than B, since it refers to a specific instrument commonly used in music.<n><n>Let's assume that E or D is the correct answer, and eliminate options that are unlikely to be the actual choice. <n><n>The answer choice "orchestra" (C) should be eliminated since an orchestra would not need a vast amount of individual instruments, but rather just enough to comprise a full ensemble together. There are several possible instruments, for example, 35 violins, 10 cellos, and 13 woodwind and percussion instruments. <n><n>Likewise, the option "fiddle" (D) could be eliminated, since the term is generally used to describe someone who plays the violin. Since the question refers to a place with the potential to have tens of thousands of a specific instrument, it must be the violin, but there are other options besides the fiddle, violin, and viola. <n><n>That gives us our remaining choices between "Tennessee" (A) and "fiddle". In terms of plausibility, a "fiddle" is a musical instrument as mentioned in part D), however "Tennessee" refers to something else entirely. Given the clue of part A, it seems very likely that "fiddle" is not the appropriate answer.<n><n>Hence the final answer is A: Tennessee<n><n>Input: I always thought that a spy was an espionage specialist.

Choices:  "spies" (A), "Espy" (B), "Espionage" (C), "Espionages" (D), and "Espiogue" (E)<n>Output: Reasonening:<n><n>The answer might lie in recognizing the pattern of the question. Let's start with the first choice, "spies" (letter A). The answer is in a plural form, so if we were to translate this into a singular form, it would have to be "espionage". <n><n>"Espy" (letter B) is not plural, but the word "Espionage" is not even included in this list of choices.<n>

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where could you find many theater? Choices:  A: school B: populated area C: military base D: opera E: church<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The "theater" mentioned in the question refers to a room or hall that is equipped with seating for the performance of plays or live concerts. So it needs to be located in a populated area where such events are common in the first place. Also, the answer needs to be an area with a high number of people, so the answer is unlikely to be an opera (C) or a church (E).<n><n>The question asks where can we find theater, so we need to eliminate answers that aren't spaces with a high density of theater or live performances—for instance, churches (E) aren't suitable venues for theater. Another example might be military bases (D) because they often have a higher military population compared to other states.<n><n>The answer is 'A: school' because it is an educational institution where theatre events are held.<n><n>Input: What is a good way to make an instant cup of coffee? Choices:  B: add cold water to hot coffee C: use grounds and water like they do in jails D: leave beans out and burn the water E: fill up all the little holes with foam or cream<n>Output: Reason:(Most of us will not do this, but we can still learn something from it)<n><n>In the question, the first and last phrase are contradictory because using cream or foam would not make coffee instantly in the cup, the process would take time. Cream and foam are only applicable when you have a large capacity of coffee and you do not need to prepare at the spot.<n><n>For example, when you make iced coffee or iced latte, you may add cream to it when you prepare. This is because you have time to wait for the cream to blend well with the coffee.<n><n>But for an instant instant cup of coffee, these things are not applicable as there is no time to wait.<n><n>Therefore, the phrase "leave beans out and burn water" (E) is the answer as it is the quickest and suitable way to make an instant coffee.<n><n>Input: At what time can one be charged with a federal offense in the United States?

Choices:  A: smile B: shake hands C: express gratitude D: say you're welcome E: appreciate compliment<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>To answer this question, we must first consider the context and purpose behind the "thank you" gesture.<n>The action would typically be performed as a way to show gratitude, or to say "thank you" for someone's compliment.<n>Option "appreciate compliment" (E) would be a common response if a person received a compliment about their work, and it is supported by the scenario in the question.<n><n>On the other hand, option "express gratitude" (D) could also be a valid response. It is a similar action in concept to "appreciate complament" (D), with the additional emphasis on the phrase "express" - giving the idea that the action would be performed in a way to show that the person feels deeply grateful.<n><n>The remaining choices, in contrast, are more specific to the gesture of shaking hands (B) or smiling (A).<n>It would be unlikely for a person to shake hands to convey gratitude, and even more so to do so after someone has received a compliment.<n>Option A, while a good example of the type of reaction a person might have if someone compliments them, seems specific in nature to the actual phrase; it's unlikely the actual phrase "smile" would be sufficient on its own to convey all the information (since the scenario in the question states, specifically, someone thanking the person for the compliment).<n><n>While the options are largely similar in meaning, the context and purpose of the "thank you gesture" gives meaning to the choices, and helps distinguish which are the most relevant options. So the correct answer is D: express gratitude<n><n>Input: A person gives a colleague a gift card for the bookstore for her birthday, on her birthday, what is the best reason for her to go to the bookstore?

Choices:  A: math book B: phonebook C: statistic D: music school E: office<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The context of the question makes it clear that the speaker is referring to operations with numbers, such as arithmetic. The first two options, "math book" (A) and "phonebook" (B), could be sources of information on numbers in general.  <n>But they wouldn't be the ideal reference for learning about arithmetic operations. <n><n>The last three options are more fitting, as they relate to a specific type of math. Option "statistic" (D) describes a course of study that would teach students how to manipulate and analyze numbers - which would include operations. It's also possible that a student could learn about operations through one of these courses. It's highly plausible. <n><n>However, the course in question isn't necessary to learn about operations. The correct answer is option "music school" (C), which describes a venue where people can learn to do arithmetic and other operations, such as playing musical instruments.<n><n>Input:Which of the following is NOT one of the 7 wonders of the Ancient World?

Lighthouse at Alexandria<n><n>Output: Instruction:<n><n>The first two answers, "The Great Pyramid" (1) and "Hanging Gardens of Babilon": (2), are the great wonders of the ancient world. <n><n>The next two options, "The Colossus" (4) and "Lighthouse at Alexandria" (7) are also not included among the seven wonders. <n><n>The final answer is "Statue of Zeus" (6), which appears on the list of wonders as the "Statue of Zeuss at Olympia".  <n>The Statue of Zeus was a colossal statue sculpted in stone, but according to the list, this isn't counted as one of the seven wonders of the ancient.<n><n>Input:What was the name of the inventor who created the world wide web after creating the web browser the internet?

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:james loved the stars.  In the wilderness, they lit up what? Choices:  A: outer space B: night sky C: universe D: orbit E: the ground<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n><n>The context of the question suggests that "they" refers to the stars - a collective noun for the group of celestial objects in the sky. So the stars light up the wilderness, where James is, not outer space (A).<n><n>Option "night sky" (B) is a bit more specific and grammatically appropriate than "wilderness" (C). However, it makes sense that James would be looking at the starry sky rather than the darkened night sky itself (B compared to C).<n><n>The option "universe" (D) implies that the stars are part of the universe, which means they're lighting things up in outer space or in the ground, which is incorrect.<n><n>"Orbit" (E) is the movement of celestial objects such as planets or stars around other objects, such as the sun, in a regular and predetermined pattern - a completely different phenomenon. Therefore, it cannot be the answer to the question, as the scientist wanted to know what the stars were lighting up, not how they move around one another. Also, the context and word choice ("lit up" - past tense) suggest that the event has already taken place, implying that it has to be something in the wilderness. Therefore, the only feasible answer is E.<n><n>Input: A group of people was having an argument about what. Choices:  A. the meaning of life. B. the importance of morality. C. the existence of truth. D. the correct spelling of words. E. the importance of a good education. <n>Output: Reason: <n><n>According to the context, A is not the group of people, whose existence is explicitly clarified as a fact, but what they are having an argument about. This also clarifies B, C and D being incorrect answers, since they are clearly the topics or subjects of the discussion.<n><n>The remaining sentence tells us that the last two are correct answers, so we can eliminate B. Since the discussion is about morality (B), which can be subjective and dependent on people's personal beliefs, the topic of truth cannot be the subject of the discussion since it is the opposite of being subjective and depends on what is true to a person. Furthermore, the choice C is incorrect since if truth is the topic of discussion the word 'true' should

Choices:  A: smile B: singing C: sweat D: act E: dance<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option "singing" (B) is out of the picture, because it involves the use of sound. The same can be said for sweating (D) as well since sweating requires exertion, which also happens to be a no-go due to the requirement of movement.<n>The next options are acting (M) and dancing (E).<n><n>Acting does not involve sound, but it is also not possible to act while being deaf, since acting involves speaking/signing/miming.<n><n>The same can be said for dancing. Dancing involves a degree of movement, which deaf people would not be able to carry out. Therefore, the answer is E: dance.<n><n>---<n><n>### Input: <n><n>>There is an island far far away in the west of Germany. People from the east would say that the people in the islands are crazy and always eating salads. They call them salad-people. Another thing is, that they all have big beards. <n><n>>It's really not like on main land Germany, where there live many other people from around the world.<n><n>->What is on the island?<<n><n>---<n><n>Output: Reason<n><n>Let's take the first line of the text and let's analyse it:<n><n>The first part of the sentence is "is" which implies the subject "is far far away" which makes sense, for an island can only "be" so far away from the mainland. Now, let's move to the second part of the sentence:<n><n>"in the west of german." This is very odd. West of what exactly? West from Germany? West from Europe? So, an island is far far away from Germany, in the west of Europe is not possible, because it's clearly very east.<n><n>Therefore, we can safely say that the island is west of Germany/west of Europe.<n><n>We can now look at the second paragraph:<n><n>"People from the east would say..." Well, it's not saying people from where, just east.<n><n>"Salad people."<n><n>This is also very strange. As a person from the west of Germany I really don't know about salads, maybe people to the east don't know.<n><n>"What is on the island?"<n><n>We now have

Choices:  A: teach B: cost money C: do work D: be productive E: help people<n>Output:		Reason:Answer:<n><n>The first step is to identify the purpose of the question. The question asks about the use of computers in the workplace, and specifically the function they serve. This eliminates all options but D - "do work."<n>Finally, the question asks about whether or not computers are helpful to people. Given that computers serve their purpose by being productive, this makes sense as the correct answer.<n>

Here, the key information is "there were 4 rocky planes and 4 gaseou planes." We can immediately eliminate "the solar system" bacause that answer is not compatible with the given fact.  We can also eliminate the other incorrect answer (B) because it is too general and does not indicate where the star is located.<n><n>Next, we will identify the key details that can narrow down the answer choices to "hollywood" (A) or "constellation" (C). We know from the question that the star may be part of one of these two concepts. It could be a star that is famous in Hollywood, or it could be a star that belongs to a constellation. The question does not specify which of these two options is correct, and we don't even have a strong clue as to which one it refers to, but we can now eliminate a third answer (D). This answer is implausible because it refers to alien planets. There are no alien planets in the question.<n><n>The final answer is "constellation" because stars are often placed into constellations and the term "constellation" can refer to groups of stars.<n><n><n><n>

Choices:  A: run programs B: play games C: control model D: power down E: reason exists<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Reason:The sentence "to control model" (C) implies that the person is not using their computer to control a model but instead to control the computer itself. This is incorrect because the previous sentence says that he was at the office and is now going to the start menu. Therefore, the option to control model is incorrect.<n><n>The next option "to run programs" (A) is also incorrect because this activity would be impossible during the night. The sentence says "His day at the officer was nearing an end" and "to run prgrams" would only be possible during the daytime.<n><n>The next two options "play games" (B) and to power down (E) would also be impossible to be done during the nighttime, because it is assumed that there are no programmes running on the computer at night.<n><n>Therefore, the only two options that are left as valid options are "to control model" and "to power down". So the final answer option would be C:Control model.<n><n>

Choices:  A: ouch B: skip C: enjoyed D: awesome E: watch television<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>There is no "awesome" in this sentence, not even a hint of it. "What did they exclaim...?" means that they exclaimed something. There cannot be an "ouch" in a sentence (unless the children were punched or struck by Superman).<n><n>Options "enjoyed" (C) and "watch television" (E) are not part of the sentence as well, making them incorrect options.<n><n>Option "skipped" (B) could refer to the children skipping school or work - but skipping doesn't refer to something being "awesome" in the way that "exclaimed" does. Also, "skipped" isn't used in a way that could describe something, such as how "exclaimed" would be. Therefore, this can be ruled out.<n><n>The best answer is "watch television" (D), which clearly would elicit the reaction of the children.<n><n>Input:The scientists believed that the volcano would erupt, what were they afraid of? Choices: <n><n>A: headache B: explosion C: pizza D: rain E: the police<n>Output: Reasonings:<n><n>The first step is to look for options that are plausible - one, in this case, is "being afraid of an explosion" (B). However, this doesn't mean it's accurate. <n><n>Another option that could be correct is "pizza" (D). The "believed" in the sentence suggests that volcano eruptions are generally notorious for spawning pizzas.<n><n>Both of the above options are incorrect, however, due to "erupt" being incorrectly capitalized.<n><n>It can also be inferred from the text that the scientists would've been afraid of the "eruption", which is an action. This would most definitely not be called "the police". In addition, if the volcano was the source of the explosion, then the police wouldn't know of any such thing.<n><n>Finally an option that might work is "the rain" (E), but this is a bit of a stretch to even put in the correct category as it's not a fear - a fear is an emotion, and "the rain" is a literal entity that cannot be feared.<n><n>The next best answer is

Choices:  A: cinema hall B: mall C: department store D: closet E: shop<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>To infer the purpose of purchasing expensive clothing, one would need to analyze other clothing prices in the town. The only options that do not require the act of "knowing more" is D: closet and E: shop. Both E and D only require you to know the name of the store, which isn't much information at all.<n><n>Option A: cinema hall requires "knowing more" because you would need to know the prices in the cinema hall in order to know if the clothing was indeed "extremely expensive" compared to these prices.<n><n>Option B: mall seems likely, but you still need more information. The mall does have expensive clothing, but you wouldn't know how expensive without knowing the store prices in the mall.<n><n>So the final answer would be E: store<n><n>Input: What would a cow feel like if it couldn't sense touch? Choices:  a) Sensitive b) Hectic c) Slow d) Blurry e) None of these<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>The purpose of describing a cow's touch is to give an idea of how the cow would be different without its tactile abilities. <n><n>So the answer would have to be either B, C or D.<n><n>Option A is obviously excluded since it would not give a hint to how a cow would feel without its sense of touch.<n><n>Option E is also excluded since this question was given to provide information about how the cow would feel.<n><n>So the two correct answers would be D or B, but A would seem to better fit the "touch" context provided. <n>

Choices:  A: determination B: upper hand C: superior D: higher position E: skill<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Let us understand the question. There is no option in the question which means that whatever option we choose should make sense. A: In this question, it is clear that we are talking about being in an "advantage position" in the competetion. Thus, this is not the correct answer.<n><n>B: It could be A, B or C. This indicates that there is at least a 22% certainty that A, B or C makes the right sense. This is the best you can get.<n><n>C,D: These options are the wrong choices because they are not about advantage position of person. They should be answered by person who is in the competiton, not by a person who is not in the competiton.<n><n>E: It is also a wrong answer. Because it is not about the competetion.<n><n>Thus, A = determination, B = upper hand, C = superior are wrong in the sense that they are not close to what is specified in the question.<n><n>Thus answer is B: upper hand.

Choices:  A: pets B: fills the pond C: attempt to fly D: school together E: breath in water<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first thing to do is identify the central subject matter of this question.<n>Option "A" (pets), while possible, doesn't really apply - fish have no way of carrying around a pouch or a basket, let alone walking alongside a human being.<n>Option "C" (try to fly) also doesn't fit, because it would immediately pose a conflict with the "water" word in "breath" (E). The fact that they're in water means they can't breathe out of it.<n><n>Option "D" (school) is very appropriate because fish congregate in large groups of the same species in lakes and rivers. By using the word "school", it's suggested that scientists have found ways for many types of fish to school together successfully.<n><n>Option "B" (fill the pond) would also be appropriate if it's referring to one specific kind of fish, but it implies that all kinds of fish will fill the pond, which is untrue, because different species don't school together.<n><n>Option "E" (breath water) would also be appropriate because fish do exist in bodies of water such as lakes and seas. "Fish" are a natural part of water. Thus, the best answer is option E, because it combines the most appropriate words and suggests an appropriate sense of plausibility.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question.<n><n>Input:'You have lost your keys,' the lady said to her husband.

Even though airplanes that are crashing at all times anywhere in the world, this wouldn't be what we wanted when reading the above question, since "non-being-used" airplanes are what we were looking for.  <n>So the correct answer is (E) Crash<n><n># 题2<n>##Instruction:Answer the following question.<n><n>Input : We have 11 red cards and 7 blue cards in a box, What is the probability of picking a red card at random from this box: Choices:  A B C D E<n>Output: Reason :<n><n>Since we have 11 red and 7 blue cards, the number of ways to get a red card from a total of 18 cards is 18C11 and the number of ways to pick a blue from total is 18C7. We count for 7 blue cards by adding C7*C12 = 7*12=84. Since 84+11+1 = 106. The total number of combinations = 106, we just need to divide 106 by 312 to get the probability = 0.34

Choices:  A: water B: liquid C: foamy D: intoxicating E: harmful<n>Output:		Solution: <n><n>The trick to answering this question is to deconstruct the clue and understand the different components of "term consumption of...beer" and then find analogies between those components.<n><n>The term "term consumption" is straightforward - it refers to consuming a thing over a period of time or in a continuous fashion.<n><n>"Long" (the prefix) is an extension of the term it modifies - in this scenario, "term", which denotes a period of consuming beer rather than a single instance or a short term consumption pattern.<n><n>The word "all", which describes what can result from long-term consuming beer, can be interpreted as a phrase that implies inclusiveness - all elements contained under the broad category "all sorts of problems" are to be considered when analyzing the issue at hand.<n><n>In other words, "all sorts of problems' is a generic description, which excludes nothing - any possible outcome that results from long-term beer consumption is to be considered.<n><n>In order to understand the entire concept of "Long term consumption of beers can lead to... all sorts of problems, here's a breakdown of each of the component parts:<n>- the phrase "term of..." refers to a period of time<n>- "all sort of", which is used to qualify the words or elements that the phrase "all sorts of" is describing<n>- "long term" is a qualifying modifier of "beer consumption", which denotes continuous practice or practice over a period of time<n><n>The use of the word "can" in the phrase "can be quite all sorts of sorts of things" hints to the possibility of multiple outcomes of such behavior or practice. <n><n>With this knowledge, we can construct an analogy between the components we found and the phrase in the question, which will help us to find a meaningful response.<n><n>In English, the phrase "all sorts" is traditionally used to describe a large number of elements, objects, or concepts, without limiting or excluding anything from that list. For example, "there are all sorts of vegetables", or "she wore all sorts of clothing styles."<n><n>This use of the phrase "all sorts," however, can be confusing and ambiguous, as it does not limit or specify what "all sorts" specifically refer to. It could simply be a descriptor, a way of saying that a certain thing has been included

Choices:  A: television B: dumpster C: landfill D: fox news E: trashcan<n>Output:		Reason: The clue is all in the question itself. “garbage” can mean a wide variety of things, including the solid waste stream (i.e. things that can actually be dumped into landfills). <n><n>But the “dumpster” is a clue here too. The two are often synonymous in colloquial use, but in this context, there is clearly more “garbage” than a common dumpster can hold, so the landfill has a better chance of being the actual answer. <n><n>The “Fox News” option hints that the garbage is perhaps more figurative, a statement that reveals itself as nonsense, rather than actual waste to someone who pays attention. <n><n>The answer of “landfill” is by no means intuitive, and it is far outside the realm of the more common “dumpster,” but it’s the most logical answer to give, based on both the literal and figurative definitions of the question.<n>So finally the answer is E: landfill<n><n>Output: Reasonable:<n><n>Without giving away any significant parts of the answer, it’s best to answer this question using a process of elimination. <n><n>Answers that fit the “dumpster” theme are obviously ruled out, since it’s clear that more garbage is involved here than a dumpster can hold. <n><n>Options “E” and “D” have a chance at being correct, as “E” is a more figurative interpretation of the question, and “D” could be referring to “fox” as in crafty or deceitful. Still, in this scenario, “D” is highly unlikely. It would be much more logical to associate “Fox” the network with the literal dumping of garbage than the figurative type. <n><n>At this point, it’s likely that either “A” or “B” will be correct and the rest are ruled out. “A” might make some sense, since both “television” and “garbage” are household items which would likely involve both “trash can” and “dumpster” types of waste to be disposed of. <n><n>“B” could perhaps make some sense on the grounds of “dumpster” or “truck,” but the wording remains slightly vague, and not enough to rule any of the other options out. <n><n>As it turns out, “B

A zoo (B) and body of water (C) are clearly too broad or abstract to describe the beaver dam.<n><n>Finally the conclusion is reached.

He picked a place that was inexpensive and offered few luxuries.  Where might he be staying? Choices:  A: farm B: town C: city D: hotel E: motel<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Here, each option is a place one might stay. In other words, each of the options should be answered with a word that matches the place in the scenario.<n><n>The first option, "farm" (A), doesn't match at all because a farm is a place where you would live if you were a farmer. Since that is not what the question invokes, it can be eliminated.<n><n>The next option of "villa" (B) makes no sense whatsoever, as a villa is not a place that one might stay. Instead, it's a building, so that it can be eliminated, too.<n><n>The option "town" (C) is in some ways a possibility, but it is too vague. This question implies that John wants to stay in a place with few luxuries - this means that you would be staying somewhere modest, not luxurious. It is therefore possible that you could end up in a town if you are not fussy, and John says that he doesn't want to waste his money. But since towns can be luxurious as well, it cannot definitively be eliminated as an option.<n><n>Since the town is an obvious possibility, we need to consider the next option of "city" (D) in terms of its contrast. The city is a more populous place and is usually more luxurious.<n><n>Finally option "hotel" (E) is just a little better than the city. A hotel has more rooms (like a city does) and thus is not so modest as a town.  This makes the hotel a slightly better choice. <n><n>For each of these reasons, the most accurate choice would be city.<n><n>Input: Who is the greatest musician in the world? Choices:  X: Y Z: W<n>Output:Reason:<n><n>This question is similar to the earlier question in the same test. The first thing to do is to understand the question from both sides of the argument. From the point of view of Option X, he is the greatest because he is the best.<n><n>Option Z has a different perspective. He points out that Y has played thousands of songs to Z's hundreds, and Z himself performed very well in a recent concert (W).  Thus, Z thinks he's better.<n><n>Based on this information, we see that the greatest musician

Choices:  A: building B: hallway C: table D: exchange E: office<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Here again we see that the answer lies in determining the basic setting of the question: a stock exchange. The answer then needs to be in this context and can be considered relevant accordingly.<n><n>This leaves us with four options, one of which does not fit the theme or context. "Exchange" (D) is not relevant. The word "exchange" means to give or receive something in return - a word that doesn't describe the job description of being a "trader" on the stock market. <n><n>"Hallway" (B) is also unnecessary as traders in this context would be working on the floor of the exchange - not in its hallway. <n><n>The remaining two options, "building" (C) and "table" (A), make sense given the context of a stock exchange. The floor on which traders sit is their working environment, thus making "building" (C)-likewise a logical answer. <n><n>Therefore, the final option which makes sense is "table" (A). This would imply the place where traders typically sit/work on the floor of the market.<n><n>So the correct answer is A: Table<n><n>Input: At a restaurant what? Choices: A: you can get drinks B: they often seat you by yourself C: you can leave when you want D: you can use a credit card E: they bring you small plates and bowls<n>Output: Reasonin:<n><n>Since the question does not explicitly say where the "you" is in relation to "a restaurant" it is not enough to say that they bring you small plats/bowls, this is irrelevant since it doesn't specifically say it will be from your "end."<n><n>Also, the words "you can get drinks" doesn’t necessarily have to be drinks from the restaurant, I think that what it may mean is that you can get drinks from a nearby store. This is also an irrelevant answer.<n><n>Option A makes no sense because you can't always get drinks at a restaurant, for example some restaurants that have live bands may not sell drinks because they don't want patrons to be drinking while the band is performing.<n><n>So the final answer would be B: they often seat people by themselves<n>

Choices:  A: panic B: getting in trouble C: mass hysteria D: go to prison E: murder<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>First, the word "roving" could refer to multiple different sources - meaning, multiple different people causing trouble.<n><n>In the second situation, "panic" is a good fit because people will become frightened if people are being brutally murdered. The fear (also known as panic) is spreading because the deaths continue to occur.<n><n>Next comes the word "going" which could be a verb or a noun. Either way, it fits a similar context to "panic" in that people are afraid.<n><n>Option "mass hysteria" doesn't make sense because hysteria is a type of fear that only lasts for a short period of time.<n><n>Finally "cause murder" fits the context. People are being killed, so that would lead to the deaths of people who caused it.<n><n>Therefore, the final answer would be A: the deaths of people causing it,<n><n>Input:The farmer had been looking forward to planting his crop for some time now.

Choices:  A B C D E<n>Output:Reasonning:<n><n>This situation can be understood to mean that a farmer wants to plant a crop after tomorrow. <n>Things could happen that delay this. For example, the farmer could be busy, or it could rain and prevent him from planting. <n>These options seem like they could dissuade him from wanting to plant a crop. These options also seem to make sense in the sense that a farmer who was informed of a drought should not want to plant until after the drought has subsided.<n>However, A and B are too specific. There are options that could still allow him to plant despite hearing about a drought. For example, maybe all of the rain will only hit this region, thus the farmer won’t care.<n>Therefore, E is the best option because it allows a farmer to plant while also recognizing that there is, in fact, a drought.<n><n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question by finding the missing word or phrase in the sentence.<n>### Input: "Everyone agreed the decision was reasonable" except for who?

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The lab results had been compiled, the scientist began analysing the data because he wanted what? Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: Reasoning:<n><n>The first task is to understand the context of the question. Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more. But it is vague as to what exactly the scientist wants to learn about. <n><n>The option "enlightened" (D), while spiritual in nature, doesn't fit the scientific context of this situation. It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What happens when people are waiting for something? Choices:  A: read book B: getting bored C: worry D: singing E: s never comes<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>Context helps us narrow down the options as to what these people are waiting for. Because the question is phrased as a "when" statement, it seems that the people have anticipation and expectation of something specific in sight. Therefore, the purpose of the phrase "for something" could be read as "in-between waiting for something."<n><n>Option A: "reading a book" is not very relevant here. Although the waiting period may indeed be boring, these people are anticipating an event, and the waiting time is not a period of leisure. Reading a book wouldn't be something to occupy the time in between a big event.<n><n>Options C and D: The question was framed in a way that made these two answers seem unlikely. The word "never" (D) implies that no event will ever occur, which is also in opposition to the preceding phrase, "comes." The sentence also seems to invoke some sort of hope or expectation by using the term "comes," which doesn't seem consistent with worry. Finally, the fact that there's a "when" involved makes "singing" (C) seems like an unlikely option. A person who's waiting for something to happen wouldn't be singing. It's more likely they're doing something else, or perhaps even just sitting there anticipating things.<n><n>This leaves us with the final answer - option E: "singing"<n><n>Input: When you want a lot of vegetables for dinner, what is the best thing to do after you finished cooking it? Choices: 	A: Put the vegetables in the refrigerator B: Put the vegetables aside C: Put the vegetables on the table D: Cut the vegetables into pieces E: Leave the vegetables in the frying pan<n>Output: Reason: The best thing to do is to leave the vegetables in the pan because its faster and easier to finish it.<n><n>Input:When the students started speaking the language of the indigenous people, they were impressed.<n>	Choices:  A: It's easy to communicate in their languages.

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What would something be if you do not need it? Choices:  A: satisfied B: unnecessary C: luxury D: sufficient E: extra<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The option "satisfied" (A) does not make any sense here, because the word "satisfied" typically means to be content or to find enough. If one needs something, then being satisfied with it would imply it's not needed anymore, which directly opposes the question.<n><n>Options "luxury" (C), "sufficient" (D), and "extra" (E) are also not appropriate, because they all refer to a circumstance where the item being asked about is not needed. But again, the answer choice doesn't need to be negative, because there is a possibility that someone values an item so much that it is needed even when it is not required for survival.<n><n>That being said, option "not need" (B) is the correct answer. It is grammatically correct, and it fits the context of this question well.<n><n><n><n>

An armchair in an apartment, furniture store or hospital is likely to be used by a large number of people.<n><n>Input:If a bus ride typically costs $5, what's the cheapest far that you could purchase? Choices: 1: $0 2: $1 3: $5 4: $50 5: $55 Output: Reasoning: <n>Given the options in the question, it's pretty much certain that the lowest price will be at $0, except for possible edge cases where ticket prices are round off-cent or round up-cent (in the $5 to $5.5 range of prices).<n><n>Input:What did the scientist finally figure out? Choice: 1: A,1014 2: B,234 Answer: a) 1 = A, 1014 and 2 = B,234 Output: Instruction:<n><n>    Reasoning<n>    A scientist observed an animal in its natural environment. He finally figured out that this animal was very sensitive to the temperature, and could only survive in certain temperatures. The temperatures at which he could see the animal were roughly A, 234 and B, 1015.<n><n>Input: Which was the biggest? Choices: A: 331 B: 458 C: 724 D, 881 Answer: b) 331 Output: Reasoning I :The options "1024" and "10243" are incorrect, since the value 10243 is less than both 1024 and 10240.<n><n>Instead the correct answer is "331".<n><n>The options "1014" and "234" are correct but a simple way to identify the actual minimum of the three possible temperature choices is by seeing if only "331" is the minimum or not. So 1014 > 331 and 234 > 334, if both are true, the answer would be "3

Choices:  A: make noise B: band C: museum D: concert hall E: rubber band<n>Output:		Reason<n><n>Reasoning:<n><n>Let's first parse the various components of this question.<n>We know the instrument with the name "harpsichord" is likely encountered at a "concert". If we were to try and reverse-engineer this question, it would be, "Where is one likely to encounter the 'concert' element of the 'concert hall'?" <n><n>But that's not the full question here. We still have "make noise". For the sake of efficiency, let's parse it out as "make-noise". With that context, the question is, "Where does one encounter'make-noise'?". (In this sentence, "make" means "create" and "noise" means an annoying or disruptive sound.)<n><n>We know the answer is going to be something that is noisy, so we can eliminate the options "band" (C) and "rubber band" (E).<n><n>Now we look at A and B, the two remaining options. "Make noise" in this context means "create a loud sound". So what kind of sound do you typically create a "band"? A concert is for listeners, not creators. This eliminates option "band" (C).<n>What does "noise" mean? At this point, it's unclear, but there are more clues than just the presence of "concert hall". <n>A harpsichord and a concert hall have something in common (other than being in the same room)... the both have "hall" in the name. <n>The other is "rubber band", which sounds like a kind of annoying sound, <n>But also... a concert hall's purpose is "to perform music", and that's exactly what one does with a "rubber band". But that's getting too subtle. So... let's say rubber band is the "noise". Then it's really just "which of the following is a common annoying sound", right? <n><n>The answer is A: make noise and C: concert hall.<n><n>### Instructions: What is the question we’re answering?

Choices:  A: choose one B: get comfortable C: bought a book D: learn to read E: open up<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The first thing we are giong to focus is the purpose of the book reading. By definition, reading is the activity of reading or understanding the meaning of something. The question indicates that the book reading in this specific scenario is an *independent* activity (i.e. not instructed/commanded/required by someone else), so the correct answer would be to do something *on its own* - hence, it must be B or E, since A, C and D are not independent actions in the first place.<n><n>Next, we should take notice of the fact that in the context where we are told in the question that the book reading is an independent activity, we can take out things like "getting comfortable", "buying a book", etc from our candidate selections.<n>With that in mind, the answer is E: to open up.<n><n>Input: After spending a long time on his boat doing what, he had become very competent in his area of expertise? Choices:  (A) A: get a promotion (B) B: make friends C: get on internet (D) D: get the phone call E: get a new sail (F) F: have a boat trip<n>Output: Reason<n><n>First, by knowing that we are talking about a situation involving boat, the only sensible action for the character in this story (beside getting a new sail F ) is to learn about sailing, so the answer must be B: Make Friends -> A,B,D,E are not action involving making friends. So A,B,F are eliminated.<n>Now we are left with A,C,D, which means that the purpose of the main character is learning (A) -> Counterintuitive as the character had spent a long time on his own in front of his friends (B). Learning(C), not really.<n>D(D) -> D(E) : This would be the most reasonable scenario for the character, but the question states that he had become *very* competent, and you can't do this in only a few months, right? <n>So we are left with E: Get a Call.<n><n>### Difficulty: Easy<n>#### Bonus score: +20<n>### Instruction: You need the answer to the following question from your memory, please use the hint buttons.<n><n>Input:

Choices:  A: northern B: nome C: tromsø D: finnmark E: vadsø<n>Output:		Reasonning:<n>The most common name for the city in Norway could be Tromso because you're searching it through Google. <n><n>The Tromso-of-the-North is the cultural capital of Northern Norway and is considered the “capital” of the polar regions, both in Norway and the world.<n><n>In the extreme north, you can watch a magical sunrise at midsummer, a midnight sun at midwinter and the Northern Lights at any time of year. Northern lights is known by different names elsewhere in the world including aurora borealis and aurora australis. <n><n>Auroras are spectacular night illuminations seen on the magnetic magnetic pole in the earth's northern and southern poles. <n><n>A half marathon is a distance of 21 kilometres or 13 miles run in competition conditions.

Here, the scenario invokes a scientist analyzing lab results, which suggests he's searching for a certain outcome. That immediately eliminates irrelevant options such as "headache" (B) and "do math" (C).<n><n>The next task is to pin down the exact purpose behind the scientist's actions.<n>Option "learn more about" (A) is plausible, because analyzing the data would undoubtedly result in learning more.

It would be uncommon to use the term "enlightenment" to describe the outcome of data analysis in a research study.<n><n>Finally, the last option is "better understanding" (E). It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:The man tried to run, but he could not. He could that he could only move by doing what? Choices:  A: stand B: go quickly C: walking D: stand still E: walk slowly<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n><n>The main premise here is that the man could not run. This eliminates all options that involve running, such as "stand" (A), "walk" (B), and "go quickly" (C). All of these options assume that the man can run, and thus would not be accurate for this scenario.<n><n>Next, we need to focus on the constraints. The man is not able to move at all; he can only move by standing still. However, he can move by standing. If we look at the options, "stand still" is not an option because it implies that he must move, and we know for a fact that he's not able to move.<n><n>Furthermore, "walking" (D) and "walk slowly" (E) involve moving. So we can eliminate "walking" since the man cannot move at all, and "walk slowly" since the man did not try to take his time. He was trying to run, and was unsuccessful. Thus, the final answer is D: stand.<n><n>Input:If you think that there are people who believe that what you have is better, then you are most likely what? Choices: A: an egocentric B: paranoid C: schizoid E: psychosociale<n>Output: Reasonning:<n><n>The main task is to determine the definition of the term "egocentric." While "paranoid" (B) and schizoid" (C) may come to mind, neither of them actually defines "egocentric" in a way it is used in the text.<n><n>Instead, the answer here is A: egocentric. It describes a person who places his or her own interests above those of others. So, when the question says that you're an egocentric person, it means that you believe your interests are better than those of others'.<n><n>Another similar idea that may come to mind is "psychosocial," which is a psychology term that refers to a person's social relationships. However, this term does not quite fit in the context of the question, as it does not quite explain the belief that some people's interests are better than others'.<n><n>Ultimately, the final answer is A: egocentrism.<n><n>Input:What makes the solution unique? Choices: A)

It fits the context and purpose behind analyzing the data - that is, to gain a deepened understanding of the results. Therefore, this would be the most accurate answer to the question.<n>So the final answer is E: better understanding<n><n>Input:What is an way for people to meet with each other? Choices:  A: believe in god B: pay bills C: group together D: enjoy themselves E: face each other<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Again, the first and most important thing to do is to identify the purpose of the question. The question states that people meet in different ways, as there are many ways people meet. So the only correct answer is that people can meet for social reasons. It is easy to rule of the irrelevant options, as the question does not mention work or studying at all.<n><n>The next step is to pick the correct option. Group together (C) does not seem suitable for social meeting in this context as it indicates that a bunch of people meet physically. However, face each other (E) can meet with each other, so it is not the right answer.<n><n>Pay bills (B) is an option, although in this context it is a slightly implausible answer. The answer might be a bit too general in the context of social meeting, and face to face (E) is actually more likely to fit the question.<n><n>So the correct answer is E: face each other.<n>

Choices:  A: cupboard B: chocolate C: coffee D: candy bar E: soda pop<n>Output:		Reasoning:<n><n>From the context of the question, the answer can be narrowed to "cupboard" or "sugar." Since the question is referring to a specific container of sugar, the cupboard is the correct choice.<n><n>Input: It's easier to learn a language at the age of five what? Choices: A: 53 B: 55 C: 36 D: 56 E: 32<n>Output:<n><n>To answer this question, the first step is to determine the context and structure of the question. The phrase "at the age of" implies that the number of years should be provided as <n>a response. Additionally, the answer option that refers to "53" seems to be closer to what the question is asking, which narrows it down to 55 as the correct answer.<n><n>Input: How do you turn a 60 into a 33? Choices: 60 -80 = 33 A 60 +80 = 140 B 60 -0 = 60 C 60 +0 = 60 D 60 +83 =50 E 60 -83 = 43<n>Output:Reasonning :<n><n>To answer this problem, we first evaluate the numerical values and determine that the answer can only be 33 or 43, as the other options are inconsistent with the given values.<n><n>The answer must be a numerical value that can be calculated using only the numbers 60 and 83, which removes "A" and "B".<n><n>We then consider the options that end in either a 0 or 30, which excludes "C" and "D".<n><n>Finally, we come to the last alternative: "E", which matches the pattern required by the question exactly.

Choices:  A: gain experience B: taking notes C: listen carefully D: complete test E: focus<n>Output:		<n><n>Scientific studies, especially those related to medicine, involve a lot of data. To fully understand the outcomes of these studies, it is typically necessary to perform extensive data analysis. The results of data analysis allow doctors to gain a better understanding of the underlying causes of medical conditions or treatments that can be effective for certain patients.<n>In this way, gaining new experiences through data analysis can potentially lead to medical breakthroughs in the long term and help advance the field of medicine.<n><n>However, the most common purpose for data analysis is simply to gain a better understanding. That means analyzing data to better understand a situation. The more precise the data analysis, the clearer the understanding becomes. So, the final outcome is that one should gain a better understanding of something, so the appropriate answer is “C: listen carefully”.<n><n>Input: How do you think you'll score on the exam if you study hard, read study materials and memorize formulas? Choices: A: poorly B: well C: well-studied D: badly<n>Output:<n><n>As per the context, scientists are working to understand the results of their experiment. So to interpret the results, they must make a logical decision to do further data analysis. In this case, it means looking at possible causes and effects.<n><n>So the most logical decision is to understand the results further. Now let's go to the answers.<n>Option A indicates poor study. So it is obviously wrong. Option D indicates bad performance in the exam. So that is not possible, because the scientist is taking the help of data analysis to do further study.<n>Option the answer is obviously D: well-studied means that there is a reason to study further, because he knows the reason is right.<n><n>Input:Why would someone analyze a situation instead of drawing conclusions from it. Choices: A: The situation has not been analyzed before B: The situation's conclusions are uncertain C: The situation is too complex to interpret D: The situation needs interpretation<n>Output: <n>This is a very interesting question where the choice of the answer depends on where the learner is.<n><n>If the person taking the question is from a place where most of the thinking is either from what they experience or what others have shared, the choice is B: The situation is too complicated to interpret.<n><n>When a person lives in a place that is full of thinking by others, the decision

Choices:  A: antique store B: in the graveyard C: kitchen D: junk yard E: ice<n>Output:		The scenario suggests that our protagonist has either broken or has been gifted an icebox - an ice chest - with an apparent structural defect. Options A, B, and E would suggest that our person is either looking to make a significant financial profit from the icebox or wants to dispose of an object of sentimental value. Since neither of these is true, the correct answer is D (Junk Yard).<n><n>Input: Why did he go to the doctor for a fever? Choices:  C: he had an accident B: fever A: inability to move his hand E: was tired of feeling cold<n>Output: The answer is A. There are three other options from which it would be possible to infer that the protagonist felt sick and needed medical attention.<n><n>Input: Do you think that the student cheated today? Choices:E B: Absolutely A: I believe he did C: Yes D: Don't know<n>Output:The question requires us to deduce whether or not the student cheated. There is clearly some speculation or uncertainty in the question, as the person does not directly state "do you know the student cheated", rather "believe he did". The only option that specifies certainty is A- "Absolutely". Therefore, the answer, "Absolutely" is the correct answer.<n><n>Input: She was very tired after dancing all night without sleeping. Choices: B: She was hungry D: She was sick E: She had no shoes C: D: Freshly Cool<n>Output:The protagonist is dancing at a dance party. She may not be hungry or sick, though this has to be guessed by the reader. The correct answer is B- "she was Tired".<n><n>Input: You were at your friend's party, but decided to leave early.

Choices:  A: sanded B: composted C: warp D: hardened E: petrify<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>Option "warp" (B) is an incorrect answer because wood does not have the ability to "warp" to the point where it becomes fossilized.<n><n>Option "composted" (C) is another incorrect answer because it's incorrect to refer to plants fossilized in that manner: fossilization occurs independently of whether or not a plant is decomposing.<n><n>Option "petrified" (D) is an extremely common term used to describe fossils, and it's therefore quite obvious that this is the correct answer.<n><n>This question is asking about the "when" and "how" of one specific type of fossilization, and thus the correct answer can only apply to petrification.<n><n>Therefore, the correct answer is D: harden<n><n>Input:The scientists were observing the plant life, and they noticed a group of lizards under the plants were growing quickly which was evidence of the plant growth enhancing the lizards’ growth. Which of the following conclusions is the correct one: Choices:  A- The scientists saw the lizard grow into its adult form in one generation as a result. B- The lizards were exposed to a more toxic algae type that made them grow larger and thus were protected by their lizard peers. C- The lizards grew larger when they were closer to the plant life, and this evidence was evidence only of this. D- The plant life was growing at a rate of faster than six feet per hour. E- All of the above statements are correct<n>Output: Reason<n><n>Option "E- All of the above" (E) is incorrect because it's not possible to determine which of the options above is the correct one by using only that option.<n><n>Option "B- The lizards..." (B) would be a correct answer if the question were "What plant did the lizards grow on?" However, this question doesn't ask that - it asks for a specific, factual conclusion about the plants' effect on lizard growth. Therefore, this would not be the correct answer.<n> <n>Option "A- The scientists saw..." (A) is a description of the results: that in this particular instance, the lizards reached adulthood in one generation. No conclusion should be drawn from that observation, which is why it's

Choices:  A: own home B: old england C: new hampshire D: coffin E: denmark<n>Output:		Reason:The word "small dog" immediately makes "Old England" out of the question. Why would a small dog be found in "Old England," unless by pure coincidence? It would be much more likely to find a small dog back home. This is because all small dogs belong in the same category of "dog." The word "new" in "Old England" confuses the question, and is essentially irrelevant because no new dog found at "Old England" is going to be the same small dog that went missing.<n><n>Input: What is the correct sequence of events?<n><n>1-2-3-4<n>Output: Reason 1,2,3,4 are the order of events.<n><n>Input:What letter was written after M?<n><n>M.A.E<n>Output:Reason MAE<n><n>Input: What kind of cheese are we thinking of?<n><n>Answer: Camembert<n><n>Output: Reason : Camembert is the only cheese that begins with the four consonants C-A-M-E. <n><n><n>Input: What can come next?<n><n>D,W,F,E,I,H<n>Output: Reason, <n>A can be placed anywhere after C<n><n>Input: In English is it ok to end a sentence with a preposition?<n><n>No<n>Output: Reason<n>Prepositions are words that indicate when or how something is done.<n>Thus, the answer is no.<n><n><n>Input: There are 4 boys and 5 girls in a class.

They're working hard to entertain the fans, giving their best to please them.<n>C: clap<n>- This would fit for a different type of band, one that specializes in clapping. However, this is not the case for band at hand, so it can't be the right answer.<n>D: reproduce<n>- This does not apply. A band reproduces music, not their fans.<n>E: celebrate<n>- This would fit, but the start of a show is not an appropriate time to celebrate, as they should be working hard to perform for their fans.<n>Therefore, the right answer is B: working hard.<n><n>Input: Which statement, when true, makes research particularly valuable? Choices:  TRUE: It aims to describe, predict, solve, or create. FALSE: It aims to verify, validate, confirm, or explain.<n>Output: The most accurate answer here is FALSE because a scientific research "aims to explain or confirm."

Choices:  A: lake B: aquariums C: swimming pool D: pond E: childrens pools<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>The body of water "typically shallow water" should be a lake (A).<n><n>* A lake can be any piece of water body surrounded by land, whether it is natural such as a freshwater or saltwater lake, or man-made such as an artificial lake. Lakes will always have a shallow area (at least near the edge), while bodies of water such as the ocean are not typically shallow.<n><n>Input: What is the correct scientific term for a species of dinosaur that have feathers?

Choices: A. True B. False<n><n>Output: Reasons<n><n>A human heartbeat is controlled primarily by the cardiovascular system, which is part of the nervous system (B)<n>* A human heartbeat isn't controlled entirely by its own nervous (nor muscular) system. The heart actually has its own autonomous nervous system, which is separate from the central nervous system (which controls voluntary movements). Additionally, the nervous system and the muscular system both work together in order to control a heartbeat, which is why the answer is B.<n><n>The nervous system plays a major role, but does not solely control the heartbeat of a human.<n><n>Input: If you need to buy gas on the highway how much miles can you travel?

Choices:  A: public building B: tomb C: arena D: large building E: treasure<n>Output:		Reason:<n>The context of the question suggests a scene of adventure and discovery where an explorer or group of explorers may have found a hidden treasure. Option "A: public building" would be the most uncommon response to this question because it doesn't seem likely that an ancient public building would be hidden and protected by an intricate labyrinth. <n><n>Option "a tomb" ("B") is more likely if the setting is a place of burial and an ancient burial mound. However, the reference to joy at finding the entrance suggests that the central passage was actually the entrance into a tomb and was not specifically discovered.<n><n>Option "an arena" ("C") is also possible, since it is an establishment typically built for celebration and entertainment. However, an arena would likely not be used for burial and the fact that the explorers are described as being delighted at finding the entrance further suggests that the passage is only an entrance.<n><n>Option "a large building" is equally as likely since it is a wide-spread building or establishment in which a series of chambers could be located, but these would likely be smaller than a regular arena or an arena-like structure.<n><n>Option E: "treasure" (E) could be the correct answer if the explorers were searching for and found buried treasure. But it doesn't quite seem right for this context because the treasure may not have been underground.<n><n>Therefore, the final answer is D: large building.<n><n>Input: What is the difference between a sporran and an uisge-beatha? Choices: A: Sporran is Scottish while uisge beatha is Scottish B: Sporran is a wineskin, uisge is an elixir C: Uisge is a Scotch while sporran is a woollen bag D: Uisge is what they drink at parties while sporran is something they make in bars<n>Output: Reason for Answer:<n>The question asks for information on the difference between a sporrran and an uisgebatha (uisge means "beverage" in Gaelg, one of the languages of Scotland).<n><n>Answer A: "sporran is Scottish while it is uisgebeatha is Scottish" (A) does not answer the question asked. <n>

Choices:  A: music shop B: music store C: jug band D: united states E: among nice people<n>Output:		Reason the answer is D<n><n>The answer can be determined simply by looking at the context of this question. The scenario suggests that a banjo is famous in some way, and the choices provide clues as to what it would be famous for.<n><n>Based on the context, "music shop" (A) seems like a possible choice, as a music shop would likely sell musical instruments. However, that is not entirely relevant to this question.<n><n>The answer "jug band" (B) sounds too vague - what exactly is a "jug band"? To learn more about what a jug band actually is, the best next step is to look at the word "jug" in the context of this sentence. "Jug" here implies that something needs to do with the container, or perhaps the drinking glass. Perhaps this band got its name from what they drank?<n><n>In contrast, the answer "music store" (C) is unlikely, given that the phrase "store" makes it clear that the location refers to a country, not a shop. Even though the shop could be in the US, there's no reason to believe that would be the case.<n><n>Furthermore, the answer "united states" (E), while seemingly plausible due to the country's name, cannot be correct given that the banjo is "probably" famous in the United States. If it is famous anywhere, it must be within a smaller country. Hence, the final answer (D) is "among nice people".<n><n>Input:The best way to learn languages is to surround yourself with native speakers who use them? Choices:  E: Yes A: Yes, and then travel in different countries B: No, you should only listen to them C: Yes, and then study all of their history D: No, but you should live there F: Yes E: No<n>Output: Reason:<n><n>"E: Yes", "F: Yes" and "A: Yes" are similar as they include "surrounding yourself" meaning to have a place such as home or work where native speakers are also present. "D: No" is incorrect as no need to live in the country where the language is spoken.<n><n>"B: No, you should listen to them" is different as the context includes only languages and there might be no travel.<n><n>"C: Yes, and then

Choices:  A: relax B: controversy C: pleasure D: frustration E: needs theater<n>Output:		Reason: We know that art is a process of creating something, and that it requires materials to do so.  What this question is really asking is what does someone need to do in order to begin the process of creating art.  Therefore, we know they don't need any materials other than themselves, so the answer is they "begin creating art" (A)<n><n>Input: Is the manna in the wilderness still being eaten at all? Choices:  * A: no * B: sometimes * C: yes * D: depends on a certain day * E: yes or no<n>Output: Reason (In order): In the passage it states, “But manna was still a daily staple in the land of Israel”. This shows the manna is being eaten in the desert, so I chose the correct answer, (B).<n><n>Output: “No, actually the mushrooms aren't very tasty and most people prefer the beef stew.”<n><n>Input:Alice: Hi Mary, long time no see!

Choices:  A: lake B: manhattan C: shoreline D: coastal area E: los angeles<n>Output:		Reason:A bay is always found in a ______?<n>The question invites you to identify the type of geographical area in which a bay is always found. By cross-referencing, you'd see that "bay" is a synonym for "cove", though other geographical features such as "cove", "bayou", "arroyo" and "estuary" are also forms of bays.<n><n>As for your answer options:<n>Option A: A lake is an inland body of water. Therefore, you cannot find a lake anywhere that is a sea, ocean or coast (C). <n><n>Option B: Manhattan is located on New York's island, which is one of the five boroughs. It is not part of the ocean.<n><n>Option D: The coastal area is the coast. That is what makes sense as an answer choice.<n><n>Option E: While Los Angeles may be on a coast, "always" is an essential qualifier. Therefore, you can only find a bay in the coastal area. <n><n>So the final answer to the question is D: Coastal area.<n><n>Input: What is the first line 4-letter word to appear in your favorite books? Choices:  a: ad b: ab C: ac d: abd e: abc <n>Output:<n>Reason: The first four-letter word is _____?<n>The general context of the question invites you to assume a particular textual style. This would be any type of text, but specifically a book that you enjoy reading most. <n><n>As such, you need to identify which of the answer options is the first-word of your favorite book.<n>Thus, option A: "ad" is not the answer, because it is not the first word of any text, not to mention your favorite book.<n>Option C: "ac" is not the answer either, because "ac" is the first word of Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, which few people would consider as their favorite book.<n><n>The final answer choice is D: "abd" which appears in a few texts, such as the Holy Bible and various works of Shakespeare. As the book you like is presumably not one of the Bible's, it could very well be a book by the Bard.<n><n>So the final choice D: "abd", is

Choices:  A: smell smoke B: catch cold C: burnt D: look angry E: bank savings<n>Output:		Reason: The person turned the oven and put a pizza inside, what happened one hour from now?<n><n>Option "look angry" (D) is incorrect because it doesn't logically follow from the preceding actions of putting the pizza in the oven and turning it on.<n><n>Option "look pizza" (E) doesn't make sense because the person is the one who'll look at the pizza, not the pizza itself. Additionally, it's also unlikely that the pizza will be "angry" after an hour.<n><n>Option "did not smell smoke" (B) is incorrect, as smoke would most likely be produced after an hour of baking a pizza in an oven.<n><n>Option "catch cold" (C) is incorrect.<n>Option "burnt" (A) is incorrect, as it is unlikely that an hour's worth of baking a pineapple would cause it to "burst."<n><n>Option "bank savings" (E) is incorrect, as the person would have deposited the money in the bank before putting the pizza in, not one hour after doing so.<n>The correct answer, then, is E: burnt<n><n>Input: John's mother, a doctor, was talking about diabetes. She told her son about who gets diabetes, how you get to develop or not and John was confused about who is the worst group of people. What did John think? Choices: 1: diabetes is a problem 2: the doctors are to blame 3: it is the most incurable disease 4: some get it and some do not 5: doctors themselves are in a risk of getting diabetes 6: diabetes is good<n>Answer: Reason:<n><n>Option "it is the most incurablE disease (3)" is incorrect because it doesn’t match John’s point of confusion.<n><n>Option “doctorE themselves are at a risk of getting diEabetes (5)" is incorrect because it still does not match John's point of confusion. In fact, those in the medical field, who are often well-aware of the consequences of diabetes, are more likely to avoid this disease completely.<n><n>Option “diabetes is good (6)” is incorrect because this does not address the concept of who develops diab

Choices:  A: pet shops B: new mexico C: white house D: arctic E: garden of eden<n>Output:		reasoning:<n><n>To make your answer choice even more correct here, take into account that these are animals in the wild, so pet store (B) doesn't make sense.<n><n>New Mexico (C) is a state in the southwestern United States, so I would definitely rule it out as an answer as well.<n><n>The Arctic (D) is a part of North America known (among other things) for being very cold. I don't think it makes sense that the weather would cause an animal from the Arctic to move to New Mexico.<n><n>This leaves Garden of Eden (E) and White House (F) as the two remaining options. Garden of Eden (A) is a mythical land described in a biblical book of Genesis as the lush, beautiful earthly paradise where God gave two humans - Adam and Eve - first life. <n><n>White House (F) - being the residence of our nations' President - isn't appropriate because snakes are naturaly seen as dangerous animals in our culture (they were one of the main reasons why Eve was sent out of the Garden of Eden in the first place).<n><n>The final answer would be Garden of Eden (F), because its pleasant climate would surely make snakes want to move there!<n><n>Input:A cat lives on a farm in the village where it eats mouse, rabbit, chicken, and grain. When the farmer moves to the city the cat follows the farmer to the big city and sells milk. Where will the cat take the milk? Choices: 1. Home 2. Grocery Store 3. Farm 4. Restaurant 5. Hotel<n>Output: reasoning: here the option is quite simple, what is the animal that milk sells.<n><n>Input:Jim has to get to two locations in the downtown area.

He didn't heave anything to put it on, and he lacked the what to balance it? Choices:  A: tenacity B: hands C: coaster D: skill E: breaking<n>Output:		<n>Reasoning:<n><n>First of all, we find the exact context in which the statement 'The man set the cup.....' is taking place.<n><n>It is a situation where the man had to set'a cup' on some surface, but he didn't have'anything' to put it on. It seems he couldn't find anything to use. The man didn't 'lack the'.<n><n>In the above statement, we can see a common'something' was necessary to put the cup on, but he couldn't find 'it', which was there to support the cup.<n><n>Now, we are just left with a few statements/options to choose from:<n>'The man didn't heave...' means he didn't throw (hurl) the cup. <n>'... put it on, and.... he lacked the...'.   The meaning of the sentence, as a whole : The man was unable to place the cup anywhere due to lack of some supporting object.<n><n>Now, 'it's too darn heavy', to put it on.<n>We can safely say that the man didn't have the'skill' to support the cup. So, we can mark down option C, along with option E.<n><n>Option A, B and the original statement, also don't fit in. <n>Now, we see where we have 3 options out of 5 are the wrong ones (including the original statement)!<n><n>I'm not done yet.<n><n>The whole 'he didn't have the skill...' has been written for a reason. When something isn't working, someone thinks up of a solution. <n>The whole sentence is just a way of saying: The man tried his best, he tried really hard, but it still didn't work.<n><n>"I did my best, but it still didn’t work! I'll have to find another way."<n><n>He lacked what to support the weight of the cup, so he decided to throw the item.<n>Hence, he was trying to balance it using force rather than'something else'!<n><n>Now, only 2 options left.<n><n>A man had tried his, but didn't succeed. <n>He was unable to have another way to support the cup.  <n>He knew that only thing he had in his hand was too 'heavy' to put on anything

Choices:  A: health club B: jocks C: fitness centre D: stadium E: gymnasium<n>Output:		Reason:<n><n>First, we need to figure out what they mean by 'green drink'. One likely culprit is the "Green Monster" - a popular food in sports lore. A more likely culprit is the Green Monster Bar - which is green, and serves as a 'health drink'<n><n>The next step is to figure out where we are. In the first paragraph, it is stated that this is "an upscale sports-themed restaurant".<n><n>We can eliminate "B" and "C", and "D". There is  no "fitness centre" that we can visit in an upscale, sports-themed restaurant; "fitness centres" are more likely to be found in corporate offices.<n><n>The first reference to a "locker room" suggests that the setting is a sports bar or restaurant. It's also worth noting that in the sports bar, one might find a bar/waiter in the locker room. So it may be more plausible that we are headed to the "bar" here rather than the "locker room".<n><n>We now have a good idea of where we are, and we are now left with two choices to consider. We already eliminated "Fitness bar" as an option, as it was the wrong type of bar.<n><n>So we are left with two options: "jocks" and "bar/waiter". But "jocks" would refer to the men who work out. The correct answer, is "bar/waiter"<n><n>Input: Which of the following statements do we believe about the current pandemic? Choices:  I: The vaccines and the other anti-viral drugs are too expensive. II: The new vaccines and other anti-viral medicine should be better. III: We can't do anything but pray. IV: We can't change the situation. V: A lot is being done to fight against the coronavirus, but nothing is going our way. VI: It's more a problem in developed countries. VII: It will eventually be overcome. 8: COVID-19 doesn't affect people that much. 9: Life will be back to normal.<n>Output: Reason I: The vaccine and other anti-virus drugs are too expensive because 66,608,000 people

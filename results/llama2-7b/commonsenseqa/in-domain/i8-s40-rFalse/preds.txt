They are, in this article, divided into four different areas: Learning, Storing, Recalling and Forgetting. Let's take a look at each strategy and some memory hacks that were applied during our development.<n>```<n>1.Learning:<n>```It is the process by which people take any information and turn it into something meaningful. For example, learning what is in the other room behind the door. This type of learning will enhance our knowledge while reading or listening about something new. Reading or researching is another exercise.<n>When we learn something, it also makes us feel confident.<n><n>- Strategies like repetition, visualization and reading help in learning.<n>- Practice will make you stronger.<n>```<n>2. Storing:<n>```This part of the brain is responsible for the long term retention. We need to remember something more than once in order to have stronger memory retention.<n><n>- Use mnemonic techniques, place our information in the familiar surroundings (for a short period), and use associations to store information.<n>- Remember names easily using the technique below.<n>```<n>3. Recalling: To recall or retrieve information that we stored earlier.<n>Recalling is done when we actually access the information that we stored in our minds.<n><n>- Recall the stuff from our senses, our senses are what we use to record the information.<n>```<n>4. Forgetting:<n>This is a process of forgetting something that we don't use anymore.<n>- Forgetting is a natural process which might not be intentional and we can not necessarily prevent it.<n>```

At the same time, oceans, like lakes, have many different kinds of water.  In fact, oceans have at least four different kinds of water. The four kinds of water come from four different parts of the water cycle, the cycle of water moving between the earth, the soil, and the air.  The cycle has four parts. The first part is when water falls from the sky and gets on the land. The second part is when it is warmed by the sun and evaporates up into the air. The third part is when it becomes cloud and moves with air. The cycle then ends when water falls back on the ground again to form rivers and lakes. <n><n>Oceans always have water rising from the land, and it always falls back upon the land.

This will show you that the first digit (not including 0, as the data is only 0-9) will give insight into what type of image we are dealing with. The numbers do not follow a simple sequence, except for, 1 being a more common number in the dataset in terms of percentages.<n>Look at the feature that you are examining. You may examine all possible features or you may start with a random subsample of features and examine one feature at a time (permutation importance). Start by using the number in the feature (as you examined in lab 3-1) as a base/label you can classify against. Try to find what other features are important in your text representation.<n>If you find out that a certain digit has a higher correlation that you would have expected, it may be because what it's representing is highly correlated. For example, 2's represent the number 8 more often than you would expect, there may be an association between numbers

Choices: <n>A. make sure the house is ready B. put all the plates away C. make sure the windows and roof are secured D. make sure the car is ready E. go to sleep F. all of the above Answer:<n>A: make sure the house is<n>right I feel like there is a huge misinterpretation of the answer because I understand this question to be, "What can you do to prepare to keep your house safe from a storm?" And the answer is not "make sure the house is right" which means secure and ready. And it's definitely not "make sure the plate's are away" because you don't need to put your plates away if a storm is coming? It's definitely not B because the window and roof would already be secured. It definitely isn't A and C because if you have secured these elements I don't think it is wise to go to sleep. I think the answers are D and F. You need to make sure your car is ready for the storm so that you can go where you must and be safe. F and A are both the correct answer because they are all correct.

This will show you that the first digit (not including 0, as the data is only 0-9) will give insight into what type of image we are dealing with. The numbers do not follow a simple sequence, except for, 1 being a more common number in the dataset in terms of percentages.\nLook at the feature that you are examining. You may examine all possible features or you may start with a random subsample of features and examine one feature at a time (permutation importance). Start by using the number in the feature (as you examined in lab 3-1) as a base/label you can classify against. Try to find what other features are important in your text representation.\nIf you find out that a certain digit has a higher correlation that you would have expected, it may be because what it's representing is highly correlated. For example, 2's represent the number 8 more often than you would expect, there may be an association between numbers", "answer": "C: kitchen"}

We can have a simple switch case that has four different branches, where each branch would correspond to an option. The first option is when the user does not choose an option, in which case we print \"invalid\", and continue to test the user's input.\n\n### **Answer:** Choices:  B (D)\n\n### Answer:\"invalid (or none specified)\"\n\n### Suggestion: This question is similar to question \"What is a person unintentionally hurtiing someone else but unable tostop likely to feel?\".

The first part of the loop would print the question, and then we would use a switch case based on the input, that would determine the answer\n\n### Answer \"B (D)\":\n\n### Answer\"E (E)\"\n\n```\nlet function_1 = function(input) {\n  input = input.toLowerCase();\n  switch (input) {\n    case 'a', 'b', 'c':\n      return 'in-between'\n    case 'd', 'e', 'f':\n      return 'loud'\n    case 'g', 'h', 'i':\n      return 'out-of-sync'\n    case 'j', 'k', 'l':\n      return'soft'\n    default:\n      console.log('invalid(or none specified)')\n  }\n};\n```", "answer": "C: despair"}

Determine the minimum number of questions the teacher must ask to find out whether or not a student is good at one of the two subjects. **Example 1:**  The teacher asks each student "How many apples do you have?" and "What is your address?" One student has an answer to both questions "4 Bananas." If the teacher then asks "How many peanuts do you have?" and the student answers "24," it's obvious he or she is not good at math. Now the teacher knows the answers for at least 4 students and can find out the remaining answers. **Example 2:**  In this case, the teacher will ask each student "If your uncle died and left you money, what would you do with it?" and "Wanna pizza?". The one student who answers only "No way!" to the first question has an answer to the second question. **Output Format:**<n>**Case 1:** The answer to the question is "yes".<n><n><n>[Link to Solutions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19489439/how-can-i-determine-the-minimum-number-of-questions-the-teacher-must-ask-to-fi)<n><n><n>## Code Challenge:<n><n>The program must print a string that is the maximum length possible and has a given number of 'A's.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n><n><n>Input:Sam didn't like the people he met while traveling.  What might he do to get away from them? Choices:  A: come home B: airplane C: learn from each other D: go out E: make art<n>Output:		C<n><n><n>input: Sam did not like the people he met.  He will not travel with people on an airplane because it<n>is uncomfortable. But, he wants to get to know each other and wants to go out for meals.<n>Answer: B<n><n><n># Instructions<n>1. Create a class called Airplane.  An Airplane can have:<n>    - a single passenger<n>    - multiple passengers (which is more the normal case)<n>2. For the single passenger class, implement getNumSeats() to return the number of seats for a single passenger Airplane.  The seat class has 2 properties:<n>    - seatNum - represents a seat number.  The getSeatNum() method just returns the seat number.<n>    - occupancy - represents the occupancy of the seat.  You can also overload operator = and operator ==.<n><n>3. For the passenger class, this class holds the seats info for an airplane.  This class will contain a single object of the seat class.  The passenger class defines:<n>    - getNumPassengers() - will return the number of passengers in that Airplane<n>    - setPassenger() - will be used to set a single passenger to a seat, which will set the occupancy on each occupancy.  You will write a class method that takes in a seatNum and a passenger, in order to set the passenger on the seat.  Whenever passenger on the given seat is set, this will take care of setting all other occupancy on the Airplane for that passenger.<n><n>4. To test this functionality, implement a couple of functions:<n>    - getTotalPrice<n>    - getPassengerPrice (returns the price that the passenger pays)<n><n>5. Implement a bookInAirplane() function that takes in multiple passengers as input and returns a single Airplane object, booking only those seats based on the seats available and the seats they have booked.<n>6. To test this, I would provide a function with all the bookings which must return the Airplane that was returned by the booking function.<n><n>7. Implement getNumberOfBookedPassengers method for Airplane.  This will be used when the booking function has already passed in all airplane bookings.  The getBookedPassengers method should return the number of the passengers which booked seats in that airplane.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n><n><n>Input:Who designs a building? Choices:  A: builders B: driver C: architect D: fall down E: tradesmen<n>Output:		A is the best Answer.<n><n>#### Explanation:<n><n>Builders are the people who make buildings. This seems like a clearcut answer, but is it really that simple?<n>The dictionary definition of a builder is "one who builds a thing". It could be said that the architect is whoever builds a building, but I don't think that's what is meant by the word "builder". Sure, it's the architect who designs a building, but a builder is one who assembles or constructs something. Thus, it is not the architect that is a builder, but rather the builder.<n>As for being an architect, it is the builder who builds the house, not the architect. The architect designs the plan for the house to be built. The builder takes the plan and puts it in practice, making it come to life. The builder is the one who is able to produce tangible results, while the architect is merely a person who has ideas. The builder is the person who is able to turn a plan into a real, functional building.<n><n>#### Code:<n>```<n>from tkinter import *<n><n>def run():<n>    #create Label<n>    l = Label(root, text="Who designs a building?")<n>    l.pack(fill=X)<n><n>    #create Options<n>    options = ["A: builders", "B: driver", "C: architect", "D: fall down", "E: tradesmen"]<n>    values = []<n><n>    #create Option Menu<n>    for i in range(0,len(options)):<n>        o = OptionMenu(root,values,*options[i])<n>        o.pack(padx=20,pady=30)<n>    <n>    #create and add Button to the button frame<n>    b = Button(text="Ok", command = lambda : quit()).pack(side = BOTTOM)<n>    #for now, just disable the button for now<n>    b.config(state=DISABLED)<n>    #run tkinter app<n>    root.mainloop()<n><n>root = Tk()<n>run()<n>```<n><n>#### Test Cases:<n><n>```<n>print(run())<n>print(run()) <n>```

We then populate rows one by one starting with (1, 1).<n>And fill each DP cell with the maximum among four possibilities:<n><n>1) DP cell of index i=1 + DP cell of index(i-1) (as it is just a sum) <n><n>2) DP cell of i=3 + DP cell of i2<n><n>2) Dp cell of index(i+1)<n><n>3) 1<n><n>Basically this allows us to have 3 values for each index (0 to N):<n>(0,0) the base case <n><n>(i,i) : value from previous step <n><n>(i+1,i) : Value for max case (max among previous cells )<n><n>So we call this: <n><n>DPTable(i,i) = DPTable(i-1,i-1) or if new value for i+1 is greater, DPTable(i,i+1)<n>

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n><n><n>Input:The man needed balls of cotton, where should he look? Choices:  A: south B: georgia C: north carolina D: pocket E: medicine cabinet<n>Output:		Answer the question by replacing A with "South", B with "Georgia", C with "North Carolina", D with "Pocket", and E with "Medicine cabinet".<n><n><n>Explanation of the Solution:Answer the question by changing each one of the choices to the man's answer. If the choices are valid, then the answer is B, because A would be incorrect since "south" isn't a geographic place and D would be incorrect because "pocket" isn't a valid place to look. If a choice is not valid, then the man would choose D and look in his pocket. A valid choice can be a valid location (like A, where the man is searching for "South"). Additionally, A can also be a non-word, such as "South", which isn't a location, but is valid since the test can't recognize it as a correct answer. A isn't valid, though, if it is a nonsensical word, like "South."<n><n><n><n><n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question by choosing the most likely answer<n><n>The answer to the following multiple choice question:<n><n>A: He is getting cold<n>B: He needs his hat<n>C: He is feeling under the weather<n>D: He is getting hungry<n>Output 1: B<n>Output 2: B<n>Output 3: C<n>Output 4: D<n>Output 5: D<n><n><n>The man needed hats, where should he look?:Choices: A: his closet B: pocket C: medicine cabinet D: shelf<n>Output:Answer the man's question by choosing the most probable choice.<n><n>Explanation:A, B, and C make sense as choices, giving the most answers to the question whether the man has access to that item or not.<n><n><n><n><n>  <n>Output of the First Instruction<n>The man needed hampers, where should he look:<n><n><n><n><n>Choices: A: shelf B: corner C: draw D: cabinet<n><n><n><n>Explanations<n><n>There are several logical choices:A: if the shelf isn't in his home, then he could probably live in an office and work at a desk, and so hampers could be his primary household item.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n><n><n>Input:Where would there be a connection to go to another place? Choices:  A: wires B: electrical circuit C: computer network D: wall E: freeway<n>Output:		A: wires<n><n><n><n>[What we call “electrical circuit”](https://www.instapaper.com/p/78148794) is not just a “circuit”, it is also [a conductor of the electrical flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_current). This leads to the connection mentioned in your question. Therefore, answer choice A is correct, and other answer choices are incorrect.<n><n><n><n>#### Solution:  <n><n>We're going to start with option A, then B, then C, then D, and finally E.<n>- _**A**: _ The dictionary states that “wire” is something “made of metal strands or fibers twisted, arranged in parallel, and supported by metal casings”. The [conductor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conductor&redirect=no) is just the metal support that these wires are attached to. Since a circuit contains all of the supporting hardware that a circuit needs, we would say that a circuit contains "wires." An electrical circuit contains “wires".<n><n>- _**B**: _ For us to make a circuit, we must first make a connection from a wire to another wire. We know that “electrical circuit” contains “wires”, therefore, a connection must also contain a wire, to connect to another wire. By this reasoning, we can also say that an electrical circuit contains connections.<n><n>- _**C**: _ The dictionary describes a network as “a system consisting of a large number of computers interconnected by communication lines”. The connection can also be made by other means, but generally, in this age of advanced computer technology, they are made by hardwiring or communication lines. The dictionary does not speak of an actual physical “wire”; but it is common to use the term “network” to describe a computer circuit. Therefore, an electrical circuit does not have to contain an electrical connection. If we can prove that a network requires an electrical connection, then we would also say that networks contain electrical connections. We can't find an explicit definition for “electrical connection” in the dictionary, but we can infer that “an electrical connection” means that these two points in a wire are connected together. <n><n>- _**D**: _

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n><n><n>Input:What are people playing when they want to take the lead with small papers? Choices:  A: very heavy B: video game C: news article D: card game E: lead pencil<n>Output:		 A<n><n>### Explain:Answer this question.<n><n>I think a lead pencil is heavy. So it will let him take lead.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question after the image.<n><n><n>![image description](https://i0.wp.com/uploads.quizletcdn.com/24/images/play_1a1acda2-0727-407f-8d7f-3f4789e21289_s.png?w=800&ssl=1 "image description")<n><n><n>Explanation:<n>If I am you, I will find the answer as “yes” then because in the picture that is on the question it shows that you are playing a video game. This is what a video game is used for and it takes away a paper in my view. So that is a lead paper and can also be said "lead paper takes away". Now there is a news article which is a small paper and it will take it away. So I think that this is correct.<n><n><n>I think the other choices are not right because they are not connected enough to the picture. For example lead pencil is wrong because it is not being used. It will not let him take lead but not be used. News article will probably be used but I don't see it is playing the game. So the question needs to be asked the correct way and the answers need to be true.<n>

The question you're answering for the practice quiz is not something that is easily answered by a script, because there are many ways to mark a correct answer.

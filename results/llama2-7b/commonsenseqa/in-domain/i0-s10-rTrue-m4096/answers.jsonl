Determine the minimum number of questions the teacher must ask to find out whether or not a student is good at one of the two subjects. **Example 1:**  The teacher asks each student \"How many apples do you have?\" and \"What is your address?\" One student has an answer to both questions \"4 Bananas.\" If the teacher then asks \"How many peanuts do you have?\" and the student answers \"24,\" it's obvious he or she is not good at math. Now the teacher knows the answers for at least 4 students and can find out the remaining answers. **Example 2:**  In this case, the teacher will ask each student \"If your uncle died and left you money, what would you do with it?\" and \"Wanna pizza?\". The one student who answers only \"No way!\" to the first question has an answer to the second question. **Output Format:**\n**Case 1:** The answer to the question is \"yes\".\n\n\n[Link to Solutions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19489439/how-can-i-determine-the-minimum-number-of-questions-the-teacher-must-ask-to-fi)\n\n\n## Code Challenge:\n\nThe program must print a string that is the maximum length possible and has a given number of 'A's.

I searched loneliness and i tried to click on every result found. The most results found are mostly about how to get over loneliness then I started to click on one of the results on how to get over lonelelesness and this is what I find: \n###How to get over lonelines:\n\n\n* Be productive\n* Stay engaged\n* Be generous\n* Don't be afraid to ask for help\n* Try talking with others\n* Don't limit yourself to your own experiences\n* Build your support network\n* Find a support group\n* Practice mindfulness and meditation\n* Join a gym\n* Take a class\n\n\n\n#Explanation:\n##1-Be productive:\nMany people like being productive, we like to get things done, so if we do something productive and productive enough then loneliness does not have a big place in our life.\n\n\n##2-Stay engaged:\nWe try to avoid being lonely by staying engaged by having fun with our friends or other people we like. we try to avoid being lonley by doing things we like\n\n\n##3-Be generous:\nWe do this by helping others, helping others relieves us from loneliness because we help them and as a result we feel like we have made a difference in their life and we get over what we have a problem with.\n\n\n##4-Don't be afraid to asked for help:\nThere are people who know what it is like to feel lonely, so we should not be afraid to ask for our help, sometimes our friends will be the persons who will support us.\n\n\n##5-Try talking with others:\nBeing lonely in some cases is a situation that is temporary, so we try to overcome this situation by talking with other people and", "answer": "D: socialize"}

But, he wants to get to know each other and wants to go out for meals.\nAnswer: B\n\n\n# Instructions\n1. Create a class called Airplane.  An Airplane can have:\n    - a single passenger\n    - multiple passengers (which is more the normal case)\n2. For the single passenger class, implement getNumSeats() to return the number of seats for a single passenger Airplane.  The seat class has 2 properties:\n    - seatNum - represents a seat number.  The getSeatNum() method just returns the seat number.\n    - occupancy - represents the occupancy of the seat.  You can also overload operator = and operator ==.\n\n3. For the passenger class, this class holds the seats info for an airplane.  This class will contain a single object of the seat class.  The passenger class defines:\n    - getNumPassengers() - will return the number of passengers in that Airplane\n    - setPassenger() - will be used to set a single passenger to a seat, which will set the occupancy on each occupancy.  You will write a class method that takes in a seatNum and a passenger, in order to set the passenger on the seat.  Whenever passenger on the given seat is set, this will take care of setting all other occupancy on the Airplane for that passenger.\n\n4. To test this functionality, implement a couple of functions:\n    - getTotalPrice\n    - getPassengerPrice (returns the price that the passenger pays)\n\n5. Implement a bookInAirplane() function that takes in multiple passengers as input and returns a single Airplane object, booking only those seats based on the seats available and the seats they have booked.\n6. To test this, I would provide a function with all the bookings which must return the Airplane that was returned by the booking function.\n\n7. Implement getNumberOfBookedPassengers method for Airplane.  This will be used when the booking function has already passed in all airplane bookings.  The getBookedPassengers method should return the number of the passengers which booked seats in that airplane.", "answer": "A: come home"}

{"idx": 975, "text": "A is the best Answer.\n\n#### Explanation:\n\nBuilders are the people who make buildings. This seems like a clearcut answer, but is it really that simple?\nThe dictionary definition of a builder is \"one who builds a thing\". It could be said that the architect is whoever builds a building, but I don't think that's what is meant by the word \"builder\". Sure, it's the architect who designs a building, but a builder is one who assembles or constructs something. Thus, it is not the architect that is a builder, but rather the builder.\nAs for being an architect, it is the builder who builds the house, not the architect. The architect designs the plan for the house to be built. The builder takes the plan and puts it in practice, making it come to life. The builder is the one who is able to produce tangible results, while the architect is merely a person who has ideas. The builder is the person who is able to turn a plan into a real, functional building.\n\n#### Code:\n```\nfrom tkinter import *\n\ndef run():\n    #create Label\n    l = Label(root, text=\"Who designs a building?\")\n    l.pack(fill=X)\n\n    #create Options\n    options = [\"A: builders\", \"B: driver\", \"C: architect\", \"D: fall down\", \"E: tradesmen\"]\n    values = []\n\n    #create Option Menu\n    for i in range(0,len(options)):\n        o = OptionMenu(root,values,*options[i])\n        o.pack(padx=20,pady=30)\n    \n    #create and add Button to the button frame\n    b = Button(text=\"Ok\", command = lambda : quit()).pack(side = BOTTOM)\n    #for now, just disable the button for now\n    b.config(state=DISABLED)\n    #run tkinter app\n    root.mainloop()\n\nroot = Tk()\nrun()\n```\n\n#### Test Cases:\n\n```\nprint(run())\nprint(run()) \n```", "answer": "C: architect"}

{"idx": 462, "text": "Answer the question by replacing A with \"South\", B with \"Georgia\", C with \"North Carolina\", D with \"Pocket\", and E with \"Medicine cabinet\".\n\n\nExplanation of the Solution:Answer the question by changing each one of the choices to the man's answer. If the choices are valid, then the answer is B, because A would be incorrect since \"south\" isn't a geographic place and D would be incorrect because \"pocket\" isn't a valid place to look. If a choice is not valid, then the man would choose D and look in his pocket. A valid choice can be a valid location (like A, where the man is searching for \"South\"). Additionally, A can also be a non-word, such as \"South\", which isn't a location, but is valid since the test can't recognize it as a correct answer. A isn't valid, though, if it is a nonsensical word, like \"South.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question by choosing the most likely answer\n\nThe answer to the following multiple choice question:\n\nA: He is getting cold\nB: He needs his hat\nC: He is feeling under the weather\nD: He is getting hungry\nOutput 1: B\nOutput 2: B\nOutput 3: C\nOutput 4: D\nOutput 5: D\n\n\nThe man needed hats, where should he look?:Choices: A: his closet B: pocket C: medicine cabinet D: shelf\nOutput:Answer the man's question by choosing the most probable choice.\n\nExplanation:A, B, and C make sense as choices, giving the most answers to the question whether the man has access to that item or not.\n\n\n\n\n  \nOutput of the First Instruction\nThe man needed hampers, where should he look:\n\n\n\n\nChoices: A: shelf B: corner C: draw D: cabinet\n\n\n\nExplanations\n\nThere are several logical choices:A: if the shelf isn't in his home, then he could probably live in an office and work at a desk, and so hampers could be his primary household item.

Great out door not related.\nD doesn't work, in the rain forest, monkeys always live in tree tops. But if you are in the zoo, it's not the wild, they may live at zoo, but it's not the out door.\n\nThen, here are two choices I think you need to consider.\n\n* Monkey in tree tops\n\n* Monkey at zoo\n\n\n\nThere are two branches like this:\n\nif you take the branch at tree tops:\n\n\n\nThen, you need to take the other branch at zoo.\n\n\n\nHere the probability that monkey live at tree tops at the first floor is P=X/T(1), then you need to take the second floor and divide by X/T(2).\n\n\n\nThen at zoo, it's like this:\n\n\n\nIf X=2, then you need to divide by 2.\nFor example, \n\nP(X/T)=1/4, then at zoo, \n\n    P= X/T=1/4/2=2/8=1/4,  \n     then T= 4 or 2 T=2\n\n\n\nIn fact, here is my way: \n\n\n\nThen you need to divide P by T, it's like:\n\nP(x)/T= (1/4) / 2=2/8\n\n\n\nand then divide T by X, it's like, \n\nT/(4)=(2),\n\n2 /8=2/4\n\nTherefore, in total, you got 2/8, it's your answer!\n\n\n\n### Solution:", "answer": "A: tree tops"}

This leads to the connection mentioned in your question. Therefore, answer choice A is correct, and other answer choices are incorrect.\n\n\n\n#### Solution:  \n\nWe're going to start with option A, then B, then C, then D, and finally E.\n- _**A**: _ The dictionary states that \u201cwire\u201d is something \u201cmade of metal strands or fibers twisted, arranged in parallel, and supported by metal casings\u201d. The [conductor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conductor&redirect=no) is just the metal support that these wires are attached to. Since a circuit contains all of the supporting hardware that a circuit needs, we would say that a circuit contains \"wires.\" An electrical circuit contains \u201cwires\".\n\n- _**B**: _ For us to make a circuit, we must first make a connection from a wire to another wire. We know that \u201celectrical circuit\u201d contains \u201cwires\u201d, therefore, a connection must also contain a wire, to connect to another wire. By this reasoning, we can also say that an electrical circuit contains connections.\n\n- _**C**: _ The dictionary describes a network as \u201ca system consisting of a large number of computers interconnected by communication lines\u201d. The connection can also be made by other means, but generally, in this age of advanced computer technology, they are made by hardwiring or communication lines. The dictionary does not speak of an actual physical \u201cwire\u201d; but it is common to use the term \u201cnetwork\u201d to describe a computer circuit. Therefore, an electrical circuit does not have to contain an electrical connection. If we can prove that a network requires an electrical connection, then we would also say that networks contain electrical connections. We can't find an explicit definition for \u201celectrical connection\u201d in the dictionary, but we can infer that \u201can electrical connection\u201d means that these two points in a wire are connected together. \n\n- _**D**: _", "answer": "E: freeway"}

Unfortunately, you tagged this with Javascript and Python. If you're going to tag your question, please make sure the one is relevant, otherwise your question might get closed.\nIf you had any specific questions, I'd be happy to explain anything, but the whole reason for SO is people come asking _how to implement this,_ instead of _can someone help me with my assignment._\n\nComment: @DavidePedrazzini Hi. Thanks for noting. I didn't have any specific questions. I know how to implement it but I didn't know the logic. I thought it was a simple question so i didn't have a question.\n\nComment: @BubuGuitar, welcome to SO! The question you're answering for the practice quiz is not something that is easily answered by a script, because there are many ways to mark a correct answer. For what reason are you being asked this question? The best way to answer questions like this is to look at the full exam and see how this question is marked.\n\nComment: \"Need help\": **I can't help you if I don't know what you need", "answer": "D: city centre"}

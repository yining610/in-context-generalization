This takes some work, and includes jury selection, jury instruction, evidence gathering, defense objections to evidence, and trial.  The only thing standing between an accused person and a conviction is a jury, which has been selected, and if you are innocent, you should find a way to convince the jury.<n>```<n>Note:I choose the answer 'A: go to jail' as the correct one as the last word of the question in this text, the answer is 'Judgement'.<n><n>```<n><n>```<n><n><n><n>

I have designed an approach which is given in the following:<n><n>![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68656720/140741354-3364f520-9466-42ab-ae05-5fb37074a84e.png)<n><n><n><n>In the above picture, I have designed an app with these functionality. For taking the input: the 'Scanner' class will call method 'GetInput()' which reads the values from the keyboard. Then this class will call the 'Controller' class and 'Display' class. Then I have used 'Controller' class to assign the input to variables. This class calls 'Display' class where it takes the values which are in the form of string and then displays them on the console as a string or a number by using the 'print' function. Then, when the input is scanned, I have called the 'ProcessInput' method and this method will ask user's input, then will store in the 'InpArray' variable by using the 'input' function. Then, this variable will be passed to the 'Scanner' and 'Display' class and this way the input will be taken in my app.<n><n>### Code:<n><n>Scanner: <n><n><n>```<n>class Scanner:<n>    Scan = [] # This variable will be used to store the scan results<n>    Scanner_array = []<n>    <n>    <n>    def GetInput(self): # This method will call the 'input()' function to<n>                        # read values from the keyboard<n>            <n>                            self.Scanner_array.append(input("Please, enter your <n>                                                            first character:"))<n>   <n>                        # then this method call 'add()' to add the input character to<n>                        # the Scanner array<n>                        <n>                            self.Scan.append(self.Scanner_array[-1])<n>                        <n>                        # the above method call 'get()' to get the  Scanner_array<n>                        <n>

She knows that each common word shares just one of its letters, each letter being unique. Moreover, all these words are of the form abc, where a, b, and c are letters. Note that Alice can not guess by themselves.<n>Given two common words, she can always tell whether they are the same by just looking at how they start. If they share the same first letter, then they are the same common word. If they do not share the same first letter and not exactly the same lengths, then they are not the same common word.<n>Informally speaking, Alice can only recognize a word after she sees the first two letters of that word. She wonders what the minimum number of different common words are where she can not tell them apart just by looking at the first two letters.<n>The first line of input consists of n integers a1, a2,..., an (2 ≤ n ≤ 40) denoting the number of letters in each common word.<n>The second line of input consists of the first two letters of the first common word, which must be distinct.<n>For 1 ≤ i ≤ n, the ith line of input contains a single integer Ai (0 ≤ Ai

This problem takes the DFS to an extreme where it explores all the possible children (edges) of a particular vertex, then it explores the possible children of these children and so on and so forth. The algorithm is called *Depth Limited Search* ( DLS ) or *Depth First Search on Graph*<n> <n>### Example<n>For the question given above, we have to check whether the answer for child being entertained and walk slowly is both possible or not. Here the graph is as below:<n><n><img alt="drawing" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78531354/117876798-9aaab980-bffd-11eb-8cad-98e06615e7aa.png"><n><n>```<n>(1) -> (2) -> (3) -> (4) -> (5)<n><n>```<n><n>### Algorithm<n>The algorithm is to make a recursive DFS from vertex 1 to vertex 5 by following the order above. For every vertex, check if the answer is included in the answer list. Note that for each vertex, this will take only O(n) time as DFS is Degree of vertex ordered.<n><n><n># BFS <n><n>## Definition<n>In a directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), a BFS traverses the graph by exploring the vertices in the other direction. Every time a vertex is visited it is marked as “exited”, and all its unvisited children (edges) are marked as visited.

List of names are separated by a new line<n>and the numbers next to the names are to the left separated by a new line. The numbers to the left of the names indicates the number of correct and<n>incorrect guesses. The program's input is the path to a file and the program's output is the path to a new file with the same name as the current file<n>without its extension and the new file will contain the correct guesses for the names and their correct and incorrect guesses. For example the file<n>input is:<n><n>```<n>Multiplechoice<n>Gavin<n>2<n>0<n><n>Tom<n>1<n>3<n><n>Anna<n>3<n>4<n><n>Anna<n>4<n>2<n>```<n>The program's output is:<n><n>```python<n><MultipleChoice.MultipleChoice() MultipleChoice.MultipleChoice.write_correct_guesses()><n>```<n>### Input Data: The input file will consist of the same names as the input file. Lists separated with 2 new lines and 0 new lines separating the lists.<n><n><n>### Output Data:The output file will be the same filename minus its extension, it will contain the new data, the number of correct guesses, the number<n>of incorrect guesses.

[](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search)<n><n>### Instruction:The dictionary is a two-dimensional character array defined as<n><n>char dictionary[][26];<n><n>### Instructions and solution:<n><n>1. Your program must read two character arrays from "string" and "dictionary". The first array to be read is "string".  It can be any length up to 100 characters long. The character array will be converted into lowercase. If there are any uppercase characters they will be ignored during the conversion. The second array to be read is the dictionary.  <n><n>2. The input to your program will be converted into lower case and passed to your program as a character array.  <n><n>The character array "string" will contain a sentence of words that you need to locate in the dictionary character array. The sentence will be a combination of letters such as the following:<n><n>```<n>"the cat sits on the table"<n>```<n><n>3. If the word is in the dictionary,  <n><n>then output the letter in the same order. The character array "dictionary" will be made up of words that are already known. Those words will not be modified.  <n><n>4. For the example given above if the string "the cat sits on teh table" is passed, then "table" will not be output because "table" is not found in the dictionary.<n><n>**Note:**<n><n>1. The dictionary is made up of uppercase words.<n><n>2. "teh" is a word in the dictionary and will not be output.<n><n>3. If "teh" is part of a larger word, it will be ignored. If it is part of a word and you need the full word, add the word to your dictionary. Do not add the letter "e" as I have done with the sample sentence. "teh" will only be looked at if there is no more words left.<n><n>4. "table" is a word that is in the dictionary and will be output by your program.<n><n>5. Any word that is repeated will be ignored. Words that are repeated should be added to your dictionary. If the word is found in the dictionary multiple times the last one will be output.<n><n>  <n><n>### Input:<n><n>```<n>dictionary[][] = {

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n><n><n>Input:Where would you put a folding chair if you do not plan to use it and you do not have any large doors in your house? Choices:  A: roof B: school C: beach D: closet E: garage<n>Output:		Choice (C)<n><n><n>### Solution:<n><n>For the input:<n>```C<n>A: roof<n>B: school<n>C: beach<n>```<n>We will apply recursive approach. The first 2 values are the base case to get the output Choice (C). We assume that beach is the third value and the beach is the base case. Therefore, we will return back to the beach part and calculate the value in beach. The value in beach is less than the first 2 values. So, we continue to recursive the function. In the second recursive we calculate the value in the C value which has <n>the answer in A and Beach. Since Value in Beach is more than A and value in Beach, we take the minimum of the two values which gets the answer D (choices A and Beach). So, we will get Choice (D). Next, we continue with recursive function. In the third recursive part we get the answer in Input A. Since, the value in C is equal between B and C and A. So, we continue with recursion. We calculate again on the C part and we get value in C to be same as A. So, the value in C becomes less than A. Since, A is the lowest value in the answer Choices. So,the recursion will terminate and gets the final answer of Value (A) which the answer is (D).<n><n><n>### Follow-up<n><n>Can you solve this problem recursively rather than with a loop?<n><n>

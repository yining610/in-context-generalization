One pencil may be yellow but it was a yellow pencil and the next yellow pencil may be brown! I learnt to go beyond the color to decide the color of pencil\n\n### 2015-10-11, 18:03:21\n### What challenges arose?\n\nThe main challenge was going beyond the label of the pencil to decide it's exact color!\n\n### 3. How did I solve this problem?\n\nI divided the problem into sub problems like:  - How do i decide the color of a pen, since pencils can have multiple colors.  - What happens when the color of a pencil is unknown by the pen machine?  (like a broken pencil or a very dark color pencil or a pencil with some marks)\n\n### 4. What was particularly difficult?\n\nI did not know what to do with a pencil which was broken, with a very dark color or with some marks\n\n### 5. What did I find interesting?\n\nI found the pencil machine and the problems with the pencil and the pen to be very challenging and interesting\n\n### 6. Did I solve the problem exactly as specified?\n\n> Yes! This question is a variation of the assignment description. I have solved the problem correctly.\n\n### 7. Did I learn anything new? If so what was it?\n\nYes, I learned that to determine the color of pencils isnt easy as it seems. You have to determine the color of the pencil as much as possible\n\n### 8. What challenges arise in scaling this solution?\n\nTo scale this solution, we have to scale each of the sub problems.

This takes some work, and includes jury selection, jury instruction, evidence gathering, defense objections to evidence, and trial.  The only thing standing between an accused person and a conviction is a jury, which has been selected, and if you are innocent, you should find a way to convince the jury.\n```\nNote:I choose the answer 'A: go to jail' as the correct one as the last word of the question in this text, the answer is 'Judgement'.\n\n```\n\n```", "answer": "D: death"}

For example, if the input is \u201cA\u201d it should return an integer corresponding to the letter A and if the input is \u201cC\u201d it should return an string \u201cC\u201d instead.\nQuestion 2: Rewrite the function get-answer in the question_2.py file to work on your answer to the first question. It should compare your answer to the possible choices and return a string \u201cCorrect\u201d, \u201cIncorrect\u201d, or \u201cUndefined\u201d. For example, if A was the correct answer then the function should return a string \u201cCorrent\u201d.\n\nQuestion 3: The first person in line will get the job done and 4 people will be paid: 4 people will be given $100 if you think A is the correct answer or $50 if you think A isn\u2019t the correct answer. 4 people will be awarded $100 if the correct answer is B or they will be given $50 if the correct answer isn\u2019t B.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructions for Assignment 2: Use the above code snippets and your original code for Question 3 to solve the following problems: \n\n\n-1.

{"idx": 634, "text": "Choice\n\n### My approach is to think in terms of the OO concept\n\nIn this problem, for the first time, I have to design an application which has functionalities of reading input, displaying the output & taking up the input again. I have designed an approach which is given in the following:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68656720/140741354-3364f520-9466-42ab-ae05-5fb37074a84e.png)\n\n\n\nIn the above picture, I have designed an app with these functionality. For taking the input: the 'Scanner' class will call method 'GetInput()' which reads the values from the keyboard. Then this class will call the 'Controller' class and 'Display' class. Then I have used 'Controller' class to assign the input to variables. This class calls 'Display' class where it takes the values which are in the form of string and then displays them on the console as a string or a number by using the 'print' function. Then, when the input is scanned, I have called the 'ProcessInput' method and this method will ask user's input, then will store in the 'InpArray' variable by using the 'input' function. Then, this variable will be passed to the 'Scanner' and 'Display' class and this way the input will be taken in my app.\n\n### Code:\n\nScanner: \n\n\n```\nclass Scanner:\n    Scan = [] # This variable will be used to store the scan results\n    Scanner_array = []\n    \n    \n    def GetInput(self): # This method will call the 'input()' function to\n                        # read values from the keyboard\n            \n                            self.Scanner_array.append(input(\"Please, enter your \n                                                            first character:\"))\n   \n                        # then this method call 'add()' to add the input character to\n                        # the Scanner array\n                        \n                            self.Scan.append(self.Scanner_array[-1])\n                        \n                        # the above method call 'get()' to get the  Scanner_array", "answer": "A: medicine cabinet"}

{"idx": 778, "text": "A child is more likely to be entertained then walk slowly while going to play  \nExplanation: The correct answer is A, B, C, D, B, B\n\n\n# DFS\n### Definition\nIn a directed acyclic graph (DAG), a DFS (Depth First Search) explores all possible ways from one vertex in the graph to arrive at the other vertices, and a BFS( Breadth First Search) exploring the same in the other direction. This problem takes the DFS to an extreme where it explores all the possible children (edges) of a particular vertex, then it explores the possible children of these children and so on and so forth. The algorithm is called *Depth Limited Search* ( DLS ) or *Depth First Search on Graph*\n \n### Example\nFor the question given above, we have to check whether the answer for child being entertained and walk slowly is both possible or not. Here the graph is as below:\n\n<img alt=\"drawing\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78531354/117876798-9aaab980-bffd-11eb-8cad-98e06615e7aa.png\">\n\n```\n(1) -> (2) -> (3) -> (4) -> (5)\n\n```\n\n### Algorithm\nThe algorithm is to make a recursive DFS from vertex 1 to vertex 5 by following the order above. For every vertex, check if the answer is included in the answer list. Note that for each vertex, this will take only O(n) time as DFS is Degree of vertex ordered.\n\n\n# BFS \n\n## Definition\nIn a directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), a BFS traverses the graph by exploring the vertices in the other direction. Every time a vertex is visited it is marked as \u201cexited\u201d, and all its unvisited children (edges) are marked as visited. This process keeps going till all the vertices are marked.\n\n\n# Example\n\n### The Problem\n<img alt=\"a.jpeg\" src=\"https://github.com/LuckyThanakorn/AlgorithmsandDataStructure/blob/main", "answer": "A: laugh"}

The goal is the same.\n\n\n\nInstructions:\n\nYou are a programmer creating a program that performs operations on a list of names in a MultipleChoice. List of names are separated by a new line\nand the numbers next to the names are to the left separated by a new line. The numbers to the left of the names indicates the number of correct and\nincorrect guesses. The program's input is the path to a file and the program's output is the path to a new file with the same name as the current file\nwithout its extension and the new file will contain the correct guesses for the names and their correct and incorrect guesses. For example the file\ninput is:\n\n```\nMultiplechoice\nGavin\n2\n0\n\nTom\n1\n3\n\nAnna\n3\n4\n\nAnna\n4\n2\n```\nThe program's output is:\n\n```python\n<MultipleChoice.MultipleChoice() MultipleChoice.MultipleChoice.write_correct_guesses()>\n```\n### Input Data: The input file will consist of the same names as the input file. Lists separated with 2 new lines and 0 new lines separating the lists.\n\n\n### Output Data:The output file will be the same filename minus its extension, it will contain the new data, the number of correct guesses, the number\nof incorrect guesses. It will be in the exact order as the file without the extension.\n\n\n## Instructions\nThe MultipleChoice Module is defined in the MultipleChoice.py file. \nTo use it the first step is to have a data file with your data into which ever format\nyou can use. You can then use the Module, you put a list of names into the List() Function\n(in this Module this list was created using a variable) and this list is then read for the\nnames and their correct and incorrect answers. Each name must be put in a separate\nlines for it to be read for its correct and incorrect answers. Finally, you must use the \nMultipleChoice.write() Function to write the correct and incorrect answers into the output\nfile as well as the number of correct and", "answer": "A: depressed"}

{"idx": 659, "text": "A\n\n\nExplanation:When the word 'kitchen sink' is mentioned, a sink is almost always understood as the 'faucet/taps/ spout with water' which is found in kitchens. If you're wondering, that's not 'the water from the faucet or spout', but water from the tap or spout. So, 'your kitchen sink' means a sink. If there's a sink in a kitchen, then the only possible places to store foodstuffs in a kitchen is a cupboard or a grocery store or a pantry or a cellar.

B: Smart. C: Not any more intelligent.

Mary's dog is very smart, and Dmitri's is not any more smart than Mary's.\n2. Mary's dog and Dmitri'sm are both smart, but Mary's dog is not any more intelligent than Dmitri'sm\n3. Mary's dog has lesser intelligence and Dmitri'sdog is smarter (miserably so).\n\nWhat you can't say is that Dmitri's 'intelligence' is the same as that of Mary's. Mary's dog's intelligence levels to Dmitri'sdogs intelligence levels is impossible to compare.\n\n\n### Instruction:\"This is a new pencil.

[](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search)\n\n### Instruction:The dictionary is a two-dimensional character array defined as\n\nchar dictionary[][26];\n\n### Instructions and solution:\n\n1. Your program must read two character arrays from \"string\" and \"dictionary\". The first array to be read is \"string\".  It can be any length up to 100 characters long. The character array will be converted into lowercase. If there are any uppercase characters they will be ignored during the conversion. The second array to be read is the dictionary.  \n\n2. The input to your program will be converted into lower case and passed to your program as a character array.  \n\nThe character array \"string\" will contain a sentence of words that you need to locate in the dictionary character array. The sentence will be a combination of letters such as the following:\n\n```\n\"the cat sits on the table\"\n```\n\n3. If the word is in the dictionary,  \n\nthen output the letter in the same order. The character array \"dictionary\" will be made up of words that are already known. Those words will not be modified.  \n\n4. For the example given above if the string \"the cat sits on teh table\" is passed, then \"table\" will not be output because \"table\" is not found in the dictionary.\n\n**Note:**\n\n1. The dictionary is made up of uppercase words.\n\n2. \"teh\" is a word in the dictionary and will not be output.\n\n3. If \"teh\" is part of a larger word, it will be ignored. If it is part of a word and you need the full word, add the word to your dictionary. Do not add the letter \"e\" as I have done with the sample sentence. \"teh\" will only be looked at if there is no more words left.\n\n4. \"table\" is a word that is in the dictionary and will be output by your program.\n\n5. Any word that is repeated will be ignored. Words that are repeated should be added to your dictionary. If the word is found in the dictionary multiple times the last one will be output.\n\n  \n\n### Input:\n\n```\ndictionary[][] = {", "answer": "D: michigan"}

{"idx": 108, "text": "Choice (C)\n\n\n### Solution:\n\nFor the input:\n```C\nA: roof\nB: school\nC: beach\n```\nWe will apply recursive approach. The first 2 values are the base case to get the output Choice (C). We assume that beach is the third value and the beach is the base case. Therefore, we will return back to the beach part and calculate the value in beach. The value in beach is less than the first 2 values. So, we continue to recursive the function. In the second recursive we calculate the value in the C value which has \nthe answer in A and Beach. Since Value in Beach is more than A and value in Beach, we take the minimum of the two values which gets the answer D (choices A and Beach). So, we will get Choice (D). Next, we continue with recursive function. In the third recursive part we get the answer in Input A. Since, the value in C is equal between B and C and A. So, we continue with recursion. We calculate again on the C part and we get value in C to be same as A. So, the value in C becomes less than A. Since, A is the lowest value in the answer Choices. So,the recursion will terminate and gets the final answer of Value (A) which the answer is (D).\n\n\n### Follow-up\n\nCan you solve this problem recursively rather than with a loop?", "answer": "D: closet"}

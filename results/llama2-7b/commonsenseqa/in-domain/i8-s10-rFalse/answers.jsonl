Choices:  Monday: 100 hours  Tuesday: 102 hours  Wednesday: 104 hours  Thursday: 106 hours  Friday: 108 hours\nOutput: Wednesday:  ________\n\nHow long do you think it took to answer that question?  Well, you're probably still wondering, but I'm not going to tell you yet. We'll return to this soon but before that you may want to know how fast you can learn to answer something like this.\n\n# Time & Speed:\nAs you may already suspect, this is a skill that can be learned. Most people would think that taking an hour or two to answer something like this is acceptable but in fact, it's probably 7-10% of people that go above that time. If you look at professional job seekers you can see that their times are generally much faster.\n\nSo how fast can you learn for things like this? It turns out that it can vary a fair amount, but using a few experiments I've been able to get people to learn in time to consistently perform in less than a minute. To learn, it actually has less to do with your intelligence then practicing. In the book **Expert Performance** authors Clifford Nass and Ellen Langer suggest that it take 10,000 to 50,000 hours to master a skill or 10 years of dedicated time. You can even speed this up using 30-60 consecutive minutes a day and you can learn most tasks (not including motor skills) within 1-2 weeks.\n\nBut wait that's not all, because many people don't like to do the same thing over and over. One of the easiest ways to be successful is the [Pomodoro Method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro", "answer": "E: table"}

(The person is trying to find cat)\n\nIt should be: The cat is in the house and it sleeps in the room. (It's not on the bed but it is in a room)\n\nThis is because the object \"the person\" needs to change to \"the room\". This is because the object \"object\" can't be in other objects. Objects can be in other objects. Ex: The girl's room is in the house. In this sentence it means that the girl's room is an \"object\" and that the house is another \"object\". Now I know that there are sentences with different objects but that's kind of irrelevant. The main point is that the objects can't be contained in other objects.\n\nThe output is: The cat is sleeping inside and it lives in the house. (It's on the bed and it's alive) The person is correcting there fault by saying that the cat is on the bed. The person couldn't be bothered to say that it was in the house to get their point across and make them sound smarter. In this situation the person doesn't know what room the cat is in, let alone if the person is in that room so they correct the sentence to sound better.\n\n# Instruction to the student:Write the code to solve the above problem.\n\n```\n#!/usr/bin/python3\n\nimport os\nimport re", "answer": "B: look attractive"}

In this example, there are a total of 10 answers, however, there are 8 different letters that makes 8 \u2264 10, therefore we can say every answer is correct.\n\n### Problems 2\n(Ex.

Input:(train station where (B) is (2)\nOutput: B: trains (1)\n\n<br/>In Example 1, we don't have all the answers, and the last answer could be either A: book, or B: vegetables. Therefore, this means there could be either 1 possible combination or 2. Hence we can say either the answer is incorrect or at least possible to be incorrect.\n\nWe also need to remember that the total of 8 different answers in Example 1 is the same as having 10 examples and each of these examples are 1 of 8 possibilities. So in terms of the problem itself, there is not something wrong, however, it is not correct since there could be more than one possible outcome. This is why each example is not considered a solution as stated by the statement to \"Solve this problem.\"\n\nSo if we do this a total of 1,500 times {(1024 choose 10)} we will have a total number of combinations", "answer": "E: errors"}

The answer must be the **tailor**.<n><n>We can first check the wording. Because we are talking about the fabric, we know that we have curtains and then we add the cut at order.<n><n>This rule can then be applied to either C or D for the answers.<n><n>The answer is C, because it answers the question and the answer also works with the context.<n><n><n>#### 2: D<n><n>The question asks us where we would be if we are reading mags at a rail station because we are waiting for a train.<n><n>All answers are wrong. The answer is obviously at that place, a rail station. All others are out-of-context answers and not able to explain why we would be at it.<n><n>Another rule can be applied is that the answer should be a common word if it is also a noun. "Station" is a common word, "rail" is a common word and "traveling" is not a common word. The correct is at D, for obvious reasons we can't "travel" to the train station as people can travel "to" the train station.<n><n><n>## 3: C<n><n>The answer is engine because we mention car and car is an engine.<n><n><n>####4: F<n><n>The answer is G because we can assume that the note for a melody is probably a musical note, the same kind of note that you could find on sheet music? That is just what people write on sheet music, so it makes sense that the question would ask us about one place that notes are likely to have notes from a song.<n><n>You can note that the answer doesn't really matter for the question, as long as it works, it works.<n><n><n>####5: F<n><n>The question asks the location of a hammer, and the answers are in order.<n><n>As you can see, the first answer is a D, and we know that the question uses the words "in a box".

I like how to read the question and think about how to solve it.<n>1. I like the part where we have to use our vocabulary and our understanding of the questions and find answers.<n>1. I guess the hardest part was coming here and thinking where to start in order to answer the questions.<n>1. My first language, I guess, was the language that I did the better on. English is difficult for me to understand sometimes, but I liked the way it was explained in the language class.<n>1. I liked how we got asked questions and had to search the answer. I feel like my english got better and it was helpful for vocabulary.<n>1. At first it was a little difficult to understand how to think about the questions. I also need to work on reading questions in both German and English.<n>1. At the end of the class I was tired.<n>1. The class took a long time, I think it was good.<n>1. I think I did not use the vocabulary correctly and my answers were not very creative.<n>1. Sometimes I struggled to understand the question. We didn't have too much time though.<n>1. I felt like I didn't really know too much vocabulary, like clothing, tools and furniture. But for other questions, I managed pretty well.<n>1. Some vocabulary and spelling questions were harder for me.<n>1. My head is feeling tired. I think I should have done this the whole semester.<n>

The sun seems very hot, but you shouldn't touch it. When you touch the sun, it stays hot and burns you.<n><n>So if you must have the sun, just touch it by looking at it. You can look at it, because the sun just feels warm. If you want to see it, you can look at it with your eyes, because all colors light up to look dark to dark, so you can see the color of the sun through the darkness. You may even want to look at the sun through a camera or through a telescope because they see colors different.<n><n>All light is heat. The light of the sun is very hot when you feel warmth and heat on your skin. The light does not burn you, but it still makes contact with us all. We all see the light and the heat, but we will all burn if we are too close to the sun.<n><n>Sometimes we get used to looking at shining objects in the sunlight, so we can see objects when the lights go on. Some people even say they see colors better in sunlight than in dark places. Some people even say that the light is better than the color. We always learn to see colors with our eyes first, but the light and colors are important to see at all times. Just as colors exist all

The only thing i can think of is this site:https://quizzes.com/topics/multiple-choice which shows you how to write a quiz. But the site does not show you how to host that quiz for people to take and view the results. So it might good to look into that as an alternative to using Google sheets.<n>2. I would just recommend a good quiz or a questionnaire for the question section and then just using the answers in Google sheets to be displayed on the google site. This method of creating the question section would be more accurate and easier to manage for me.<n><n>#### Recommendation:<n>If you have not done so, I would recommend using the quizzes site i linked above. Its a quiz creator you can use from any computer and its free.<n><n>#### Future steps:<n>I want to edit the instruction section to not use the term Multiple Choice and I want to use the correct term Question and answer.<n>

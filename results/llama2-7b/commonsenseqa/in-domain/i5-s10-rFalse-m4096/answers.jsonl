Choices:  C: tool shed D: toolbox  E: handy person F: garage G: hardware store H: store front\nOutput: D: toolbox\n\n---\n\n### Answer with explanation\n\n#### 1: C\n\nThe question asks what type of seller the fabric was being cut for. The answer must be the **tailor**.\n\nWe can first check the wording. Because we are talking about the fabric, we know that we have curtains and then we add the cut at order.\n\nThis rule can then be applied to either C or D for the answers.\n\nThe answer is C, because it answers the question and the answer also works with the context.\n\n\n#### 2: D\n\nThe question asks us where we would be if we are reading mags at a rail station because we are waiting for a train.\n\nAll answers are wrong. The answer is obviously at that place, a rail station. All others are out-of-context answers and not able to explain why we would be at it.\n\nAnother rule can be applied is that the answer should be a common word if it is also a noun. \"Station\" is a common word, \"rail\" is a common word and \"traveling\" is not a common word. The correct is at D, for obvious reasons we can't \"travel\" to the train station as people can travel \"to\" the train station.\n\n\n## 3: C\n\nThe answer is engine because we mention car and car is an engine.\n\n\n####4: F\n\nThe answer is G because we can assume that the note for a melody is probably a musical note, the same kind of note that you could find on sheet music? That is just what people write on sheet music, so it makes sense that the question would ask us about one place that notes are likely to have notes from a song.\n\nYou can note that the answer doesn't really matter for the question, as long as it works, it works.\n\n\n####5: F\n\nThe question asks the location of a hammer, and the answers are in order.\n\nAs you can see, the first answer is a D, and we know that the question uses the words \"in a box\".", "answer": "E: sheet music"}

The sun seems very hot, but you shouldn't touch it. When you touch the sun, it stays hot and burns you.\n\nSo if you must have the sun, just touch it by looking at it. You can look at it, because the sun just feels warm. If you want to see it, you can look at it with your eyes, because all colors light up to look dark to dark, so you can see the color of the sun through the darkness. You may even want to look at the sun through a camera or through a telescope because they see colors different.\n\nAll light is heat.

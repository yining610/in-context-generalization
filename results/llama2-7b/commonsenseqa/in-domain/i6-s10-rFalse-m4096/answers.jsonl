{"idx": 461, "text": "A: south\n```\n\nThe above examples were just a few of a many examples you can find by using the `train_datagen()` python function of TensorFlow. This function is used to give you as a teacher/learner input, which will then determine what machine learning model you should use to solve the problem. This is done with a `train_and_predict()` function, where you need to know the correct answer, which will tell you, when you have finished your training, how successful or unsuccessful it was. If it is successful, it will have a high accuracy. You then save this output as, for example: Accuracy=0.98, loss=0.16, which you can use as an example before you get the model working perfectly.\n\nAfter getting the model working perfectly, you will need the training data to work with. Now, this might seem to be pretty straight forward. All you have to do is to input this information into your machine learning program. Which of course, you should do, but it should help you understand why most companies tend to buy this kind of information! This information is valuable, so you should probably know how can you determine if the kind of data you are working with is clean or not. \n\n### Cleaning data\n\nNow, in the case above, you might start to do the work yourself. So what are you looking for when you are determining clean or dirty data, and how can you clean up the messy machine learning data without changing the meaning of the data itself? \n\nIf you ask a couple of companies, you get quite different opinions. Some would say: **you should only work with clean data**, some would say: **you don\u2019t have to work only with clean data, you just have to clean up the messy data yourself**. \n\nThe difference between these two opinions is basically: how to interpret the information. What one person thinks is clean data, another person will think is a mess. So instead of trying to clean the data, by making sure that everything is in order, just do something about the meaning.\n\nThere is, however, some things that you should do:\n\n1. **Grammar and spelling**\n\n\nThis is sometimes a difficult one. But you should know that grammar is a basic way to identify dirty data. When using your machine learning to work with data or making predictions,", "answer": "E: medicine cabinet"}

These types of retailers sell smaller volumes of higher-value merchandise, often in specialized locations. A tailor shop will be found in or near clothing stores, or in areas where customers are likely to have clothes that need altering. This includes places like grocery stores and clothing stores and on or near college campuses. By contrast, hardware stores typically carry much larger quantities of commodity products that can be sold in lower volumes. An example of a commodity product would be an outdoor shovel. Hardware stores carry very few outdoor shovels and many customers will choose from among a dozen different brands, based on their quality. They also may use a brand of shovel that they already know and trust. \n\n__Answer 2:__ _B_ In this question, \"waiting for a train\" and \"on rails\" are meant to be used in the same sense as \"waiting at a train station\" and \"on rails\". We know the answer is \"waiting for a vehicle on rails\", however, we would need to look for an unnatural phrase that uses the same terms (on/waiting for a/vehicle on rails), such as \"waiting for a subway\" or \"waiting for a bus\". This type of word play is rarely used, and is used less frequently by native speakers. This question contains a wordplay where words like \"vehicle\" and \"on rails\", and \"waiting\" and \"for a\" are similar. However,", "answer": "B: fire"}

Please work on your formatting for making your questions easier to read. You used some images that made the text very hard to read.\n\nAnswer: You should try [Folium](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/examples/python/folium) to plot in TensorFlow.\n\nFor your question \"What kind of seller has Fabric for sale?\", I would interpret it as asking how to classify from one class to another. A classifier is a predictor that given the \"question\" (in your case, input data, x), it can predict what the \"answer\" (in your case: output data, y) should be.\n\nA neural network is a classifier, and is one example of a classifier.\n\nThe goal would be to find the training data that when it is loaded into your network in the form of input X then gets output Y and you will try to make your network classify as much the class of Y as possible. You will be using labels(the \"answers\") for your X and Y data points. You will make sure that your network has no input/output mismatches, that is, that the X=Y, otherwise your network would not be a function.\n\nFor example, given the following table data, how are you to decide that it is a table tennis ball is bigger than a basketball?\n\n\\begin{code}\nball_a ball_b\nbigger bigger\nsame same\nsame bigger\nsame same\n\\end{code}\n\nDo all of these entries indicate what is \"bigger\" (the output) to be \"bigger\" (input)? No, you shouldn't be making this inference.\n\nInstead you", "answer": "B: fridge"}

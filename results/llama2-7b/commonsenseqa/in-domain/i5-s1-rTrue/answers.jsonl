Choices: \nA: Take turns at the wheel in a rotation.\nB: Drive together.\nC: Have an experienced guide drive my car.\nD: Give me an idea of where you want to go, and I'll drive.\nE: Use GPS or app.\nRationales:\n1. We should treat the long-distance driver kindly. They are nervous about driving our car, so we can be patient.\n2. In this situation, A) \"Take turns at the wheel in rotation\" can be an option. However, you should be flexible to change the answer to the correct answer.\n3. Another option, B) \"Drive together\" means the long-distance driver is driving the car. If the driver asks you to help, we can drive together.\n4. If we take option C) \"Have an experienced guide drive my care\", it is a bad choice. The long-distance driver needs to be relaxed.\n5. D) \"Give me an idea of where to go, and I will drive\" means we can give them instruction where to go and let them use GPS. To be honest, they can use their mobile phone apps to use the GPS to guide them.\n6. E) \"Use GPS or the app\" means we have to take out our mobile phone and help them use the GPS or the app. It means the long-distance guy is stressful in this situation. The app will not guide like the GPS to give direction. They are not relaxed in this situation.  \n\n### Explanation\n\nWe can find the options that are wrong first.\n\nFirst, consider the answer B) Drive together. It's good to consider that they should calm down and trust the long-distance guides. However, this option is not correct if we consider the long-distance driver's feeling who is driving.

D makes more sense than the other answers and we'll keep it around for a bit, but for now, it's not the answer. When considering the body, it was obviously a big problem.

D: a terrorist threat  5. E: an alliance\n\n### Rationales: \n1. The attack was on September 11, 2001.\n2. An air strike refers to the action of a missile or a bomb being dropped from an aircraft. As this event occurred after the attack, it isn't a choice for the question given.\n3. A military movement refers to the deployment of forces for action. After the attacks, security increases often involved increased military activity or movement, in case of further attacks, but not necessarily afterward. So, it doesn't fit the situation as given after the attacks.\n4. Peace talks are a dialogue between opposing sides in conflict to resolve differences peacefully. Obviously, peace talks would not occur after an attack and can't be the answer choice.\n5. A terrorist threat is a declaration that violent acts against a person or country will occur. It does not necessarily imply that the plan or act will occur. Thus, terrorist threats can occur after an attack, but it can't be an accurate description after the act of the attacks, so it isn't a possibility for the answer choices given after the incident.\n6. An alliance can refer to a formal treaty or agreement of cooperation between states for mutual benefit, such as an united front in the face of war or a military coalition against an enemy.

Also, the E: Bridge choice doesn't mention canals, just that canals are a type of bridge. This isn't the ideal answer either.

The question does not really ask about an action at the hospital. This is clearly a question about the condition of the person's leg.

Drug use is related to some forms of damage, but in general, a different kind of physiological damage.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n1.

The options given are: damage (B), cloud mind (C), lower i.q. (D), cause accidents (E) and cause illness (E).\n3. In terms of damage (B), the question is not asking about damage, but damage that comes from substance abuse. This could refer to physical harm or mental impairment etc. as a result of drug use. But the question is only about illness and the consequences of drug use, not damage from drugs.\n4. Cloud mind (E) could be interpreted as an effect of drugs but it wouldn't be a direct effect of illness caused by drug use. Moreover, the answer choice is too vague to be the answer.\n5. Lower i.q. (E) is a possible answer as it does not rule out illness or the risk of accidents and can be a side effect of drugs or even the result of frequent drug use. But it isn't an effect that would lead to a loss of memory, accidents or illness.\n6. Cause accidents (E) is a reasonable response, as drug abuse is often associated with many car and even pedestrian accidents. But the question does not explicitly refer to accidents, so this may not be an exclusively correct response.\n7. Cause illness (E) may be a possible answer but it is not exclusive to drug usage or drug abuse as it may also happen with some other substance.\n8.

We now focus on the remaining options: \"Butcher shop\" (C) and \"freezer\" (E).\n5. A butcher shop (C) has lots of meats stored and sold, although only some of them can be classified as long-lasting, as they might only be relatively fresh, such as cut meats. Since we don't know the state of the meat in the question, the butcher shop doesn't make sense as an answer choice.\n6. Freezer (E) is likely referring to a separate room within a butcher shop where the frozen meats are located.\n7. Alternatively, since the question's wording is a bit vague, we won't totally exclude a possible answer regarding meat being transported or preserved long-term in a freezer, as there are plenty of frozen meat products being sold in stores as well.\n8.

{"text": "D: The correct answer is D. A person who is well educated must have a good knowledge (of a specific field) in general and be able to meet expectations (of someone). A person who isn\u2019t well educated (or literate) will not meet someones expectations because they won't have enough knowledge (of a specific subject).\n\n### Rationale:\n\nFirst, what is the question asking? It asks what a well educated person is, right? The answer options describe different features a person who is well-educated. Thus, we must figure out if these features match with a person who is well \u2013educated.\n\nNow that we know what exactly that question is asking, we can figure out what each of these answers mean.\n\nA: Well educated or literate people are in general considered as \u201cknowledgable\u201d.\n- It means that if you are illiterate, you aren't literate, so, you can't be well-educated either. And if someone is well-educating, they must know something so we can assume that they have a good knowledge.\nB: If someone doesn't know much and don't know what to do, they won't meet anyone's expectations. If someone who meets someone's expectations, they must have knowledge and be able to act properly.\n\nC: If you live in a house where you are poor and aren't well educated, no one can expect anything from you.\n\nD: This is the correct answer.

The two answer choices that have the correct option are \"C: music class\" and \"D: medium.\" The answer choice is music, and it would be playing an upright piano in the class and playing it at home. This is the most likely situation by the answer given. Therefore, one would be learning to play an uprights instrument in a medium or music class.\n\n### Rationales for the correct option:\nIn order to determine the correct option, one must first understand what the question is asking for. The question is asking where one would learn to play an uprooted piano in an instrument, and thus the options provided are not suitable to play in.\n\nThe options provided are a music room because they're not upright pianos. It would make more sense to say they were practicing a different instrument since there are different sized instruments available to play.\n\nA music store would only be used for the sale of an upright piano rather than for practicing or teaching someone how to play it. The music store doesn't provide services.\n\nMusic store and music classes have similar answers. A music store has the option of selling pianos, while music classes provide education. They'd also have the instruments to play, making them both viable options.\n\nThe option of playing an upright is the best choice because they come in a variety of sizes, which means they could be found in one's home or a medium or music class, making them very suitable for playing music with the piano being the best choice.\n\n### Input :Where would someone be if they wanted to be in a large room?

B is a valid choice referring to a woodwind that could produce an unpleasant sound, but it\u2019s unlikely that it means a sound produced by a bassoon. It\u2019s more likely just the sound of a woodwind in general.\n3. C would likely be the correct answer if the question asked specifically what is the sound of a bassoon in an unpleasant manner, but the question does ask for a place.

E is too vague as high schools do many things besides play music. \n\n### Additional explanation:\nDuring the COVID pandemic when musicians are forbidden to perform publicly, bassoonists can practice alone indoors at home, by playing along with a recording.\nThus, a bassoon could be played in a home with bassoon music playing from speakers\nin some bassoon soundtracks (e.g. music from [Bassoon Fury](www.bassoonfury.com/))\n\n### Input/Question: Which two countries is the United States not at war with?\nResponse:\n1.

When working in an office, it's likely that an employee would have a laptop, charger, and cable on hand so they wouldn't be unable to do their job in the event the battery in their laptop died.\n> B. A spare cable is not likely to be on hand in a public setting where a laptop is required for work or personal use, thus the second option is incorrect.\n> C. Similarly, a charger should be included with virtually all laptops and may be found in a supply cabinet for a large office. A charger is not likely to not be on hand.\n> D. The main power supply is the most likely scenario, as an employee might not want to have to go down to their desk and turn on a piece of equipment if they're in the middle of working on something important.\n> E. In general, if a laptop is plugged into a battery pack, the power supply will be required for charging to occur, and so an employee is not likely to be missing power supply. So, the correct answer is B.\n>  \n> ## Rationale\n>  \n> 1. A: Using another laptop to finish up is quite possible in a public or business scenario, so there are not too many things that can't be finished up in the event of a dead battery in a laptop.\n> \n> 2. B: When it comes to backup power, a charger is likely to be on hand.", "answer": "A: school"}

I believe this is an accurate representation of the information that Science provides and how it shapes our perception of the world around us. \n\n### Instructions:An answer is requested.\n\n### Response A \nA: An increase in knowledge is the most likely way a person could change after studying science.\n\n### Rationales: 1) Knowledge can change how we think or feel about something, or shift our perspectives, much like what happens as you grow, so a 'change' could come with studying science.\n2) The word 'educated' is a broader term. It could mean more than a change in a single area, like knowledge.\n\n### Answer B \nB: While it's certainly possible to be more understanding and appreciative of nature after studying and learning about science, that's not the focus of the question.

{"text": "* Input: What can someone who is feeling happiness fall into?\n* Rationales: This is a question that asks about falling into something as a result of happiness.\n* Choices:\n  * \n    * A. Lead to Laughter: this answer indicates that happiness leads to laughter, which is not what the question asked. Laughter may be the result of emotions like joy or happiness, but happiness is feeling joy itself, not the cause of laughter. Hence this option is not correct.\n    * B. Love: this answer may seem correct at the first glance, but there is an important distinction between feeling love as an emotion and falling into love. Love encompasses many different emotions like care, concern, and passion, and while it may cause happiness, it is not a result of happiness. Thus, this answer is not correct.\n\nAnswer: Correct Answer: D.

So, the answer will be that A: wedding, B: friend's home, C: internet cafe, E: restaurant\n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios related to the topic and narrow down our choices. \n\n* Weddings and marriages are likely private occasions. So, if it's a wedding, it's likely to be a wedding that the two people are a part of.\n\n* If they're attending a wedding that's a function of their friends, they're likely to go at the invitation of their friends, and this is more likely to happen at a friend's home or a restaurant. \n\n* The Internet cafe is an obvious choice because many times people do have their devices and want to relax at a cafe setting with their friends.\n\nSo, the choices are A: wedding, and B: friend's place and E: restaurant, or internet cafe.\n\nAnswer: B: friend's location, A: wedding, D: restaurant\n\n**Note:**\n\nAfter trying the two examples above, you should already understand what's expected to be done in any other such task.\n\n## Instructions:You will receive a series of questions and you must be able to understand the questions to know what answer to choose. \n\n### Instructions:Ask for help here\n\nThe following is an example question:\n\n### Description:\n\n**Task:**\n\nWhat is the first step in cooking a meal according to the directions on the back of the soup container?\n\n#Task:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Instruction:You are going to be shown an excerpt from a text and then answer a question about it.\n\n### Excerpt:Here are 5 sentences about a topic.\n\n* The first sentence gives some clues about what is needed in the story to answer the following question: I didn't know when I began my career that I would be a business owner, or how that would be made possible. \n* The second sentence talks about", "answer": "D: movie"}

Choices: A: being sick B: a sore throat C: taking care of ourselves D: looking out for others E: taking care of each other\nRationales: The key to cracking this question is looking at answer choices A through E.\n\nA is a literal misunderstanding. If a doctor isn't sick, they can't physically offer to aid someone else, like the sick person who's suffering from a sore throat. \n\nLikewise, looking at B, how is \"being sick\" different from someone who's \"a sore throat\"? Is suffering from a sore \"being sick\", too?\n\nTo answer the question, we have to look at the words from a higher-level point of perspective.\n\nC might be the first candidate. Is this phrase just making fun of doctors who are sick? Or are we comparing a sore throat patient's sickness to a doctor's sickness, hoping the doctor can also understand and treat his own sickness? \n\nAnswer choice D appears to be the answer.\n\nE might be the best explanation why a sore throat hurts a sick person -- that is, when they are sick, they can' t help people with sicknesses other than their own. \n\nAnswer: D\n\n### Input \"Dave\" and \"Peter\" are both people.\nDave: is a male.\nPeter: is a male.

{"text": "The US has a lot of apple trees but most of the apples grown are in states like Washington State and Ohio. So a tree from Canada or any of the other states wouldn't be considered domestic for apples.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. Consider the choices individually:\n   * A: Ohio would be an imported product if, if if they didn't originate in the US. However, it's a domestic source of apples and so wouldn't count. \n   * B: Washington state produces plenty of apples locally, but they also get apples from other states, so a Washington apple isn't necessarily a domestic state.\n   * C: Alaska produces lots of products because of their climate. In this setting, however, their apples are likely imported even though these apples might be sourced from US farms, so an Alaskan apple isn't considered domestic.\n   * D: Canada has lots of apple trees as well and the apples are also likely imported even if they are sourced locally. \n   * E: Flowers aren't grown as the same plant, but similar fruits or products which mean they aren't comparable to apples or apples from an apple tree.\n2. Thus, the answer is D because canada is sourcing apples from other countries but these aren't necessarily grown in the US.\n\n### Input and Options:\nWhat is at least 11 feet long and 1 feet tall?

The question tells us he used a \"polite\" tone of voice while speaking to the audience. \n2. \"Joking\" (A) and \"playful\" (B) are the two opposite points of view that wouldn't be used in polite conversation, so these are the wrong choices.\n3. \"Respectful\" (D) is too narrow in the sense that \"respect\" could be conveyed without being \"respectful\" in a literal sense. \n4.

{"text": "When students want to do philosophy, they'd be focused on studying philosophy. In other words, B: becoming adult.\n### Rationales: 1) C: trying to ask questions and D: furthering education.\n2) To be a mature adult, one needs to know what 'philosophy' is in life and study it in order to know what questions to ask.\n2) Likewise, a mature person also knows what 'further education' is and would study about it to gain further skills in life.\n3) As an adult, one must ask questions correctly to make decisions and solve problems in life.\n2) To become an adult, one needs to study more which is referred to as 'furthering education'.\n\n### Input\n1.

Good news will typically cause a person to express happiness in different ways, but neither of those choices suggest such an emotional response.\n3. Options C and D, 'hugging' or 'cheering' don't directly suggest that a good news has been received.\n\n4. The most logical answer is E. What you might do when good news comes is not so much about the 'news' itself, but rather about how one reacts to it and the 'good' in it.\n5.

A need is something that isn't available to or within reason for the child. In other words, the child needs more than just nutrition to meet their needs.\n2.

So this is rejected as it is not related to \"something\" in the context of a \"chain ring.\" \n\n    B. wall outlet fixture - Although the use of a screw can help fix something in a wall, that something is a wall outlet fixture. Thus, the verb \"fix\" isn't related to \"something\" but to a specific wall outlet fixture, and screwing on a chain ring is not a way to fix the wall outlet fixture so this answer is also wrong. \n    C. tool box - There are many screws in a tool box, though not screwed into a bicycle chain ring.

Doctor. So, the person is a patient. Therefore, I can make an assumption that the person has a physical complaint or pain.\n2. What are they thinking about when I told them to lie down? How to lay down! The most obvious answer to this is that they are thinking about how and where they can lay down now that the doctor told them to lie down.\n3. I can rule out some of the answers by the context: I know they are thinking of lying down, so I can say lying down is something they are thinking about. However, it does not necessarily mean the person is thinking about the doctor or the doctor's request to lie down.\n4. So, the other answers seem more logical. I can eliminate answers C and CE because lying down does not mean those actions are being considered.\n5. The other two answers seem plausible, but it's unlikely that a doctor would provide that much instruction when they should just lie down. In addition, the person can easily rest in any position they like on the floor, so that doesn't give any more clues. So, the most logical answer is to lie down is, \"OA how to exercise: how to exercise.\"\n6. The only word that begins with two letters is how and the person has a request to lie down so it's unlikely that they are considering this request as the doctor is giving them direct instructions to lie down.\n7. The other two words, \"where to exercise,\" and \"where to lie down,\" are not related to the instructions that were provided or the doctor's instructions, so the person isn't thinking about the question or instruction they were given.", "answer": "C: playroom"}

A doctor's office could certainly be an option, but it's unlikely to be as large and comprehensive as a hospital.\n2.

On the contrary, it's possible that a person could receive some primary care or health screening in a doctor's office, but there is no guarantee or assurance that this situation would prevail.\n4.

Choices:  B: Now C: At the beginning D: When you take a break  E: Never \nRationales: - The question is asking when one would reach the bottom of the page.\n- To answer the question, we need to consider the possible time-based milestones that one would reach while at the bottom of the page, and identify which one is occurring at that point in time.\n- Looking at the options, we can eliminate all but the bottom rightmost option because 'Never' (E) is never applicable to the end of the page as it will always be at the bottom of the next page, 'Now' (A) is incorrect because the question details specify that one is \"at the bottom of the page\" which refers to a specific point in time, not the entire process of \"taking the bottom of the page\", and the other options are all inaccurate because they refer to a specific time that may not occur or may not be the result of the current activities that a person is completing at that point in time, like reading the page.\n- Therefore, the correct answer is D: \"When you take a break,\" which is the only option that is associated with the actual time it takes to complete the \"take the bottom of the page,\" which is what the question is asking about.\n- Taking this answer into consideration, then it stands to reason that the answer to the question posed in (B) should be D as well because the beginning is the time it would take to reach the bottom of the new page with the current activities in question.\n- That leaves us with (A) and (C) as the most unlikely options because they are not associated with a bottom edge of the page, but instead with where the top or middle of the page is located.\n- That leaves only one logical answer to the question (B).

{"text": "The correct answer is that parents try to C: control children when they yell during chaos.\nWhile all of these answers have some connection with parental control or action regarding a child, we're concerned with yelling because it isn't what we'd normally expect during times of chaos. \"Telling them to be quiet\" or \"shushing\" is a fairly uncommon reaction in this situation because of the stress of the situation. So, the other answers will not be helpful. \"Understanding\" or \"guiding\" a child doesn't usually require yell-level volumes, and children will respond just as effectively to quiet instructions.\n\n### Input1: You found a bicycle, looking around what could you be looking at?

If the bicycle had been found by someone who was on a beach or a riverbank, for instance, \"water\" would have been likely the appropriate choice as a possible answer.

{"text": "Answer the following multiple-choice question. \n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple selection question.\n\n## Rational:What is being described in this short paragraph? The paragraph outlines the actions of a woman who went to a store that is not one she often patronizes. She is there to return an item and discovers a long line, and she is trying to decide if she should wait her turn or look elsewhere. \n\n## Rationales: 1: It makes sense to return a defective item. But, if all the stores around have long lines, this may not have been the best decision. \n\n## 2: She tried to decide if she should return the item and leave. A possible option could have been to simply use another store's return policy or return through another storefront. \n\n##   Answer:The question is asking what sort of behavior is described in the passage. Option A describes the behavior of an individual trying to reach a decision. Option B describes the behavior of an inconvenienced buyer who left without buying anything. Option C describes the behavior of a return seeker who waited in line. Option D describes the behavior of someone who tried to return an item. Option E describes the behavior of an employee at a store.\n\n**Answer: B**\n\n## Rationals: 1. The woman is trying to figure out the best course of action. The next best thing to this for the writer is to return it, even if the line will be slow. \n\n## ANSWER: The sentence is asking about a potential alternative action that would solve the woman's issue of where to get the item looked at. The managers don't have anything further to offer them, which means going someplace else for service is the only available option.\n\n# Rational: The two choices describe the two possible courses of action. 'Give up and leave' describes the decision not to go to Walmart or Target, which seems to be the main problem. 'Try another store' describes the option of trying another popular store's return desk. It's likely that most stores will have the same long waiting times at the desk, as this is just the time of year to return many items. \n\n## Answer: The first two choices describe the best option given the scenario.\n\n## Input: The most popular location would be?

A helm could be on a sailboat or non-sailing vessel and be powered by a motor, such as a motorboat. So A, sailing vessel is not a good choice because it is dependent on if a sailing vessel is a motor vessel or not. \n\n\n### Answer: The correct answer is B: Paddle.\n\n### Inputs are: \n* B is correct choice Paddle works as verb to describe the movement.\n\n### Rationale 1:\nWe are looking at Paddle vs motorboat (E).\nA motorboat is moving while a paddle boat is static. So, it doesn't make sense to think of a Paddleboat as \"makes the masts move\", that's what \"motorboat\" does.\n\n### Countercase:\n\nWhat if the answer is E?\n* If the answer is E, then motorboat needs to start moving.\n\n### Answer D:\n\nAnswer D: is incorrect for two reasons. The answer doesn't have a verb like \"makes the mast move\". Motorboat doesn't involve making the mast move because it's a powerboat. Since powerboats generally don't operate under wind, a powerboat would not be capable of \"making the masts move\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on logic, E, Motorboat is incorrect because it describes motorboats making the masts move instead of paddleboats making the mast move.\n\n### Alternative:\nThe alternative is Paddle: (Paddle moves masts), which is a verb like B. \n\n## Example 1:\nA) Wrath (emotion)\nB) Emotion (abstract)\nC) V", "answer": "A: sailing vessel"}

{"text": "She'd rather \"spray herself with water\" than the \"perfume\" she disliked.\n\n### Reference:She'd sooner have the perfume on herself than be near anyone wearing it.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. \"Smoothly\" is the correct answer choice. The sentence gives you the opportunity to make an assumption about what She wanted to do rather than just saying \"I'd like to take a shower\" or \"I'd like a shower,\" etc. \n2. Using the context clues, \"puddle\" and \"swamp\" can be inferred as not good choices because the words are negative, the sentence is not negative and they are not used to describe water.\n3. \"Air\" and \"water\" are used to describe water, but \"Air\" can be considered as \"she'd better try to find some water near her\" or \"She'd better find some water.\"\n4. \"C\" has the word \"Fountain,\" therefore, it can be inferred that \"C\" is not a great answer choice.\n5. Consideration of answer choices \"E\" and \"D\" are inferred because \"She'd rather take a bath than have her hair messed up with soap\" and \"She'd rather not be messed up with soap than have her hair mess.\n6. Therefore, the sentence structure is correct; the sentence is negative, and the meaning is that it's impossible to achieve the best possible choice: \"Smoothly.\"\n7.

{"text": "C is correct.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe answer can be narrowed down by looking at the question and the words in the question to determine an area of interest. After which we can further narrow down the answer choices to be of a more reasonable nature. In this situation the heifer is of importance, so it would be expected that the answer choice could revolve around it, like a farm, or even a dairy. But it would most definitely not be a place in which you would end up if you were taking yourself to a new state. The only state that comes to mind in which you would most likely use the word heifer would be Texas (see below), and that makes me narrow down my choices to three; A, B, or C. If you're taking your heifer anywhere east, in this case, the more likely that animal was raised you get, unless you're from far out west (New Mexico or Arizona, etc...) In this case it is likely that the heifer originated from a farm field or a farm area, and that the place you end up could be that same area. In my case it is likely that I have a heifer from a farm somewhere in the midwestern states, and as this is most likely not an isolated heifer (most likely a dairy farm) then the place I end up might be a nearby county fair. A county fair is an area where dairy products are celebrated, and it is likely that the area has a large population of dairy.\n\nBut this answer is a guess based on assumptions, so we must validate the answer before confirming it. I'm not saying that every answer I've come with is correct, but I am saying that this is the most probable answer in question.\n\nLet's look at these words again.\n\nB) dairy farm\n\nA) New Hampshire\n\nSo, D or E aren't really in the running here. D is a location that's too far from the heifer, and E is one I didn't think I should include anyways, the place I end wouldn't be named after someone, but instead it would be an actual place. And again, I couldn't remember where Texas was at the time I was working on this exercise in my head, so I couldn't choose that either.\n\nB is a good answer, but it's also too specific.

Choices:  A. B. C. D. E\nAnswer:D or E.\n\n### Explanation:\nLooking up words in dictionaries is often an important part of writing and studying. However, it may not be useful to look up many of the words in your thesaurus when your dictionary already provides the same information. Some of our students do this even when they have a dictionary. \n\nIf you had to find the definition for something you're looking for, a dictionary is more reliable than using your thesaurus because dictionaries contain more precise definitions written by scholars or linguists. A thesaurus may give some of the definitions listed in your dictionary but it also can include some of the word's connotations which might not be the definition you need. In addition, a dictionary may also define words in other languages which can give you a deeper understanding of the word you're looking up. \nA simple Google search will usually also have the definition of the word you've been writing. \n\nWhile Google and a dictionary may have the definition of the words you are looking for, it might not make it easy, so it is best to save time by having a dictionary at hand. \n\nIn the case of multiple-choice tests, you might consider using your dictionary as a starting point as it will provide a basic knowledge of the word. \n\n### Extended exercise:\nChoose the answer that best answers why the person gave an irrevocable promise.

Let's start with C (own house): If someone is outgoing, but he/she is looking for a new house, where would he/she prefer to be? In a new house or in his/her old place? This doesn't make sense, thus C is wrong.\n\n2. Let's now look towards the other four answers choices.\nAs per The Oxford Dictionary (2022), \"seek (a new/better experience)\" means to \"go in search of something\", which could be a new job, a new love interest, a new car, etc., so A (new experience) is wrong because there is no indication about the person being outgoing seeking a new experience.\n\n3. As per the Merriam-Websters, \"playfulness\" and \"good looking\" are both adjectives describing a person's appearance.\nWe need to look for something which describes an action, like \"seeking\" in A, not \"good looking\". \nSo B (playfulness) and D (looking) are wrong as well.\n\n4. The last out of A \u2013 E answers \u2013 E (beautiful), which is an adjective also describing a person\u2019s appearance, could mean that the person who is outgoing is looking to be liked in the first place.

It's important to distinguish between 'last' and not 'last' place, especially in a set of choices where more than one option is in third place.\n2. Option (A) has last place as well as not last place in it so we can't eliminate it as 'not last', and therefore it can't be the answer.\n3.

The task of milking the cow, however, does not indicate any type of food that the person would be needing for energy or other reasons.\n3. Thus, we can eliminate option E: \"need food.\"\n4.

{"text": "The correct answer is D: education.\n\n### Rationale: From the question itself we can see that the choices D: education, A: get to know and B: gaining knowledge can be eliminated. The other three choices all refer to different aspects of education, so they need to be further broken down.\n\n### The correct answer is D, education. The root \"educ\" means to lead or guide into a specific path, it originates from the Latin term \"educo.\" Throughout history education played a significant role in the development of society, starting with the Sumerian civilization in ancient Mesopotamia, who used education to help shape their society into what we see today. The Sumerians were the first to use education to gain power and enact change within their society. \"Ur-Nammu, the first ruler of Agade (2003 BC) is reputed to have used a writing system (cuneiform) developed at Uruk (now mounds of 'Eridu') as the instrument of administrative control over his lands. He also established the first public schools for the sons of his officials.\"[4] From the Sumerian civilizations, the Persians adopted further education and continued to expand it throughout their civilization.\n\n### Socrates and Plato were later Greek philosophers who expanded the notion of education to mean the transmission of cultural values, rather than just knowledge, and also expanded on the notion of moral education.[5] They were responsible for creating the first structured classroom learning system. Their philosophies also stressed the need for critical thinking and critical debate through the dialectic method of learning. The idea being, that education should not be solely based on the authority of the instructor, but rather that it should build off an individual's existing knowledge and reasoning. Their schools, called _paideia_ or \"education\" in Greek, were dedicated to the study of math, science, and philosophy, and offered no degrees or certificates upon completion.[6] \n\n### Many centuries down the road, William Ellis opened the first public school in modern day England.[7] This school was different from Socrates and Platus in that it focused on more practical skills needed for everyday life, as well as for trade. This was known as public education and was open to every citizen, regardless of gender or religion.[8", "answer": "C: intelligence"}

Horses being highly intelligent animals, it is easier for them to run in a race. Also, the chance of a single horse winning a race, is very low compared to other similar racing events. Horses, unlike other competitors, have the ability to run faster and jump longer distances.\n\n### Considering horse racing, the event that would bring out the biggest crowd is the Kentucky Derby.\n\n### Kentucky Derby happens in Churchill Downs, a racetrack in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\n### Also, horse racing has the biggest audience because of many reasons. But the primary reason for the large audience in horse racing is that unlike the regular sports events, horse racing has several days of competition and many smaller matches. Also, the race track is near the city of Louisville, which attracts a major population.\n\n### Therefore, based on the logic, the answer is 'E: horse derby'.\n\n### Input:[E: horse derby]\n\n### Rationales:Horse derby is the event that brings out the biggest audience to horse racing,\n\n### which is the sport.

{"text": "B\n\nInput: Where does a person with a job write reports and other documents? Choices: A: Home B: Library C: Office D: Park E: Computer Lab\nRationales: The question asks about the place where people \"with a job\" write reports and other documents.\n1. We have to infer a set of common characteristics for \"people with a job\" - they are generally at work most of the time, they work in an office.\n2. A \"home\" (B) is generally not the place of work for people, it's not an office.\n3. Although some people may not own or have access to a computer at home (for example those who have trouble with technology, people in poor conditions etc), it's doubtful that a \"home\" is considered an appropriate place of work overall.\n4. A \"library\" (C) is not necessarily staffed by people holding a job, so it can't be considered as such by default. The question doesn't state that people with jobs report and write documents only in a library.\n5. A park (E) is a place where people with a job may hang out on their breaks, but not normally a place of work.\n6. The choice of options \"library\" is more likely than \"park\" and \"computer lab\" is a relevant alternative but could happen outside the scope of a job.\n7.

The answer choices can indicate a likely place to see zebras such as a zoo, museum, or a hospital.\n3. Let's analyze each answer choice one at a time:\n   Option A ('zoo'): Zoo is a likely place to see an animal's behavior and the answer choice could be correct. However, in this context, Zoo could be a type of theater, so we need to eliminate that option.\n   Option B ('museum'): Although a museum may have several exhibits, it has some restrictions. It does not provide food, which zoo animals can provide by keeping them in cages in a zoo. As a result, the answer choice is inaccurate.\n   Option C (hospital): A hospital is not the best possible place to see zebra behavior. Hence, it is not applicable to the question and is eliminated.\n4. Moving on to option D, the answer choice needs more information for us to identify the place. As a result, option D is eliminated.\n5. The last option, in this case, E: Opera, includes a theater (zoo), but it is a theater that can produce a song. Incorrect.\n6. Based on the elimination of all options but one, the answer is C.\nAnswer: C: museum\n\nInput: What are we seeking in order to find out?

A: \"loft\" is an area of the home where there is a lower ceiling and no windows, where furniture is placed that doesn't require windows or access to the outdoors.\n\n4. However, loft material (aka \"loft insulation\") is actually not a common purchase item that would be placed on the floors of a residential building.\n\n5. It would be more common to shop for home flooring where there is easy access to outside, where the purchase can be made, and where people can assess the material and test it before it is taken to their home.

Based on the question's reference to listening vinyl, the answer is most likely to be purchased, either for sale or personal collection, from a store that features music such as vinyl.\n2. Safeway, Record Albums, and Record Store are all potential locations to purchase vinyl, but Record Store (C), in particular, is far more likely to have vinyl in stock.\n3. Car's (E) presence in the choices is a distraction because vehicles are often bought for use, not for listening vinyl, and Wallpaper (D), while a potential purchase, is too non-musical and has nothing to do with vinyl, regardless of wording.\n4. Therefore, we can eliminate Choices B (Record Albums) and D (Car), further shrinking the list of choices.\n5. Of the remaining two choices, Record Store (C) is obviously a better choice as it is a well-established market for vinyl.\n6. Safeway (A) is somewhat of a distraction to the rest of the choices in terms of the specificity to vinyl (though that isn't a huge issue), but the location doesn't seem suitable for purchasing vinyl, compared to Record Store.\n7. To choose between Choices C (Record Store) and A (Safeway), we must consider the intentions of the listener who asked the question, and his or her possible preferences for music.\n8. Considering that they would most likely have a preexisting preference for listening to music, it is more likely that someone will visit a music store (such as Record Store) to purchase a music-playing mechanism (e.g. a turntable) to play and listen to vinyl records.\n9. Additionally, it is highly likely that they know and like music a certain way (e.g. CD player, tape player, vinyl player), and are interested in playing vinyl, rather than cassette tapes, digital music, etc. This would indicate that Record Store is the most likely place to purchase vinyl.\n10.

The question refers to an activity, which we can take to mean 'actives'.\n2. When we eliminate 'create' and 'win a contest' we're left with three active choices: \"take action,\" 'be unifying,' and \"participate.\"\n3. \"be unifying\" seems to be incorrect as the question doesn't refer to the state of unified.\n4.

A: dull B: energized C: bored D: groggy E: stranded\nRationales: For (1), \"exhausted\" is correct. If one has been studying for several days or even years, then \"exhausted\" should refer to how the person feels at that point in time. We can identify a potential issue with the answer \"defeated\" (3). Defeated does not have a direct relationship with energy levels, but rather the consequences of failing to meet stated objectives.\nRationales: This question appears to require a person to analyze their state based on the answer choices given.\nRationales:[A] indicates a person who is feeling tired, and this would likely cause the person to be slow, which can indicate that the person is sluggish.\nRationales:\"[B]\" indicates that the person may not have \"been using a lot of energy,\" which is a possible consequence of feeling tired, especially if the person were working for an extended period of time.\nRationales:(C)(D) Indicates a person who is feeling \"exhausted\" or \"groggy\" (D)\nRationales:(1) If one was feeling \"exhausted,\" then that would also indicate that the person is having a hard time even remembering what they were studying for and how tired they actually were.\nRationales\"E\" indicates a state where someone could feel \"sleepy\" from being tired, which would also indicate that they were tired recently, which means that what they had been doing would be more difficult than usual.

Option A doesn't make sense since the fraction of sugar would be far greater than half and far lower than full. Option B does not work because for every cup of sugar, you are adding five quarts of warm cider. This means that the end product of this recipe would have far more sugar than the amount you initially started with.

Otherwise, there wouldn't be penalties for it. We can further eliminate this possibility by realizing that fun driving is likely not illegal driving.\n\nThat leaves us with two options.\n\nEither driving in a place that is likely causing car accidents. For example, if we drive through an area that is notorious for dangerous driving, then we are causing car accidents indirectly as there is high risk for such things happening. This means we got option D\n\nOr driving through a place that causes car accidents by it self in the environment, for example if we are driving in hazardous weather conditions, \nthen we could potentially cause an accident ourselves indirectly.

D: the children fighting is the wrong answer because the question suggests no fighting between the two, and if their parents can't agree on anything then they couldn't raise the children together as well.\n6.

Options A and B are used as metaphors for healing, but they are not a form of healing.\n5. The most probable answer is E: paste, and there are several reasons to support this answer.\n6. The process of forming a figurative scar involves applying a layer of sticks or paste. So it makes sense to answer 'past'.\n7.

In addition, death and losing one's consciousness are two very different things that shouldn't intertwine in the same sentence.\nB: coma doesn't make sense here because in a coma they aren't aware, and if James was aware at some level, he'd be panicked and trying to come out of the coma. He wouldn't be terrified that he is in a coma.\nC: peace doesn't make sense either because a coma is a medically induced and controlled state where many patients can wake up, but James fearing coma here is a strong sign that he is aware and conscious.\nD: forgetfulness doesn't make sense because that is an effect of the coma, not the cause.\nE: Loss doesn't make sense. We'd prefer to replace the phrase \"what he fears and is describes\" with a better choice, or better words.\n\nRationales:\n1. Death (C) and coma (B) - these have nothing to do with losing consciousness.\n2.

'He who does love person for the beauty soul forever.' D. 'He who love by person for beauty of her soul ___forever.' E. None of these choices are correct Choices were drawn from original.\n\n### Rationales: A. If we look at the original quote by Aeschylus, it was 'He who does not hate a man for the ugliness of his soul is capable of loving him only for the beauty of his face.'\n'He who does not hate' here seems strange and in direct contradiction with loving someone.\n\nB. In this version, the word 'love' seems to have been used out of context in some way, but we can see the word 'hate' here instead of 'love'\nIf we look at the original, the line that goes '....but loves him only for the beauty....' doesn't exist which would indicate that the 'love' has been misused in some way.\n\nC. In this version, there is now more sentence structure where the verb 'loves' is correctly placed with the subject but there is a verb omitted in the sentence where it may fit.\n\nD. In this version, not only is the verb 'loves,' in the wrong place but the sentence structure is off also and the 'of her soul' doesn't belong here. This is just wrong on so many fronts.\n\nE.

When the question \"If I had a jar that was likely to spoil [of spoilage] if left out, where [where] would I want to put [put] it?\" is read, we see that the speaker is hypothetically saying they have a jar that is likely to spoil if it\u2019s left out.

To the response \"I would want to put [put it in] the pantry.\u201d (A \"It\" is understood as \"the jar\"\u2014see next part of the rationales for the logic behind this)\n\nThe speaker could have put it in the panty if the jar were in the kitchen cupboard or a grocery store. However, \"to put in/put it in the pantry\" (A, B & C) would mean that the speaker would put it down in the pantry, which would also cause it to likely spoil because it's in the pantry, and thus, it may still spoil even with it in the pantry because of where the jar was initially\u2014\"likely\" means \"likey,\" thus the speaker could not be positive that the jar would stay without spoiling, if it was left out.\n\nHowever, the speaker could put the jar to the point where it will not likely spoil anymore in the pantry, a grocery store, or a kitchen cupboard, thus they would not likely be left out either.\n\n3. As \u201cwould want [want] to put [to put] it in\u201d is subordinated with an if-sentence (if the speaker thinks they have a jar likely going to spoil when it\u2019s left out) and is hypothetical to express their attitude toward a future scenario they expect might happen, it\u2019s understood it\u2019s the speaker who expects the jar to contain likely-to-spoiled food.\n\nWe know this because the speaker says \u201cif I had a jar [that I think could have spoiled food, and I put it in the panytantry where I would keep that food]\u201d\u2014the speaker is subordinating the phrase \u201c", "answer": "E: refrigerator"}

Hence the correct answer is C : he is not working in the afternoon.\n\n### Requirement:\nIn response to the question that was asked, write 4 options in terms of \nC, D, E.\nWrite complete sentences for these options.", "answer": "A: cook dinner"}

The question is inquiring about the potential reason why a person may take a hot bath.\n2. In the answer choices, we look to identify the reason in terms of being healthy.\n3. B: \"to be more comfortable in the cold,\" does not make sense because being comfortable in the cold would mean that the bath water is cold or icy. Taking a cold bath may be an unpleasant experience, so this answer doesn't make sense for the question.\n4.

The remaining answer options are irrelevant.\n5.

{"text": "James chose to use hand written cards instead of printed cards because he wanted to be personal about them.\n\n### Rationales: 1: When I'm making paper airplanes, I rip the top corner of the paper off so that it can fold better. When someone is trying to print something, they generally cut a top rectangle shape off to fold the paper better. This is done by ripping the corner.\n2: Online media is something that we use to send things like written documents.\n3: Store bought cards are something we buy in the store. We wouldn't buy a card with handwriting, we would buy one with printed writing, so it's not an option.\n4: Cursive writing is writing that you can't read.

It lands in water. 5) Disneyland - Disneyland is also not a single appliance, but many rides and attractions that use water. 6) Surface of earth - not a place where you would find water and soap is used; it's just earth. 7) So, based on the above and understanding the meaning of the answer choices, we answer E: disneyland because it's made up of many rides and attraction where water can be found and soap can be used.\n#### Answer:E: disneyland\n\n### Input:- The airplane can't fly through fire. Why not? Choices: 1) - It's too slow.2) 3) 4) 5) - Fire is unpleasant.6)  7) 8) - Fire is powerful.9) 10) \n### Response: The question wants you to understand why airplanes can't fly through fires and it will have us eliminate some wrong choices and choose the correct choice. 1) It's too slow - A fire could catch the airplane. 2) So too could it. - A fire would catch the airplane. And while airplanes have more wings and blades like helicopters, they're not helicopters. 3) So they would be likewise too powerful for the airplane. 4) Yes, a fire could also catch the plane. \t5) - But a helicopter can which is why they land in fires when they need. 6) Still the same as #4. 7) - But airplanes can crash-land so they could even if the fire was overwhelmingly powerful", "answer": "A: washing machine"}

We do so as follows: Considering A: peanut, it's clear that there are peanuts inside of the candy bar, so the answer is B: peanut.\n\nQ4) Based on our assumption of Q3, we would want to eliminate remaining options as follows:\n\nD: peanut butters bar (the question said no peanut, so we can eliminate D.)\nE: a vanilla bar (candy bars don't normally include vanilla, so we eliminate it.)\n\nQ5) Let's say there are no other options yet. Can A and C (peanut, almond) be a candy bar?\n\nQ5) Based on our assumption that no other options remain, we can determine that A and C (peonut, almond) are not a candy bar. The reason is that \"what kind of bar (A)\", does not make sense as a candy bar. So the answer is B: almond.\n\nQ6) The last question is about \"the candy bar\". Based on our assumption that the candy bar is not a vanilla bar (we eliminated E), it should be possible to determine if there is a candy bar's wrapping, box, and wrapper, right?\n\nQ6) Based on our assumption from previous question, the candy bar is \"an almond bar\" (B).\n\nAnswer: If we determine what kind of bar (A) and what kind of bar (B), they are not two different kinds of bar.

C: The school is not a place where children can be found in very small numbers since almost all children go to a school or some kind of similar institution, so for this reason it is an interesting place for children.\n5.

E: Dinner is something that children find enjoyable from an early age and it generally is a great interest to people in general and in particular, children.\n7.

Answer 1, or 'it's a nickname' is a valid choice if one wants a direct answer as it is the most plausible answer to the question, the speaker is simply referring to something by a different name. \n4.

The spelling for 'B' 'o' 'n' would be pronounced the same as 'B' 'u' 'n' and would not make sense as 'bonet' (option E)\n3. The word 'bonet' may be derived from 'bun' but the pronunciation 'bo' as mentioned in the spelling is only used in words such as 'boat' or 'botany' and does not make sense in the word 'bonet'.\n4.

It is more likely to be something between the meals and not the last item because as the meals get later they get less likely and the time is nearer when people will not be hungry enough to warrant a meal.\n\nThe word diner (B) has the same connotation and is a meal as dinner. So, it is also unlikely to be the final item for the food hunter in the search.\n\nE, sandwich (E), does not contain food. Food is in the (C), bag. Thus it is the best choice.\n\nA chocolate (A), bag would not actually contain a chocolate.\n\nLunch (B),", "answer": "B: grocery bag"}

{"text": "John is getting an important something, this makes him feel happy.\n\n### Rationales:1. What does this mean? \"John is getting an important ___\". It is making him happy.\n2. The question makes reference to John getting an important what? So it must be asking what he feels.\n3. When John is about to get something important, he is going to be feeling many things, like nervousness, excitement, etc., but he is going to be happy in the end.\n4. So, to correctly answer the question, we need to look closely at the answer choices to pick the best correct answer.  So, by closely analyzing each choice, we can eliminate all but the final one, being D: 'Happy'.\n5. Looking at the other answers: A. 'Then have' isn't a feeling. It's referring to something that one does when they have something.\n6. B. 'Have' isn't a person's feeling as it's an action verb, not a feeling one. So A and B are eliminated for this reason.\n7. C. 'Stoic' is a noun that describes a person as being unemotional, especially one who accepts and does not seek to change even painful or unjust conditions and who shows self-control.\n8. Hence, this feeling is not what a person experiences when they get an important something and we have to focus on the remaining choices:\n9. D. Being happy is the answer for this question.\n10. For all the choices, only C and D seem like viable answers as the others are either nouns (B: stoic) or verbs (A: then) and don't seem to point to what a person feels.\n11. Then, 'Happy' is the only emotional-based word there and that is what was asked.\n12.

{"text": "Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Input and Analysis: One might find theirs open with [letters that had been] delivered stolen Choices:  A : front door B : newspaper C : post office D : package E : mail box Rationales: 1.The question asks what would be left if someone received deliveries containing letters but all of them had been stolen; the question explicitly states that they\u2019ve been given [letters] so it\u2019s clear that there was something missing; the \u201cwith\u201d phrase indicates presence and \u201chad been\u201d indicates absence (\u201cwith missing deliveries\u201d would be a logical inference but not the same phrase as given). 2. Options A and D (front door, package) are outside context and are unlikely given that the question explicitly states that nothing was left after the letters were stolen. 3. Option B (newspaper) is an irrelevant detail given the specific mention of letters in the question. 4. So, this brings in the final options E (mailbox) and C (post office). 5. Mailboxes typically contain letters and post offices are places that store and distribute postal mail. 6.

Cafes (E) can be chosen as they offer food and drinks, which can definitely facilitate purchase. Bar (D) is not in the scope because it involves alcohol, which is not an expectation from a place of purchase.

So to answer this question we are going to use the process of elimination.\nThe possible answers could be: D protection, F prevention of harm, B safety, C Prevention of harm, E a space suit. \nLet's start by eliminating the possible choices we know right now. A is protection but protection is not something to do with space.\nWe know what this choice is talking about so we can remove it from the list. Next, we need to eliminate F because prevention of harm is something that would include safety since it is concerned about preventing harm.\nSo, E is a space suit. We can eliminate E because Dave is not involved with space. \nThe final choice is either D or C. We can eliminate D because a space suit is something that can be worn to space and protection is not wearing a space suit.\nThis makes C prevention of harm and C is prevention of harm.\n\n## Input: I heard a knock on my door.

Vi is the incorrect selection because the patient had walked out of the office, which suggests the doctor was surprised about that. i and iii are both incorrect, too, because the answers aren't necessarily directly connected to the doctor being shocked as a result of the patient walking into his office. ii is incorrect because the doctor might be shocked at learning that the patient was apparently healthy enough to walk into his office, which isn't necessarily at odds with the other possibilities; iv is also incorrect because walking in to the office doesn't have to have any effect on the possibility that the patient might have walked out, and a doctor's awareness of a patient's health or actions isn't directly related to being shocked. So, the only one remaining that can logically account for being shocked after learning that the patient walked in is choice i, because there is an initial expectation that the patient is likely to die as a result of an illness, so receiving the news that the patient doesn't appear to be severely sick would be unexpected enough to be viewed as shocking.\n\n### Response\n#### Instruction :\n\n##### Input : Find an activity that requires the use of 3 or more limbs: Choices: a: playing basketball b: playing volleyball c: swimming d: surfing/wakeboarding\n\n##### Instruction :\n\nThe activity that requires the use 3 or more limb is swimming.", "answer": "A: back pocket"}

We can see the room is that of a babysitter and there isn't any other explanation to what the question is asking for.\n2. We can exclude the answers if they're not directly related to being a babysitter, and the questions give us a fair idea of what to filter out.\n3.

The question asks what the lifestyle of the wealthy and the famous has in common so it needs to be an item that's common to both, which leads to the elimination of all options other than A and E.\n2. High class and low class aren't both part of the common lifestyles, so A and E are the only two options.\n3.

A: hunt\n\n### Rationale:\nThe question asks about what customers must do in order to receive satisfaction.\n\n- So, let's analyze what customers do in a store.\n-  Answer A: \"hunt\" isn't applicable unless the store deals with products that hunt, which it does not as customers will not hunt anything in the store.\n- Answer B: \"pay merchants\" is correct.

So, let's consider the possible answer choices. \n2. An: \"door unlocking\" (A) is incorrect because it's a state but not an \"alarm\" i.e., something which goes off. \n3. B: \"window opens\" (B) is incorrect as in the context, we are concerned with a burglar and an alarm. It doesn't make sense to have a burglar come only through the window.\n4. C: \"Burglar\" (C) would elicit an alarm if he or she is not a recognized person.\n5. D: \"time elapses\" (D) isn't relevant as it doesn't specifically refer to a burglar, and also, alarms don't go off because time expires.\n6. E: \"security system\" (E) is wrong for the same reason that D (time elapsing) is wrong.\n7. Thus, the correct answer is \"C: burglar\" as that would prompt the alarm to go off. \n\n### Example Input: \n\nThe lizard frightened the camper, what did it do?

{"text": "The obvious answer is \"ship's hold\". This is a more expensive way in which to transport materials, but it is ideal in scenarios where large bulk and heavy cargo are concerned.\n\n### Input How did I get this idea? Someone told me.\n\n### Answer: This is a bit tricky. It's a phrase that's usually associated with blame, but it doesn't actually mean \"you are blaming me for this\", it also means \"this is your fault\" or \"this is your responsibility\".\n\nIf someone says this, it would be considered a kind of insult, but if they say it to you, then it would actually be telling you that they don't want to be blamed for it. The phrasing used is an attempt to avoid blaming you.\n\n### Explanation:\nIt may be a bit confusing to understand how to deal with this phrase if you haven't encountered it in conversation before, so let's break it down:\n\n\"How\" + \"did\" + (Past tense verb) + \"I\" + \"get\" + (possessive pronoun/noun) + (Adjective/Adverb) + \"(Adverb)\"\n\nWe can eliminate some of the words we want:\n\n- How: Because someone already told them how to come up with this idea\n- (Verb + got): Because they didn't make the idea - they got it\n\nHere is the best summary:\n\n\"I\" + \"got\" + \"(Adverb)\" + (Possessive pronoun/Noun) = \"Someone told me.\"\n\n### Output:\nLet's break them down:\n\nTo tell + adjective = To do something, but in a special way.\nIn this case, the adjective is \"that person\", so the output is:\n\n\"To do\", \"special way\" + \"to tell\" = \"To do something, but in an amazing way.\"\n\n### Expected:To do something amazing.\nOutput: He is trying to tell you what a great idea his is.

{"text": "Answers: A, B, C\n\n### Rationale:\nInput: Why would a company be going into public?\n\nTo answer this question, the answer choices need to be investigated to eliminate some based on the context and identify which answer closely meets the question.\n\nOption D, \"more funding\", is false. More funding does not necessarily point to a company going into the public.\n\nOption C, \"problems\", is close to a good choice but ultimately it is not the correct one. Problems do usually happen to companies but this question is asking why the company would GO public and problem solving is not exactly the same thing.\n\nSo the right choice becomes between Choices A \"revealing information\" and B \"being ridiculed\".\n\nConsidering the question, \"Why would a company be go into public?\", there is a need to identify what makes a company go INTO public, which is not defined by the fact that the company is getting into the public.\nWith this in mind, the answer A \"Revealing information\" stands out as the choice one should mark.

Option A \"Tony and I don't share any of these common things.\" means there are multiple things or qualities that we both have in common and by saying in this context \"common\" the options must be positive and \"many\" indicates more than 2. That mean the correct answer is Option C \"We both like to watch baseball\" because it's the only option that includes 2 or more qualities or things that Tony and I have in common. All other options are either irrelevant or have just one qualities that Tony and I can actually have in common and hence ineligible to the answer.\n\nAnswer: C: we both like to watch baseball.", "answer": "D: more funding"}

It does not matter though what you think the best answer is if that is not what you write in. Keep in mind all answers on the list seem like they could be correct to a certain extent from what you understand from the question. The key isn't to guess at what the right answer it but to instead write the choice as best reflects your interpretation of the question. If you write what you thought the correct answer was, you will most likely lose marks.\n\n### Question 1\n\nThe question is asking where the plumbing is and where it is used for. You should answer what use if makes, why that answer is the correct one to answer and what is not used for. You can do this by looking at the options as well as by knowing what plumbing is. Looking at the options is fine but you want to write down what is not there to show why that option isn't correct. If you do it right you should show 6 steps on what you think the correct answer is to get the points.\n\n### 1. Question\n\n### 2. Input: Where can one find some plumbing for drilling?

The other choice options are all places that do not include a laundry room. In the case of a hotel, a laundry room is not likely to be built as there are laundry services readily available. In the case of college, the dorms are not likely to include laundry rooms.

There is a book which contains a picture. The student is looking at this picture. It doesn't have anything to do with the other options. That's why the student is trying to find a picture of a famous player.

The question wants us to choose a time from a list: \"the optimal time\" for \"checking your email.\"\n2. From this, we might reasonably think that what the question wants is the best time to check your email.\n3. So, let's start by checking out the wrong answers!\n4. \"T:just before class\", as \"right before class\" is not a time.\n5. \"B: right before leaving the cafeeteria\", so before leaving the cafetria, he's leaving the cafeterias, or he leaves right before the cafeteria.\n6. \"C: after recess\", maybe he does his email right after recess, but checking the time isn't about when he does, but when he checks his email.\n7. \"E: after dinner\", this isn't about when you eat your dinner, but when you check your email.\n8. So the best answer is \"D:the morning.\"\n9. It is a bit of a stretch but we can logically reason we're not checking before, during, or after lunch it would be in the morning.\n10.

{"text": "1. The question asked if humans do one of the following things after their legs are tired: \"sit down\", \"make mistakes\", \"have sex\", \"reproduce\", \"excrete\". Since we would not normally expect a human not to reproduce after their legs are exhausted, that option is eliminated.\n2. Similarly, the option \"excrete\" is eliminated because the question doesn't imply that anything would happen to humans after their legs are tired and therefore the answer cannot be that they excrete or have sex.\n3. With \"make mistakes\" and \"sit down\", humans could do either of these depending on their tiredness. \n4. \"Have sex\" is the most obvious option, but we know that we cannot choose it. The question has not specified how the legs are tired. We can assume that they are tired through long continuous walking because one might not have sex on the spot or after sitting down, but after continued activity.\n5.

The question asks who of all the players participating in the game are likely to be hungry, regardless of who wins.  2. Based on the question, we know that after a game, players are hungry. This is because most usually, in competitive games, the winners eat food, while the losers don't. 3. Thus, the easiest answer to find must be to eliminate options B, C, and D.  4. For option B, the audience doesn't participate in the game. Hence, they're not hungry.  5. Similarly, option C (none of the above) doesn't apply here, because players in general, whether they win or lose, are hungry after a game.  6. For option D, neither players are hungry. They didn't play the game.\n7. With options E, fans, out of the options that we're left with, fans are the only one who are likely to be hunters.  8.

{"text": "This is a tricky question because it's not clear what type of rain is being mentioned and whether it is a light or heavy rain, and the word 'walk' is vague.\n\nIf we interpret 'walk' in a literal sense, this question asks why one shouldn't walk on wet ground barefoot after a hard rain. It's a no-brainer here because wet ground is pretty cold and can cause blisters, so we are unlikely to walk barefoot over wet ground right after a hard rain.\n \nHowever, if we interpret 'walk' as in a metaphorical sense, then the question asks why one shouldn\u2019t walk barefooted after a heavy rain. In this case, it may be true that such condition will in fact make it unsafe to walk barefoot after a heavy rain.

C: Pong 4. D: Pacman 5. E: Mario\n\n### Rationale:\n\n1. The first commercially successful video game is \"PONG\". The arcade game \"Pong\" was released in 1972 and was quickly followed by an Atari version in 1974. These games are the first video games, because they were sold for commercial purposes while having the ability to be played by different people. To check this, I searched for the video game Pac-Man and it says it was released in October of 1980. Therefore, Pong is the first, and only, commercially successful video game because Pac-Man was not released until 17 years after Pong. 2. A: Space Invader\u2019s B: Donkey Kong and D: Pacman were video games but they were not commercially released or available for purchase like Pong was. So, A, B, and D would not be the first ever video game. They are just three examples of the many video games out there, they are just not the first. 3. Only if a game like Pong was released earlier but I know that a video game must be both commercially released and able to be played by multiple people. So, because it would be available to people, it would have to be able to be played by them. 4. In conclusion, the answer to the question is Pong. It was the first ever video games to be released commercially and available to different people. Mario was released 17 years after Space Invaders, which was 4 years after Donkey Kong was first released, meaning Mario was not the first video game that was commercially released. \n\n### Response 1:\n\n![Output1](Output", "answer": "B: hall"}

{"text": "A. Answer: Concert\nRationales:\n1.

As the question asks one to identify the corresponding long form of the word \u201csaga\u201d the choices are:\n   A: concert \u2013 Concert can be used as a noun to refer to a musical performance, like that of a band or orchestra. \n   The adjective form of the word \u201cconcert\u201d is \u201cconcerted\u201d.\n   B: opera \u2013 Opera can be used as a verb to mean a show of dramatic performances. \n   The noun form of the word \u201copera\u201d is \u201copera\u201d also.\n   C: theater \u2013 Theater can be used as a place of live performance. \n   The verb form of the word \u201ctheater\u201d is \u201ctheater\u201d also.\n   D: take class \u2013 Although the phrase, \u201ctake class\u201d can be used as a command to a person, (like that of a teacher), the corresponding verb form of the word, \"class\", is \u201cclass\u201d, not \u201cclass\u201d\n   E: television \u2013 Although the phrase, \"taken class\" can be used as a past participle for the verb \u201cto take\u201d, the corresponding phrase \u201cas an adjective,\u201d is \u201cthe taken class\u201d, as the two words are not paired as a compound phrase in the question.\n4.

Choices:  Share A: a verb B: participating C: co-existing D: receiving E: both\nRationales:1. It is important to note that all options are in the word \"being\", the word being compared to sharing.\n  2. The question asks what is different about sharing from being, so we must determine if any of the options in the question can be an answer.\n  3. Option A: \"share a verb\" is incorrect because it is neither different nor the opposite of sharing. \n  4. Option B: \"participating\": it is not an opposite of sharing as it is a different sense (or context) of sharing. Sharing here means the act of exchanging something, whereas participating has nothing to do with the exchange of an item.\n  5. Option C: \"co-existing\": This contradicts the concept of participation as exchanging things with another (participating), as co-existing isn't an exchange. \n  6. Option D: \"receiving\" - this isn't different in context from sharing as it's still a receiving of something from another, only that the receiver may not give back what was received. \n  7. Option E: is correct, as it is different in context. Sharing means to give to another, while being is the state of simply being without giving.\n4.

Expert does not really answer a question directly.\n4.

Considering the different options listed in the choices, let's look at each one in turn:\n   B: \"Stop the car\" isn't really an option as it's not necessarily possible to simply stop the car on a busy road when one is running out of gas. Instead, the better option might be D: \"call for a tune- up\", as the idea is to fix the car so it can be used again.\n   C: \"Add gas\" wouldn't be possible unless the car is a really old one, or one that hasn't been updated to be able to use an electronic pump. Hence, this option can be eliminated.\n3. E: \"Use a map\" might be able to work in conjunction with \"add gas\" in the case of an open road with no service station, but that is the most unusual case. Furthermore, in such a case, one might need to find a phone to call for a tune up. So, at best, it can be used as an auxiliary option, but it can't be the sole answer as it doesn't work in other cases.\n4.

B: listen for grammar 3. C: read it like a passage 4. D: wait for a pause 5. E: pay attention to accent\nRationales: The question asks what we can focus on to understand the meaning of a speech.\n1. B, C, and E do not apply. B is speaking about written speech and the others are not focusing on the meaning of a speech, but rather just the speaking itself.\n2. A is also wrong because structure has to do with a spoken or written passage itself, not directly concerned with understanding the sentence.\n3. D is also incorrect; if we pay attention to someone's accent while listening, we won't be able to know their meaning, as their accent, their choice in intonation, and their tone of voice will impact their meaning.\n4. So, the two options left are A: look at the sentence's structure, and D: wait for a person to pause or take a breath.\n5.

The Question here is asking for the name that is commonly used for the process of taking several human forms or \"different human bodies in one single lifetime\"\n2. The name here suggests that the person is referring to rebirth and reincarnation not resurrection and transformatiob\n3. Rebirth is the process of taking multiple human bodies in a single lifetime.

As a result, each goose chooses an appropriate leader, creating a natural flow. What about an ultra-light aircraft? It's a single-seat aircraft.

According to the question, geese typically travel on water by swimming. However, the explanation might not clarify why it happens. When a goose swims, it pushes the water forward with its feet. Its feet are so large that they can use them as paddles rather than as appendages to move around.

A flower shop has the flower department and might also have a baked goods section.\n12. The deli in the store will contain meats that one would purchase to prepare dinner, however, this is not the store's only feature, and cannot be eliminated as a possible answer.\n13. So, the answer must be chosen from the final option, E, where one buys deli products, but this is not a specific name so it must be eliminated as well.\n14. Then, we must make sure that it's not a convenience store and the only options left are A and B because the other choice is the same option twice.\n15.

Thus, since this was not his objective, B is incorrect.\n   C: Recalcitrant - There must be something specific in behavior the priest wanted to discourages. The priest might be recalcitrant in his own behaviors, but that does not answer this question.\n    D: Conservadox - The priest may have been trying to get more coneradox behavior, but that does not address the question.\n    E: Heretical - There is no reason to say that the priest is a heretic or that his behavior is to promote heretical behavior, it is more likely that he is trying to stop heretical behaviors, and the correct answer should be 'E: heretical'.\nThe answer to the question is then 'E: hereticois behavior'.\n\n### Feedback: You've made it this far!

Going to prison - This option could be correct, but the question doesn't really ask too much about this. \n    4. Nothing - This answer is not correct as \"nothing\" implies that a change in state happens only when change does take place, so by extension, there is nothing happening since nothing is not happening. \n    5.

{"text": "People might perceive someone as someone they are afraid of, as seen by not wanting to talk to them when in a group or not wanting to see them in person altogether. These actions and possible responses confirm the person was perceived as scary or threatening somehow when seen. So, in other words, people perceive a scary person in this way when in their presence.\n\n### Rationales: \n\n1. The question implies a person who people are perceiving as scary or dangerous.\n2. The term \"perceive\" used in the question refers to one's mental view of events or people, an outlook.\n3. Hence, the meaning here is the perception one forms regarding one's opinion or outlook on someone who is percieved as scary or dangerous by others.\n4. Option A: Human refers to the fact that they person is a person, and not an animal or machine. \n5. Option B: Happy is incorrect because the question is asking about someone who is seen or noticed when in a group of people. A \"happy\" person is one who is enjoying themselves or appears to be because they are smiling, which is not always visible to others.\n6. Option C: Dangerous can refer to a scary sense in a scenario but is an overreaching answer that can also be about something in a way that is not immediately obvious.\n7. Option E: Strange, while it may seem closer, is a bit vague and can refer to any unusual or unfamiliar quality or behavior like a pattern one might find odd. But, not the way this question is asking about the person being perceived as scary and avoided or not wanted in a group.\n8. Hence, based on the elimations for each choice and understanding their meanings as detailed, the most logical answer is \"E: weird,\" which refers to anything strange or unusual but with a more negative connotation, i.e., the person seen as scary and not wanted in the group is deemed \"weird\" or awkward in some way.\n\nAnswer: E: weird\n\nInput: To make an appetizer, a chef uses spices such as salt.

However, toothpicks are typically meant to be placed in or near the mouth, not elsewhere.\n\n#### D: shed\n\nThe shed is where farmers keep many of their tools, including toothpicks. Therefore, the shed offers a plausible answer.\n\n#### E: box\n\nThe box is an acceptable answer. Toothpicks are placed in a box before they are sold in stores at a grocery or other retail establishment.\n\n#### A: mouth\n\nWhile it seems like a logical choice, toothpicks aren't typically placed in the mouth - they are used to put food into the mouth, and so the mouth is not a likely place to find a toothpick unless it is lost or thrown away in that location.\n\n#### B: grocery\n\nThis doesn\u2019t quite work because the farmer is looking for toothpicks but can\u2019t find them in a grocery store. Toothpicks don\u2019t typically arrive at grocery stores unless a farmer uses a toothpick while at a grocery store and drops it.\n\n#### Evaluation\n\nThe answer is 'D: shed', as toothpicks are commonly kept there.", "answer": "A: mouth"}

The majority of students who get this question wrong do so because they are looking for more elaborate answers. They do recognize that furniture goes on the floor. However, they think they should get some kind of specialized answer that incorporates more information. \n\nFor instance, some students answer \"B\" (the room). However, the question is very clear. It asks you to answer what you are PUTTING on top of the furniture. The answer is \"on top of\" which means the floor. You need to be confident about which response you are giving.  \n\nThe same can be true for \"D\" and \"E.\" They are also good answers. However, they are more general. If you can see the context of the question, you will know that the answer should focus on what you would USE to put the furniture on. \n\nThis question is tricky for some, because they assume it is about ACTUALLY putting the furniture on top. For instance, a student might say that furniture goes on A ROOF. In this case, the answer is wrong because he is not referring to what he IS putting on top but specifically WHAT he would use to put the furniture there. He is missing the small nuance. \n\nThe same applies to \"E.\" While the roofs of buildings are usually more complex than the floors in an apartment, it is still the floor that the furniture is being placed on. Similarly, \"B\" is also a good answer because the furniture will be on top of something. However, the answer is more relevant than that. \n\nIf you struggle with this question in any way, focus on using more specific answers. Do not give answers that are too general. This question is designed to test that you are paying attention to the details. You should try to answer the question as simply and straightforwardly as possible. \n\n### Instructions:\nAnswer the following multiple choice\n\n### Instction:\nWhat kind of food will be eaten after supper?\n\n### Thinking:\nThis question is a little tricky at first.

{"text": "Input: Is it inappropriate to use pencil to write on paper? Choices:  True or False Answer choices: True False\nRationales: This question is very simple, True or False, where there is only one possible answer that could be True and only one possible answer that would be False. This question is asking if it is inappropriate to write using a pencil on paper. To understand whether or not to choose \"True\" for this answer, we have to consider what constitutes \"appropriate\" as an adjective and \"pens\" are certainly more specific than \"pencils\". The word \"paper\" is a type of writing medium and therefore can be considered a blanket term for all the different ways written material can be stored, so the answer is True. The answer is: True.\n\n### Input:\"Tiger\" is the color of a zebra, is it inappropriate where you are not wearing something like that?\n\n###Rationales:\nThis question is similar to the previous one, except it asks about colors rather than \"appropriate\" and is not referencing some specific medium. Therefore, for the same reasons, you can choose to be correct. The answer is: False.\n\n###Answer:\nThis question is straightforward: yes, it is inappropri\n\n### Input\"Tiger\" is the name of a dog, is it appropriate to not wear shoes while running?\n\n### Answer:\nThis one is really tricky to pick because in terms of inappropriateness, dogs can, in fact, be called tigers in some cases as well. However, the word \"shoes\" is more specific than \"footwear\", so tigers need to be considered inappropriate, and that is the answer to this question. True.\n\n## Requirement 3\n### Instruction:\"Tiger\" is a type of cheese, is it appropriate to wear clothes while walking?\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: \"Tiger\" is the kind of cheese, is appropriate to wear clothes while on the stoves?

E: corner thief would have been appropriate had the policemen gone looking for a thief, but that task was not the focus of their activity described in the question.\n\nThe policemen wanted to \"clear the scene of the accident\" (the question says this, not \"direct traffic, hurry traffic, or helping traffic\").\nSince we know that they do not want to help traffic or hurry traffic, we can eliminate B and C.\n\nSince traffic does not exist while traffic is cleared, we can eliminate D.\nWe know that they do not need to force open doors at the site of the accident because traffic does not exist.

{"text": "A: fearless \n\n### Rationales:  1) The question asks which of the following is associated with the color yellow.  \n2) There are 5 answer choices and we need to select one to fulfill the request.  \n3) Let's briefly discuss what we know:  \nWe know that yellow is associated with the emotional characteristic \"courage\".  \nWe do not want to eliminate a choice due to how we feel about it or how uncomfortable it makes us feel because this is not the task requirement.  \nWe also know that the opposite of courageous is cowardly.  \nLet's work through each choice and determine which one is correct.  \nChoice 1: Fearlessness is the opposite of cowardliness, not courageousness.  \nChoice 2: English carrier is not an emotional characteristic, just a type of vehicle. It is clearly the wrong choice at this point in time.  \nChoice 3: Yellow is also associated with the emotional characteristics \"fearlessness\" and \"courageousness\". Both of these characteristics are very similar. Let the question repeat. The opposite of \"courageousness is a bit wordy, so let's break it up. \"Courageousness\" is simply \"courage\" as an adjective. \"Brave\" and \"cowardly\" are opposites of \"courageous\", and \"achromatic\" is the opposite of \"colorful\". If choice 3 is the correct response, the word \"cowardly\" was incorrectly worded and can be edited, but the same question can be presented using the same correct choice. Choice 4: Courage can be associated with color without being directly associated with a color. Therefore, this is also the wrong answer.  \nNow we have 2 answers so far, choice 1 and choice 3.  \nTo be certain that choice 1 is correct, and choice 3 is incorrect, we need to determine if the characteristics associated with the color yellow are related to the emotional characteristic \"fearlessness\".  \nUsing the concept of the \"emotional characteristic circle\", we know that emotional characteristics are related to emotions, to thoughts, and to actions / behaviors, but not to colors.   \nWe know \"courageous\" is associated with the color Yellow  \nWe", "answer": "A: fearless"}

It could be a small townhouse or the Empire State Building\n### Option D: City: Cities do not typically focus on science and science buildings, so this would not likely be considered.\n### Option E: Science: A science building is a specific type of building that focuses on science, so it isn't correct.\n\nOption D: City - A city is a large, densely populated settlement with varying architectural buildings that focus primarily on commerce.\nOption E: Building - A building, as we have mentioned, is a structure that encompasses a certain space. It can be a commercial, educational, or government building. The question is focused around the construction of a SCIENCE building.\nTherefore, we can conclude that Option D, City, is wrong.\n\nOption A: Fraternities - This answer option can be eliminated immediately because it is a social organization founded in the collegiate system for both men and women.\nOption B: Bank - This cannot be an option for several reasons.\nFirstly, it does not allow for any room for creativity of a new science building.\nSecondly, it is not scientifically speaking.\nThirdly, a millionaire or billionaire does not usually donate to fund projects for rebuilding banks.\n\nOption C: Science - This would never be the focus of a former college of a billionaire due to the fact that the two do not go hand in hand.\n\nOption E: Science Building - Lastly, we get to Science Building.

Option E, Washing, can be excluded as it is not listed items that need to be sorted, but a task that needs to be carried out. Based on this, option G, A list of the people I spoke to today, is incorrect as it is an item that was spoken about, and not something that needs to be sorted.

Based on this, the answer is C, a cab, as the last thing the narrator wants to do after coming out of the bar is to get into a taxi, which would add to and increase the likelihood of them feeling sick. Option A, the subway, can be eliminated as it is unlikely that someone who has been out the night before would want to get on the subway.

Both Wedge and Parabola are the shapes of curves. So, (A) cannot be the correct option.\n\nParabola contains all the points under the curve, while wedge only contains certain points around the opening. Parabola has to be symmetric, while the wedge has no symmetry.

The question is looking to identify a \"place\" (i.e., a specific location) that provides a \"table\" (i.e. a specific item) for eating.\n2. While the question could have used other phrasing, its structure implies that all the \"eat\"/\"table\" components must refer to a place (i.e., not something portable or a personal item) and for eating (i.e., in the manner of consumption rather than cooking).\n3. Looking at options, we know that it cannot be a:\n   B: train station - Trains are not specifically known for their wide areas where multiple people can sit (eat) at a table.\n   C: cafeterias - These are food eating locations and can feature places for sitting, but not specifically at a table.\n4. From here, we can determine that it cannot be E: park - Parks include grass areas where people can sit on a blanket (not specifically a table) and eat as well as picnic tables, but these are more portable (can be moved) and would not be included in the original question (to eat at a table.)\n5.

{"text": "The answer depends on why they are unable to stop. Consider that it might be due to lack of awareness and a desire to not hurt someone else. In that case, they would feel regret (C). Consider that it could have arisen from recklessness. In that case, it'll lead to despair (D). \n\n### Rationale: This is a situation which may be difficult to answer accurately. A person who unintentionally hurts someone else may feel empowered as they got away with something they're not supposed to do. Alternatively, they may feel regret as they are remorseful about hurting the other person and wish to apologize. It's also possible they might feel glee as it's unlikely that they'll need to admit to their actions. They might also feel glad or happy that they were able to hurt the other person but sad as they aren't proud of their actions or that they had to hurt someone. So, the answer to this question depends on several different factors which cannot be analyzed from just one sentence.\n\n### Consideration: This question asks about the likely sentiment that someone feeling unintentionally hurt might feel. There are some answers that are clearly incorrect, while others are not as easily eliminated. Given these factors, this is a good question for a learner to practice thinking about the nuances of human emotions and situations where people are likely to feel a certain way.\n\n### Input 1\n\n### Your choice: Write about your favorite holiday.\n\n### Response 1\n\nMy favorite holiday is Easter, as it's full of color and the symbolism of hope and birth.

{"text": "A: Work hard\n\n### Response Justification:Work hard (A) is the best answer choice because 'bumps' (noun) usually indicates that things are moving at a slower pace, not faster. Furthermore, 'bump' (verb) is about touching with force.\nAnother important factor is that the question mentions 'when you are walking' (prepositional phrase) which indicates a continuous movement. This is because the speaker (the narrator, probably the boss) is issuing instructions and is generally not expecting to bump into the 'ali' (person) he is talking about.\nTherefore, the correct logical conclusion would be that 'working hard' is something more in line with what the speaker or the boss might expect the 'ali' to do.\n\n### Inputs: How much would you need to pay for car insurance if you had $12000 worth of assets? Choices: A: $72 B: $92 C: $168 D: $256 E: $360\n\n### Response A: $72\n\n### Response justification:\nThe reason it's $72 instead of $92 is because $72 is the minimum payment for a 60-month loan, which is a long enough period that the annual tax rate on the assets would be 3%. $72 is also a full-value loan which means that the borrower must put at least 10% into the asset to get the maximum loan amount; if he/she cannot put at least 15% down, the asset must be worth less than $72,500. Therefore, $72 for an asset worth $120,000 with a value-to-loan ratio of 72.32 percent ($84,000) is reasonable and more likely to be the answer.\n\n### Other Notes: Car loans usually last 48-60 months.\n\n### Relevant links:\n[Quora Link](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-quick-and-easy-ways-to-convert-decimal-numbers-to-percentages)\n\n[Wesam](https://www.wesam.com/calculator/calculator.aspx)", "answer": "B: slow down"}

The question is alluding to storing an instrument such as a clarinet or flute, so we can eliminate the four answers given that are all rooms of houses. \n2. While a band room could be an option for storing a musical instrument, we can eliminate that option because the question didn't specify that the room was a band room. \n3. It's unlikely that an instrument would be stored in a bedroom or under a bed since it requires care and regular playtime that may become inconvenient to store directly in the home.\n4. Therefore, option B is the most reasonable answer when assessing the situation since the room designated for music, or the music room, is most likely where people would want to store an instrument such as a flute.\n5.

Choices: \nA: communication B: text C: silence D: gesture E: look\nRationales:\nA) Communication: Communication is used when two or more individuals interact and exchange relevant and useful information. It can be verbal (e.g., saying) or nonverbal (e.g. body language). To find out information about someone, verbal communication would be the appropriate choice. \nB) Text: It does include the communication, however, the choice 'communication' includes various forms of communiqu\u00e9, such as the spoken language, whereas the choice 'text' refers to a written message that does not involve oral communication. \nC) Silence:'silence' is not considered a means by which to find out information from an individual, but a state of absence of communication. When trying to find out information about someone through a conversation, silence will not produce any information about them. \nD) Gesture: When communicating with someone, one form of communication is expressing oneself through gestures. In this instance, these gestures will help reveal the identity of someone. Therefore, 'gesture' is the answer. \nE) Look: When someone 'looks' at another person, it shows a level of interest in that other person.

Therefore, 'look' is the answer.\n\nAnswer: The correct choice from the following is: E: Look.\n\n> Explanation: Looking at someone is a form of communication that can determine who that person might be. It is an attempt to determine the identity of someone, through a form of communication in the form of gesture.\n\n\n### Instutions:Where might I discover information about people?

Choices: 1) Set aside a certain number of times to read daily 2) Limiting yourself to certain number of pages per read 3) Keep a diary of your reading habits each day 4) Read from a book every day 5) Buy a book to help you read better\n\n### Response to request:\n\nThe correct response should be 2) Limiting number of pages per-read.\n\n### Response Explained:\n\nThe purpose of reading is to gain information, read a story, etc. To  best be informed or receive as much information as possible out of a  book, we should read at least for a certain number of pages, so that we won't  miss any information that can be found within the book's pages. Therefore, the  first step of improving reading habits is to limit the amount of pages  to-be-read in one session to a certain number of pages that is appropriate  according to the type of book so as the book can be read completely  and properly. This strategy will be most effective in improving our reading  habits.\n\n\n### Input : What is the most logical conclusion to be drawn from the following sentences in the question?\nChoices:  A.

The police will catch the boy and arrest him\n\n### Response :\n\nThe most logical conclusion is that the police will arrest the boy if they can prove that he is the culprit who had actually stolen the bicycles. This can be understood by considering the sentence in which it is said that the boy has stolen the bike from the police station and the question asks us about the conclusion.\nAlthough we don\u2019t know if the police will catch him and arrest him at this point, the inference is most certainly that he will be the object of the investigation and will later be captured by the police, as it is stated in the sentence that the police are currently investigating", "answer": "E: class room"}

D: a fence 5. E: a ramp\n\nRationales;\n\n### Instructions: \nThere is no way that the answer would be an \u201cabyss\u201d or a \u201cfence.\u201d For starters, the word \u201cside\u201d appears in the question, which implies that the person is positioned horizontally\u2014lying down, instead of vertically. Therefore, there\u2019s no way this could be option A. In the same way, an \u201cabys\u201d is vertical, so it can\u2019t be a correct answer. Secondly, the question mentions the choice of \u201clying on the side,\u201d which implies that this is a position that involves a person being horizontal. For another reason, the answer cannot be choice B, as it\u2019s describing the state of being \u201con a pond,\u201d which implies being in a vertical position. If the person was on the pond, they would be standing. Since a pond is a large body of water, that person would be standing upright and looking down upon the pond\u2019s surface. Therefore, the response can\u2019t be choice B because it\u2019s a state or position that implies verticality. Likewise, we can eliminate a number of other choices for being similar to the previous two: there can\u2019t be a choice for \u201con a highway\u201d or \u201cat a bus stop\u201d because that implies uprightness. Since the person is lying on the side, the \u201chighway\u201d implies being upright and the \u201cfence\u201d implies standing upright. So, the answers for choice C and choice D are out of the question.\n\nLikewise, we can\u2019t consider choice E. It\u2019s a ramp\u2014a small slope or gradual incline\u2014not a \u201cside.\u201d It\u2019s describing the surface you\u2019re walking along, not a surface you\u2019re lying on when you\u2019re horizontal. In addition to the reasons already mentioned, there can\u2019t be an answer of choice B, because the surface of a ramp is usually smooth, unlike an off-kilter \u201cside.\u201d\n\n##", "answer": "C: every city"}

Choices: \nA: disgust B: apathy C: pleasure D: interest E: hate\nRationales: The question asks what would your words and your body language imply if you were to say that you did not like broccoli.\n1. We have to consider what the words and the body movements might imply if told someone that you don't like broccolli.\n2. 'Apathy' is not a good answer as it is an overall attitude or emotion, and we are not asked to give the overall attitude or emotion of the person.\n3. 'Pleasure' cannot be the correct answer as that is the same as 'disgust'.\n4. The person who likes broccoli would then express pleasure with words while doing a positive body posture.\n5. Since we can select a body posture response with our choice, I will eliminate response 'E: hate'. \n6. 'Hate' is a strong word and would be used for responding to the person (who doesn't like broccolis). So, it can't be the answer.\n7. 'Disgust' can be the correct answer as disgust can imply the person who doesn't like brocolli. The person who likens broccoli wouldn't be 'disgust'\n8. 'Pleasure', 'Interest' and 'Disgust' are all words that the person who wants to like brocolli would use.\n9. Therefore the correct answer from our choice is 'C: pleasure'.\n10.

{"text": "Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Demonstration:Input:What is the result or consequence of instituting civil actions? Choices:  Answer: A: bad feelings B - confusion C - going to court D - hurt feelings E - sandwiches\n\nRationales:1. The question asks about the result (i.e., consequence) of \"instituting civil actions.\"\n2. In order to get to the correct answer, we should first understand what an \"institution\" is.\n3. \"Civil action\" does not mean \"court action.\" Rather, it refers to civil law which is law governing citizens i.e. any non-criminal matters such as contracts, marriages, torts, property, etc. (https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/civil+action)\n4. It is important to note though that this question does not specify the actual type/category of civil actions, so the answer is not limited to a single type of civil actions (say, property law or marriage law). Rather, the answer could be any of the five options, depending on the type/category of civil action being instigated.\n5. So for the question as stated, we cannot say with certainty that it is \"going to court\" that is the result of \"instituting\" any particular type of civil action.\n6. In fact, going to court is only an option if the type of civil action being instituted is court action- for example, if I issue a court summons to you, you have the consequence of \"going to court.\" On the other hand, in case I issue a court summmon for you, the consequence will be \"going to court.\"\n7. So in our example, \"going to court\" may not be the ultimate outcome/result of \"instituting X type of civil action.\"\n8. However, that being said, \"going to court \" could be the most common result/consequence of a number of civil lawsuits e.g., those involving property and tort.\n9. So, what other options could be a result of \"institut(ing) civil action\"?\n10. We start by eliminating E: sandwiches.\n11. Sandwiches will not be a consequence of instituting any type of civil action, since they have nothing to do", "answer": "C: going to court"}
{"text": "C: bedroom\n\n### Demand Explanation/ Justification:\nFirst, the man was not happy about stepping on tile, so we can quickly eliminate the choice for 'c' as that is tile floor. Secondly, 'E' is the open gym, which we can also quickly eliminate as the man was not happy stepping on the tile, which we saw was indoors. The only remaining options are 'A' and 'B'. 'A' is for 'houses', but this is not a feasible or logical choice since the tile he was stepping on was indoors. This is also the same for 'B' since we are talking about the'man' here, and not a family. We can thus eliminate 'A' and also choose 'B' as his bedroom was carpeted. Thus the full answer here is 'B; bedroom'.   \n\n### Input:-Why is a fishing hook used to catch a fish at a sea, lake or river?\n\n### Response:-Because it uses magnetism to draw fish in from the sea, lake, or river.\n\n### Explanation:-In order to catch a fish at sea, lake, or a river, one may use a hook.\n\n### Input- I was at a movie theater waiting for the movie to start, and my seatmate was a cute male.

Option A: 'Giggle.' Laughter is an important reaction when hearing a joke. \n3. Option B: 'Lie.' No, lying isn't a natural reaction to hearing a joke. It doesn't make any sense to lie, and moreover it would not be socially appropriate to lie. \n4. Option C: 'Laughing.' The given situation doesn't really allow for the person to laugh. They are just hearing a joke that someone else is telling. They are not going to laugh in a situation that they themselves are not telling a joke for, like on stage. \n5. Option D: 'Chuckle.' An interesting reaction to a joke but it definitely wouldn't be the most natural choice for a person hearing a joke, and the word 'chuckle' isn't a commonly used one when describing a specific reaction to a joke. 6.

One can be entertained without necessarily being happy or without being happy by entertainment.\n\nD. walk slowly\n\nAs explained above, walking slowly is symptomatic with something, not necessarily indicative of anything.

The attic is located on the roof of a house and is typically reached by a staircase or other narrow, low door. Because of this, it is well-suited for storage since it is easy to reach and the space is large enough to store many bottles of wine. It also tends to stay cooler than other rooms in the home, further preserving the integrity of the wine.", "answer": "B: basement"}
{"text": "C.\n\n### Rationale:\n\nThe question makes reference to a 'place' where one might find lots of plastic things. To answer correctly, we need to think about the type or context of plastic things a person with children might have. So options A and B are out since they're not places where people keep plastic things. Option C: own home could reasonably place plastic things. However, a parent would not generally store a large number of these items in their own home unless they had more than four or five children. So, one would store these items in a dumpster or other area of large scale storage. Option E: garbage dump is an acceptable place. \n\n### Annotated solutions\n\n### Solutions:Input:A person with children has many rubber duckies. They are typically stored where? Choices:  X: child's room A: toy box B: cupboard C: own home D. everywhere E: garbage dump\nRationales:1. The query asks about where a set of rubber duckies are typically stored. \n2. Let us consider each selection and see if they are possible locations for a set of rubber toys.\n3. A: 'Toy box' is a suitable place, yet rubber toys aren't limited to toys inside a toy box.\n4. B: 'Cabinet' is a suitable place where rubber toys can be kept, although in this case, it is unlikely a set of rubber-based toys will be stored there.\n5. C: 'Own home' is generally where one would store their belongings, but rubber toys can also be found in public spaces, such as schools, daycares, playrooms, etc.\n6. D: An 'Everywhere' selection indicates the general availability of rubber articles, but that wouldn't satisfy the condition that they are 'rubber duckies'.\n7. E: A 'Garbage Dump' location wouldn't satisfy the context of the question where 'there are many' rubber duckies to begin with.\n8. So the location option with the best match is D: Everywhere as rubber duckies can be found in a diverse set of locations.\nAnswer: D: Everywhere\n\n### Input : What must a parent do", "answer": "C: own home"}
{"text": "A bride and a groom would generally be \"getting things done\" (B) and \"finishing\" them (E) before a wedding ceremony (A, C), so the logical answer is both (B, E).\n\n### Input:(1) There is a bird on the top of a house. What is the likely position of the house? \n> Choices:  A) Upside-down (2) B) Right-side-up (3) C) Tilted up (4) D) Tilted down\n> Rationales: (1) The question asks us to identify where the bird is most likely to be sitting. (2) It is unlikely that the position of the house will affect where the bird sits, so it should have little bearing. (3) The bird is probably on the edge of the roof, or even on the edge of a window or ledge. (4) The position of the house may make it \"tilted\" from the norm, but likely will not affect where the bird satiates.\n### Answer:(1) D)(1) and (2) are correct. The question here does not involve a specific location and doesn't refer to the 'where' position of the house (i.e. on its roof or in a particular part of the house). Rather, the question focuses on the 'how' position of the house - tilted or right-side-up. The position of the roofing surface cannot determine whether a bird is sitting on the roof or on the siding, or even between the roof and the siding. All this is clear when you consider that birds tend to use ledges, windowsills, gutters, etc. This suggests that the bird isn't on the roof at all, but in another spot near the roof. (4) is incorrect because it makes the assumption that tiltedness will determine where the bird sits. It can't, as per (i) above. (3) is, however, incorrect because it doesn't give any reasoning behind why one should prefer the third answer. (2) is the only option that can support its reasoning: since it is impossible to put a bird on top of a house in a right-side-up position, therefore the house will be tilted.\n### Answer(2) B)(3) is partially correct.

Question: What task is asked?\n    * The question asks one to find the answer that identifies what is inevitable when people have a large morning breakfast with many people.\n    * The word \"inevitably\" is used to mean \"certainly\" or \"with no doubt.\"\n    * The question uses the words \"breakfast\" and \"morning\" to mean a morning meal and implies that the people are sitting at a table while eating (instead of walking around or standing).\n    * The context also indicates that the people have to stay together at one location because they are all in the kitchen area.\n2. Clarification of the request:\n    * The request for the response is \"write a response that appropriately\" finishes the sentence: __________ leads to a pile __________.\n    * We know the sentence has to be finished. The options are: an underwear, a bad breath, a better day, and a dirty dishes.\n3. Analysis of the options:\n    * Among the options, only \"dirty dishes\" can logically replace the missing word.\n    * \"Underwear/bad breath\" is likely not present because they are not logical to find/have in a sink.\n    * \"Better day\" is likely not present either unless it somehow links to a \"dirty dishes.\"\n    * \"Dirty dishes\" is the only logical option because they are typically found in a sink after a meal.\n4.

They are not found in the state of Michigan or in a lake.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer for the question is D, the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n###  Question 5\nInput: Dad tells mom the name of what, and the name of what to her? Choices: \nA: daughter, spy B: spy, daughter C: kangaroo, marsupial D: marsupial, kangaroo E: daughter, spy\nRationales:\n1. By the question setting, we may expect that the question will ask for the names of things told to Dad by Mom. \n2. In the possible answer choices, options C (kangaroo, marsuopial) and E (daughter, spy) seem to fit the question but their answer places them in the opposite direction.\n3. Dad and Mom are related to the daughter and spy in options A (dad, daughter) and B (mom, spy) respectively. \n4.

Choices:  I: a frog II: a rabbit III: a bird IV: a mouse V: a cat VI: a bee\nRationales: I: The question asks us to identify something \"that is not a computer.\"\n2. A frog isn't a computer, as a computer is an abstraction that can't exist in such a tangible, corporeal form.\n3. A rabbit, bird, mouse, and cat aren't computers either as they are all living, flesh-and-blood organisms.\n4. Lastly, a bee is a potential candidate as a computer. Bees \"communicate\" with one another in a network-like fashion (using dance as the \"language\"), work in groups to sustain their hive, and store their collected food in a central food library. This is what makes a bee a good example of a computer because 1. It demonstrates some of the characteristics of a computer, 2. It is an abstract concept, and 3.

The question asks for the location where pencils with a company's \"logomark\" are likely to be found.\n2. Possible locations could include; office, school, backpack or pencil.\n3. From the perspective of \"company\" and \"label\", it's not likely that the response would be from a pencil or a backpack, or a \"pencil\".\n4. The question suggests a \"PEN\" - a writing utensil.\n5. We can eliminate A (Office) because it's too big a concept to be used as the term \"Office\" isn't specific.\n6. We cannot eliminate D (Backpack) because there's an option of pens being found in backpacks, and since the question doesn't further specify, the option remains.\n7. The term \"Label\" is probably something that can be found on a pencil.\n8. We can ignore C and E as there's no need. \n9.

Choices:  Choices:  A. make a lot of movement B. make a lot of noise C. look very different D. make loud sounds E. create an unusual sound\nRationale: This question can be answered by eliminating the wrong choices. Some of these are so obvious it's hard to believe that people have done them and think that it would attract more attention. It's hard to imagine someone saying \"Hey look at me. I want your attention\" while acting like the dumbest person on earth. There would be a discrepancy that would likely arouse suspicion. Other things like looking different or making unusual sounds may also be a distraction because you aren't trying to get attention, instead you're drawing it to an unusual event.\nThe correct answer is C: looking very different.\n\nInput: A good way to practice writing would be to write what?

Writing a paper about what you'll do in the future is not particularly going to help you write. This is the type of thing that you might discuss with your family or friends.

Looking at each choice, the options that are possible for the investigator, not the owner, are B) \"back to its owner\" and D) \"crime scene.\"\n3. Option B) isn't likely and is eliminated because we know there is an unknown reason to send it back to its owner, and also a person doesn't normally return an item with potential evidence to its owner if the item is the source of evidence.\n4. The reasoning behind Elimination for D) \"crime\" is that the investigator wouldn't send it to the owner's crime after all, for the same reason as Elimination, but also because it's not reasonable to leave a firearm at a crime scene and in the hands of criminals.\n5. The investigator is also eliminating A) \"drawer\" and E) \"holster\" because we know that the owner is aware of the gun, possibly as a result of the death of the individual responsible for putting the gun in there.\n6. What is left is C) \"Police station\" and B) \"back-to-owner.\"\n7. Option A) \"drawer,\" we know, was previously eliminated so that leaves option B) \"back- to-owner.\"\n8.

Choices: A: accomplishing B: resting C-D: moving, standing D: starting C: performing B: taking a rest C-D: accomplishing, moving, standing, starting\n\n### Response\nAnswer: B: taking rest\n\n### Demaration\nIn the sentence, a noun and verb must always be used. In example 5B, \"The lizard frightened the walker, it's movements caused what rustle?\" where \"rustle\" is the noun, and \"caused\" is the verb.\n\n### Example 6\nTaking a rest can be understood as a verb in two different ways. One, when a person takes a rest, she or he may be accomplishing nothing. Or, secondly, taking a rest is both performing the act of resting, as well as, the result of accomplishing resting.\n\n### Explanation\nThe question is \"When a person begins work on a task, what are they doing that first?\"\n\nAnswer options\n* \"A: Accomplishing\" This option includes working with the aim of accomplishment. However, this question asks about what a person is doing when they begin work and the accompishment is not the \"start\" of work.\n* \"B: Resting\" Resting comes before the \"starting\" stage. A person might rest before work, but this is not correct because the question is about what happens when a person begins work.\n* \"D: Moving\" In moving, a person is doing the act of moving (which doesn't describe the beginning of work) and it comes after the \"starting\" of work, not before.\n* \"C-D: Accomplishing, Moving, Standing, Starting\" It's not clear what these options even mean. For example, \"starting\", \"moving\" and \"standing\" are all verbs, so does that make the options A: verb and B: verb?

That is because \u2018\u2018Gulf Of Mexico\" contains natural formations as compared to \"Indo Pacific Ocean\" or \"South Pacific.\" According to the \u2018\u2018Gulf Of Louisiana\u2019\u2019 it contains an aquatic exhibit that can be viewed from a tunnel.\nHence, the correct answer is \u201cE\u201d: Gulf of Mexico\n\n### Input;  where might John purchase a new treadmill if his current one is broken and his treadmill has a broken belt?\n\n### Response\nThe correct answer is E: gym, and the correct answer is E because in order to purchase a new tread mill one should go to where a tread mill is sold.

{"text": "I've given the instructions and rationales above. The correct answer is B: fear. The most likely reason someone confesses to a murder they committed is out of fear.\n### Additional Rationale:1. Fear is a common motivating factor to confess to being guilty when you aren't. One could confess out of a guilty conscience, but in this context, the question does not explicitly specify that the person confessed out of a guilty conscience.\n2. Going free or getting help with problems are common motivations for confessing to committing a crime that one didn't commit.

{"text": "Noise could help us discover what we do not want because it causes distress and confusion. A dull sound makes the world seem unfriendly, and unfamiliar noise could be alarming to a person.\nWe may use sound to identify hazards by perceiving different noises in distinct ways. Loud sounds such as screams or shouting could alert someone to a problem and the location of the sound allows them to reach the source of the problem. Similarly, the sound of running water may indicate water damage, and the difference between the sounds of a doorbell or a timer helps tell time.\n\nThe brain's perception system is important in deciding how to respond to sounds, especially when they come from unexpected sources. For example, if a person woke up in the middle of the night to find they were being bitten by a dog, the sound of the barking would trigger a panicked response because it's an unknown and unfamiliar sound. The inability to learn could cause problems because it could prevent us from understanding the world around us. It could also make it difficult to perform specific tasks that require specific sounds or movements. For example, someone with learning difficulties may not be able to learn sign language, and people may not be able to recognize their name if they cannot learn their name, and they may not be able to communicate with others.\n\nThe inability to learn causes distress because it can stop us from doing the things we want to do or need to do and it can make it difficult to function in society. It can also make it hard to understand what is happening around us, and it can cause problems in communication and social interaction.\nThe inability to recognize speech could be problematic because it can affect how a person can communicate with others. There are other ways to communicate besides speech, such as sign language, but if someone cannot understand the difference in sounds, they may not be able understand sign language or other communication methods. The inability to understand could affect how people are able to learn. They may find it difficult to access information that will help them learn and develop, and they might experience a high degree of stress in learning situations.

In addition, people tend to have tea before they start their day or before they stop by a bank. Thus, having tea in a bank is more common than the other choices presented. \nYou May Also Like - [TCS Interview Experience for FTE on 9th July 2021](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/723489314752185522/)\n\n### Choices with incorrect logical explanation: \n\n- [1] - Make noise- This choice is incorrect because we cannot \"make noise\" inside the bank's office.\n- [2] - Take time- This choice is incorrect as it is an \"action,\" so it is not logical to \"take time\" in a bank, and also, it means that people are not \"taking time\" in the bank.\n- [3] - Payments- This choice is incorrect for the same reason as above.\n- [4] - Make payments- This choice is also incorrect since it has the same meaning as [3] and is also redundant with [3].\n- [5] - Make payments\n- [6] - Have Pizza- This choice is incorrect and would be more suited to an Italian restaurant rather than a bank.\n\n\n### So, let's recap on what we know about the bank. \n\nAs we can see, having tea is the answer that fits best with the bank. We don't normally speak about coffee in a bank, so drinking tea would make sense. Although the bank may have tea as an option during specific events or activities (e.g., \"We have tea available in our lobby during this event\"), we don't think that would be expected.\n\n### Here is another example: \n\nInput: Where should we take an object with", "answer": "D: make payments"}

{"text": "A: carpet B: breadbox\n\n### Rationale:\n\nThe question indicates that the leftovers had a considerable age, which suggests they had been in storage for a long period. We can then infer that this would be sufficient time to grow a thick layer of mold, which is what we should expect to discover in the storage.\n\n### Choice explanation:\n\nThe question mentions that they had been forgotten, which would mean they would be placed in a storage place. This gives us a possible idea of the location, which is a storage.\n\nThe question mentions, \"The forgotten leftover.\" This implies that they refer to food or a meal. Hence, it makes sense to look for the storage of the same.\n\nSince, the forgotten leftovers were old, they'll be old once again after a long period of storage.

It's possible that different options can't match, leaving what doesn't match (A: filtration) \n    - Option C:  This process includes the elimination of what does not match however, doesn't happen after we compare different options. The process of comparison (C) occurs before we try to match different options. While we do compare options to identify what does match, we can't see if any option doesn't match something after we compare them and eliminate what matches (Recognition). \n    - Option A: If the process is filtration, we can't have what doesn't match left. We eliminate what doesn't go together after we compare and find what matches. Therefore, what is left can't have what goes with every option. When every match is eliminated, only what doesn't match would be what's left. Therefore, this is not possible (A: filtrate)\n    - Option E: The process of division is used to identify how many parts come out of something whole.\n    - Option B: This choice doesn't make sense because this process requires recognition and comparison which is used to eliminate what doesn't fit with what we're trying to match, and not to find what does fit with what we'd like to match.\n    - The answer is C (Comparison).\nAnswer: C:Comparison\n\n### Input1:Mother and father bought a new computer.

However, in this case, one is actually feeling full, which is what the question asks about.\n\nAlso, \"satisfaction\" isn't the answer one is looking for as it is about feeling satisfied with the tasting menu. So, \"getting sick\" is not the best answer; however, one still feels ill and therefore cannot feel everything.\n\nThis leaves the options \"full\" and \"D: sick.\"\n\nOf these, full can be eliminated because it's not the correct answer for the question.\n\nSo, the appropriate choice would be \"D: sick\".\n\n### Explanation:\n\nIt is not really the word \"answer\" that we are answering to the question, but an \"explanation.\" This is a question of reasoning based on an explanation.

The reason why someone eats a tasting menu before eating healthy meals is not to gain weight but to become full.\n\nBecause \"sick\" is not the correct answer, we cannot pick \"B: getting full\". There is no other explanation to the question.\n\n## See also\n\n* Critical thinking\n* Reasoning\n\n## References\n\n<References/>", "answer": "B: getting full"}

But if the street is gated off, that would prevent you from having to have community and streets around you to be able to be able to go on your private street without interference.\n\n6.

However, one cannot be certain that the TV is the cause of this in the first place. \n3. \"Laziness\" (B) could be a result of sitting too close and watching TV for too long, but it doesn't directly come from sitting too close to the screen.\n    - Laziness is a side effect, not an immediate effect, and one cannot really tell if it's the direct cause of sitting too close and then experiencing the pain, or if it's just a symptom.\n4. \"Headache\" (E) could be caused by looking too long at the TV screen, though the headaches could be caused by other issues, such as spine issues.\n5. \"Laughter\" (D) would not be associated with whatsoever with a pain linked to watching TV too close. \n6.

So, there's no reason not to believe that the \"they\" are attending some sort of game and that they are eating some food that the pretty food he's bringing over was made for.\n10. A: picnic is out, B: friend's place is out, D: space shuttlers is out, and E: fairgrounds isn't the answer.\n11. We're left with the logical possibility that it's the \"they\" who he's accompanying that are getting together for the game, for whom he brought pretty food with him over to the table.\n12.

{"text": "The answer is D.confession. The word 'confession' means an acknowledgment or statement of belief\n\n### Response 1:\nAuditorium is incorrect because the word 'auditorium' has two meanings in the English language. \nOne of the meanings is the part of a theater where spectators sit. Another meaning is an anatomically correct name for the hollow space in the back of the neck. The answer is not specifically referring to the seat where you have your head, in which case it would actually include the seat that the spectators sit in, so we can choose to go with this as the correct answer because they might be in a large auditorium and 'be' sitting because it was an anatomically correct term. \n\nB office is incorrect because, by definition, offices are 'A room used in business for meetings, record keeping or other work, typically (but not necessarily) one in a building'. So it does not have to house so many people sitting in chairs listening to a sermon or religious speech.\n\nC synagogue has the word 'listening' which is correct, as well as the word'sermon'. The only problem is that the sermon is delivered in a synagogue for religious speech. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\nE church has all the qualities of being correct, however, there isn't actually a sermon being given off in a church, it is just a place of worship and the church itself or the churchgoers would not be listening to a sermon.\n\nD: Confession is the correct answer because if you are going to a confession, you are hearing a sermon. To be a confessional, there must be a space to sit down and listen. Therefore the only option which has all the elements is D: Confession.\n\n### Response2:\nIn order to answer this question correctly, we need to eliminate all of the incorrect parts of the answer choices. The first step in eliminating incorrect parts from the answer choices is to examine and remove the irrelevant parts. Now let's begin by saying that the best answer choice is option B. This happens to be \"B: Office.\" \n\nOffice isn't incorrect necessarily, but as we said it's not what the answer choice is looking for. We'll keep going.

The question is attempting to determine one of the uses of electric eels.\n2. There are several contexts where electric eels could potentially be used.\n3. Exclusions: Option A: bath tub - while this could potentially be used for shocking, such an unusual use case is highly unlikely.\n4. Option B: home - It is not likely that an electric eel would be sold as a pest control device for the home.\n5. Option A: car - While it could be hypothetically possible to use an electric eel as a jolt to start a car, it is not likely in this scenario, and would not be the most obvious approach.\n6. Option: Ocean - This is the most logical and direct use for it as the electric eel lives primarily in the ocean. Hence, it is unlikely to use electric eels in any other context except for the ocean.\n7. Option: bathtubs - The answer choice is unlikely because using an electric eel in a bathtub is quite a strange idea, and an unusual use case that seems impractical.\n8.

{"text": "> Answer: (D) Frustration\n### Rationale: The options aren't clearly defined, but D is a more logical possibility since the question is about one's response, which suggests that there is some sort of frustration related to being paid. Considering the situation of 'getting paid' and it being one's reaction to money coming in could be positive or negative, but the question doesn't really make it clear that the frustration is negative. If we rephrase the question to ask what emotion getting paid can lead to, we could infer frustration as the answer (since it's a 'getting' action, which implies a negative reaction to receiving something that one might have wanted).\n\n### Input, 7:\n>What's the first step to building a snowman?

{"text": "Based on the question we can assume that they were traveling by plane and needed to check the weather. This is because they were on their way somewhere, and needed to know the weather for their destination. Additionally, a paradise would normally be associated with good weather. Since they want it to look beautiful, the correct answer would be A: Paradise.\n\n### Response II\n\nThis question is asking me what the weather is needed for. Well I think paradise is not a place or thing but rather a state. When we think of a paradise we think of it as a place that is happy and relaxing. This implies that we need happy and relaxing weather for a paradise to happen. So our options would be either B (happy and relaxing) or C (no inclement weather). Now let's think about the weather itself. The wind, precipitation, and temperature. Let's start with the wind. We know that paradise is a state. However, wind is not always positive nor negative. It could be warm, warm, cold, but most commonly it is described as calm or mild. Another thing to address is precipitation as well as temperature. Rain, snow, frost, heat, cold, and humidity. These things all may or may not occur when you're in a paradise. We could have all these things or none of these things. If we think about the temperature, rain, and snow we could conclude that paradise could occur anywhere as long as the elements are nice. Now let's talk about humidity. When we're in paradise, we don't want to sweat from the humidity. So if it's not humid in our paradise, it must have no sweat (unless we wanted to sweat due to exercise). We can remove all the weather options that are sweat related or that cause us to sweat by removing humidity, frost, and heat. This leaves us with clouds if we look at rain, fog if we look at cold, and wind if we look at snow. So now we only need nice weather, it's not that difficult to get to paradise. So our answer is either B or C. The options D and E might happen in our paradise, although we don't want it to. D could also happen on route to paradise. But there is a higher chance it will happen in our destination.", "answer": "A: look beautiful"}

{"text": "The question is asking one to identify why someone can say that I am a person.\n\n### Rationales:\n\nThe first thing to understand about this question is that the reason that I is a person is because I is human which makes me unique as a human among the other animals in the world (like dogs and cats). We should be able to recognize this fact by just looking at the question and it's answer choices.\n\nIf we start by eliminating answer choice A, we can eliminate answer choice A because A could be a dog or a cat (or another animal).\n\nAnswer choice B, C, D and E do not make sense because these answer choices are not unique to humans but rather specific abilities that any human or animal with the ability to speak spanish, etc. can do.\n\nThe only unique thing that humans can do that no other animal can do is to speak. Because of this ability, humans should be able to further their education which makes C and D ineligible because other animals like dogs and cats cannot take college classes.\n\nFinally answer choice E is the right answer since humans are the only animal that has the unique ability to speak and therefore will be able to further their educations.\n\n\n###  Example:\n\n```python\nI = 'Johnny'\nif I:\n\tprint('I')\n\n# I is a string\n```\n\n### Instructions:\n\n* Write a function called printI() that takes in one argument 'x'.

What we don't know is that single-home refers to house or an apartment. \n\nD: 'own home' could refer to the home that belongs to both homeowners like house/apartment or it could refer to where they live. In this case, single home is likely to be house/apartment. \n\nSo, that narrows down answers from A: top of home to E: material.\nSo the correct answer would be E: material.\n```", "answer": "C: victorian house"}

So, this option isn't suitable for this question.\n   Option E, \"inspiration,\" is definitely what a teacher needs. It's inspiration to impart knowledge to children and to teach them effectively.\n   Option D, \"teachers,\" refers to what teachers already possess; it's not an additional component of their role.\n\nTherefore: What teachers need is 'a lot of inspiration' and this is what they already have.\n\nTherefore the correct answer is D: teachers", "answer": "B: patience"}
{"text": "The most logical answer is A: fresh smell.\nNotes: \nExplanation: The question asks for the purpose of putting on lotion.\nThus, we should look at what it means by \"lotion\", and that is as to prevent damage to skin, to provide hydration, and, most likely, for improving its aesthetic appearance by making it soft, smooth, and pleasant to touch.\n\nIt was mentioned that the person put on lotion to \"prevent damage to skin\".\nBut, this suggests that they \"polluted\" or \"damaged\" their skin and then are looking to redeem it somehow, or that they were already concerned about their skin and are looking for a solution.\n\nFurthermore, \"putting on lotion\" does not necessarily refer to applying it in general. \nThe way the sentence is crafted, to us it suggests that they are concerned with or focused on their skin's aesthetic appeal or comfort level.\n\nSo, the two answers that support that, are:\n```A: fresh smell``` -- As lotion can be smelled, it likely refers to their skin's smell, to refresh it, to make it less unpleasant. \n```B: good credit``` -- As lotion is a skin treatment, and not a monetary transaction that is reflected in one's finances.\n\nWe reject choices C, D, and E because they don't seem to match the context of applying lotion to one's skin.\n```C: smooth skin``` -- Smooth skin has to be had, so applying lotion doesn't support it.\n```D: fresh produce``` -- Pondering over produce items to smell or taste might smell, but if you're seeking smell, it's irrelevant compared to the purpose of applying lotion.\n```E: headache``` -- As mentioned above, this smells like it refers to skin damage, and applying lotion would address it, not the other way around.\n\n### Explanation of the above:\nThe original question is asking what an individual desires after applying lotion. \nThe answers A (fresh smell) & B (good credit) seem to relate better to that context than the other answer choices. \nIf an individual was applying lotion to deal with discomfort", "answer": "C: smooth skin"}

{"text": "Answer B\n\nRationales:1. \"Canned goods\" are items that have been preserved with heat and cooked afterward, e.g., spaghetti sauce in a tomato can, canned pineapple, etc. \n2. Most canning is typically done within the kitchen and the canned goods are most likely kept where there are many other kitchen items such as cabinets, shelf, etc. \n3. However, the question does not indicate any details of the location where the canned goods are usually kept, and \"small door\" seems to be an unnecessary detail or limiting the options. \n4. The answer choices B & C both refer to larger locations than a small door. \n5. \"Pantry\" (C) is incorrect. Though there is typically a pantry within the kitchen, it's quite large and would not be considered \"small.\"\n6. \"Kitchen\" (D) is irrelevant to the context of the question because they do not refer to any specific features in kitchen such as cupboards, pantries, etc.\n7. \"Shelf\"(E) seems similar in nature to \"pantry\" because they are both large storage containers that can keep canned goods.

You should therefore provide an answer that fits that template and is in the same tense.\n\n### Further Explanations:\n\n#### Option A: Copy:\nWe would need to write this as 'Copy'. Copy is what we do, not what we are, hence why it is incorrect.\n### Option B: Intelligent:\nWe can't say, 'I **intelligent** hard concepts' because what is being described here is a quality, not an action. Hard concepts can't be learned or improved; one has to learn to get smarter. We would say, 'I **am intelligent**'. When using an answer from A, you need to make sure that it fits the template given or is in the same tenses as the option.\n### Option C: Improved performance:\n\nWhen people improve their performance, they perform something well, not what they are. They can't improve their performance at being intelligent. We would say, *'I **am improved**'.\n\n### Option D: Empower:\nEmpower means making someone, something, or, more generally, making one capable of achieving something or having something. \nSo for something to be 'empowering', you need to empower me.

This implies that we must consider what things they can use to explore space. We can then filter out choices that people cannot use to explore space.\n\n- A roadblock - not the intended use\n- a hoverboard - a toy\n- supermarket - a store that you can visit and buy items from that you can take with you to the planet that you want to explore.\n- a space shuttle - a craft that is used to launch rockets into space.

So, we can choose options A and B: beach (to catch sand-fairies) and church (pupils of magic), but the question specified \"after it had rained\", which means these options are out.\n4. We can reject option D because it's a cemetery (and therefore not a place where a witch would be found in general).\n5. We are left with options C and E.\n6.

Choices:  G: wood A: car B: stone C: concrete D: cement E: asphalt \n\n### Demostration:\nResponse: A waterproofing material must be found in an area where wetness or moisture is to be prevented. So we need to find an area that contains water or that is susceptible to water. As we look at the different answer choices, consider the material itself. The material is described as waterproof. So it must be an area that is able to stay dry, keeping water out or away from the material.\n\nLooking at the material, waterproofing is a substance that prevents water from entering the material. If the material is on an area that will remain wet or contain moisture, it will not be waterproof. So, it makes better sense to find the area it is used in.\n\nWood, stones, and asphalt are not areas where wetness is likely to be found. So, it is not logical that you would find waterproofing materials on any of these surfaces.\n\nCement is a substance that is used in the construction of buildings and is likely an area that has material that might contain waterproofing or might be wet. So, cement might have waterproofing material for use in other types of construction around the structure.\n\nConcrete, while a construction material for buildings, is similar to cement in that it is used for construction materials such as flooring and sidewalks. It could potentially contain waterproofing materials as it is an area susceptible to water, and waterproofing is a product that must be used.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: concrete.\n\n\n#### Response: The answers can be arranged from A, B, C, or D, which form an acrostic.\n\n<div style=\"padding:5px\">\nA = Where can a person find someone who is a person?\n\nB = Where can a person go to find an empty shoe?\n\nC = Where can", "answer": "E: jump"}

Choice D requires a decision  to be made, but the question does make it clear Allison was going and Sam was going against it.\n\nThus, choice option C: combined or Joe being on both sides sounds better.  Choice C suggests Joe was on both sides of the decision, for and against which is unlikely, since they would then be in both disagreement or support of the decision.\n\nIt is best to choose B: combined because Choice choice of A and C is incorrect.\n\nIncorrect Answers and Reasons:\n\n     A: being for\nA: combined\n\nReason: The questions indicates that Allison\u2019s decision is to go on a cruise that she is planning and Sam was not in agreement with her in that decision. But, being for is related to being in favor of a decision. Similarly, being against means to not be in favor of a decision, so being for and against cannot be correctly combined as one might say for against a decision.\n\n      A: away from\n      B: away from\n      C: conjunction\n      D: combined\n      E: combined\n\nReasons: Away from is related to a non-agreement with a particular decision, as opposed to being against which means not being in favor of a particular decision. Therefore, way from is not the meaning of combined. In addition, conjunction is used to join words and sentences together. So conjunction is no applicable here.

Effects of stress are many, including but not limited to hair loss, depression, and more. \n3. Grieving is most commonly associated with death, and in fact, grief can cause heart attacks, so this is a possible correct answer to the question.\n4. Heart attacks are among the more serious and deadly effects of stress. Hair loss and a headache, on the other hand, are not deadly unless the person is already sick and dying, thus eliminating them from further consideration.\n5. Depression is a serious mental illness, but it is not exclusive to stress, thus it is not the correct answer to the question (it is eliminated from further consideration).\n6.

The correct answer will be selected based on the girl's subsequent action in relation to the action of the dog. \n3. We are not told precisely why the girl is ignoring the dog so it is possible that she is ignoring it because it licks (i.e. continues to) or ignoring it because it is only doing it at the moment. \n4. If the girl is ignoring it because she is disgusted or does not want it to lick her, then grabbing the dog would not be a likely option, because this would not indicate that the girl is ignoring.\n5. On the other hand, this could indicate that the girl is only ignoring it at that moment but will ignore and grabbed the dog if it continues to do so.\n6.

Pineapple is a fruit grown in India, so the answer would be either B: banana A: papaya or D: apple.\n4. The question says 'India', rather than specifically 'Indian.'

However, we do not want an example that contains an incorrect statement.\n3. Considering all of the examples, the most likely choice that contains a correct premise is C.\n4. Choice B. \"Being in the hot afternoon...\" - This is not likely, as no mention of any hot afternoon is made before choosing a C-shaped path to try to become a ball.\n5. Choice D. \"Getting thinner made me bend...\" - This is not what makes him bend, rather, it is the act of bending himself that makes him bend.\n6. Choice E. \"Getting thicker made me bend...\" is not likely as neither a hot sun nor getting thicker are relevant before trying to get into a C-shaped ball position.\n7.

{"text": "Input: What isn't a safe way to transport the jewelry on one's vacation is specified.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The key point is that there are two twos, which means that two, and just two, are not safe. \n2. It's important to note that the number of twos here represents the number of answers that should be considered together. \n3. So, the first step is to eliminate all the answers that have two in them, as they can't be safe.\n4. A suitcase (A) doesn't work because it doesn't allow for maximum security while traveling and can be opened and searched.\n5. A safe deposit box, also not a safe way, is a place to store valuables for a specified period of time, rather than travel with them.\n6. A department store (C) is not an adequate way to transport jewels as it's a place where many people are present and the items are visible and can easily be stolen. However, stores can provide security measures like alarms and surveillance.\n7. A lady's boudoirs (E) are often not a safe environment for valuables as they can be easily accessed or stolen.\n8.

Let's go through all the answer choices:\n   A: \"Georgia\" wouldn't be a logical option because it's a country. It's not a specific location.\n   B: The south pole is located on the southern hemisphere and nowhere on this specific hemispheric continent of 'Georgia'.\n   C: \"Kitchen cupboard\" is a specific enough location that eliminates the remaining answer choices.\n   D: \"Italian restaurant\" isn't logical as a saucepan isn't used in food service, and a specific saucepan isn' be stored in the restaurant.\n   E: \"To boil eggs\" isn't a specific enough location to keep a special saucepan used specifically for marinara.\n3. It's important to note that \"Italian restaurant\" could be a reasonable answer to another question, involving how an ingredient might be used in an Italian restaurant or when a kitchen item might be used in an establishment that happens to serve Italian food.\n4. However, based on the context specifically and the wording of the question, we have to eliminate the possibility of this specific answer choice.\n5.

Option B demonstrates a lack of understanding of proper reasoning and following rules as a result of the difficulty of the question itself. Option D shows a lack of critical thinking and logical reasoning as it relates to understanding the context of the question and following rules and reasoning using appropriate grammar.

We could say, \"Fiddle is a word that refers to an instrument such as the violin, but this would also mean that someone does not have to have an instrument, like a piano, in order to 'listen to music'.\n\n### Hence, the answer is 'A, B, C, and E'.\n\n### Input A, B, and C, D, E: \n\n### Response A, B, D:  Play an instrument\n\n### Response C, E:  Listen to music\n\n## Explanation:\nThe first sentence says: I know I've told you this before: if you want to listen, you don't have to buy new equipment, you don't need expensive instruments, and you don't even have to sit down! So, that says that you listen to music without having to do any specific action, other than enjoying the music which means you just \"Listen\". Hence, one will only do any action if they want to play some instrument which makes only \"Play an instrument\" a valid answer. Then, comes the second sentence which reads: But here's something you might not know: even if you just want to listen to your record player, you can use a regular chair to listen, or even to dance! This would mean that \"Listen to Music\" and \"Dance\" are both actions that can be taken and are valid, other than the other words in the answer choices.\n\n### Input D, B:  Play piano\n\n### Response D, B:  Dance\n\n### Rationale:\nThe answer choices seem quite strange here because you could dance to music but not listen to music.

This is not incompatible with staying at a hotel, but we will still look at the answers that fit in the hotel context, so we can eliminate choice B: spacecraft. We can eliminate choice C: hall because the use of words like \"upgrade,\" \"higher quality property,\" \"not available,\" etc. imply that the upgrade will be to a higher quality, larger, or more expensive establishment, such as a villa, or a hotel that accommodates a larger number of guests, like a palace. Choice D: palace is a possibility, but there is no definitive information to support this answer. Choice E: hotel would be a reasonable answer if they weren't already in hotel accommodations, but we previously eliminated choice B, which indicates that they would rather stay at a villa.

There are two options that are likely, given the context of the question - they are either 'push the brake pedal' (C) or 'push the accel pedal' (E).\n\nC: Push the brake - As it often denotes stopping, if one is listening and hears what appears to be noise, i.e., an abnormal sound, when travelling, it's natural to assume they are most likely to halt or pause the journey, which would require braking. \n\nE: Push the accel - Alternatively, given that we are 'driving home', i.e., travelling to one's normal or presumed address, the natural thing to do is go the normal way, which is to accelerate.\n\nTherefore, it is most logical to answer A: 'push the brake'.\n\nAnswer: A: push the brake\n\n## Input: After they read an email, what do people usually do?

{"text": "The correct answer choice is D: \"own bathroom\".\n\n#### Rationales: The question states that his wife asked him to look in his own bathroom, not a specific location, first when he complained about missing his deodorant. Based on this information, we can safely eliminate answer choices C and E, as these do not mention the keyword \"own\".\n\n#### As for answer choice A, there are a few reasons to reject. First, it would be strange for someone to ask their spouse to go shopping when they are missing an item that could be found in their own home. Also, a trip to the grocery store would take more time than simply searching for the missing item, and it is more likely that the question writer would not use the word the question writer would want the spouse to go to someplace to search for the missing item.\n\n#### Similarly, answer choice B is unlikely because it is asking someone to search through items they have placed on their nightstand already. This is a strange request, especially given the context of the question.\n\n#### Answer choice C could be correct, but it is difficult to determine exactly where the person would be instructed to look based on the information given. Therefore, this answer is rejected.\n\n### Input When a man was caught cheating how did he not get in trouble? Choices: A: by not giving the cheating woman to his wife B: by hiding the affair C: by keeping secrets from his wife D: by not cheating E: by marrying her \n\n### Rationales:\nThe rationale behind eliminating answer choice A is based on the fact that it is not clear why the woman is given to the wife. In addition, it is not clear how or if it would bring harm to the man if he were to hand the woman over.\n\nThe rationale behind answer choice B is that it is not clear if the affair was with the person the man was married to and how that would affect how he should handle the situation from the perspective of his wife.\n\nThe rationales behind answer choices C and D both revolve around the same idea, which is that the man is not going to give his wife the secret.

The question is regarding a hierarchy of needs known in ancient greek culture and what sort of a thing it is that might refer to such a hierarchy.\n2. The answer choices are:\n3. A: government is incorrect because this is a term that is more commonly associated with a government system and not something that has to do with a hierarchy of needs. Even if it were to be interpreted as being the sort of \"government\" where people lived their lives in a particular order or sequence, this isn't the same sort of thing as a hierarchy of needs.\n4. B: a building system is also incorrect because a building system has to do with a building and not a social organization like what we're talking about.\n5. C: a way of thinking is the best answer out of the given options because the question does not explicitly ask about ancient greek culture as opposed to history in general, and \"way of thinking\" might refer to social practices more broadly.\n6. D: the idea of equality is incorrect because the wording doesn't suggest anything other than the idea of a specific hierarchy.\n7. E: a social hierarchy is incorrect because a social hierarchy has to do with a social class order as opposed to what the question is talking about, which is describing a hierachy of needs.\n8.

{"text": "A: sea world\n\n### Rationale: 1. The card players sat \"emotionless\" (the implication is that they had no facial expressions).\n2. When referring to a \"game\", \"card player\" or \"sitting at a card table\" the game usually suggests a \"card game\" such as \"solitaire\" (a card game played alone) or \"poker\" (a card game traditionally played with more than 1 person).\n3. Furthermore in the following phrase \"swim through shallow waters,\" the word \"shallow waters\" refers to an environment which a shark could be expected to swim through.\n4. The \"shallow waters\" environment seems to contrast to the deeper ocean waters where a card game like \"poker\" would be taking place.\n5. A court \"room\", on the other hand, is a special area designated for legal proceedings in the judicial system.\n6. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Sea World as the word \"world\" indicates it refers to a location to visit where sharks are found.\n\n### Input- \"Pardon the interruption, but there's no such thing as a free gift.\"\n\n### Rationales: 1.) A \"free gift\" generally is seen as a gift that you did not pay for, which in this case, does not exist (free of charge).\n2.) The word \"interruption\" shows that the man was talking to someone else, possibly a co-worker, so the second part of the phrase is more likely to be used in an office setting (as opposed to a casual setting, like at home).\n3.) \"No such thing\" implies that whatever the man is trying to give is false (or untrue), when in fact, \"there is such a thing,\" i.e., a free gift.\n4.) Thus, the statement \"No such thing as a free lunch\" is false as there is such a thing as a free luch (e.g., a free food sample in a grocery store or a free gift on a birthday party).\n\nAdaptive Interpretation:  A similar phrase \"there's no such thing...\" can be used in a different setting where a \"free lunch\" may actually exist, i.e., in a company cafeteria and/or at a birthday party", "answer": "D: poker game"}

{"text": "Answer: The correct response is 'D: awesome'.\n1. The phrase 'overhead' indicates that superman flew a little bit higher than eye level, which is consistent with the children exclaiming 'awesome' in response to this phenomenon they witnessed which they probably haven't seen before.\n2. The answer 'B: skip' can't be the answer because it doesn't include an exclamation of an emotion/feeling (a joyful exclamation). Also, they can't'skip class' by seeing superman unless it's a class recess or the children miss school that day in general.\n3. The answer 'E: watch television' may be tempting, but since they are probably running outside, 'watch television' doesn't make sense unless they were waiting back at home to watch it.

The last part of the sentence refers to a homeless person who had been left by police to fend for himself or herself \n2. Only the homeless person is left struggling to survive in this situation. However, a 'kindhearted teacher' didn't leave the homeless person alone, as evidenced by the fact that there is a homeless person left, struggling to survive.\n3. A 'policeman' isn't left struggling to survive as they don't even need to survive in the first place as they are well provided for and do not have to worry about living on the streets. The 'policeman' could be a different one from the one who left the homeless person.\n4.

Therefore, the puppy would not likely have done X: welcomed. He may have done something like K: died but that would not have been welcomed.

Classrooms - Classrooms in school are places to sit and learn, so not a place to hang out necessarily. \n5. \"Outside\" (C) implies that it might be in or around the school, so the answer is C: outside.\n6.

Let's consider a variety of possible settings:\n3. School - School isn't an appropriate answer as a group of teenage school children isn't typical of a crowd the question is describing, and it's an indoor setting, not an outdoor one.\n4. Sporting event - While it's possible a group of teenagrs from a school will attend a sporting event in a massive crowd, there are lots of other venues besides a school to attend sporting events.\n5.

To figure out what a bunch of fish are collectively doing that they can possibly have in common with humans, we need to eliminate the impossible and the improbable.\n3. Option B, \"pets\", is clearly impossible for fish because they do not belong to the human world and it's not logical to keep fish as pets. \n4. Option C, \"fills the pond\", is out of the realm of possibilities, since fish don't do their schooling in a pond; this is merely a description of fish in the water.\n5.

{"text": "> A: Building\n> \nInput: In an orchestra, where would you typically find the conductor? Choices: \tA: on a piano B: on the drums C: with the band D: in front of the audience E: in the balcony\nRationales:1. The question is where you would typically find the conductor. When considering the conductor's position relative to the instruments in the orchestra, it is easy to eliminate some options.\n2. An orchestra is comprised of many instruments, so A: on a piano; B: on the drums; and C: with the band\u2014all include a position in which the conductor might sit, so they are ruled out.\n3. Similarly, D: in front of audience because the conductor is in the front of the orchestra is not a helpful answer.\n4. Therefore, the likely response is E: in the balCONEY because the conductor is traditionally situated in an elevated position, above the orchestra.\nAnswer: E In the balcony\n\nInput: On a football field, where could you find the quarterback?

By definition, the quarterback is:\n\n>the leader of the offense, usually the team captain. He is responsible for putting the team in a favorable position after the ball is snapped from the center. Often the quarterback acts as the signal-caller for the offense and decides when to hand off and when to throw.

The question asks us about what people consider the first step of their job process. There are several possible steps in the job journey including Applying for the job, researching for information, looking for job openings, filling applications, and interviewing with the hiring managers.\n\nCandidate Options A, B, and E represent incorrect responses and are not in accordance with what the question is asking.

{"text": "### Demonstraion:\nInput: Annoying little pests - Choices:  A. house centipedes B. carpenter ants C. ladybugs D. aphids E. fruit flies\nRationales: Let's get into it!\n1. House centipedes, carpenter ants, and ladybugs each have something to do with pests and being annoying.\n\n2. Looking at each choice, ladybugs (E) have the most direct relation to pests. However, they are considered helpful insects and are not generally seen as annoying in the same way as house centipedes or carpenter ants. This is why I'm eliminating it.\n\n3. House centipedes (A) and carpenter ants (B) each have some relation to being pests, but the term \"house centipede\" refers to an insect that can be extremely aggressive. If they are seen at home, it's not a pleasant experience, but they are not normally known for being annoying. Although I can get behind calling termites annoying, I will eliminate the \"carpenter ant\" answer choice as well because I don't feel like it is enough evidence to eliminate the \"house centipede.\"\n\n4. And then we have Aphids (D), known commonly known as \"greenflies\" or simply, \"flies.\" They usually have a direct relation to annoying pests because they are small and they sting and leave little wounds on plants.

Choices: A: a long sleep that lasts hours B: any sleep C: a sleep during which a person is not awake D: a sleep of a few minutes E: a sleep taken in a chair\n\nRationales:\nInput A: A: \"a long sleep that lasts for hours.\" --  When we're describing taking a nap, we're describing something of relatively small length. So the definition doesn't quite seem like what we expect to see here.\n\nB: B: \" Any Sleep\" --  By saying \"any sleep\", the question isn't focusing on the details, but the overall meaning. The word nap is being compared to other types of sleep, so \"any sleep\" is not the way to describe the word \"nap.\"\n\nC: C: \"a sleep during which a person isn't awake.\" --  'Napping' is an action, but here, the word 'nap' is being used to compare itself to another action/event. A nap is a sleep that someone can take, so the answer has to be 'a sleep taken.'\n\nD: D: \"a sleep taken in a chair\" --  If somebody was to fall asleep sitting on a chair, that would probably amount to a nap. But again, the question doesn't tell us that the nap is actually sitting down during it.\n\nE: E: \" a nap taken\" --  This answer choice is correct because the word 'nap' (the one in question) refers to something that is taken. So we need to eliminate other definitions that do not fit that structure.\n\nAnswer:\n\nRationales\nA: No, 'any sleep' is not included within the definition of the word nap.\n\nC: Yes, we need to eliminate 'Any sleep' because it doesn't fit the structure and definition.\n\nD: No, a nap isn't sitting in a chair (usually.\n\nE: Yes, we need eliminate all other choices, thus leaving us with 'A nap taken'\n\nAnswer: A nap taken\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "E: fabric store"}

You look at the card placed on top and you flip over the bottom card. If you then look at the bottom card, you will be able to tell whether the card placed on top is a red or black card. How can this be?\nHint: Think about it for a minute before you start.\n\nAnswer: Flip the cards so that the card of one type is on top, and the different type is on the bottom: it's easy to see then whether the card on top is an Ace or not.\n\n### Title : How do I change the card back to its original position?\nQuestion: We place three cards face down in a row. We then look at cards on top and at the bottom card and then turn face down the card which is on top. Finally we look at the bottom card. If we then turn over each card in turn, what would one next do to place the cards in the original position?\n\nThis looks like a trick question, and there is a catch. If the cards are placed so that the top card is a King (for example), and the bottom one is black, then the King will always be on top if we don't look at it (so the sequence is: King, Jack, Queen, Ace, King).\n\nHowever, if the cards are placed so the top card is a Jack (for example), then the Jack will always be on top until we look at", "answer": "D: egg carton"}

When a computer is more reliable than a non-computed system\n\n### Rationales:\n  Inputs 1: One should consider getting treatment when one's blood sugar (also called glucose or sugar) levels are either higher than normal or lower than normal.\n  It should be noted that the pancreas releases insulin in response to eating food. Insulin works to break down the glucose in the bloodstream so that glucose can be sent to the body's cells to sustain their functions, and if this does not happen, a person's blood sugar levels will start to rise.\n  There is no need to take medicine when one's blood glucose (or sugar) levels are within normal limits as it could result in hypoglycemia, which can be a serious health condition.\n  Thus, the most appropriate and correct option to choose is \"when the body has higher or  lower sugar than the usual level.\"\n  Inputs 2: A computer system is able to process data at a much greater speed and efficiency than a non-computable system.

Choices:  N/A  A: airport B: beach C: casino D: hotel E: lounge<n>Output: A: airport<n><n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>This solution used regex to split and extract values from the string.<n><n>* The regex used to check if the given number string is a decimal or not is `[.\d]` This is because this string will begin with a period or dot which will be our check character for the decimal variable.<n>* Then the regex `[,\d]` is used to check if the string also ends with a comma or not.<n>* Finally we take the substring from the variable i.e. if it is the first input, the substring is 42, from variable 1.<n>* For the next input, 03761002 - the substring is `03761` for first input, the substring we take is `1002`.<n>* The same process is performed for the remaining two inputs to get the substring value which is `4525` - `0.24` and `7775` - `7.77`.<n>* Finally, this substring value is printed using `print()`.<n><n>* First we need to split the string using `\W` to prevent the substrings we take to contain alphabets.<n>* Then regex `.` splits the strings based on `.` which are digits, this means the whole value of the substrings will be of only number and there will be no alphabets which may cause the program to fail.<n>* And regex `[,\d]` will not split the string if it contains  comma or dot (`.`) at the end of the substring.<n>* This means all the substring starting from the beginning ends with `.` only if no comma is there, only then the substring will be created.<n>* Finally, we take the substring from all the substring of all the inputs using the given index number.

They checked his friends' houses, and asked their parents where he might be. After searching their entire neighborhood, the police continued to their home town, where they knew the family was staying for a few days. When searching the town, there were a few places the police thought the child might be. They searched houses and businesses, because they remembered from a previous robbery how important the child's wallet, credit cards, and driver's license all were to this particular criminal. When searching a restaurant, the police asked if anyone had seen the child and checked to make sure nothing was left in the child's favorite table. Because the child's cell phone had been stolen, the police asked everyone they met to look out for it. One of the police officers remembered, however, that the child's cellular phone was located in a different state. When the police found the child's favorite park, they checked to see if he was playing. While checking the park, the police checked under all of the park's benches, under the slides, on the swings, and even on the lighthouse. Because an animal shelter had taken in the child's dog, the police checked these animals first, to see if they had a clue of the child's whereabouts. The search was quite thorough, and no one had seen the child.<n><n>Input: "I haven't seen him", said the man. Choices:  A. It's OK! You will.<n>Output: A.

Explain what is the different between the way the author answered this question and the way you answered this question.<n><n><n>A. Question 2 had a sentence that said, “Where is a large water pump located?” and the author answers with the right answer, F: sewage water plant however the way that my friend and I answered this sentence is A: aquarium which I think the aquarium part is just a hint that is why we answered that answer choice. However, the other answer choices is not a hint and not a part of the sentence which I think the author should add the other answer choices in his answer (which is actually in the sentence). Because, when we was trying to figure out on how to answer this question, we had to think of where is a large water pmp located? is not in a lake? is not in an ocean? is not in a river? is not in a bathtub? We actually had to think and figure our way around which is not a good thing if you have to look for the answer choices because it would distracts us which make the author to not add the other answer choices. Or maybe if you know the answer then try to figure out these answer choices and look at it or maybe if you do not know the answer, then you just have to figure it out on how the author answers this question which was not a good way to answer the question from my experience.<n><n><n>Q2.

The first example is an example for Question 3, the question is “Where was expensive knowledge being gained? A. University.” The correct answer for this question is University, however, the author’s answer for this question is book, I did not know the authors answer (book) was correct so I just thought that the authors answer was wrong because I thought that it should be university because in my head I was like book knowledge does not sound that impressive or well-known as a knowledge

Often, these documents describe the same topic from different<n>angles. One document might be a how-to guide for a command line tool, while another<n>document explains how the same idea could be accomplished in an application. This leads<n>to duplicated effort on the instructor's part, multiple confusing documents for<n>students to digest, and an inconsistant experience for students.<n><n>#### Solutions<n><n>One solution could be for the instructor to write a single document that describes all of the<n>commands for the command line tool and all of the concepts behind the application. A <n>second possibility could be for the student to write software to aggregate and compare<n>all of the documents so that s/he can choose the document that best fits the student's<n>needs. The downside of this solution is that aggregation software would be difficult for <n>the instructor to maintain.<n><n>When you encounter a duplicate piece of information it can be hard to know what is the right information to follow and consume.

They checked his friends' houses, and asked their parents where he might be. After searching their entire neighborhood, the police continued to their home town, where they knew the family was staying for a few days. When searching the town, there were a few places the police thought the child might be. They searched houses and businesses, because they remembered from a previous robbery how important the child's wallet, credit cards, and driver's license all were to this particular criminal. When searching a restaurant, the police asked if anyone had seen the child and checked to make sure nothing was left in the child's favorite table. Because the child's cell phone had been stolen, the police asked everyone they met to look out for it. One of the police officers remembered, however, that the child's cellular phone was located in a different state. When the police found the child's favorite park, they checked to see if he was playing. While checking the park, the police checked under all of the park's benches, under the slides, on the swings, and even on the lighthouse. Because an animal shelter had taken in the child's dog, the police checked these animals first, to see if they had a clue of the child's whereabouts. The search was quite thorough, and no one had seen the child.\n\nInput: \"I haven't seen him\", said the man. Choices:  A. It's OK! You will.\nOutput: A.

Question 2 had a sentence that said, \u201cWhere is a large water pump located?\u201d and the author answers with the right answer, F: sewage water plant however the way that my friend and I answered this sentence is A: aquarium which I think the aquarium part is just a hint that is why we answered that answer choice. However, the other answer choices is not a hint and not a part of the sentence which I think the author should add the other answer choices in his answer (which is actually in the sentence). Because, when we was trying to figure out on how to answer this question, we had to think of where is a large water pmp located? is not in a lake? is not in an ocean? is not in a river? is not in a bathtub? We actually had to think and figure our way around which is not a good thing if you have to look for the answer choices because it would distracts us which make the author to not add the other answer choices. Or maybe if you know the answer then try to figure out these answer choices and look at it or maybe if you do not know the answer, then you just have to figure it out on how the author answers this question which was not a good way to answer the question from my experience.\n\n\nQ2. Please explain what is wrong (if there are any) with the author's answers with respect to your answers for Question 3.\n\nA. The first example is an example for Question 3, the question is \u201cWhere was expensive knowledge being gained? A. University.\u201d The correct answer for this question is University, however, the author\u2019s answer for this question is book, I did not know the authors answer (book) was correct so I just thought that the authors answer was wrong because I thought that it should be university because in my head I was like book knowledge does not sound that impressive or well-known as a knowledge", "answer": "D: electric refrigerator"}

In questions like, **Q1**: The what word is correct to apply in these cases?\nIt is clearly given in the explanation, when the same word has two different meanings we have to find which one is used for each individual case. \n**Q2**: We have to know the meaning of the given sentence. We find that the sentence is : Where might a television likely to use at night?\nWe find that the last word 'e' has two different meanings, so it is wrong.

If we find grapes in the store then it only means that the food is in the grocery store.  If we find grapeseed oil, it means that we are extracting oil from the fruits rather than eating the fruits.

Often, these documents describe the same topic from different\nangles. One document might be a how-to guide for a command line tool, while another\ndocument explains how the same idea could be accomplished in an application. This leads\nto duplicated effort on the instructor's part, multiple confusing documents for\nstudents to digest, and an inconsistant experience for students.\n\n#### Solutions\n\nOne solution could be for the instructor to write a single document that describes all of the\ncommands for the command line tool and all of the concepts behind the application. A \nsecond possibility could be for the student to write software to aggregate and compare\nall of the documents so that s/he can choose the document that best fits the student's\nneeds. The downside of this solution is that aggregation software would be difficult for \nthe instructor to maintain.\n\nWhen you encounter a duplicate piece of information it can be hard to know what is the right information to follow and consume. With the internet, most consumers are subjected to \"spaghetti\" information where the web is full of duplicates, and hard to navigate.\n\n## Ideas\n\n### Create a web site\n\n#### Instructions\nImplement a site, that allows users to submit problems that can be answered by the rest of the users on the system. The purpose of this site is to allow people to share information and collaborate on solving problems. A good example is Stack Overflow. \n\n- Users can create an account and answer questions that others have posted.\n- Users can answer questions posted by others if they feel they know the answer.\n- Users can upvote and downvote answers or questions to help make the site useful and relevant.\n\n- How to create a new site?\n- How to post a question?\n- How to respond to a question?\n- What is a bad question?\n- How do I search for questions?\n- How do you filter questions by tags or authors?\n\n#### Instrucions\n\nImplement a web site that provides answers for homework related problems to people.", "answer": "A: modern house"}

Choices: \tA: CAT  B: RABBIT C:DOG\tD:BAT   E:MOUSE\nOutput: \n\n### Solution\nIt's a fun problem. You have to use recursion to solve it and the idea is to call the function from within the function. So first I am `A`, then I am `D` which refers back to `A`, which refers back to `D`... like a chain. But to break the recursion you need to pass the value for recursion to `A`\n\nThis is how the code looks like:\n\n```python\nfrom utils import myFun\ndef myFun():\n    a = 'CAT'\n    def aFunction(word):\n        word = 'RABIT'\n        def inner(word):\n            word = 'DOG'\n            def innerinner(word):\n                word = 'BAT'\n                def innerdeep(word):\n                    word = 'MOUSE'\n                    return word\n            return innerinner\n        return inner\n    return aFunction(a)\n```\n\nFor more information about recursion: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b-GK5H8uNM](https://www.youtube/watch?v=04b-GK-5H8NM)\n\n\n### Instructions:\nAnswer the following problem.\n\nInput : I am a word problem which contatins one word.

If an unknown command or argument is provided, the first argument that is not an unknown command or argument should be returned. Otherwise, return the full input string.\n\n\n\n### Question 1\n\n### Answer\n\n\n### Explanation\n> In this question we got: 1. It was breakfast time. 2. Brad ordered eggs, toaster, and something to drink  \n\nSo, the program should return the first argument that is NOT: 2.  Brad ordered eggs  \nAnd the answer should be: 1. It is breakfast time  \n\n### Solution\n\n#### C++ : O(n) time \n```python\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n#include <map>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nmap<string, string> args;\nmap<string, int> knownCommands;\nmap < string, int> unknownCommands;\n\nint main() {\n    string input;\n    cin >> input;\n    char prevChar = 0;\n\n    while(input.length() > 0) {\n        if(input.compare(0, 1, \" \")) {\n            if(!prevChar) {\n                continue;\n            }\n            else {\n                input = input.substr(1) ;\n                input.erase(0, 1);\n                if(input[input.length() - 1] == \" \"){\n                    int returnInput = input.length() - 2;\n                }\n                else {\n                    int returninput = input.length()-1;\n                }\n\n                if(returninput > 1 &&!knownCommands.count(input.substr(0, returninput))) {\n                    if(prevChar >= 0x33 && prevChar <= 0x64){\n                        knownCommands[prevChar]++;\n                    }\n                    else {\n                        unknownCommands.count(prevChar)++;\n                    } \n\n                    return input;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        else if (prevChar =='') {\n            if(!input[0]) {\n                input = \"\";\n                continue", "answer": "A: coffee"}

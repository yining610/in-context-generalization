Considering the context around the question, the feelings expressed are likely to be related to the stress and frustration of having all the work in the relationship on her, as opposed to being joyful and happy about it.\n3.. So we have to look out for feelings which are negative, or ones which are related to unpleasant situations.\n4.. The feelings listed in the options are anguish, bitterness, tears or sadness.\n5.. 'Anguish' and 'bitterness' are feelings which are negative or unhappy in nature.\n6..

The given price is 259000.\n2. From looking at the prices and eliminating the numbers that are higher than the given price, the only possible answer is option D because there is no other option that costs this price or less than that.\n3.

The remaining choices are: eastern, arizona, good repair, and arizona. \n5. These describe geographical locations, conditions of roads, or road constructions. \n6. None of these seems to apply to the question, as the question is about the location of the tollbooth on a particular highway.\n7.

Choices: 1. A: by the way they reflect B: by the way they scatter C: by the way they shine D: by the way they transmit E: by the way they absorb\nOutput: 1) The question is asking which 'way' things have more color.\n2) 'the way' in the statement could imply any particular way in which things are being measured in relation to color. \n3) So, the question is asking about the 'way' or measurement that the above statement describes.\n4) This implies that the statement is talking about the way color is distributed, as in, how color spreads out to different parts of an object. \n5) Among the choices: 1) by the way they reflect, and 2) by the way they scatter, we can eliminate  by the way they reflect  as this refers to how color is absorbed and not scattered. \n6) By analyzing the remaining choice: by the way they  scatter,  we can know that color does not necessarily  spread out  or travel. It can also be concentrated in one particular  direction  or even be a point distribution. \n7) Thus, the answer B: by the way things have more color  by scattering can therefore be interpreted as an object having higher concentration of color or being brighter than another.

{"text": "1.'Housework for hours' implies a prolonged period of time, indicating that the activity took a lengthy amount of time to complete. \n2. Anger would not be an expected reaction as the result of something that was done for a long period of time, such as housework.\n3. It is more likely that boredom or stress would be the result, depending on the individual and the nature of the tasks being completed.\n4. The question's context suggests that feelings of anger or boredom are not warranted in comparison to the time spent completing the tasks.\n5. Therefore. the answer must be between D: boredom and E: anxiety, where 'D' is closest in meaning to both.\n6.

B: He has a new and better job. \tC: He must be making a lot more than I am.D: He has moved away from the city.E: He has a stable job and good income.\nOutput: 1: 'Former best friend' suggests that we are referring to a friendship that has ended or no longer exists.\n2. The usage of the word'surprised' implies that the situation is not as expected or expected of someone in particular.\n3. The context suggests that the friend is still in the city, which leads us to exclude choices A, B, and C, which imply the opposite.\n4. Only 'E' correctly describes the situation of the friend'making a lot.'\n5. 'E' is the best description of what is probably the case based on the context.\n6. Therefore, the answer must be 'E: he has a stable job and a good income.'. \n7. In this context,'stable job' translates to a high probability of staying job-oriented in the future. While 'high income' can be taken in multiple meanings, it can also indicate good and stable income.", "answer": "C: stress"}
{"text": "1.'You can hear testimony about how spirituality changes lives' suggests that this person is asking another for their opinions on the subject.\n\n2. Among the choices the only one that makes sense is testimony. \n3. Testimony is a form of communication where a person gives their views or feelings on a certain topic.\n4. Furthermore, the word 'change' suggests the testimony is about how spirituality has changed someone's life positively.\n5.

The sentence implies that all the steps were laid out in a procedure, however, when the list was compiled there must have been steps where something could go wrong.\n4. Something must be missing or gone wrong in the procedure to have reached the problem.\n5. The choices B and D mean the procedure was wrong or missing but don't suggest that it was incomplete as does C.\n6.

{"text": "1 This question asks about \"some pretty food\" that was brought to the planned get-together.\n2. We know from the context that the question is about the big game, and this is the event that all invited people were there for. So, this has to be a get-together for the game.\n3. We can choose between option C (a table) and option D (\"a space shuttle\"). Both of these choices mention different spaces but aren't directly related to a large group of invited people like the get-together for a big game.\n4. The question specifically mentions that the food was pretty.\n5. This can only be food that's attractive and pleasing to look at, which could be food on a platter. However, the sentence doesn't mention anything about the food being served in a platter.\n6. Thus, we can rule out option D: a space shuttle. \n\n7. Option C: table has the same problem\n8. Hence, the only available choice that fits the requirements is 'B: friend's house' since food in friend's house is often served on a table.\nSo the finals answer is B: friend's home\n\nInput: \"He's one of those who makes people like what? Choices: A: hate B: envy C: ignore D: love him E: want to be like him\nOutput:1.\"He's one of people who makes people like him\" - this sentence contains a grammatical error.\n2. In the given sentence, the pronoun \"him\" fails to agree with the subject \"he's.\"\n3. To correct this error, we can remove \"him\" and rephrase the sentence.\n4. \"He's one who makes people like him.\"\n5. This makes the pronoun's reference clear and its agreement correct.\n6. The words \"him\" in both choices are referring to the same person, making the sentences ambiguous.\n7. So the sentence means \"He is one who makes people like\" and does not make sense.\n8. That is why we eliminate both \"A: hate him\" and \"B: envy him.\"\n9. 'C: ignore him' could be a choice, but the sentence is missing a complete subject: verb after \"ignore him.\"\n10.

Choices: 1: anxiety 2: confusion 3: bored 4: disgust 5: indifference 6: no problem\nOutput: 1: The question is talking about how you may feel with your clothing.\n2: Looking at the choices, 'confusion' suggests that the feelings are related to not knowing how the items should stay in your wardrobe. \n3: 'Disgust' describes feelings related to a lack of acceptability of something.\n4: 'Indifference' describes a situation where you don't care how things go.\n5: 'Anxiety' describes an unpleasant state of mind concerning the future.\n6: It does not make sense to say 'no problem' since the sentence before this question uses 'feeling'.\n7: Therefore, the best choice that suits the context of the question is 'anxiety'. \n8: So the answer is A: anxiety.\nSo the final choice is A: anxiety\n\nInput: The only way to see what you're looking at is if what?

{"text": "1. Committing perjury is the act of willfully lying under oath in a legal setting, with the implied consequence of facing severe punishment.\n2. The option that best describes the result of lying under oath is \"go to jail.\" \n3. However, there are two options \"committing perjury\" and \"go to jail\" that both refer to the act of committing perjury.\n4. To distinguish between these two options, it is helpful to consider the context of committing perjuries and the consequences that may result from it.\n5. While it may seem that committing a crime or \"going to jail\" are interchangeable phrases, the former implies the act of committing a crime itself, while the latter describes the consequences of a crime, specifically imprisonment.\n\n6. Hence, \"go to jail,\" in this case, refers to the punishment or consequence that results from committing a crime rather than the act of committing the crime itself.\n\n7. So, option \"go to jail \" refers to the consequence of committing perjurious while \"commit perjury\" refers to the act or crime itself.\n\n8. Hence, the correct answer is \"commit perjury.\"\n9. So, the final answer is D. commit perjury.\nSo the final answe is D: commit perjury\n\nInput: Who is the worlds oldest person to climb Mount Everest?

Among the choices, the only ones that meet this criterion are options B (with the 79 year old) and D (the 80 year old).\n3. \"a Swiss climber\" is redundant, as the question already mentions \"Swiss climber.\" \n4. Therefore, the options that can be narrowed down further are between \"a 79 year old\" and \"a 80 year old.\"\n5. As the climber reached the summit of Mount Everest at the age of 80,", "answer": "B: arrest"}

Given these points, there is little reason to expect that any child might not want to go play.\n4. The question suggests an activity before going to play with the focus on the child rather than the adult.\n5. Among the choices, options C and D do not seem to fit the context. Option E seems like a reasonable guess, but it still feels vague and doesn't directly relate to the activity before playing.\n6. Option B is the most specific in context and is also the most general in that it implies any form of stimulation, laughter included, is a reasonable activity.\n7. It stands to reason that before playing, children would want to be stimulated and have fun.\n8.

The man thought it was the fireman that should turn on the tap.\nOutput: 1.) Since the sentence said the firefighter was turning on the tap, the man should think that it was a firefighter turning on the tap. 2.) Although it was written the way it was written for a purpose, it's possible that the man said the firefighters name out loud if he recognized him, the fireman could have heard it and decided to use it. 3.) The man should have thought that the water should have been on to put out the fire. 4.) The firefighters job is to save people and objects. He needs to save the water to make sure the fire is put out.\nSo the final answe = firefighter\n\nInput:  If I were to say that 'it is important' what would be the best way to complete the sentence?

{"text": "The question asks about the emotion that getting paid can lead to. \n1. Getting paid is a positive development and getting paid is known to make a person happy.\n2. Thus, 'A: sorrow', which is a feeling of regret over loss, is an incorrect choice.\n3. Also, getting paid can mean having the money to pay bills, and feeling happy due to this development is also an option.\n4. This makes choice 'C: happiness' a more plausible option than option 'B: paying bills'.\n5. Although getting paid can have a positive impact on bills, the question suggests that there is an emotional impact that can be gained too.\n6. This means that the person's emotion can rise based not just on clearing the bills, but on receiving payment as well. So the answer is 'A: happiness'.\nSo the final answer the answer is B: happiness\n\nInput: Who might you see doing a handstand?

{"text": "1: The options suggest that the person was looking for a particular kind of home.\n2. The context is that the person sought a certain type of home or house.\n3. They moved out of the city.\n4. Thus, we can infer that a city home wasn't suitable for them.\n5. This implies that they looked for a rural or suburban home, which is a likely choice.\n6. However, it's unclear whether they sought for a small, large, or medium-sized home.\n7. Looking at the choices, 'Big House' is an option for a large home, but could also mean an old house, which may not have been suitable for the couple.\n8. Option 'Large House' could refer either to the fact that they left the city or to the size of the house. If the person meant that their new home was huge and they were seeking a large house, this would be inaccurate as option A is just a master bedroom.\n9. Another possibility is that they wanted to keep personal items with them, which could be interpreted as the choice for option E. However, this is unclear.\n10.

Legal firms deal with contracts all the time, that reduces the amount of paperwork during loan applications too. This can be eliminated as we do not need to hire any legal firm for this purpose. \n4.) Increasing the fees increases paperwork during loan applications. This is eliminated. \n5.) Asking for more money is similar to an increase in fees, which only increases the paperwork instead of reducing. Hence, these choices are eliminated too. \n\n6.) Eliminating those choices that increase paperwork leads us to choice E. Hence, the correct answer is E: increase the", "answer": "E: learning about"}
{"text": "1- The given context of a dead patient can be understood as a possibility of feeling changes at various levels of physical being.\n2. For a dead patient with obvious signs of injury, the change of color is least likely to be a manifestation of dying.\n3. With symptoms of dying, breathing has a significant impact on the patient's current capacity to live.\n4. With obvious changes in physical being, sleeping longer or getting dead are also possibilities. However, the context suggests that the patient is already dead.\n5. The statement suggests feeling \"as though she was in a place with more gravity than ours\". This may be related to the idea of getting dead.\n6. Thus, the change of color in the given context has a more significant probability of being an indication of changes related to dying.\n7.

The possible outcome when a person feels the need to tell someone unsolicited what to do could be annoyed.\n3. This is also an option but it is not as probable as it seems since the sentence specifically emphasizes on \"things\".\n4. A possible outcome of rejecting others' efforts to help someone, would be annoy others.\n5. This outcome is also highly probable as it would indeed result in \"something\" and \"someone\" feeling annoyed.\n6. In addition, this response could be the result of the caring person's attempt at being nice.\n7. The context specifies that the statement is suggesting doing \"things\" rather than \"something\" so it would make more sense to think that the statement might be referring to the \"reject others' efforts to do what\" option.\n8", "answer": "B: getting cold"}

She gave the patient the aspirin because it was already being used in the patient D. She gave the patient a treatment that would have no effect on him, and the patient was harmed. E. She gave aspirins that might harm the patient\nOutput: 1: The doctor knew that by giving aspirin, she was actually harming the patient.\n2. In any case, she still gave him the aspirin.\n3. This could only mean that she did not care about the patient and was solely concerned with using the aspirin to complete a task.\n4.

However, 'C' (speak spanish) can not be correct answer because there are other ways to express it, like'speak spanish' instead of'speak spanish language'for example.\n5. Similarly, 'D' (speaking chinese) is wrong because we can use'speaking Chinese' rather than'speaking chinese language.'\n6. So, it is better to choose between further education and speak Chinese.\n7.

{"text": "1.'Russia' does not make sense in this context. \n2. Option 'A' makes sense as something that a lemur would do at home is be in its natural habitat.\n3. As home would not be a good place to find a lemur, we can eliminate the remaining options.\n4. 'Heaven' would only be the result of a lemur's passing, which wouldn't be a scenario that led to the question in the first place.\n5. 'Another country', option 'B', would make more sense if the intention was to travel around the world and find a lemur, since other countries might have lemurs that can be seen. \n6. 'Field', option 'D', could be used as a euphemism for heaven. \n7. Hence, our search is not restricted by the other countries but could also cover the field.\n8. 'A hole' (option 'C') seems like it could be both a physical location, like a hole in the ground. \n9. It could also refer to an abstract location, like a hole or an empty space. \n10.

This doesn't fit the context, as the question is asking for what somebody else calls you when they know you are sad.\n3. Options A, C, and D provide what is being called, rather than what.\n4. Considering this, we can eliminate options B and E, as they don't refer to what being sad is called.\n5. The options that remain refer to what sadness is called, as they directly mention it.\n6. Option C specifically refers to what sadness is typically called. Since people are not usually very cre", "answer": "D: field"}
{"text": "1.'Squash court' is a term in sports that refers to a court used in squash, a racket sport similar to racquetball.\n2. 'Rich person's house' is a vague option, while 'pool' and 'fitness center' would be unsuitable, as the court is for playing squash.\n3. At the end of the sentence, we find out the person waited for his friend at a country club, which seems to be similar to a 'public facility'. This implies that the person was concerned that his friend thought he was waiting at another type of public facility rather than one used for playing squash. \n4. These other facilities mentioned in context include 'rich person's house' and 'pool, which are not related to playing squash and are unlikely to be covered as a public facility.\n5. To summarize, the clue is the placement of 'rich person's' house and 'pool'.\n6. By eliminating options that make no sense, what we're left with is A: 'country club'.\n7. A country club, much like a country club golf course or a public pool, is a public facility.\n8.

This suggests that he felt humble and insignificant in the presence of this natural marvel which is beyond humanity's understanding and control.\n3. The options are unimportant, insignificant, stellar, somewhat, and helpless.\n4. 'Unimportant' and 'insignificant' mean 'irrelevant', which is inapplicable in this context.\n5. 'Stellar' means'relating to or belonging to a star'. This would suggest something related to stars, which does not reflect what the camper felt in the given context.\n6. 'Somewhat' means 'rather'. This may work with'mighty' to suggest that the camper was 'a little mighty', but this does not work with the wording of the question.\n7. Therefore, the correct choice is 'E: helpless'. \n8.

{"text": "1.'Bob and Boris were in a queue at the checkout.' As we read to the end we understand that the word queue in this sentence conveys the fact that they were standing in 'queue' or 'line'.\n2. 'They were standing in place.' From this sentence we have already understood that 'places' referred to their respective position in the line. 'Bob was standing directly behind Boris.' This sentence suggests that there is one person standing in the queue ahead of Boris and one person directly behind Boris, thus, the queue ahead of Borris must be consisted of two people.\n3. From the options mentioned below, the only word that fits these sentences and the context in the paragraph is 'delay'. We can further understand that the 'queue was fast', and the 'children in front of them were noisy'. All of which points us towards the word 'delay'.\n4. The word 'delay' is defined as any slowdown, impediment, or hindrance that causes delay in arriving or completing something. In the story 'Bob and Boris' delayed buying their groceries because the 'queue' in which they were standing was too slow and they were unable to buy what they needed.\n5. Therefore the answer must be 'delay'.\nSo the final answer E: delay\n\nInput:  You have an interesting friend who has a unique manner of speaking. You think they talk in a slow, boring manner but others think the opposite. What would you say about this friend? Choices:  is A: their best friend B: their worst enemy C: their biggest fan D: their least friend E: their number one fan\nOutput: 1: We can infer from the context that the friend's speech is either slow or boring but not both which leads us to eliminate 'A: their best friend' from the list of options.\n\n### A. Slow, B. Boring, C. Best friend, D. Biggest fan, E. Least friend, F. Number 1 fan \n2. We can infer that their speech is either slow or not boring as it is the opposite of how we describe their speech(boring->not boring). We can't think of any other scenario where the person's speech is boring but others think that their speech is slow, and hence option b(slow) only fits the context.\n3.

{"text": "1) The question refers to a child's first game in the bleacher.\n2) The context suggests that football is being discussed, and football is widely played at \"football stadium\".\n3) Pharmacy is a place to sell pharmaceutical drugs, so it is an unlikely place for a child's first football game. \n4) Laboratory may be a place where a child's football game can occur, but the question does not specify. \n5) Baseball stadium and soccer game are two kinds of sports, so it doesn't rule out those two.\n6) Baseball stadium is a place to play baseball, so if the child is excited about attending their first game in a baseball stadium, we can assume that baseball is what the child is going to the stadium to watch. \n7) Same with soccer game. If a  child is going attending their first game at soccer stadium, its most likely to be a soccer game.\n8) So the answer is option C, baseball stadium. \nSo the final answer should be C: baseball stadium\n\nInput:  The company took an extremely detailed approach to the report, even to what?

{"text": "1a. The sentence implies that people would like to explore space, but it doesn't establish that they actually would if space tourism became more affordable.\n2. The options 'roadblock' or 'hoverboard' seem too specific and not particularly practical as a method of space exploration.\n3. A space shuttle or a public place would technically allow someone to explore space, but are not implied by the sentence itself.\n4. 'Public place' suggests an alternative to space travel.\n5. However, this is unlikely to be possible due to the costly nature of space travel that has yet to be remedied.\n6. Option D, hoverboard, seems plausible considering that it is used by some for surfing, or similar to surfing.\n7. If space exploration became practical, a hoverboard used to surf through the stars would be quite fascinating. However, it would not satisfy the question of how people would actually perform the exploration.\n8. Option E,'supermarket', is also unlikely because space travel is costly and unlikely to be affordable to the average citizen, so it would be inefficient to use supermarkets to allow people to explore space.\n9. Hence, the best answer option would be B: 'roadblock'.\nSo the final answer are B: roadblock\n\nInput:What is likely the highest paying job in the hospital setting? Choices: 1. A: Risk Analyst 2.

{"text": "1.'Exposed wire' refers to an unprotected wire that can potentially give a person shock.\n2. This implies some level of surprise when the wire is discovered, implying that the person should not have touched it.\n3. Looking at the options,'shocked' and'startled' mean to feel such an emotion.\n4. However, this doesn't necessarily mean you are surprised - these are emotions, not states of knowledge.\n5. Hence, 'Surprised' would not be the correct choice.\n6. 'Shocked' isn't the correct answer because the previous sentence about touching the exposed wire suggests there should be some surprise.\n7. So the options left are 'humorous' and 'funny'.\n8. 'Humorous' refers to having a light-hearted sense of humor, which might not necessarily imply surprise.\n9. 'Funny' connotes the sense of amusement or humor, but it's less specific than humourous.\n10. Thus, the correct answer would be 'funny'.

Also, if the cow was accustomed to staying outside all the time, then it would not leave the green field.\n3. Therefore,'leaving the stable' and 'leaving the green field' are relevant contexts here. \n4. The other options like'red barn', 'gate' and'meat grinder' are not explicitly related to the cow or its movements.\n5. So the green field represents where the cow is 'leaving the'. \n6. 'leaving the green fields' implies that the cow stays there, indicating its preference for the open green fields.\n7. Also, 'leaving the stable' suggests that it will return to the cow after the storm has passed.\n8.

Choices:  L A: space to work B: equipment C: machinery D: support staff E: training staff\nOutput: 1; The sentence states that the new hood had all that was necessary for success.\n2. Therefore we are searching for an option that is important to creating success.\n3. Looking at the alternatives:'space' is needed for a person to work, but space is also required to be successful in a variety of different endeavors.\n4. It is not a 'needed to' item and is not an indication of the new hood being successful.\n5.

Thus, option A, 'large city' is most apt.\n9. In a large city, a store's damaged product would be more likely to be stored in a separate area than in other parts of the mall, and would be less likely to have further issues as such an area would be better suited to temporary storage.\n10.

Choices:  First, let's break down the sentence. We can see that \"she\" is upset by her boss' \"condescending tone\". This means that her boss is being overly dismissive and patronizing with her.\n5. Secondly, the question asks for what she likely fears in this scenario.\n6. Based on the above information, the key words to look for are \"fear\" and \"her\". \n7. So, let's look for options that contain or have \"fear\".\n8. As for \"her\", we can use the word \"person\".\n9. So, let' choose options that contain any of these two key words.\n10. To get the meaning of \"her\", let's consider option \"E\". The sentence is saying \"what she probably fears\". \"she\" is an objective pronoun.\n11. Since an implicit subject and object is assumed, what \"her\" stands for is what person \"she fears\".\n12. Combining the above, option \"E\" could be something like \"What is she fearing?\" or \"What do you think she fearing?\".\n13. Using these words, we can rule out options \"A\" and \"C\" because they're not related to the workplace.\n14. In option \"B\", the word \"she\" is used as a pronoun. But we also have already used the pronoun \"the person\" for \"her\", so this is irrelevant.\n15. Options \"D\" and \"F\" contain a subject-verb pair \"is\", which could mean she probably fears", "answer": "B: think"}

{"text": "1: The statement says \"the ground is getting wet\".\n2. This indicates a potential damp environment as the ground gets wet.\n3. This implies the presence of nearby water, as water is responsible for wet conditions in the ground.\n4. Among the list of options, only one option, namely E: skin rash, mentions an issue relating to wet ground as a possibility.\n5. In addition,'skin rash' is a symptom that often indicates the exposure to moisture or dampness.\n6. So, we can conclude that a damp environment may cause a skin rash.\n7.

However, personal characteristics is not mentioned as one of the reasons why a person may be disliked. This indicates that the third possibility should be dismissed.\n4. Similarly, the word'may' in the sentence implies that there are many factors that can lead to dislike.\n5. Therefore there are many reasons why a person is disliked, and personal characteristics is not necessary for this.\n6. There only remains four other possibilities as", "answer": "B: melting"}

In the question, it is mentioned that the spout was seen off the coast of what.\n3. This implies that the incident in question happened off the shores of somewhere.\n4. Looking through the options, we can rule out option A: Florida.\n5. In terms of location, this is not where the sighting of a water spout occurred. Thus, it cannot be the answer.\n6. The next two candidates are the last two: B: basement and C: sink.\n7. Basement and sink are located deep within the land and not the shores of a place respectively, and thus can be ruled out. \n8. We have been looking for a location, and Beach and Fountain are both locations.\n9. Thus, it must be the correct options with Beach and Fountain respectively. \n10. The most direct answer to the question would have been Fountain - Fountains are found on the beach.\n11. But since the word 'fountain' wasn't given as a choice, Beach or Fountain could be correct.\n12. However, it is clear from the choice that a water spout appeared from the ocean as opposed to some other location.\n13. If the water spout had appeared from a fountain, it would have also appeared from the sea, but instead, it was seen from the ocean.\n14.

Hence, we can rule out supermarket as the location for the shopping bag. \n3) Shopping (A) refers to buying, so option D) can be considered. As the question asks where the shopping bags are located, this option can be ruled out, as it does not specify supermarkets. \n4) We can rule out option D) as home to mean 'not in a supermarket' is unnecessary. 'Home' can be interpreted as a plausible location in general rather than in a supermarket. \n5) Similarly,'mart' can be ruled out as the question does not specify supermarkert. \n6) As we are looking for a location related to grocery stores, not all shopping choices, 'hardware store' can be ruled out. \n7) Closet(C) can be ruled out as there are many other uses for closet, like storage. \n8) So, we are left with two options: A) Supermarket and E) Hardware store. 9) However, 'A) Supermarket' can be ruled out because the question did not specify that the bag should be a supermarket bag, so it is not necessary to find a supermarket bag. 10) Hence, 'E) Hardware store' is the answer to the question.\nSo the final answers are: E: Hardware store\n\n### Note: \n1. \uad73\uc774 \uc790\uc138\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ub098\uc624\ub294\uac83\uc5c6\ub2e4. \uc77c\ub2e8 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc790\uccb4\uac00 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0\n2. \ucc98\uc74c \ub0b4\uac00 \uc9c8\ubb38\ud558\ub358 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc774 \uadfc\ub2f9\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc778\uac83\uc744 \uc54c\uac8c \ub418\uba74 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294\ub370 \ubc29", "answer": "A: supermarket"}

The options include for or away from, either of which could be inappropriate due to the negative connotation, combined may also be problematic as it suggests a fusion of the others. \n3. For or against are most likely choices, but not without some minor discrepancies. For or against also implies that the other party is either for or against it. \n4. This implies that Allison is for the decision.  So, we should narrow down the options to for or against and choose one of them. \n5. 'Away from' is a negative term that might not be appropriate here, 'for or against' can be further subdivided into 'for the decision' or 'against the decision'. \n6. However, it doesn't specify which party is taking which position. \n7. Hence, we can combine these two phrases into one term that indicates disagreement while also specifying the parties.\n8.

{"text": "1) It is important to clarify the use of the word 'experiencing' because it can have different meanings depending on the context. For example, if the phrase was to say 'I am not experiencing curiosity.', this means that I am not feeling curious at the moment. However, if the phrase was 'I am not experiencin', it would suggest that I am a passive recipient of an experience and do not play an active role in it.\n2. In this context, the meaning of 'experiencing curiosity' is to actively engage in the process of becoming curious. This means that in order to watch a video on YouTube successfully, it is essential for the viewer to actively participate in the experience of viewing the video. This implies that the viewer should be actively engaged in the process so that they can effectively learn and understand the video.\n3. The statement suggests that those who do not experience curiosity or do not feel fulfilled by watching videos on YouTube may have different interests and ways of obtaining knowledge.\n4. Thus, it is important to have options that will capture the different interests and ways of learning that people may have. By doing this, the options can serve as guides and indicators to other viewers of the video.\n5. It follows that the options suggested should be ones that have a correlation to the way that people who experience curiosity or are fulfilled by watching videos learn. In this way, the options will help guide others to enjoy and derive the most value from watching videos on YouTube that they can.\n6. The options that appear most likely to appeal to these individuals and have a correlation to their way of learning are ones that involve exploring the world, such as A: examine thing and E: see favorite show. \n7. Conversely, some people may prefer to focus on more abstract concepts and ideas or be more focused on entertainment for mental stimulation rather than curiosity. In this case, options D: hear news and B: stare into mirror could capture the attention of these viewers.  \n8. Therefore, there are five possible options that could be suggested to those individuals who do not experience curiosity when watching videos on YouTube. These options are: E: see favorite show, A: examine thing, B: stare into the mirror, C: go somewhere, and D: hear the news. \n9. The final answer is E: see favorite show which", "answer": "E: see favorite show"}

{"text": "1.The question asks what you need before buying products.\n2. A person can buy a product without desiring it or having money, but a person needs time to think about whether they will buy that product, regardless of whether they desire it or have money. \n3. Thus, 'time' is what people require before buying products. 4. Looking at all the choices, 'time' is the most logical because it fits the context given in the question. Spending money is obviously a requirement for buying products, which is something people won't spend money or require if they don't desire something, which 'time' also doesn't require. As for the other choices, 'desire' is implied in the question as a requirement for buying, but it's ambiguous until you find the product you want or need and it's not necessarily enough to ensure you will buy it. Money and needs can be either a lack of funds or the reason you may desire a product.\nSo in general, 'time' is a better fit for the given context.\n\nInput: You should not rely on other people to make you feel good, but to what should you rely? Choices:  D: yourself B: friends C: family E: luck F: your brain\nOutput: 1) First, since it's implied the person needs to feel good, the options should be ranked in terms of how they make you feel better about anything.\n2) The question mentions that you shouldn't rely on people to make feel good so we can rule out 'friends', 'family', and 'your brain'.\n3) 'Luck' is included as an option since luck can be a helpful influence in improving anyone's life. \n4) The option 'yourself' is a better choice than the other options because it is the only one that mentions the person can'make themselves feel good'. This further implies that the other options do not allow for personal participation in making the person feel better.\n5) 'Friends', 'family', 'luck', and 'your brain' are all out. This leaves the two choices that involve personal involvement in making yourself feel better.

Hence, the next phase of their lives involves their absence from fear of the dark.\n4. This conclusion implies that the next phase starts immediately after they grow out of their fear of the dark. \n5. Since the next phase happens just after fear of the dark is gone, the next phase is the phase where they fear nothing but have not fully developed an interest to face the world.\n6. This can be narrowed down to two main choices: the phase of being alone or the phase of social interaction.\n7. 'Being alone' has been excluded firstly because children do not want to be alone but instead, to socialise with other children. \n8.

Option B can be ruled out as it is more about being old, not the actual event. Option C does say a bookstore, but is too vague to say anything about the type of event.\n\n7. An opera concert is most likely to occur somewhere with a sophisticated concert hall. The operatic hall may be in an abandoned theater, so option D cannot be ruled out, but the event itself may not be there.\n8. Therefore options A and E might be possibilities, with A being more so, since the theater at which the event may occur would have a stage that would allow for such performances.\n9. Therefore, it is a possibility to find a ticket to the opera at a used bookstore.\n10. Yes, A used bookstore could conceivably sell a ticket to the opera or a related performance, like the orchestra or a concert itself.\n11. But it would be more likely to be something for sale in a music or theater store.\nSo the final choice is E as a. used bookstore is unlikely to sell a. ticket to a classical concert.\nSo the answer is E: used music or theater store\n\nInput: Who invented the modern guitar", "answer": "C: opera"}
{"text": "1..We can rule out 'B: can' because it's not a living thing. \n2. If B was replaced by 'body', C could be B instead because 'body includes (lip included)'.\n3. 'Human' could be B because humans usually have bodies with lips.\n4. KFC doesn't fit here because they are not living things and a living thing has a lip.\n5. Hence, the choices we have are A, C, E or D.\n6. Lip is the outer edge of the mouth. D could be a living thing if it's a toad, but what are its characteristics?\n7. A toad doesn't have ears like human beings do. \n8. And a toad's snout is its nose instead of lips, which is the outer edge of a mouth. \n9. So, even though D is a living thing, it's not a correct answer.\n10. Similarly, E is not a living thing.\n11. C says \"the lip is the fleshy part of my mouth...\".\n12. The correct answer is A: mouth because only mouth as a living thing has a fleshy part called lip.\nSo the final answers are: A: mouth\n\nInput: You are going to be on TV if you: Choices:  A.

{"text": "1. Where could one find large pieces of paper that were not for sale? \n2. The answer should be'somewhere that doesn't sell them,' hinting at the context for the paper.\n3. But 'a suitcase' and 'an office supply store' may imply a place where you can find some, as they're usually places where things meant for selling can be readily found.\n4. So that narrows our options down to a computer printer and an artist's studio.\n5. If you look at the context of the question, you might figure out that the paper is meant for an artistic purpose.\n6. Considering this, an artist's studio seems like a logical option for a place to acquire free-for-use paper.\n7. But it's only an implication from the context - you can't take the given fact for granted and it's not necessarily true.\n8. So maybe an artist's studio might not be a logical place to find large paper that is not for sale.\n9. Looking at 'a computer printer' we notice that it could likely print large paper, as most printers can only print paper of a certain size.\n10. If this option is true, it would definitely be somewhere that would be able to print large pieces of paper that's not for sale.\n11. In addition, as far as the context goes, this is the only logical option which implies that paper is for an artistic purpose or that you want to create your own art piece.\n12.

{"text": "1._Injury__is the only non-weather-related reason__that__does not allow a professional to play._\n2. The context of the question is a list of what 'would not be a valid explanation' for a professional athlete not competing in their respective sport, where we have already eliminated the answer choices A: pain and B: mudslide.\n3. C: sweating and pain due to competition itself are also invalid reasons because they would not prevent an athlete from playing.\n4. To find an answer that is not included in these reasons why would professionals playing sports 'not be able to compete', we focus on E: rain and D: injuries.\n4. Rain is not just any form of precipitation, but rather a specific water phenomenon that would be more akin to another sport like soccer with wet fields or indoor events where the weather conditions are not relevant.\n5. Injuries and medical issues would potentially impact an athlete's performance by impairing their ability to participate in training and competitions, but we can assume that proper medical attention and rest is available for any injury or condition that impacts an athlete's ability to compete.\n6. Therefore, the answer cannot be E: rain and injuries, meaning the answer must be D: injuries. So, the answer is D.\nSo the final choice is D: injuries.", "answer": "D: injuries"}

The options that could serve as possible answers: apartment, vacation, idle, neighborhood, and going.\n6. The answer we are looking for requires more specificity as to location, and only options A and D have the appropriate sense of specific place.\n7. So we can eliminate options C and E.\n8.

{"text": "1 The question asks what was one of the major activities that took place at the shore.\n2 At this point in the sentence,'shore' has already been established as relevant to tourism. Therefore, the shore was a bustling site for fishing before it was a tourist destination.\n3. To clarify: It's important to keep tabs on the meaning of the word'shore' at all times in the question.\n4. In general,'shore' is a synonym for 'beach'. However, when'shore' is used in context like this question, it refers to the coast and adjacent lands that are along the edge of water.\n5. 'Ocean' is the name given to the vast body of salt water that covers most of the earth's surface.\n6. Thus, there is no fishing industry at the 'ocean', as it would be found inland or on an adjacent land to the ocean.\n7.

We can eliminate 'negligence' as not being the correct answer because of similar reasoning.\n5. Looking at answers: 'indifferent', 'difference', and 'care' do not fit as the context indicates the person is not interested or does not care about the person.\n6.

Garden party: event held open to public in garden for entertainment. Friend Grouchy: He was cynical. Grouchy: Angry, bitter, rude & cynical. He was not happy! He was cynical, bitter & angry; he was not happy!\n2) The question asks why the friend is grouchy.\n3) Because the garden party is generally a happy & care free occasion, the reason why the friend is annoyed must be something outside the general pleasant atmosphere of the event.\n4) Options A and B are rejected because they don't explain why the friend is grumpy.\n5) Options C and D express opposite emotions from what we are looking for, so we dismiss these.\n6) The answer is E: joyful and grouchy.\nSo the final question is E: joyful\n\nInput: The scientist thought her experiment had failed, but she kept revising her results until she realized that she had been mistaken.

She had thought the book was not selling because it was not placed at a good position.", "answer": "B: closed"}
{"text": "1: The question mentions where a teakettle is kept, and the choices given are all places where such an item could be found.\n2. Among these options, 'cupboard' (A) and 'water' (D) are not logical choices as far as the context is concerned. \n3. This is because the teakettle is typically used for preparing hot water or tea, so it is kept in the vicinity of hot liquid instead of having to walk to a different cupboard for that purpose. Additionally, 'england' (E) is not related to the context of the question regarding a teakettle.\n4. The other options do not indicate that these are logical locations for teakettles. \n5. 'Countertop' (B) and 'harware' (C) are not generally where people keep teakettles either.\n6. 'Water' is also unlikely as a place to keep a teakettl, since there are typically already vessels for hot liquid present there. \n7. Therefore, the only logical choices among the given options are: 'countertop' (B) for its ease of accessing hot water, and 'water' (not an option to indicate a logical location) itself, since it is a common sense idea where the teakettle can usually be found.\n8. Thus, the answer is A and B: countertop. \n9. The final answer is A and B. \nSo the final answer A: countertop B: water\n\nInput: Where do you normally put your hat? Choices: 1: A: on my head 2: B: in a drawer 3: C: in a cupboard 4: D: on the shelf 5: E: on a hat rack 6: F: behind a door 7: G: under a bed\nOutput: 1.: We can rule out options C and E because a hat is not normally held under a bed or hung up on a hat rack. While a hat could be hung up in a cupboard, the context of the question suggests that it is normally worn.\n2. Options A and D are not logical choices. One would expect to put one's hat on one's head or on the shelf.\n3. Options B and G do not pertain to the context of the hat.\n4. Option", "answer": "A: cupboard"}

We know that he didn't check the electrical connection, which indicates that he looked in the wrong location.\n4.

We know it was a nuisance. This is indicated by the fact that they did not feel they needed to check.\n3. This means that they felt they were not faced with a serious concern or problem.\n4. This indicates they felt they had no control.\n5. This indicates they felt the noise was something that was expected.\n6. This indicates they felt some people had better judgment than they did.\n7.

Therefore, the answers pertaining to physical location are not possible (A-B).\n5. A speech could be said anywhere, including a high school or city, so options C and D can be ruled as possible answers.\n6. However, it makes more sense for Jan to go to a theater to hear a speech, where he would potentially be near the speaker and other members of the audience.\n7.

{"text": "1: The question asks where the person who was organizing the canned food drive went to pick up contributions.\n2. The event they were having was a canned food drive, which indicates that donations were required from participants.\n3. So for the person to pick up those contributions, they need to go to where they were stored or distributed.\n4. 'Shelf' and 'cellar' are likely locations for storing food, as the question mentions picking up food from the drive.\n5. However, these locations don't necessitate storage or distribution of food, so they can be ruled out. \n6. Similarly, option B:'refrigerator' is a convenient place to store food but does not imply that food was stored or distributed for the drive.\n7. So the remaining options, D: grocery store and E: cupboard, are likely locations for food pick up.\n8. In addition, the context suggests that canned foods were being collected for the drive, which implies that food in a grocery stores will be of use for the person picking up donations.\n9. So the most likely location is grocery store, and choice D is correct.\nSo the final Answer is D: grocery \n\nInput: We like it when players run 40 yards for a touchdown rather than 75 yards, why? Choices: \tA: That's why it takes longer B: Invented by us C: More entertaining D: So our linemen can rest E: It's a lot easier to run 40 yards and be in the end zone\nOutput: 1) The sentence suggests that there is a preference for running for 40 yards instead of 75 yards.\n2) It is likely that this choice is based on some kind of reasoning or opinion.\n3) Among the options, only choices A and E fit the context, as they describe an opinion about the distance that is easier to run or more enjoyable.\n4) However, choice E can be ruled out since it can be stated in a straightforward sentence ('it's easier to run 42 yards and be in the zone').\n5) Choice A also includes part of that statement, so it is also eliminated.\n6) Choice C is likely because it says, 'it's more entertaining' and 'it", "answer": "E: grocery store"}
{"text": "1.'Fast' definitely can refer to traveling or motion, but it's a bit unexpected since it's not what the car was doing or what the driver was going to be doing.\n2. 'Fast' isn't a suitable match for the context \"fall off\", which is something that's going to happen to the car.\n3. 'Sailing' and 'tighten' are suitable since they all talk about movement\n4. But we can rule out'sailing' due to the proximity of 'footloose'\n5. 'Tighten' could also be an answer. However, the only time 'to tighten' is mentioned for a wheel is in \"to tighten a loose wheel\". It does not describe what the wheel might be doing, nor does it suggest that it is going to do something.\n6. 'Bind' means to attach and make something fast or secure. This is the best choice that fits the context and describes what the car does if it's losing the wheel. Therefore, out of 'B': sailing 'E': bind, \"bind\" is the most suitable answer.\nSo the final match is E: bind\n\nInput: You have a job for four different people. If the job is to pick peaches in the orchard, which worker has it the easiest? Choices: \n1. A person who does it for free. 2. A person who is fast and efficient. 3. A person who gets better tips. 4. A person who's lazy\nOutput: 1.\"Free\" implies a voluntary exchange, such as a job that someone is doing for free.\n2. \"Fast and efficient\" is a characteristic of a better worker.\n3. \"Getting better tips\" is directly related to the question.\n4. \"Lazy\" isn't a suitable choice since the worker is at an orchard.\n5. We can eliminate all choices up to but not including 4. So, the answer to the question would be 3. A worker who gets better tips.\nSo the final choice we have is 3. A worker that gets better tips\n\nInput: Which of these items has a common characteristic for them? Choices: 1. The word 'blue.' 2. They are each a different color. 3. They are all the same price. 4", "answer": "C: fast"}
{"text": "1.'Evenly matched' in this context means that each team had high probability of winning, which is why 'winning' or 'losing' could not be the right answer.\n2.'Envy' here could mean the desire to want one team to win because you desire to see them win, as in'respect, envy, or jealousy, which is why option B: resentment can also be ruled out.\nOption 'D', 'two winners', is not a feasible choice because it conflicts with the 'evenly matched' context and makes no sense.\n3. Since 'E: two winners' and 'D: one winner' are eliminated, the question implies that the spectators are hoping to see two different teams win, hence, option 'B: envy' is the correct choice.\nSo the final choice is B: envy \n\nInput: She was unlucky to fall on the only uneven portion of the trail, and twisted her ankle on what? Choices: A: rocks B: moss C: dirt D: gravel E: sticks\nOutput: 1: The question states that she was unlucky to trip on the only uneven part of the trail and twist her ankle.\n2. 'Unevenness' is the most likely reason for her fall on the trail, not rocks, dirt, soil, or sticks.\n3. 'Moss' could be uneven at places, but it is unlikely to cause a fall on any uneven portion of the path due to its fuzzy and soft nature.\n4. In the context of a trail, it is likely the soil would be uneven in some places in nature, but it is unlikely soil would cause a twisted ankle after a fall.\n5. It is unlikely that 'Gravel' would cause a fall due to its hard and stony nature. \n6. Sticks are unlikely to cause a fall or a twisted ankles due to their solid nature.\n7. As a result, there is only one remaining choice that could cause such an accident: 'D: rocks'.\n8.

{"text": "1 Johnny wanted blowfish from the south Pacific Ocean, so he was likely looking for it in an area that wasn't near America.\n2 It's mentioned earlier that Johnny was looking for blowfish and he wanted fish from the south Pacific Ocean.\n3. Therefore we are looking for a location with blowfish that is not near America. Among the options: \"Fisherman's Wharf\" is not a place that was used to sell fish.\n4. \"North American\" refers to the northern part of America or the land north of America.\n5. 'South Pacific Ocean' refers to the ocean south of America.\n6. So, option E: the south Pacific Ocean would cover this as it is south of America.\n7. The fish market (option A) refers to a place where fish is sold.\n8. Option E 'the south Pacific Ocean' does not necessarily deal with places where fish is sold, so it's excluded.\n9. Option C 'Hawaiian waters', option B 'Gulf of Mexico' are not in the same location as the south Pacific ocean.\n10. But option D 'tropical sea' is mentioned in a possible location for the fish later, so it probably refers to a tropical sea like the South Pacific ocean.\n11. Therefore, the answer could potentially be D, which is the south Pacific Ocean. But we should still use a specific location to answer the question.\n12. This leaves the Gulf of Mexico and the Tropical Sea.\n13. Among these, the southern-most part of the Gulf of Mexico is the Yuc\u00e1ten Gulf, found between Mexico and Cuba.\n14. The westernmost part of the GM is the Mexican Bay which is near the state of Guerrero.\n15. Therefore, the answer may be A is Mexican Bay. But that is not mentioned in the text.\n16. So we can narrow down to looking for the locations with Blowfish.\n17. The only possible location which could be used to sell blowfish is option D tropical sea.\n18. But the fact that it's a tropical sea is also mentioned in the text as a good place for blowfish.\n19. If blowfish are also found in other locations, there isn't any reason to say it was found in a tropical sea.\n20. Therefore", "answer": "E: south pacific ocean"}
{"text": "1: The idea that it was \"cutting edge\" to have a tiny calculators shows that it was a fairly new phenomenon in the past.\n2. The phrase \"cutting edge\" suggests that this was an innovative and modern concept at the time.\n3. Calculators were once relatively small, as they exist in more compact sizes now, which makes sense if they were state-of-the-art and cutting edge at one point.\n4. Therefore, the answer must be related to carrying a tiny calculator. Among the options, only option D: office and option E: desktop qualify, as they require keeping a calculator handy on one's desk when at work.\n5. In the past, many people would have carried a calculator with them to work or use one stationed on their desks.\n6. Option E: desktop is accurate, but it implies too much of an emphasis on the calculator being used on a desk, so it is not the sole answer.\n7. Option D: office is relevant, but the phrase \"it was cutting edge\" suggests that being seen with a tiny calculator was somewhat of a novel or popular concept at the time. Thus, this choice would be over-simplifying the situation by making it seem as if having a calculator was something that was unusual.\n8. It is more plausible that \"people had\" these type of calculators back then.\n9. Hence, the correct answer is D: office. \n10.

Looking at the context, we know that it is easier to meet a friend living in the same city or state than in a different country or faraway place.\n6. 'At school' has a context similar to A or D, but neither of these answers directly deals with this context of meeting a friend in a close environment.\n7. Hence, A: workplace and 'At school' can be eliminated. \n8. The choice that corresponds to these statements is 'D: neighbors house'. \n9. So, the answer is 'D: neighbours house'.\nSo the final answer  is D: neighbours house\n\nInput: After all that effort, how do you feel?

The answer must be an adjective that is used for physical energy.\n3. Options 1, 3, 5 and 6 are therefore eliminated since they don't refer to energy.\n4. There are three feelings related to tiredness: tired, exhausted, and exhausted. But only tired is a word that represents energy. So, the one that best represents the feeling is tired.\n5.

{"text": "1, The question is about what parents are trying to do when they yell in times of children's chaotic behavior.\n2. Answer choices 'guide children', 'understand children', 'control children' and'vent anger' can be discarded as they do not directly indicate the emotional motivation of the parent in yelling.\n3. 'Care for children' implies the motivation of the parent to protect and support their offspring, which would not be a major cause for yelling.\n4. That leaves us with 'A' and 'D' options, which are the most closely related to emotional motivation.\n5. However, the question does not use the term 'anger' directly, nor is it about 'control'. Rather, it is about 'chaos', which is a state of disorganization and lack of structure, which may be more related to the 'guidance' and 'care' options.\n6. Based on this, we can eliminate both 'guide children' and 'care for children' as possible answers.\n7. So finally, the only two viable options left are 'D: care for children' and 'A: guide children'.\n8. However, it can be seen that a parent trying to care for their children would not yell so much in these situations, as they would be more focused on providing comfort than guidance.\n9.

Also, strip malls and city centers would not normally house beauty salons.\n4. So among the remaining options, 'cleanup' and 'painting' don't really apply.\n5. 'Furnace.' however, would be appropriate for a beauty salon setting if it means the space was heated.\n6. This explains why furnaces can be found in beauty salons.\n7.

The major difference between writing at university and high school is that university writing is more descriptive and comprehensive as compared to high school writing.\n2.) In terms of language, the level of description required in university writing exceeds that of high school writing.\n3.) University writing is more descriptive as it requires that students are able to delve into the subject matter at a deeper level and express their opinion or research in a more thorough manner.\n4.)

{"text": "1: The sentence refers to police who \"do their job better than those of other police\". \n2. This suggests that there are different police and that some of them are doing better than others.\n3. So the next step would be to determine which is the job police are performing.\n4. Since the job could be to find drugs, the other option may be to direct traffic.\n5. Since the job could also be to stop the drug trade, the other job could be to help people.\n6. Since police could also try to prevent crimes, the other job could involve protecting business people from theft.\n7. Now that we have eliminated the other options, we can select the best one.\n8. 'Arm themselves' and 'Help people' can both be used to \"do your job better\" but the former seems more appropriate in the context of policing where the job is to find the criminal rather than to help him in the future.\n9.

Hence, the activities should be related to sleeping or sleep-related.\n4. From the choices, we can eliminate option D:'sitting' as this choice does not relate to sleeping or sleep related activities.\n5. Among the remaining options, 'dancing' implies activity. So the answer should be an activity related to sleeping.\n6. Option C: 'learn' is too broad as an activity.\n7. Option B: 'fall asleep' refers to going to sleep so it could be correct answer. However, that isn't what we are looking for - falling asleep doesn't help in doing anything else when we want to do something else. Hence, we can rule out option B.\n8. Option E 'do something' is too vague to be correct as the answer for the question.\n9. Hence, we are left with option A and option D to choose from.\n10. We can eliminate option A: 'have TV' because having TV is actually a matter of choosing TV itself instead of sleeping. If we want to sleep we cannot have TV by default.

Choices:  a person B: health C: body D: limb E: head\nOutput: 1) This paragraph asks about what is protected from the seatbelt of a car.\n2) Given that seatbelts are primarily meant to safeguard the user from injury in the event of an accident, we can eliminate 'a person' and 'body' from the list of possible answers.\n3) 'limb' is a body part, so the question is still not answered clearly, despite our earlier elimination.\n4) It is easy for someone to assume that one's 'health' is protected by a seatbelt: a seatbelt can prevent cuts from the steering wheel, but there are other possibilities for the question to consider.\n5) Instead, the answer to the question is 'the head', as this is the body part that is most exposed and vulnerable to injury when a passenger is not wearing a seatbelt.\nSo the final answers are C: body and D: limb\n\nInput: You feel better when you get enough sleep, and it can make you healthier.

Choices A: cold B: freezing C: no air D: a cold mixer E: cooling\nOutput: 1) The question refers to an ice cream bar. The fact that there are no ice crystals in this ice cream bar implies freezing. The ice cream is not frozen yet and contains moisture.\n2) So it can be inferred that when an ice cream bar is in a frozen state, the water is removed from the mix to form the ice cream. This reduces the risk of ice crystals forming.\n3) The above implies that ice crystals are formed when air is present in the mix, which is when the ice cream is not fully frozen.\n4) So, all the other options, except A (cold) will be eliminated since they cannot be the answer.\n5) As a cold mixer can cause ice crystals, the answer would be -B: freezing.\nSo the final choice is B: freezing\n\nInput: Duct tape has more uses than just repairing ducts, what else should you use it for?

{"text": "1.. The question asks how a person can end up stopping standing in a puddle.\n2.  We know that standing is stopping, so we can eliminate option A: move away from.\n3. 'Laying in' could mean that someone is laying in water, but this doesn't involve being in a puddles or the result of standing.\n4. 'Sweating' doesn't necessarily indicate that the floor is wet or causing the sweating of a person.\n5. 'Movement' could mean movement out of a puddle, but this could be through water, through slippage, or even through sweating. Option D seems more likely to refer to the kind of movements that help get out of the puddle, rather than the cause of standing.\n6. Option E could be a possible answer. However, it could refer to someone who has gotten sick and can't stand up. This is an unlikely possibility considering the context that a puddle is involved.\n7. Therefore, the answer that best captures the meaning of the sentence is 'E: walking out of'. So, the answer choice is E: walking out of.\nSo the final choice is E: walking\n\nInput: The author has done what to this old photograph of himself? Choices: \n A: changed clothes B: made funny C: changed his hair D: cropped it E: improved the picture\nOutput: 1 In order to figure out the answer to this, we need to analyze the sentence and understand what it tells us.\n2 It states that the author has done something to a photo and that they are talking about a photo of themselves.\n3 We are given the choice to select answers between A and E. However, A, B and D do not seem to be applicable, since they pertain to actions the author has not taken. The author did not change clothes, make funny or crop the photo. \n4 Therefore, the only reasonable option left is E: improved the photograph. The photo may have been taken long ago, or the author may not have been satisfied with its appearance at the time. Whatever the reasons, the author could have taken the picture and improved it through various means such as the use of special filters and lighting techniques, which would result in the resulting photograph in more pleasing to the author.

Choices:  A true story B: false statement C: old friend D: aunt E: family\nOutput: 1: This statement talks about a person who was called a bacteria, but is now called that.\n2: This implies that the person is used to or likes being called a bacteria.\n3: This shows that he has no other possible names. So, choices A, B, and C cannot be the answer because they mean there is someone else who has called him that.\n4: Choice E also cannot be the answer because it is referring to a possible family member, rather than a name for the person, which can be derived from choices D and E.\n5: Choice D is called an old friend. This implies that the person has been known by this name for a long time, so it is most likely to be true.\nSo the correct answer is D: an old friend.\n\n### Instruction:Answer the multiple choice question.\n \n Input: He doesn't just get the basic training, he also receives advanced instruction.

Another hint is'small papers' that would be helpful in games like 'cards'(or very heavy game).\n4. However, as the previous phrase is 'Lead with Small Paper', the game must be played with small papers and must be a card game (or'very heavy game', which we have already considered) and not a video or news article.\n5.

The question describes a scenario in which a boss uses the services of a broker, which is a professional who assists clients with finance and investment activities.\n2.) The question also specifies that using a broker would be counterproductive to the boss's investment goals, thus indicating that there is a negative outcome.\n3.) In the context of the question, the boss is incapable of making sound investment decisions.\n4.)

Which gives us: A or E\n3. We know A or E is one of the options because the context 'The person who started his own...' means that whoever the person is, he must choose one of the answers from the options.\n4. Hence, A or E is an option.\n5. We also know that in the answer it doesn't say 'either' or 'or' only 'and', so the options are both true.\n6.

{"text": "1, This is a question related to how people typically react to being abandoned by everyone after they separate from someone else.\n2. There are two options, a/b or c/d, as both of these groups are alternatives. So, the most likely feeling is one of these choices, not one that falls between the two.\n3. 'Grief' and 'Solo' both refer to situations of pain and sadness. This could indicate feelings of abandonment, but other emotions that go beyond just grief could also be present.\n4. 'Isolation' and 'Pleasure' are both words that could relate to feelings of abandonment, and also don't necessarily imply extreme emotions such as grief.\n5. So, we can eliminate a/b with some confidence. The more reasonable choice out of the options remaining would be c/d, isolation/pleasure. However, if we consider the emotions described by isolation and pleasure, we can consider both positive emotions like joy or fulfillment, and negative emotions like loneliness or despair. If we eliminate positive aspects, such as a feeling of relief or freedom, the choice c/d is still acceptable.\n6.

The sentence \"If a restaurant owner has a what?\" implies that the owner has a talent or skill that makes him successful in running a restaurant.\n3. Among options A to D, only options C and E are relevant here. \n4. Option A talks about cooking, which is unlikely to help the owner run the restaurant as successfully as other skills like management or planning.\n5. Option B refers to making money, which could be an important aspect of running a restaurant but is not necessarily a skill that will make the owner of the restaurant more successful.\n6. Option D refers to planning, which could be an essential part of running a restaurant, but it's unclear if it would give the owner of the restaurant a knack or a talent\nfor running it, as is suggested by the context.\n7. Option E refers to a 'knack for saving', which could refer to a certain finesse that the owner has in managing his own or the restaurant's money.\n8. This would help him run the restaurant more efficiently and effectively, thereby contributing to its success.\n9.

Option A: \"a minute\" is too short to reflect the real amount of time taken to complete the task. It also doesn't necessarily mean that he would be finished in one minute.\n3. Option B: \"one minute\" implies that he was only one minute late, whereas the guy would have been too late by at least a minute to finish the task in one minute.\n4. Option C: \"one minute more\" means more than one minute - two minutes - however, the person should have finished in one more minute than he initially expected.\n5. Option D: \"two minutes less\" means that the person finished in two minutes less than he initially expected. Again, he should have finished in one minute, but he took more than enough time to complete the task. \n6. So 'E: took even longer' is a suitable answer.\n7.

The first two words of the question indicate an area that is not a village, so we can eliminate 'Ohio' and 'Africa' as possibilities.\n3. Option 'B' could be a possible answer, as it is the opposite of 'village'.\n4. However, the context of the question is about the opposite of 'A: Village' itself, since a village would likely be an example of 'B: Rural Area'.\n5.

{"text": "1: The first sentence introduces two terms: 'beach' and'shallow water'.\n2. 'Beach', as per the definition given, is a stretch of sand adjacent to the water that people can visit to swim, sunbathe, etc.\n3. So 'beach' does not necessarily refer to an outdoor pool, so 'A' can be discarded.\n4. 'Pond' is used to describe a body of water that is smaller and less salty than a lake, but larger than a stream.\n5. So, it can refer to a small pond in a park, but not necessarily a beach. Therefore, 'C' and 'D' can also be eliminated.\n6. 'Bathe' is a verb that is used to refer to immersing oneself in water to clean or refresh oneself.\n7. It implies the use of water to wash and cool oneself.\n8. So to use 'bathe in' at a point where 'the locals' would enjoy the beach and water suggests that the water is shallow and suitable for bathing.\n9.

The options are all possible locations where one might find air that has been recently breathed by many people, as there are places on Earth (Surface of Earth, option E) where many people breathe and other things could breathe at the same time.\n3. However, the question suggests that a house is unlikely given the context, as people tend to breathe more at public spaces than their houses.\n4. Given that the question states that many people have breathed the air recently, this implies that there are many people, so options B and C are unlikely as they relate to space-based activities with a much smaller number of occupants.\n5.

This can be easily done by underlining the important part. In a sentence when part of a word is underlined it tells us that the other end is what is important/significant\nSo in this question after the big storm hit the mark wanted to know how people lived their life after the storm is the most important.\nThere cannot be many storms, so the storm hit is not important.

Looking at the context, we can rule out option B, because this would mean installing malware on a gaming computer, which is incongruent with the context.\nLooking at the other options, all of them are used for personal purposes, and therefore vulnerable to a hacker attack.\nThis suggests that option E: school is the most likely choice for malware attack, since a computer in a school is meant for academic purposes.\nSo the final and only answer is: option E: school\n\nInput: A shovel is more likely to be used on a what?

The option of dry plants without flowers would require a different condition (i.e. soil, water, and sunlight) than the cup with plant and water.\n3. The option of no plants is simply a blank in terms of what the actual condition might be, so it is unlikely.\n4. The option of no plant, roots, leaves, or flowers is a bit contradictory too, as these components do not belong to the same type of plant.\n5.

'Pond' and 'aquarium' imply that they are shallow bodies of water, which do not qualify as the largest body of water in Michigan.\n4. 'Lak'e' and 'Great Lakes' denote that these bodies of water can be large, so 'lake' would refer to any body of water in Michigan, whereas 'Great Lakes are the bodies of water that make up the largest source of freshwater in the world.\n2.

The question states that all items left on the counter will inevitably end up on the floor if people's feet sweep everything else out of the way.\n2. Based on the statement, we can assume that all items left on counter is implied to be swept up by people's feet or their movement.\n3. From there, we can infer that everything would be left behind, as the only logical items left on the counter would be things people would move out of the way to clean off the counter.\n4. Thus, the answer is E, nothing will be left on the counter if people sweep everything else off of it via their feet.\n5. However, the context provided in the following sentence might lead us to assume that people also pick up food items such as cups, plates, etc. that were left on the counter because they were moving everything away, not just their feet. \n6.

{"text": "1: The context of the question is that the source of a smell is stale in the bathroom or the kitchen.\n2. So, we should focus our search for the source of the stale smell. \n3. This implies that there are at least two different sources of the smell - one in the bathroom and one in the kitchen. \n4. Since the question doesn't specify which of those sources is stale, it wouldn't make sense to focus on the surface of Earth for a source of the smell, since that is the most distant option among the choices.\n5. Similarly, the surface of Earth is the least specific source among the choices, which doesn't match the context of the question.\n6. Thus, among the given options, options B, D, C, and A correspond to the context of the question, so they must be considered as viable possibilities.\n7. After considering that, option D states that the source of the smells in the bathroom and the kitchen are stale, which narrows the choices to three options - C, A, and B. Hence C, A, and D are out of the question, and B, C, and E are the final three options to consider.\n8. However, option B uses vague language and leaves room for many specific sources, while option E is too specific for the context of the question and is less likely to serve as a source of the smells.\n9.

'Record store' refers to a location where one could typically purchase physical recordings, such as vinyl records, CDs, and digital files. However,'record store' could refer to an online platform where one could purchase recordings in digital format, which could include pre-recorded streaming music or personal recordings recorded by oneself.\n4.

However, the term'share' could be either an activity or a pastime. It is not necessarily linked to liquids or sailing.\n6. This leaves us with options 'A: sail boats' and 'C: high fives' as possible answers. \n7. The context does not clearly give much information aside from the fact that 'people are traveling along liquid'.\n8. In answer choice C, high fives are an activity that is not necessarily associated with travel.\n9. Therefore, we have to choose the answer that is more likely to be a pastime. Among the options given, sailing is likely to be a past time.\n10. Hence, the answer would be Option A: sail boats.\nSo the final answers are A: sailing", "answer": "A: sail boats"}

{"text": "1.'Tame' in the context of the sentence can mean something akin to 'domesticated'.\n2.The sentence explicitly states that the animals were wild and not domesticated. Therefore, they are not supposed to feel any pain because they were not domesticated.\n3.'Lie down': implies that the animals could do anything, so this answer cannot be one of the most plausible choices.\n4. 'Run away' could be true, but the sentence does not explicitly suggest that it is.\n5. 'Bite': implies that the animals were wild, capable of some aggression, but they were still wild enough for them not to have been 'domesticated' for the purpose of harvesting.\n6. 'Keep alive': could hold true in a wildlife reserve, but the sentence does explicitly state that the animals are wild rather than tame.\n7.

Choices: \nA: yes B: truth C: promise D: answer E: certain\nOutput: 1: The term'sure' implies confidence or certainty in an aspect of reality. \n2. It is commonly used as an adjective, and is also commonly paired with the word 'yes'.\n3. Looking at the other choices: 'certain' is another word that is commonly used as an alternative for 'certainty' and would fit the intended adjective context.\n4. 'truth' also means 'absolute reality' and would fit as an alterntive for'sure', and has the correct relation with 'yes'.\n5. 'Promise' also fits as an adjective but the intended relation of'sure' with 'yes' doesn't seem to fit.\n6.

John's preference of glass over plastic is demonstrated by the statement 'The jar was plastic....John preferred glass'.\n4. His wish to be somewhere else suggests that the location he is in could be improved.\n5. Thus, the answer is that John should be somewhere else and this could be a choice from among the options.\n6. However, the only choices that can be connected to 'Somewhere else' are 'B' (everywhere else) and 'D' (the person's own home). \n7. This is not in line with the context that John is in a kitchen, which indicates that his own home is not very far away.\n8. Furthermore, the context also suggests that John prefers glass to plastic, so his home would be out of the question.\n9. So, we can eliminate all the choices but A:'somewhere else'.\n10.

Choices: 1. stadium 2. coliseum 3. arena 4. auditorium\nOutput: 1)\"Amphitheater\" is derived from the ancient Greek \"amphitheatre\", which means \"inclined on two sides\".\n2)\"Arena\" has no two sides so it is not suitable answer. Since the question is to get real life example of an amphidheater, we should pick one with the correct spelling of amphidetheater.\n3)Stadium is a multipurpose complex that contains multiple amenities.\n4)Auditorium usually refers to theater or auditorium.\n5)Amphitheater is the answer.\nSo the final answe is D: theater or auditoriam\n\nInput: How important is it to have the latest software version available to you and your employees?

When choosing the options, we can deduce that the parent's payment is micro as mentioned above, which means option C has already been eliminated.\n8. So the final answer is B: Costly, meaning they spent more than expected on microtransactions.\nSo the final answers to A and B: 'Costly' and the final answer to C: 'Containing', meaning they spent more on in-game purchases than expected.", "answer": "D: paying"}

Rinsing rice means washing it to get rid of any dirt or impurities.\n5). A rice cooker is a special type of cooking pot specially adapted for cooking rice.\n6).

{"text": "1.\"The man was eating his lunch, but rush\" indicates that the man ate lunch and then he immediately rushed from lunch.\n2. If we want to know why he rushed we need to look at what it is he rushed from in that context\n3. The man cannot rush out to buy food. This is because food is being served and he is already eating lunch.\n4. The man cannot rushed out because of heartburn, because that would prevent him from immediately moving on by rushing. \n5. Bad breath cannot be considered as a reason either because the man was already eating a meal, whereby his breath should already be reasonably normal.\n6. Therefore, the man must have immediately rushed away from lunch because of a work commitment or something related that was more important than continuing to eat his lunch.\n7. This eliminates the three obvious options; 'Early for Work', 'Gain Weight', and 'Bad Breath'\n8. This leaves the remaining two options; Late For Work or Work.\n9. It seems unlikely that he would rush from his food if late for work because this would indicate he will miss the whole thing.\n10. Therefore, we have to take the remaining two options: Late For Work and Work.\n11. Now we need to compare these two options based on the rest of the sentence. \n12. If we refer to the man being late, he already missed the thing he would be late for.\n13. This means he would not likely leave his food and rush to any further commitment, because that would require him leaving the one he just missed.\n14. Since the man would have to already leave from his food, he would need to rush for it.\n15. Therefore, we can conclude that 'Late for Work' is an unlikely cause for the man rushing because 'Late for Work', by definition, would already be too late.\n16. However, the reason in this question is stated as an occurrence \"He Rushed To Work\".\n17. This indicates that he actually rushed to some kind of job.\n18. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Late for Work'.\n\nSo the final answer to this question is option 'B': Late For Work\n\nInput: The man rushed", "answer": "B: late for work"}

{"text": "1 The question asks how to recover from exhaustion.\n2. The statement that only answer can recover from exhaustion is 'go to sleep'.\n3. Since the question is asking about recovery, the options are likely the best ways to address exhaustion.\n4. However, none of the options'mediate' or 'have rest' are relevant to answer here.\n5. Options B and C are irrelevant as going back to sleep would not solve the problem of being exhausted as is implied in the question.\n6. And it is not possible to recover from exhaustion by going to sleep if one has not already slept.\n7. So the options relevant to the question are D and E.\n8. Option D is defined as 'run out of steam', which is the opposite of being recovered from exhaustion. Since answer is recovering from exhaustion, but not 'run out of steam, option D is out.\n9. Option E is the only option that describes what the person wants to happen. Thus, option E is the answer.\nSo the final solution is E: go to sleep", "answer": "B: have rest"}
{"text": "1: A beaver's dam consists of a compact accumulation of material, usually wood and mud, formed across a slow-moving body of water.\n2. A beaver's dams are typically built in places where the beaver can access water for activities like swimming and food scavenging.\n3. If a beaver builds a dam in a strip club, that is a venue associated with adult entertainment, then the dam would probably not function well, because such a site might be inaccessible for the beaver.\n4. If a beaver build a dam in a pocket, then the dam's functionality probably would not be negatively impacted because beavers can build dams in such areas, which generally do not require large bodies of water.\n5. The only places for the beaver to build their dams are a millpond, an Ontario, a lake or a river, and among them, only a lake and a river would be large enough for the beaver to be able to construct a functional dam.\n6. The size of the body of water is important for beaver dams to function properly.\n7. Lake or a river are large enough where beavers can build functioning dams which serve their needs.\n8. Therefore the answer is D: Lake or river", "answer": "C: millpond"}

{"text": "1 Let's look at the question: What kind of place could have A seafood restaurant? This implies that seafood is the primary food served there.\n2. We can eliminate choices C, D. We know that seafood is not the primary food served in cities, like B, and that seafood is also not served at places that are primarily coastal, like E.\n3. So the only choices that make sense are A: new york, B: coastal cities.\n4. These are places that likely have a higher affinity to having seafood restaurants. For example, there are a lot of seafood restaurants in Boston, option E.\n5. A seafood restaurant could also exist in a very coastal city, like New York.\n6. So the answer has to be either A: new york or B: coastal cities because seafood is the only food that can fit the context given.\n7. Since the options are exclusive, we need to focus on that criteria: seafood.\n8. A key hint on the first question is that the sentence in the question begins with the subject \"What kind of...\". The subject is always focused on something important, so we need to keep it in mind.\n9. So, we need a city with more seafood restaurants, and we need a good hint from the question.\n10. The clue we have is \"coastal cities\".\n11. As soon as we see these words, we understand that we are looking for places near a coastline.\n12.

In this case, the person is likely to live in the mouth as it is an available space, but the options are still applicable.\n10) So the best answer would have to be a combination of the above.

{"text": "1: The question asks about what immortal people will one day do.\n2. The sentence mentions that mortals will eventually die. This implies that immortals will not die.\n3. The options are kick the bucket, mortal, dead, can die, and dying.\n4. Option A: kick the bucket is not relevant to the sentence.\n5. Option B: mortal indicates that the person will die one day. So, this option can be ruled out as the correct answer.\n6. Option C: dead indicates that the person will be immortal for a portion of their life, but eventually will die. This does not address the fact that they will one day be immortal.\n7. Option D: can die indicates that the person may die at any time. This is not relevant to immortality, which is forever.\n8. Hence, the only option that makes sense is option E.\n9.

{"text": "1: 1. The main requirement necessary to enable the majority of people to transport themselves is to have access to a method of transport. This can be done by owning a car, riding in public transportation vehicles, traveling in a helicopter, speaking words to summon a superhuman, or dancing together to create an airstream.\n2. People typically consider personal transportation to be one's own car. In some cultures, owning one's own car is considered the dream that everyone aspires to. In other countries, such as Japan, where cars are prohibitively expensive for the average person, taking public transportation is the norm. \n3. So, the first two choices, options A and B, would be most suitable at first thought.\n4. However, both helicopters and cars require that a person have some means of transportation or have the finances to pay for their services in order to use them properly. \n5. This means that people whose options A and B have been exhausted could try their luck with options C and D, speaking words and believing in God. \n6. This shows that options A and B are not the only answers to the question of what allows people to get from point A to point B.\n7. The final two options E and F are also plausible. Dancing together to create an air stream is similar in principle to speaking words to summon superman. Likewise, this is the type of scenario in which the \"fly like Superman\" meme originated.\n8. Therefore: C: speak words and E: dance together.\nSo the final answers are C: speak words and option E: dance together\n\nInput: A man decided to play the guitar. Why didn't they finish it?

The man's inability to finish learning the guitar means that he did not accomplish his goal of learning to play it. This implies  that he was trying to learn to play the guitar from the very beginning of the sentence and was not attempting to do something else instead.\n2. The choices A, B, and C make logical sense given the context of the situation. However, the third option B seems the", "answer": "B: own cars"}

We use the phrase, \u2018when one\u2019s left foot is shiny, It is the time to propose him/her\u2019\n7- So, to propose someone means to get married and people who got married wear white shoes.\n8- Therefore, the \u2018\u2019house\u2019\u2019 means the people who got married wear all white clothing when they get married (rule of thumb)\n9- A wedding is one of the most important events of your life.

It could be used for styling purposes, such as keeping a person's hair out of their eyes, adding volume or changing its shape.\n2) A hair salon or a barber shop are both possible places to find hairpins.\n3) Some hairpins are used only for styling hair. Hairpins are also available as accessories or a sign of fashion.\n4) Pins are typically stored in a pincushion to keep them from getting lost or rusting.\n5) A woman's hair is also an option. Hairpins can be stored in a woman's hair.\n6. The main reason why a hairpin could be lost at one place of work and another may be that it serves a different purpose than that of an office.\n7. Therefore, a hair pin would be used in an office setting if it was meant to store papers and other small items.\n8. An office might also utilize pins if they were meant to store small items, such as pencils.\n9. However, pins are not generally used for styling purposes in an office setting, so this answer is ruled out.\n10. Therefore, the answer must be a women's hair or a barber shop. \nSo the final answer are E: hair store and B: barber shop\n\nInput: One who is a master in the art of baking is the what?

{"text": "1.'He was in a cabin the woods' suggests that he was in some sort of secluded building where he could see animals outside.\n2.'Through the window' implies that he was looking out of the window to see what he saw.\n3. The fox's location outside of a building suggests it is not on the wall or picture.\n4. However, the context regarding that there is only a fox outside suggests that it is unlikely for there to be an animal outside that he wouldn't have seen.\n5. 'Indiana' is a landmass, so it is unlikely that animals would inhabit there.\n6. 'England' might be a landmass where animals can be and is a more likely option than Indiana.\n7. 'On the wall' would make sense with the context that he is seeing an animal outside that he had not seen before, but the phrase 'window' suggests that he is looking out the window to see what is outside. \n8. Hence, we know that the fox he was seeing outside is not on the wall but more likely on the ground.\n9. So the answer is C: outside.\nSo the final is C: outside. \n\nInput: Which statement is best regarding \"The Little Red Hen\" for a second grader? Choices: 1.

C: For a second grader, The Little Red Hen might not be familiar and they may need more context to fully understand it.\n5. D: The Little Red Hen could be used to discuss many topics, and is likely not used in isolation.\n6. Among these options, the one that is likely to be seen as most common in its use is option C, which says that The Little Red Hen is not well known to a second grader.\n7. However, the context is that the second grader has trouble understanding it, implying that it's possible for a second grader to understand it if the correct context is given. \n8. This suggests that the Little Red Hen was likely used in the way it was meant to be", "answer": "C: outside"}

What was the main reason they wanted to go downtown? Choices:  An: for the atmosphere B: for the music C: for the music D: for the people E: for the parking\nOutput: 1: After examining the sentence, it is evident that 'for the music' (option C) and 'for the people' (option E) represent the main reasons to switch between two restaurants, while the rest only add additional details. So, we can eliminate options C and E from the list.\n2: Now as we know that the sentence is about the main reason to change the restaurant, we should look for the main reason. Options like'music' and 'people' were mentioned in the sentence and represent subordinate reasons. Therefore, main reason would be 'for the atmosphere'.\n3. The atmosphere in the restaurant is the main reason for the restaurant switch.

{"text": "1.\"Playing a board game...\" is something that we do, not something we buy.\n2. The sentence implies that our family is already playing the game on the shelf, so we are not just buying the game.\n3. Hence, the choices that don't make sense under the given context are A: toy store and B: home.\n4. The game being 'on the shelf' suggests it is being stored and the shelf could be in a toy store.\n5. However, the options are not just toy stores in general, so we also rule out D: toy shop.\n6. So the choices we have left are C: school or E: shelf.\n7. These two options only make sense when the game has become too large for the shelf.\n8. This suggests that the question is asking where the game is being played.\n9.

However, a piece of wood can still be shiny and smooth without a polish if it is already carved or composted.\n3.

Lastly, if the piece of wooden was nailed, your face would no longer match the nails, making it impossible to see your reflection.\n6. Considering these factors, reflective wood, wood of the kind mentioned in the context, is unlikely to be nailed or burned, so options B and F do not correspond to the scenario described.\n7. Thus, choices C and D cover the requirements indicated in the context that you can see your reflection.\n8. Therefore the answer is D: carved \n9. In other words, if your face matches the size and form of the wood, you can see your reflection in it.\nSo the final answers is  D: carved\n\nInput: You're at a conference and need a business card. So what could you do? Choices:  (A) Find a friend or volunteer to make some for you (B) (C) Buy your own company cards from a local printer (D) (E) Steal some off the conference table\nOutput: 1) The context suggests that you are attending a conference, not running one so you are unlikely to have access to pre-printed business cards or contacts to make them for you.\n2) Buy your own cards is one option so you can carry them around with you, however most likely it is too expensive to carry them around with you when you only need them once so they're of no use to you.\n3) Steal is a little bit immoral so that's not a good idea either and stealing business cards is usually something that people report to you\n4) Finally, if we go back to the context, we see that you don't know anyone so it's a little bit unlikely that someone would offer to build personalized business cards for you, especially since you said you don't know the people at the conference.", "answer": "B: polished"}

This question is about whether the Pokemon cards were considered `common` or `rare`.\n4. We know from the first line that Bob thought all of his Pokemon cards were worthless.\n5. From this, we can infer that he would not have valued the cards as `common`.\n6. Therefore, the answer must be `E: irregular`.\n\nCorrect Answer : D\n1. All of the choices except `E: irregular` were mentioned as possible values for such a collection of cards.`Personal`, i.e. a card from the owner's own deck, is something Bob would definitely know about and would not have considered.`Rare`, i.e. cards that are uncommon and difficult to find, was not mentioned at all in the beginning.\n6. `Shiny` referred to a Pokemon card that has got a shiniest or best color image of that particular Pokemon card. He would have known about his own collection's shininess because he valued the collection.\n7. `Special` is an adjective usually used to talk about something unique and different, and as such would be applicable to the other four categories: `personal`, `shiny`, `rare` and `irregular`.\n8.

'To win' suggests that a crossword puzzle winner is desired, but this is not the reason why the man likes to do crossword puzzles.\n8 Furthermore, the man is retired and'mentally challenged' could be a reason for him to do crossword puzzle.

Choices:  A B D C and E\nOutput: 1 She can't fall over fast enough.\n2. The word 'thin' is implied as in not heavy or substantial, with a possibility of breaking.\n3. A thin layer of ice isn't strong enough to support someone's weight and it is prone to break and crack, which would cause someone to fall over.\n4. Even though ice isn't very heavy, an implication of thickness could still mean a large area of ice, in which falling over slowly would take a long time.\n5.

Anytime\nOutput: 1)In the context of the message asking the recipient not to disturb whoever was in there, it's most likely a request from an employee to a coworker that the door is to be left open.\n2)In this case, '9-to-5' employees typically start their workday at around 9 AM and finish at around 5 PM. So, it would be appropriate to wait for someone to leave before knocking at 5:30 PM.\n3)As 5:30 is a time when the worker would likely be leaving the office, it would be most suitable to knock at the time or shortly after.\n4)Other times that would be appropriate to knock, such as in the morning or afternoon, would be out of the office hours of 9 AM to 5 PM.\n5)Hence, the correct answer here is \"5:30 PM.\" \n6)The other choices are either times that are too early to knock or too late to knock, or are office hours that are already outside of 9AM to 5 PM.

Hence, the only option that can be chosen as the answer is E: 'Heretical'.\nSo the final answer  is E: heretical.\n\nInput: After many years, he finally made what? Choices: A: friends B: enemies C: peace D: resolution E: war\nOutput: 1:After many years, he finally reached his final destination.\n2. In the question, we can see that the person had been trying to reach the state of having friends, but after many years, it is implied that they finally made friends.\n3. This choice 'A: friends' stands out as the best option because it specifically pertains to the outcome of the person's struggles.\n4. 'Enemies' and 'peace' are also related to this context, but they are specific situations or outcomes rather than a general term.\n5. 'Resolution' also seems like a relevant answer because it is a general outcome that can pertain to many situations, but it would have not been an effective description of the desired outcome if the question asked to describe what the person achieved.\n6. The same can be said for 'war'. They may have been after a peaceful end, but the word 'war' seems too generalized.\n7. Hence option A: 'friends' is the correct answer.\nSo the final answered is A: friends\n\nInput: A good way to keep an", "answer": "B: heretical"}
{"text": "1 In a desert\n2. As suggested in the first line, \"How can a desert exist in the ocean?\", the desert being referred to is one that exists on the surface of the ocean rather than the land.\n3. Based on this, we can eliminate options A and E, as they do not have a desert or ocean mentioned respectively.\n4. The context also suggests option C, as we mentioned an ocean in one of the descriptions. Option D is also plausible, as it includes reference to both the planet and the Indian Ocean. However, the context suggests that the Indian Ocean is located in planet Earth.\n5. Therefore the best choice to answer this question is option D.\nSo the final question is D. So the final answer is D.\n\nInput: Where does a tooth decay most commonly occur? Choices:  Dentist A: gum B: cavity C: fillings D: teeth  E: mouth \nOutput: 1 The tooth decayed\n2. Option E is irrelevant to this question as we are solely concerned about \"where\" and not \"how\" a tooth decayed. \n3. We see this is supported by the given sentence, as the tooth decayed is an established fact, so we don't need to examine \"how it decayed\" to pinpoint the area it took place.\n4. We can eliminate options A, B C from the running as it has something to do with the teeth. \n5. This is because according to the question, the decay is not located in a tooth, but in the gum. \n6. Thus, there is no \"teeth\" mentioned in the description of what the mouth looks like, as it does not contain dentist or fillings. \n7. There is no mention of the tooth or mouth in the context, so option E can be eliminated here. \n8. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.", "answer": "E: earth"}

B: 3 A.L.T. 3. C: 3 A.W.O.L 4. D: 3 A.J.T. 5. E: 3 A.O.K \nOutput: 1) In this situation, Sam and Eric were not able to get along because they did not understand each other's perspectives or opinions.\n2) The '3 A.M. Club' refers to a group of people who share a similar sense of humor and timing, which is not relevant to the question at hand.\n3) '3 A.L.I.T' stands for '3 am lifestyle individual training, which is a program with rigorous military-style exercises. This would not have made Sam and Eric unable to get along.\n4) The '3 A.'J.T.' is a reference to the group Talking Heads and their album 3 A.M, which is not a reason for not getting along here.\n5) '3 A.O.M' stands for '3 american open maracas. This would not have caused conflict between Sam and Eric.\n6) The 3 A.M may mean that they were unable to meet in person during that time, which may have factored into them not getting along.\n\nSo the final answer for this question is: 3 A. 2) Because the options provided are not consistent with the context of the question, it is safe to assume that 3 A. denotes an expression of time.

Choices:  A. How much a house costs  B.  C. How much a house rents  D.  E. How much a house sells for\nOutput: 1 - The sentence mentions houses rather than rooms, suggesting that it is asking for a broader type of consideration beyond a single room's price.\n2 - If people were to think about a house instead of a room, they would consider the total rental costs, not the individual rooms.\n3 - Therefore, choice C is the best answer, as it is the most likely way to consider costs associated with a house.\n4 - The other options are all specific ways of considering a house's costs, while A (a house's cost) and B (a house's sales price) would be too narrow and might not correspond with the original question.\n5 - The rental of a room is less likely to yield a higher cost than the rent of a house as a whole.\n6 - Thus, the correct answer for this question is C.

Among the options,'relocation' only applies to moving from somewhere to somewhere else, which is not likely to result from traveling the next day.\n5. 'Sickness' is also not likely, considering that the question is asking about something that happens after a long day.\n6. The term 'fatigue' is a word that pertains to someone who gets exhausted or worn out after a lot of physical or mental activity, and 'jet lag' could be a cause of being tired after flying to a long-distance destination.\n7. Thus, the most likely result following long days of work and travel is 'jet lag'.\n8.

Choices: 1. A: by using a headset. 2. B: by hearing the 'beep'. 3. C: by looking at the screen. 4. D: by feeling the phone when it beeps. 5. E: by setting it for vibrate mode.\nOutput: 1): You can tell what is or is not on'silent mode' by listening for the 'beep' when a message arrives.\n2) The silent mode is not set by default, therefore when you first start the phone you cannot tell if it is on silent mode by looking at the screen, nor by using the headset unless the phone has not been in silent mode before.\n3) You are looking for what happens when the phone is in silent mode, which would be the lack of a beep.\n4) Once the phone is in silent then you know nothing happens.\n5) The 'beep' occurs only when the phone is set to silent mode.\n6) As for the feeling mode, you cannot touch the phone once silent mode is set so this would only be used as an option for those who had it off and felt the 'beep'.\n7) The vibrate mode is a setting, and is not related to the question on quieting the phone.\n8) If you set the phone for vibrate, you are actually choosing to receive vibrations.\n9) You are trying to find out if the phone is in silent.\n10) Thus, you can tell your phone is in'silent mode' (option E) by using any of the other features described in options 1, 2, 3, and 5.\nSo the final answers are A or E.", "answer": "D: become tired"}

So the new building is more likely to be a lab or a classroom rather than a fraternity house or a bank.\n4. And among the choices, only options D and E could be constructions of any size.\n5. Furthermore, the context that the college is where he previously studied (option A), suggests that the science building was built on campus, making option D a better choice.\n6.

It is not as easy as it sounds. Choices: A: easy B: hard C: complex D: difficult E: hard to make\nOutput: 1 Here we see that a carnival float is something that is large enough to be driven on the streets.\n2. It must also be high enough so that it can be seen from a viewers vantage point. The challenge, then, is finding a way to create something so large and so high, and that is also not hard to create.\n3. This suggests that something that is difficult to make would not be appropriate.\n4. Likewise, something that is hard to make would not be a good option. However, a car that is difficult to drive is feasible.\n5. These two options, then, are ruled out by the statement above.\n6. Among the remaining choices, hardest to make seems to fit best. A: easy, B: hard, C: complex, and D: difficult are not correct for various reasons:\n        1. Easy is not correct because A carnival float has to be large enough to be operated on the street and tall enough so it can be seen by the viewers. So, its not easy.\n        2. Hard is not correct because its not hard in sense like its hard to ride. Moreover a float is a mobile show. \n        3. Complex is also not correct as its not complex in a sense like a carnival float must have a mobile show.\n        4. Similarly D is not correct either as the float is not difficult to create.\n        5. So, the remaining valid option is E: hard to make.\n        6. So, the right answer is an E option.\n        7.

This suggests 'positive' feelings, such as a sense of accomplishment or relief.\n2) Additionally, the context suggests that this 'thing' is important, which further indicates 'positive' feelings or emotions. \n3) Based on these two points, it is likely that the question is referring to John feeling positive when he is getting the thing that is important to him.\n4) Among the options, the most appropriate choice would be 'being happy', since we are looking for a positive feeling. \n5) 'Wanting more' could relate to the excitement of achievement, but the question does not explicitly state this.\n6) Therefore, we can eliminate options A, B, and C.\n7) Option D,'stoic', may seem like a possibility because the options are all feelings and stoicism is a state of mind. However, in this context, the question is asking about John's feelings when receiving something important, not his state of mind at that time.\n8) Option E, 'headaches', would not be a suitable response, as it does not describe how John feels when he receives the thing he is getting.\n9) In summary, the answer would be E: happy.\n\nSo the final answer us E: happy", "answer": "D: being happy"}

It could involve some interaction outdoors with products, and such, but it likely deals more with interacting with customers indoors as well as dealing with inventory. It could involve interaction outdoors with goods as well as interaction indoors with customers and inventory, making the store a good choice. \n8) We can easily rule out options D: web page and E: bus for several reasons:\n9) They are outside options and options A: advertisment and B: magazine are not in-door job options, making this an incorrect choice.\n10) This leaves us with the option C: Store which he got. Since it is an option from the list of indoor possibilities, he indeed got an indoor task.\n11) The final answer choice is then clearly C: Store.\nSo the final question is C: Store\n\nInput: What are the advantages of wearing sunglasses?

A man who sings like a boy, dresses like a girl, but acts more like a boy would be more similar to a drag queen.\n2. Drag queens dress femininely and perform in shows where they impersonate women.\n3. Drag queens commonly have a more masculine identity in their private lives while performing as women.\n4. Therefore, if a man has similar characteristics to a drag queen, he would probably be a drag queen.\n5.

It seems like this person has put a ton of effort or even their whole lives into creating a thing, and now they're finally seeing it come to life.\n2. The other options are somewhat relevant: 'he did' implying that he did something related to the idea becoming reality. 'determined' is also relevant, as is 'work hard'.\n3. But only 'determined' has the potential to negate the statement: that idea would never become reality, until the creator decided things were finally going their way and determined it enough.\n4. A 'determination' could have come for many reasons, though'relax' sounds oddly out of place for someone who has spent their life working towards their dreams.\n5. So, the only one that would negate the rest of the sentence is 'determined', and the person who determined it to be reality is the person.\n6. He would say that he never would have thought that this would happen, but that he was determined to make it happen. \n7. Therefore, the answer to the question is D: determined.\nSo the finals answer is D: determined\n\nInput: Where did the author leave his shopping?

{"text": "1.\"What is a negative effect...(question)\" is an indirect question and should be read as \"How can we describe the term negative effect?\".\n2. This question is about the indirect effect of divorce on divorcing couples, and not the direct effect of divorce, which has already been given. \n3. The problem states that \"Two spouses are being divorced.\" Hence, it is assumed in the sentence that the divorce has already been initiated and is ongoing. Divorce affects spouses and their family as a whole. Any spouse, or party, being divorced will have no spouse by the end of the divorce.\n4. 'A: lot of grief' is clearly not a negative effect, and it makes no sense that a spouse who is divorced is grieving.\n5. 'B: depression' would apply to most spouses who are getting divorced.\n6. 'D: lose money' is not a relevant choice as it is not an effect felt by the divorced party themselves, but by their family.\n7. 'E: children suffer' would apply especially to children who are close to either parent after the divorce.\n8. The overall context suggests 'B: depression'.\n9. Thus, the answer is B: depression. So the final answer is B: depressed\n\nInput: When a large group of people is looking for a lost cat, how many things are they what? Choices:A: using B: searching for C: finding D: investigating\nOutput: 1.`We lost our kitty Cat', said Mr. Pinkerton.\n2.`Cat is everywhere and hard to detect', said Mrs. Pinkerton. \n3. Here, the couple mentions that Cat is lost and it is a large group of people looking for Cat. Therefore, this question is about the method, or `searching for', used in seeking Cat.\n4.`Using' is used to describe the use of a non-living object, for example, 'we are using our skills to achieve the goal'. The context suggests that Cat should be searched for and not that a search is being made of Cat.\n5. A search is the action of systematically trying to find someone or something. 'Searching for' would therefore be used to describe what is being done in the process, while'search' would describe", "answer": "E: children suffer"}

{"text": "1: James's desire to explore Mars suggests that he enjoys traveling to new places and getting to know them.\n2. To do this, James has read books, which suggests an interest in learning through reading.\n3. He has an emotional reaction to Mars, which is demonstrated by his use of the word 'love', and this feeling also extends to the concept of the 'zoo', which refers to an area where animals are kept for public display and study.\n4. The context of the question would suggest that the 'zoo' in this context is more a concept than a physical location.\n5. This would eliminate choice A ('love').\n6. Similarly, options B, C and D would also be eliminated, since none of them suggest an emotional attachment to Mars.\n7. Therefore, the only choice that would be left is E: Library, which is used to study Mars.\nSo the final question is from the question set: 3. James loves the idea of being on a space shuttle, which he prefers over other forms of transport to get to other planets.\nSo the final choice is from the question set : 3. Which option is the best substitution for E: Library?\nSo the final answer for question 4 is: Library\n\nInput:The main goal of a doctor's office is to take into account the patient's concerns about what kind of health care they need, and what they can afford.

{"text": "1) We can break this question down into three parts: 1. James was looking for a place 2. to buy bitcoins 3. He searched and found a place.\n2. The context implies James was searching for such a place to buy bit coins online.\n3. A'menu' generally refers to something involving choices or a lot of options. \n4. However, James did not find a menu containing only these options.\n5. So, we can conclude that James did not find a bar or cafe, advertisement or news.\n6. A large amount of options does not necessarily mean they are available, as in the case of the internet.\n7. So the answer for James finding a 'large menu' is most likely the internet, with option E.\n8. Therefore the answer is E: internet sites.\nSo the final  answer is E: internet\n\nInput: What is true after a 50-year-old woman, or 20% of the remaining people, is randomly sampled from a small population of 10,000 people?

The sample does not represent the full population, but it does not cover the entire population.\n3. The sample represents 50% of all people 45 year and younger, i.e. the people who are between 25-44 years old.\n4. The percentage of people younger than 50 in this population is just less than 50%, i.e. just under 5,000.\n5. So after the sample of 50 year olds is taken this means there are left 5,007 old people, of which 2,015 are between 50-69 years old.\n6.

'Ohio', as the geographic location described in the question, is not known for its villages.\n5. 'Big town' and 'Suburb' are not necessarily linked to containing villages in larger volumes.\n6.

Thus, to accurately answer the question, it is necessary to first determine where the monkey is taken.\n4. The sentence says that the monkey is taken away, away from their home.\n5. Looking at the context of the question, we can determine that the only location from which a monkey can be 'taken away' is its home. The question then is 'where is the monkey's home?'.\n6.

This is because shadows do appear on the ground especially on rainy days.\n5.'Bright light' is the opposite of where the shadow appears and is also not correct.\n6.'The 'E' can be deducted as wrong as the shadow does not need a bright light to be cast and does not appear at a bright light.\n7.'The correct answer is 'D: the ground'.\nSo the final answer in the given case is D: ground\n\nInput: John's house is under attack from birds.

{"text": "1.'Ignorance is not an excuse' means ignorance is not a valid reason to evade responsibility or avoid accountability.\n2. Here, the speaker, presumably a judge or law official, is emphasizing that ignorance is not a reason to evade accountability.\n3. The speaker is likely making this statement to show that being ignorant of the law is no defense when committing a crime. \n4. This statement is made in the context of whether ignorance will be considered an acceptable excuse for crime.\n5. So, the speaker is making an argument in favor of ignorance not being an excuse for crime. \n6. A counterargument against this claim could be that ignorance can cause people to act on uninformed beliefs, which may lead to criminal activity.\n7. Furthermore, the ignorant person may not be fully aware of the legal implications of their actions and how they can affect society.\n8. The person can also be misinformed or indoctrinated into believing certain things which may also lead them to commit a crime, in which case their ignorance would be considered a legitimate excuse.\n9. However, the speaker seems to be disagreeing with this and pointing out that ignorance is not an acceptable excuse for the crime.\n10. Looking at the choices, option B: 'learn about subject' suggests gaining knowledge about the subject that may give the ignorant individual better understanding on how to legally operate within its boundaries.\n11. However, this does not address whether or not ignorance is considered an acceptable excuse by anyone in authority.\n12.

What does this mean? What other people would the movie impact? Choices:  a)The public 2 b) The politicians 3 c)Celebrities\noutput: 1. It can be assumed that the question is asking about what part of the population the movie had an impact on.\n2. We can eliminate choices (b) and (c) because the statement specifically mentions the word \"lives\".\n3. Choice (a) is too broad; since the word \"public\" refers to all people, this is an unnecessary limitation and can be eliminated\n4. Lastly, the statement makes it evident that the movie had a strong effect on some people's lives but that it didn't impact everyone's life.\n5. This means that only some will be impacted, but the movie still had a strong effect on those whose lives were affected.\n6. Therefore, the answer should be '2: The politicians'.\nSo the final answer A: The politicians\n\nInput:Which is the most common type of vehicle seen on the roads everyday? Choices: 1. Cars 2.

The library would offer him access to books, internet, and other resources which he needs, as well as quiet spaces to get his work done.\n10) Therefore, among the options, the library, option E, would most likely be where he would spend most of his time.\nHence, the answer is E.\nSo the answer is E: library.\n\nInput: When you are going to the supermarket to do grocery shopping, where is most likely to purchase vegetables?

Choices: A: jungle B: bar C: beach D: cottage E: beach house\nOutput: 1.'They made a plan to run' suggests that they made the plan at a relatively quick or immediate rate.\n2. The word 'to' in the next part of the sentence indicates that they were running to somewhere.\n3. Then, the context makes it very clear that they were running to a beach, where the answer is either 'beach' or 'beach house'.\n4. The phrase 'beach to the' indicates that the destination is a beach, which is consistent with the context since the sentence mentions that they were running to the beach. \n5. Thus, the answer is either B or E, since the only option that combines a beach and a house is beach house.\n6. However, 'beach house' is the answer here since one option has been eliminated.\n7.

The only method of water transportation that would be classified under human powered is rowing.\n3.

'Have to sleep', 'run' are not water transportation methods but activities that require a person to sleep or run respectively.\n5. 'Let down' means to slow or gradually reduce something or 'turn away' means away from the path or course.

Therefore, the question is asking what people do in a retail store, not what they do when they are hunting for an item.\n4.

However, this is unlikely to be as efficient or fast compared to other options.\n5) Option E refers to shipped cargo on a boat, which is both costly and not a particularly quick method for transportation of small cargo.\n6) Thus, shipping small cargo by boat and by truck are options that are neither cost effective nor efficient.\n7) This suggests that the fastest, most efficient, and expensive way of transporting small cargo is airplane travel. \n8) As a result, the correct answer here is option A: airplane travel, which is both fast and expensive, and best suited for carrying small cargo.\nSo the final answers are A: Airplane \n\nInput: One advantage of public transit is that it is cheap and you need no license to drive it.

Choices:  A B C D E\nOutput: 1st question is false.\n2nd question is true.\n3. If someone is stopped payments on their credit card, it is unlikely that they will make payments on it.\n4. Therefore option A and C are false.\n5. Paying for the credit card is one of the main ways they can improve their score.\n6. Therefore, option B is true.\n7. The 2nd sentence asks what may happen to their score after payments.\n8. The answer is that it may go up.\n9. Therefore option D is false.\n10. If someone makes payments, their score will increase, even if they stopped payments.\n11. This is why their scores may go up even after they stopped making payments.\n12.

{"text": "1, Competing against others is a common activity, so the question is asking for factors that people look for when competitive.\n2. The possible motives for competing are desire to win, friendship, desire to win, rivalry and skill.\n3. Desire to win, friendship and rivalry are factors that influence competitive behavior, but they are not necessarily the desire a person has when competing against someone, as these things can be directed at oneself, rather than at someone else.\n4. A skilled person, who is good at something, may compete against others, but their skill is not a desire that they hope to experience while competing.\n5. So, the option is left with desire to win, friendship and desire to win, which is the term that people seek when competing against another person. Hence, the answer to the question is the C: desire to win.\nSo the final choice is C: desire to win\n\nInput: A lot of children want to be singers like their idols, what should they do to achieve this dream? Choices: 1: have natural talent 2: practice hard 3: ignore their parents 4: follow their idols 5: get rid of their parents\nOutput: The question asks what children want to be singes like their favorite musicians should to pursue their dream. \n1. Idols are typically famous people whom children look up to and admire.\n2. It is natural that to be like their idols, children would want to be singers.\n3. We then need to look at the options that are meant to provide guidance for children wanting to achieve their dream of being a singer, which are 'practice hard' and 'follow your idols'.\n4. These options are more related to becoming a singer, whereas wanting to be a singer can just mean admiration toward someone who is already a singer. \n5. If we look at the other two choices that contradict this line of thinking, options 'ignore your parents' and 'get rid of your parents', they show that children who want to be a singer should avoid doing those things.\n6. So, those two choices provide contradictions toward the goal of pursuing one's dream of becoming a singer. \n7. Looking at all the options, then, we cannot completely eliminate 'follow your idols', as that has not been contradicted.\n8", "answer": "A: edge"}

It implies that this view was made clear and complete using a limited color range, as opposed to a view using many colors.\n3. Thus the relevant terms to look for are 'plainness' and 'limited (color) range', which can pertain to the painting technique.\n4. Looking for these, the choices that make the most sense are 'georgia' and 'plain'.\n5. 'Georgia' relates to something being 'plain' as it suggests that the place looks that way.\n6.

It seems the questioner is implying that it is at night, and therefore, the sun is down. Therefore, it is not day time or sunset. 3. It would seem that the sun is out because it is so warm. 4. So, the other options are cloudy or asleep. \n5. If it were daytime, the sun would still be shining or a cloud would be moving across the sun causing it to get dim. \n6. So it would not be cloudy. Therefore, the option remains asleep. \n7. If the sun were not out, as it might be at sunset or sunrise, the answer would be sunrise because it is just starting the day, or sunset because it is ending the day. \n8.

Choices:  First: Clean your apartment  Second: Call the landlord  Third: Find a job  Fourth: Look for an apartment Fifth: Make new friends\nOutput: \n1. You are most likely going to move to a new place.\n2. You would probably consider moving soon as you have started planning for the move.\n3. You already know where you want to move to.\n4. You could also consider finding a job and making new friends at the same time as you are moving in a new place.\n5. If finding a job and making friends happen to take a little more time you can still move in a new place and enjoy a little vacation.\n6. Finding a job and making friends can still be done at the same time as moving to a new place. \n7. The most relevant point is that finding a job and making friend are two major life goals that you have.\n8. When these two steps are being planned one has to consider where he/she is moving to.\n9. When you are already planning to move to a new city you will have to look for an apartment in that city.\n10. When you find a job you will be required to move to the city where your office is located and so you have to find an apartment in that place.\n11. Therefore your most important task is already completed that is finding a job as it is a major part of your life that you are trying to accomplish.\n12. One might expect that one needs to find friends and an apartment but that may not be correct.\n13. One is required to make new friends only if he/she already belongs to a community and if he/she does not belong to any community he/she has already made many friends.\n14.

We also know that the word violin, which is a stringed instrument of the viol family, is the left-hand end in all the options except for option D.\n5. Therefore 'viola' is most likely to be found on option E, the string quartet. \n6. A string quartet is a group of four viol or viola instruments that generally perform music composed for this ensemble.\n7. So option E is the most sensible choice. The'string quartet' contains all the information we need to infer the choice.\n8. So we can rule B and C out and the answer is E: string quartet.\nSo the final solution is E: string quartets.", "answer": "D: orchestra"}
{"text": "1) The question is about where grapes are used.\n2) Option B is rejected since grapes have to be crushed while making wine.\n3) Option E is rejected since grapeseed oil is used for cooking, but wine is made from the grape's juice.\n4) Option D is rejected since it is not a form of use.\n5) Option A is rejected since a picnic basket would be heavy and hard to carry, unlike a plastic bag.\n6) Option E again is rejected as it is not a form or use.\n7) The options remaining are A: picnic basket and C: juice.\n8) The option that fits best in the context is A.

Choices:  C: poor organization D: poor research E: incomplete paper F: plagiarism G: missing a deadline\nOutput: 1.\"Someone's lack of preparation\" suggests that he/she failed to prepare as he/she should/did.\n2.It is clear that he/she did not do the complete work and didn't have enough time before the deadline thus they made some mistakes or did incomplete paper.\n3.Plagarism can be defined as copying work without attribution and is a form of cheating which leads to poor grade or in some cases expulsion. So, 'Plagiarism' cannot be an indicator that someone lacks preparation.\n4. Poor organisation is about keeping track of things which might indicate that someone lacks preparations.\n5. \"Poor Research\" means that the paper doesn't contain much in-depth information or contains errors which are a form of lack of preparation and which might result in lesser grade.\n6. 'Missing a deadline' indicates that the person failed to meet his/her deadline which means he/she did not prepare.\n7. These all are indicators of someone's lack of preparations and thus could be the indication that someone lacks preparing.

{"text": "1: The question asks what a warrior's primary method is in war.\n2. The word 'combat' suggests that fighting is a prominent activity for warriors.\n3. However, the question also mentions the goal of the warrior, 'to do'.\n4. This suggests that warriors do not only fight in war, but also have the intent of accomplishing other goals associated with war.\n5. Therefore the options that don't have to do with war in some way, 'kill' and 'terrible', can be eliminated.\n6. Looking at the remaining choices: 'conquer' and 'join army' seem plausible options for what a warrior would do, but they are too vague and don't deal specifically with the main goal of war: to win.\n7. Hence, the appropriate answer would be the option that is specific about the main goal of war, 'Battle opponent and win'.\n8. So, the answer is B: Battle opponent and win.\nSo the final correct answer is B: Battle Opponent and Win\n\nInput: What does 'littered with chairs' mean?

Laying eggs is a reproductive feature, but the question is about the side of the head. An egg is inside the body.\n4. Having two feet is unnecessary because humans are not amphibians.\n5. A horn is not anatomically possible because it is essentially an unusually large bone. It also requires additional flesh and muscle, which humans don't physically have.\n6. Having two ears is a simple implication.\n7. Having a head is not the same as two sides to the head.\n8. So, the answer is C: Horns.\n9. C: Two ears is not an immediate choice because it's obvious (the fact that humans have two ears).\n10. Horns require additional bones (a horn does not exist in humans).\n11.

{"text": "1 This question is about the location where James can easily find his clipboard.\n2. By analyzing the context, we can conclude that James is looking for a way to keep track of his belongings, especially important things.\n3. Option A: 'a shelf' could be a good candidate, since it's a sturdy place to store items.\n4. 'A place of work' could be considered as a reasonable answer, but it seems to lack precision since there are various places of work where people can leave items.\n5. Similarly, keeping it in 'desk', option C, has limited applicability and doesn't specify what type of desk.\n6. 'An office store' or 'an office supply store', option D, implies a particular workplace, which could be inconvenient for James as he moves around a lot.\n7. Option E: \u2018school\u2019, seems to be the most applicable since it refers to a particular type of place where clipping is a frequent activity.\n8. Furthermore, option E also has the advantage of specifying that the school location is relevant to James, which supports that the given description of him corresponds to a student.\n9. Therefore, the answer would be E: School. \nSo the final answer(s) will be E: School\n\nInput: The police had several suspects in her disappearance, including her brother, who had a history of unstable behavior and had previously been arrested for assault.

The first and third options (A and E) clearly imply that the brother is the one who is missing and thus not to be included in the group of suspects.\n3. Similarly, option B (Mental patient) cannot refer to the brother, but to the girl.\n4. Option C (criminal) can refer to the brother, as the context clearly shows that he was arrested for assault, but only referring to the brother doesn't allow us to draw that conclusion, so option D is the only one that refers to both boys. \n5. In conclusion, the correct answer is Option D: both\nSo the final answer: D: both", "answer": "C: desk"}

{"text": "1: 1. The doctor is being implied to be a trusted expert. \n2. He recommended washing hands, which in turn implies that he is promoting this practice.\n3. The doctor is being presented as someone whose recommendation cannot be disregarded. This suggests that he was asked for his opinion on an important matter.\n4. The statement suggests that the hand washing was a preventive measure.  It was to be done before doing something that could put the hand in a compromising state.\n5. This can only relate to personal care, and is not meant for other activities.\n6. So, the choices that pertain to personal care are A and E.\n7. 'Cold hands', option A, is the act of taking someone's hand, putting it in their pocket, and then pulling it back with a sense of coldness to it. This is not what the doctor recommended in the question.\n8. Hence, E is incorrect.\n9. 'Wet floor', option B, could mean to warn oneself about walking onto a floor that has been wiped of moisture. This makes sense if one is trying to walk out of a bathroom, where hands could be very wet.\n10. However, considering the context of the doctor's recommendation, and the fact that the hands are of a person already in the bathroom, such a warning would make no sense in this case.\n11. So, B is eliminated.\n12. 'Dry skin', option C, is an indication that the skin is losing the moisture it needs and needs hydration from a source. \n13. However, this has nothing to do with washing hands.\n14. 'Health', option D, is a broad subject area that covers a lot of topics. However, 'becoming healthy' does not necessarily imply that the doctor is recommending personal care or hand washing.\n15. 'Promote', option E, pertains to an advertisement. This would be necessary for a product or a service. Considering that hand washing is a personal care practice, it is unlikely for it to be sold or advertised on a wider scale.\n16. Hence, no option matches the information given. The correct answer is therefore C: Health\nSo the final answer to the question is C: Health", "answer": "C: health"}

Among these choices,'studying' is a more logical choice since a student would naturally do so to prepare for an exam and 'playing instruments' is not the most likely activity at this time. \n5. Thus, the choice'study book' is the most suitable option as it relates to the context and stands out due to the presence of a 'book' and the absence of other actions.\n6. Therefore,'study book' and'study engineering' would be the most acceptable answers since they are both closely related to the original context while keeping in mind the relevance of the overall question.", "answer": "C: play piano"}

{"text": "1) The context specifies that the question pertains to adult people.\n2. Furthermore, it is mentioned that adults are usually expected to do things.\n3. This tells us to look for actions, or a verb, that usually occur.\n4. Looking through the options, we can immediately eliminate'shake hands' as a possibility because it would not normally be associated with being an adult. \n5. 'Own property' is potentially an action taken by adults, but it is not necessarily so in all cultures. Also, this option can be combined with 'pay bills'.\n6. 'Smoking' is also not necessary an action that adults do, but it could be included with 'talking to each other' as part of a leisurely evening.\n7. The only remaining action is 'pay bills,' which only some adults are expected to do.\n8. Therefore the answer is D: smoke.\nSo the final answers is D: smoke\n\nInput: A child was a bit more excited than usual today,  so his mother took him for what? Choices: A: walk B: stroll C: hike D: amble E: jaunt\nOutput: 1: The context specifies that a child was a bit more rambunctious than usual.\n2. So, the child's mother decided to take him for what?\n3. The answer will be something less strenuous than walking, perhaps because the child couldn't handle more activity.\n4. The choices are then narrowed down to stroll, hike, and amble.\n5. Stroll is the least strenuous type of walk and doesn't really explain why it was taken. \n6. Hike could mean a leisurely stroll, but it could also mean a strenuous activity. \n7. Amble is used to describe a walk that is relaxed and casual, as opposed to fast or strenuous.\n8. So, the correct word is 'Amble',  which means, at a leisurely or unhurried pace. Children can easily tire, so walking at a leisure or unhurried pace would be just right for them.\nSo the final correct answer is B: Amble\n\nInput: What is important to consider when choosing a paint brand?

{"text": "1.'Tonight's program' is likely to refer to television programming.\n2. 'Saga' implies stories that are lengthy and epic in nature, such as classics of literature, including those that were originally told orally and were later transcribed for long-term preservation and dissemination.\n3. With this in mind, the most likely setting for such tales is a stage or a theater.\n4. The other options, concert, opera, and take class are more about music and dance that are part of theatrical performances, but a better fit in this context would be 'D: theater'.\n5.'Television' itself, in comparison, is not a long-form story in its own right.

In fact, the concert, opera, and television are all mediums in which one could watch a saga, but they are not themselves saga shows.\n7. Therefore, the answer that best complements the context of the sentence is 'D: theater', which is where the longest recorded literary works have traditionally been performed.", "answer": "B: opera"}

Choices:  C: a meal D: a party E: food\nOutput: 1: You would have 'E: food'.\n2: The context gives away the meaning of 'a party', which is a social event during which fun and games are played by a group of people.\n3: 'Lunch-time' is a specific period of time to have lunch.\n4: Therefore, there is no point having a party during lunch time because it does not make sense.\n\nSo the final choice E: food.\n\n### Instruction:\nYou are given a sentence, which is either grammatically incorrect or has a structural error\nInput: We went to the car show which had everything we need for the what? Choices: A: car show B: ride C: parade D: ride show E: trip F: tour\nOutput: 1'Car show' suggests a festival, celebration, or any display of cars.\n2'Which' refers to 'car show' and the 'we need' means that it must have all the cars of a specific type. Then, 'the what?' refers to 'the what it's called'.\n3'Ride' can refer to a car show but it makes no sense in regards to the sentence.\n4'Parade' can also stand for a car show but makes no sense in light of the context.\n5'Ride show' can also make sense as a car show, but 'Ride shows' can refer to car racing events or other such shows.\n6'Trip' is again completely irrelevant to the context and does not form a sentence.\n7'Tour' could possibly make sense - the car show could offer trips, but 'we need a car show' does not make sense. \n8So the only choice that fits the context is 'F: tour'\n\nSo the final result should be", "answer": "C: cupboard"}

We also know that the food is intended to be more interesting than what is normally served in restaurants.\n3. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that this food will be homemade.\n4. The other choices indicate that the food is to have either more or less cooked ingredients, more or less calories, more or less complicated.\n5. Since the objective is to make the food different, the additional options are unlikely. Therefore, the food will be unique because it is from the home of a friend, made at home.\n6. Therefore, the best answer is option A - not cooking it\nSo the final answer Is A not cooking it\n\nInput: He has been in the airforce for over 5 years, and what?

However, this suggestion is speculative and the context does not give any information about what kind of physical ugliness is involved.\n5. Since the options A, B, C are all related to physical beauty, they are not likely to be correct.\n6. The term 'gorgeous' is an antonym for ugly but in this case, it does not matter. The focus is on how the two individuals are being matched despite their unattractiveness. \n7. Option E fits this requirement, because knowing they're both ugly makes them both pleasing, which is a more subtle yet still correct answer.\n8.

It was a letdown has more meaning in this context than it was a disappointment, because letdown implies a feeling of dissatisfaction that can be attributed to the food, \n3. so it does not make sense for option D; it was a disappointment can be applied when food is presented badly.\n4. Option E can also be applied in this case, as being disappointed in food is not the same as being disappointed in the whole situation, so the whole context is not relevant.\n5.\nSo: The answer is B.", "answer": "C: pleasing"}

{"text": "1: The question is about the dangers of not washing your hands before eating.\n2. This suggests that there are germs and that not washing your hands would allow them to contaminate food.\n3. The options mention a lot of different things in the body.\n4. However, these options are not necessary directly associated with food. Some germs may enter the body through the mouth, but they aren't necessarily found in food. \n5. 'Spread disease' could be another consequence of contaminating food with germs, but the options do not state how germs enter the mouth. \n6. 'Ear' and'mouth' do not mention food or germs directly.\n7. This implies that germs cannot enter the ear or mouth through food, so these options are not the correct choice.\n8. The question doesn't state what body part will absorb germs after not washing.\n9. Therefore, the best choice is still option D: mouth. \n10. 'Germs' is a kind of microorganism, and food is made up of living organisms. \n11. For this reason, we can eliminate options A, B, C and E from consideration as they do not relate to the transfer of organisms from food to a specific body part.\n12. This leaves option D: mouth as the most plausible choice, as food is ingested into the body through the mouth.\n13.

{"text": "1 This question is related to emotions and how one would respond to a certain circumstance.\n2. The sentence states that a gift is being given and the person receiving it does not want to feel ungrateful or insulted. Therefore, the expectation is for them to feel the opposite- a positive, warm emotion.\n3. Among the choices, the term that best fits this criteria is'special'. \n4. A special gift is considered unique and one-of-a-kind which is why it is often appreciated a lot.\n5. A unique or rare present is also something one could feel good about, as it is a gesture of high esteem and appreciation.\n6. Receiving a 'personal' present may also be received positively, but it is not always considered rare or special.\n7. A 'personal' gift isn't necessarily rare or uncommon. So, option A is not the correct choice.\n8. 'Uncommon' is not an emotion, it is a descriptor. Option B, is technically correct since feeling 'offended' would be a strong negative emotion.\n9. Option C, means that the recipient feels insulted or belittled which is the opposite of what the question seeks. \n10.

The same goes for options C and D, which refer to negative outcomes such as an injury or imperfection.\n6. Only option E, errors, corresponds to the kind of statistic we are looking for.\n7.

Choices: 2-3 months A: three B: two C: six D: eight\nOutput: 1, This question refers to an overly ambitious timeframe for completion.\n2, Since we understand that the goal is to make a goal, we can discount the answer of B (twp months), since that doesn't really make sense.\n3) The goals would ideally depend on the amount of time they have to complete the goal.\n4, So, C (six months) is untenable as the best option\n5, So, the answer is C (six months)\nSo the final answer the overly ambitious months\n\nInput: To make an interesting dish, why would one select a seasonal ingredient? Choices: A: to use freshness B: for taste C: for health D: for quality E: for cost\nOutput: 1: To make an interesting and tasty dish, the seasonal ingredients would be more flavorful and fresh.\n2. For B and C, we can pick an important part of cooking and exclude it.\n3. For D, a seasonal ingredients can be chosen for health reasons and cost can be ignored for choice.\n4. So we are left with only A, B, and E\n5. From what we know, A means the ingredients are used for freshness. We can discard it from the answers\n6. As far as B and E are concerned, the context of the question makes clear that they are not", "answer": "A: reach tentative agreement"}
{"text": "1, The sentence implies that she made the cut many years ago, but the scars from that experience are still with her.\n2. It's clear that scars are not visible, so that rules out the choices pertaining to the visual.\n3. Thus it makes sense that she has not been able to fully heal from this traumatic experience, even though a long time passed.\n4. So the answer is one which indicates the continuing trauma of the cut felt years later. The one that corresponds to this idea is 'B: joining', which implies that the cut has not fully healed but continued to be a part of her to some degree.\n5. Therefore the answer is B: joining.\nSo the final question is B: joining\n\nInput: Which of these is the more likely destination for students to spend their Spring Break?

{"text": "1) The sentence mentions the branch that was being yelled at.\n2) We have to infer who is yelling at that branch.\n3) If it's the owner of the branch who is yelling, the idiom 'head of the branch' makes more sense than 'base of the branch'.\n4) The idiom 'finger pointing at the moon' makes the most sense when the person pointing the finger is higher or above the person or thing being pointed at.\n5) Furthermore, it's more likely that the owner of the branch would be responsible for it.\n6) Therefore, the answer must be A: owner.\nSo the final answers is A: owner\n\nInput: When was the original movie released? Choices:  [1994, 1995, 1996, 1997]  (A), (B), (C), (D), (E)\nOutput: 1: The question explicitly states that we are referring to the original movie.\n2. It is a good indicator that the original movie was released before 1997.\n3. So we only need to consider options (1)-(4), and the year can be calculated with just these few options.\n4. Among these options, only option B can fall within 1995 since the original movie was released in 1995.\n5. But the original is a remake from the Japanese version of the movie, so the timeline of remake and original movie won't be very close, if they differ.\n6. We can make a reasonable guess that the original release date is approximately the same as the original manga release date, which is in 1996 if the manga is the basis of the original movie.\n7. This option C is the most reliable guess.\n8. So answer B has been eliminated.\n9. Now, we can choose between (A) or (C). \n10. But considering (A) was a remake of the original movie released in 1974, it has a greater possibility to be a remake than the original, so (C) becomes the more reliable guess.\n11. So, we can pick the answer to be (E), the original movie released in year 1996.\nSo the final option is (A), the", "answer": "C: subordinate"}
{"text": "1: The question indicates that tennis is something in which one needs to be good. \n2. Goodness in tennis can be achieved through various means. \n3. For example, one could be good at tennis by having a tennis racket, tennis skills, a tennis court, competition, and leg power. \n4. Looking at each of the options in the question:  'Tennis racket' does not define goodness in tennis. 'Composition' does not define good at tennis either. \n5. 'Competition' and 'leg power' are part of the tennis world which may help one gain success in it, but they do not define goodness in the sport. \n6. 'Skill' comes close to defining tennis 'goodness', but is again vague, and doesn't cover all aspects pertaining to good play. \n7. So, 'Tennis skills' is an important part of being skilled at the sport. The goodness of tennis can also be attained by using tennis skills which can allow one to compete, play the sport, and maintain leg power.\n8. Thus, to be 'good' at playing tennis, one needs to have these skills as well as a competitive spirit and sufficient leg strength to maintain physical conditioning.\n9.

So, the community garden that was demolished was previously demolished.\n4. Thus, this suggests a second community garden is supposed to be built in the city, and the choice that describes this possibility is E: flowers.\n5. Hence, the answer choices can be reduced to A: wasteland, B: ocean, C: desert, and E: flowers.\n6. Looking at the context, we know that none of the four choices are acceptable alternatives for a community garden.\n7. A wasteland is an uninhabited or desolate area that is usually unproductive.\n8. So, a community garden is unlikely to be built in a wasteland.\n9. Similarly, an ocean or a desert is unable to support a community garden.\n10.

{"text": "1.'Skin was cut' could imply that there was a cut in the flesh, fat, muscle, skin, or other tissue beneath the skin when cutting an onion. This requires care to avoid contact with these body parts.\n2. Chopping an onion often involves cutting through the skin or the skin may be sliced to make pieces of onion easier to remove.\n3. Therefore the options related to'skin' are choices A and B.\n4. 'Good health' is a vague option that may have some relation with chopping onions, but it's likely not as direct as other options.\n5. 'Finger' is an option directly related to touching skin when choosing and cutting onions.\n6. 'Meat' could be associated with the skin when butchering larger and tougher cuts of meat, but it's unlikely that it would refer to the skin being cut due to the context of this question.\n7. 'Body' relates to the entire structure of a person, whereas this question focuses on a single body part.\n8. 'Own family' does not directly correspond to cutting onions, though it may have some association.\n9. Hence, the answer 'Finger' is a more direct and accurate option.\nSo the final answers are Finger:Finger.\n\nInput: The person left without telling us what?

She was what? Choices: A: full of fun B: not bored C: full of spirit D: bored E: not a bit stiff\nOutput: 1.\"Stiff\" refers to being rigid, inflexible and not moving easily. Thus, the opposite of \"stiff\" would be \"loose.\"\n2. The meaning of \"loose\" would be to be slack, undisciplined and imprecise.\n3. \"Loose\" implies that someone is capable of moving their limbs easily and freely. So, someone that is rigid, inflexibile and unable to move their limbs easily is the opposite of \"loose.\"\n4. \"Rigid\", in this context, means not able to move with freedom and ease. So, the woman in the sentence could be described as \"rigid.\"\n5.

Choices:   A: the best B: more C: fewer D: extra E: less\nOutput:  1. The company had to raise worker wages because its new factory used less.\n2. The sentence suggests that the new factory used less labor, implying that the old factory previously used what was used less.\n3. We can eliminate the choices that pertain to work conditions since those refer to factors within the factory (e.g. best, more, extra).\n4. The answer may pertain to some sort of resource, which can be related to the factory itself (e.g. technology, space, etc) or not (e.g. natural resources, materials).\n5. If you look at the remaining options, the choices that pertain directly to any factory itself are none or fewer.\n6. On the other hand, the choices that pertaing to resources are more, less or extra.\n7. However, there is no specific term that describes a factory using 'less' resources or more, or 'extra' or 'less'.\n8. 'Fewer' is the only workable choice as the word has a broader semantic field.\n9. Finally, there isn't really any correlation between a factory using fewer resources and wages having to be raised. \n10. The wage raise is for workers in the factory, and those workers don't necessarily represent the whole workforce. \n11. This means that workers may be paid a greater and more livable wage even if the factory doesn't necessarily have a reduced resource need.\n12. The answer then is B: more.\n\nSo the final answer\n\nB: more\n\nInput: He is more worried about his son's future than of his own. Which of the following is closest to an implied comparison?

It's possible that the jar contains spoiled foods and so it would be bad to place them on counters, where foods are kept.\n3. Looking at the first choice: the kitchen cupboard is for cooking-related items and so it is a good place for this type of jar.\n4. Grocery stores are places where food is bought in bulk and so it may not be a suitable choice for a jar that's just been made.\n5. Therefore the answer is B: pantry. \n6. If I had a jar which had spoiled if left out, where I would need to put it. \n6. The pantry is a good place to put the jar as it's away from the kitchen and it's large enough to store many large containers.\n7.

Choices C and D are good places to put a jar, but it's unlikely that the jar would remain unopened. \n9. The choice A: kitchen cupboard isn't so suitable for this type of jar because there's no guarantee that the jar won't open spontaneously and the contents will spoil.\n10.

Option A, 'looking good,' can also imply the same intention, but could further imply he does not want to look unpresentable in the eyes of other people.\n5.) Option D, 'handsomeness,' is very similar to A, but does not appear to be directly related to the interview.\n6.)

Therefore, the word \u2018effective\u2019 implies \u2018doing things well and using all available resources\u2019.\n2. The sentence itself hints at this by referring to a \u2018team spirit\u2019. This suggests that the members are supportive of one another, working as a whole, and focused on fulfilling a common goal.\n3. Furthermore, the word \u2018leader\u2019 hints at this as well since a 'team spirit\u2019 needs a leader to guide its members. It is likely that the chosen leader is responsible for creating and maintaining this atmosphere.\n4. \u201cGood workers\u201d, \u201cgood managers\u201d, and \u201ca leader\u201d are not necessarily essential for an effective team.\n5. \u201cCommunication\u201d is important without a \u2018team spirit\u2019 because this allows every member to know what is taking place. However, \u2018a leader\u2019 may very well be capable and present \u2018good communication\u2019 without \u2018team spirit\u2019.\n6.

As for option A(nailing) it is possible that something is added to the wood but I feel nails wouldn't fit the context.\n5. 'Eat cake' would not change the form of wood, either.\n6. Petrifying, or changing wood into stone, is possible but it would be too radical a change in a wood item's form to fit within the question.\n7.

'Together' here implies that they wanted to stay the same way they were together while being a couple.\n4. 'More long' as in more long-term suggests that they were not in a committed relationship.\n5. So, option B 'plan to marry' would be the only option that matches. \n6. All other options are not related to long-term.\n7. Hence, John and Jane wanted to 'plan to marry'.  Therefore, the answer is Plan to marry.\nSo the final is B: plan to marry\n\nInput: When a caterer makes food for a wedding, they do not cook the food. Instead, they choose which foods to where? Choices:  (a) A: serve B: serve to C: prepare D: provide E: cook\nOutput: 1: The question says 'They (here, caterers) do not cook the food, instead they choose which foods.' It suggests that the food is served to the guests.\n2. Choices A, B, and D are all ways that the food is used by the guests.\n3. The word 'cook' is not used in any of these options.\n4. The word'serving' and 'providing' both have the action of'serving' as a verb and so are a likely match to the question.\n5. Since these are the only two words that are both associated with serving the food on their own, we can eliminate all choices but A and B, because all other choices contain either'serve' or'serving'.\n6. As for 'prepared', it is related to cooking, so we can eliminate this option since the question is concerned with catering and not cooking.\n7. Hence it is possible to cook the food and it is also possible to not cook the food. So they must serve the food.\n8. Therefore the answer must be A: Serving", "answer": "B: plan to marry"}
{"text": "1.'Towed' is not a logical answer.  If a person doesn't move their car because of a parking regulation, they will be ticketed.\n2.'Accidents' is also an unlikely answer. If there's nothing wrong with the car, moving the car is not a requirement.\n3. So the logical answer to the question is probably going to be something about 'getting a ticket'.\n4. 'Driving' is not a good answer. The implication clearly is that 'not moving' while parking is mandatory.\n5. 'Getting tired' is another logical response, but is unlikely. Moving the car is a relatively easy process. If people are getting tired, that probably is the result of parking elsewhere rather than due to not moving the car in place.\n6. Thus, the logical answer is E: ticket\nSo the final answer to this practice is E: ticket\n\nInput: John was trying to get everyone to leave so he opened the window.  What did John do next?

He implies that he can be closer to home if it meant a better job, but this job is not in reach. \n4. So we are looking for a word that shows a better opportunity or reward that the job doesn't offer. \n5. From the options, we can rule out 'present' as it only shows an existing state without specifying anything better. \n6. 'Stay here' and 'come here' are essentially synonymous, implying that the better position is already here. \n7. 'Closer' suggests that moving to a slightly closer point would make it better.

Choices: \tA: there is too much sugar for the child to digest B: they disrupt concentration C: the child may not have a snack during the test D: there is more than enough sugar in the candy E: candy is too fattening\nOutput: We know that children have lower concentrations of saliva as compared to those of adults.\n1. Due to the lack of saliva in the mouth during childhood years, children take longer to get food down into the stomach, as the digestive enzymes have a longer time to be effective.\n2. In response to this problem, children absorb sugar more slowly and retain it for a longer duration of time.\n3. This means that candy can have a longer lasting effect if consumed during school exams, as the child's blood sugar levels will still be high once the candy is absorbed.\n4. This can lead to a sharp dip in the concentration levels of the child, making him or her sluggish or slow in the test, as the brain consumes glucose as a source of fuel.\n5. So, eating candy during exams is not advisable because of the effects it may have on the child's concentration.\n6.

It is clear that \"annoyance\" is the most apt choice considering the context of the question.\n5. Also, annoyance means to disturb or bother someone. Hence, \"annoyance\" can be used to describe the reaction to telling people about an embarrasment.\n6. Therefore, the appropriate answer is E: annoyance. \n7.

Choices:  a: a fenced-in yard b: baby gates c: dog whistle d: shock collar e: a locked door\nOutput: 1.'The owner is out of town', 'the dog is inside a house' and 'a dog whistle' suggest that we are discussing a home with a dog and an owner on a temporary leave.\n2. These clues help reduce our choices to 'a fenced-in yard' and'shock collars'.\n3. Though these options do not rule out any of the other options, 'a fenced- in yard' is the only option the context allows to be considered valid, because it does not mention 'a fenced- out yard' or 'a shock-collar outdoor yard'\n4. As a result, it is impossible to rule out a fenced-in-yard with a shock-collar, an option that can not be considered here because it is not mentioned in context.\n5.So, among the remaining choices, the one that is least likely to keep a dog inside the house would be the shock collar option.\n6. Thus, the answer is d: shock collar. The final answer is d: shockcollar.", "answer": "C: race track"}
{"text": "1) The context of the question indicates that expressing one's self can take a wide range of forms, from tripping in front of a crowd to sharing personal experiences and feelings to engaging in creative pursuits.\n2) This suggests that the emotions shown by people while expressing themselves can vary widely and be influenced by factors like the type of expression and the context in which it is performed.\n3) As a general rule, people express themselves in a way that reflects their emotions, values, and personality traits.\n4. Considering the options: 'Laughter' and 'Pain' are some negative emotions that could be expressed with varying intensity, as mentioned in the context of 'Suffering' and 'Embarrassment', but not necessarily through tripping in front of crowd and breaking one's leg.\n5. 'Laughter' is an especially unlikely choice as the crowd's reaction to such an event would likely be mixed, ranging from shock to sympathy to amusement.\n6. 'Communication', while important in the context of expressing oneself, wouldn't necessarily show pain or embarrassment.\n\n7. 'Cut' is a negative emotion, but if it refers specifically to the broken leg, then it is not necessarily expressed through the fall, and it's also unlikely since people would likely be focused on attending to the injury and not on expressing emotion.\n\n8. 'Bloody' could refer to the expression of pain or embarrassment, but it is more likely that people would express that emotion through words rather than through their face, if they were standing in front of a crowd.\n\n9. 'Embarrassment' is an appropriate choice as it is an emotion that commonly accompanies social interactions, and people might experience embarrassment when tripping in front of people, resulting in a face expressing or implying embarrassment. \n10.Thus, 'Embarrassment,' is the correct choice, and the answer is E: embarrassment.\n11.So the final answer is Embarrassment\n\nInput: Which of the following is a synonym of pantomime?

'C: Singing' and 'E: Orchestra' also seem unlikely from the given context.\n5. However, 'B' is an appropriate choice because a'music store' would likely contain balalaikas and may even offer rentals for such a purpose if not purchasing them exclusively.\n6.

'B: cause bleeding' implies bodily harm, but it doesn't imply the worst outcome.\n6. 'A: cause death' and 'C: fall down' are both possible results of bodily harm, but they are not the worst of the possible results.\n7. Thus, the answer is 'D: fall down,' which is the worst of the stated choices.\nSo the final outcome is D: claim insurance\n\nInput: A person's personality can affect how they react to what situation? Choices:  what is this? Choices:  a new job A: happy B: frustrated C: afraid D: angry E: excited F: relaxed\nOutput: 1) Let's define \"reaction\" as something that we do in a given situation.\n\n2. As we analyze, all the sentences except the last one contain a word indicating a possible reaction to a job.\n\n3. Thus, \"happy, frustrated, afraid, angry and excited\" can be said to represent a person's reaction to a new job.\n\n4. But \"excited\" and \"happy\" are opposites in that they portray positive and negative reactions.\n\n5. In other words, a person's reaction depends on how a new job makes them feel.\n\n6.

Looking up prices and going on a trip does not necessarily relate to crossing the street.\n9)This leads us to answer either of the remaining choices: A: Control Computer, or E: Go out. Both of these options can be used to book a vacation, although it's unlikely that a person would specifically refer to booking airfare and hotel through an online travel website as \"Controlling the Computer.\"\n10)Similarly, \"going out of town\" can refer to going on a vacation, which would mean that someone who was going out of town to go on vacation might be looking up airline and travel prices to see how much they would cost.\n11)All of this points to the right answer choice being E: Go out.\nSo the final question is E: Go out\n\nInput: What is a common term used to describe the relationship between businesses and their accounting departments?

The answers could refer to the level of care or the availability and convenience of healthcare options. \n3. The options could range from being worse to having better chances of being taken care of.\n4. So the question asks about the level of care available to a patient, while the options refer to the quality of care. \n5. Answer: F: better. Better means more suitable, which fits the context that a nurse can meet the patient's needs as well as a hospital can.  - Answer B (a worse option) would not apply. \n6. Answer D (worse option) would not apply with good reasoning. There is no reason to assume that a hospital could be worse in terms of quality of care than a nurse, and this line of thinking would lead to the wrong answer.\n7. Answer: C: better. Better means having more value or being more suitable. In this context, a patient choosing to be taken care of by a nurse over a hospital would mean choosing to receive a more suitable level of care. This option fits well with the scenario, and the correct answer is C: better", "answer": "A: swim"}

{"text": "1.'People are purposefully(intentional) harming others' suggests that the people exhibiting this trait are behaving in an intentionally harmful manner.\n2. We would not expect a trait of'stupidity' to be described as 'purposefully harming' someone.\n3. People tend to think that people showing'stupidity\" are not harmful to others because they tend to be unaware of how their actions affect others.\n4. The word'stupidity,' however, does not necessarily refer to a lack of awareness but rather inability to comprehend or think clearly to perform tasks without assistance.\n5. So, the word'stupid' may refer to a person's state of mind and how difficult it is to control that state of mind.\n6. Therefore, the term 'agressive' describes behavior that is associated with unstable or uncontrolled states of mind and so might explain the purposeful harming of others.\n7.

'blisters' is a condition of the skin, which isn't what has changed; it is merely an occurrence on the feet. \n6. 'Damage' would likely change the texture of the foot, but how does this manifest?\n7. Option 'E: locomotion' literally means the ability to move, which does not explain the change in the feet. So, it can be ruled out.  \n8. It's also unlikely that he would have 'blisters' due to walking all day. This would likely only happen after a shorter period of walking. \n9. Therefore, it seems likely that the change is 'damage' because option 'B: movement' could be used to indicate walking. \n10.

Based on the context and the definition of brief introduction, the correct answer should be D.\nSo the final choice is D: Brief introduction\n\nInput: A few workers began to work before the strike had been called, which of the following shows the workers did not have the correct understanding of their obligations? Choices: 1: They ignored the rules 7: they began work early.\nOutput: 1: Ignoring the rules shows a lack of understanding of the worker's obligations, indicating that the workers did not have an adequate grasp of their responsibilities.\n2: Starting work early is a form of breaking the rules, as it indicates that the workers do not understand what is expected of them.\n3: Failure to abide by the rules would be evidence of a lack of understanding - they do not understand what is required of them.\n4: The correct choice would be B: They began work early for the reasons stated.\nSo, the", "answer": "A: train station"}
{"text": "1. The question asks what the detective had to do all at once.\n\n2. The question also states that every little thing at the crime scene needed to be analysed\n,\n3. So, among the options we can only rule out answers A, B and C as at least one of them is redundant.\n4. The next step should be to analyse the clues.\n5. Among the answers, we can eliminate answers B and D, as \"look at\" and \"think about\" is a redundancy of the sentence.\n6. So we are left with answers A, C and E \"discovery\", \"learn new\" and \"write down\".\n7. Since the question states that the detective had to analyzes all the clues at the scene, \"discovery\" is not a plausible option as that is not an activity.\n8. Also, the sentence \"every little thing\" suggests the need to make some kind of note of the clues,so \"write down\" is incorrect. This leaves \"learn new\" as the correct answer.\n\nSo the final answer the correct answer is Learn new.\n\nInput: If you want to get a scholarship to study in the best university in town, which of these is the most difficult step to do?

Choices: A: A drilled pier system B: Cement C: Columns D: concrete E: pilings\nOutput: The text states that the new house \"had better foundations\".\n1. We are looking for what is used to construct the foundations, which are the support for the house.\n2. Therefore, we can rule out answers B, C, and E.\n3. We are left with a choice between answers A and D.\n4. While a pier system (option A) is a support for a home, it generally is not an option used in foundations. \n5. Option B: Cement, also seems like an odd choice as a foundation.\n6. That still leaves us with options A and D.\n7. Options A and D are related to the structure of foundations.\n8. It seems that option A has more specificity to the type of foundation, as it mentions using the Drilled Pier System.\n9. So, the best answer is A: A drille pier system.\n\nInput: The teacher asked the class to create what? Choices: C: an essay, D: a report, E: a thesis, F: a speech\nOutput: Looking at the options and the context, we can see that 'thesis' is a good option.\n1. A thesis is a systematic and detailed treatment of a subject.\n2. While this implies more serious research than 'an essay', 'a speech', or 'a report', that's what's required of the students in this case.\n3. Therefore 'a thesis' is the best choice.\n\nInput: This type of writing requires what writing style? Choices: A : colloquial B", "answer": "D: back and"}
{"text": "1) We know that a shower is expected when you reserve a (traveler's) room.\n2) All the other options don't sound like amenities when you reserve a room.\n3) The other options also seem fairly unrelated. \n4) This means the answer should be a verb that sounds like it describes the process of reserving a room at a hotel.\n5) So, option A is the best answer.\nSo the final result is A: gy mnasium\n\nInput:  A small, square rug may be used to cover a what?

{"text": "1.\" Stored\" in the sentence preceding the question suggests that the tent in question is already in existence.\n2. The context indicates that he is looking for a way to store it and keep it on his person.\n3. Therefore looking at the options given: camp ground and woods can't be used, since they require an actual camp ground or woods.\n4. \"Bag\" and \"backpack\" are two different forms of luggage that can be carried on person.\n5. \"Bag\" is a common alternative to a backpack; there is an implicit relationship between the two for the question since \"bag\" is a possible suggestion, with the same context as \"backpack\".\n6. The final context suggests that \"backpack\" may be a more appropriate option.\n7. So the answer that's most likely to be appropriate is backpack - E (as the context allows), and the correct answer to the sentence is B (since it allows to store the tent while camping).\nSo the final answer are: A. B. C. D. E.\n\nInput: If someone is a person, that person is? Choices: A: human B: not human C: person D: person of persons E: the only person \nOutput: 1) 'Person' is an adjective. It describes anything that is not explicitly specified. In our given question context'someone' does not refer to anything that is not specifically mentioned.\n2) 'Person' - a 'person' is a being who is 'human', in terms of our given question, 'the subject [the'someone'] is a person', therefore the answer as we can see, is Human.\nSo the final answers for the given sentence are Human.\n\nInput: What doesn't make a good judge of a good candidate?

As the context, in the question does not refer to 'Judges' directly, but to 'Person', 'popular' does not make sense at all, or any other word for that matter, with context being \"what doesn't make a [good] judge\"\n2). Neither of 'B. A person who enjoying sports' or 'D", "answer": "E: backpack"}
{"text": "1 The question asks why Lindy lived with his children instead of in a nursing facility.\n2 He didn't want to 'go where' would indicate that Lindy did not desire to live in a nursing home and the options reflect where he lived instead.\n3 So, the first thing to eliminate is A (republican party), B (old people's home), and D (park). They don't reflect the place Lindy wanted to live but instead indicate where he did not want to live.\n4 Option E(high school or college), though it doesn't explicitly explain where Lindy didn't want to live, suggests that he wasn't living in either of these places because they are not appropriate for an adult and he didn't want 'to go there.'\n5 The remaining option would be C that says 'office'.\n6 This clearly indicates that he was not living with his children in the office that he worked in, which does not make sense because the children are his children, which means he was related to them. It is more likely that his children live with him rather than another family or another employee.\n7 Therefore, the correct answer is 'C: office.'\nSo the final answer C: office\n\nInput: The man would like the woman to stop by.

Therefore,'ceremony' and 'competition' are likely to be the types of meetings for which a ceremony or convention would be appropriate. \n\n4.\n'A ceremony' is more likely than 'a competition' to be the type of meeting for which a ceremony or competition would be appropriate, as it includes more general and formal occasions than 'competitions'.\n\n5.  We can also eliminate 'd' or an interview 'because interview can be used for job meetings and these kind of meetings do not normally require ceremonies or conventions.\n\n6.

The question refers to actions that might be performed by someone who is having fun, including the possibility of laughter.\n5. Laughter is an auditory expression of enjoyment or amusement, which means it belongs to the category of possible actions.\n6. Option 'E: may laugh' is the best choice because it is a complete expression that can be true or false depending on the context, while the others are less specific.\n7.

{"text": "1 First, let's note that the question is asking why people are difficult to wait.\n2. We know from the context that the people being referred to would need to do work.\n3. Thus we can eliminate options A and B - having appointments or being late would require these people not to perform their work.\n4. There is mention of 'work' in options D and E, but again they could easily conflict with work and so can be eliminated.\n5. Option C, being late, does not account for people needing to do work, and thus is not the best answer.\n6. This leaves us with option C, which mentions time to think.\n7. There is no mention of work in this option, and so seems implausible to be the answer.\n8. The remaining choice, 'impatience', is clearly indicative of a person's inability to complete work.\n9. This means that the person is unlikely to have time to think, since that would require them to be patient.\n10. Therefore, the person is difficult to wait because of their inability to complete work due to impatience.\n11. The answer, then, is E: impatience.", "answer": "D: time consuming"}
{"text": "1. The question asks where you would get a bag after someone filled it with clothes. \n2. Since the sentence says that someone filled it with clothes, the bag should be present.\n3. Looking at the choices, Cashier makes sense as a logical choice because you would expect a place with checkout counters to have bags to put clothes in. However, we can further eliminate options A, D and E as they don't deal with a shopping bag in a specific scenario.\n4. Looking deeply at each option, we notice that B and D seem interesting. At first, we assume B will be a valid answer as it seems to imply shopping. However, bookstores don't sell clothes.\n5. That leaves us with only two choices D and B.\n6. D is not the correct answer because we can eliminate it by applying common sense. A place for shopping would have a cash counter if they sold clothes and things that can be placed in a bag.\n7. The answer is a bit too far-fetched for being the correct answer.\n8. So the correct choice is B. A Cashier is the place to go for your shopping needs whether you are looking for clothes or other products. There is even a store dedicated to clothes in a supermarket called a clothing store that can be easily found in many supermarkets.\nSo the final answers are B: cashier\n\nInput: A few new features make the product unique and more desirable.

{"text": "1.'What chore might a kid have to do after breakfast?'\n2.Chores pertain to activities or jobs that require physical work. \n3. The answer choices are all specific examples of chores.\n4. However, since we are asked to choose the chore that a kid might have to do, instead of the specific one, option 'A: drop out of school' is excluded, as it doesn't necessarily follow from the question.\n5. This leaves options B, C, D, and E. \n6. 'Ask questions' implies that the kid is already in school, and has completed their breakfast. This rules out option C.\n7. 'Read a book' doesn't entail physical activity, and is not necessarily a chore, so it's excluded. \n8. Thus, the most likely scenario is that the child would do a chore before getting on the bus.\n9. According to the context, the answer could be one of the two choices that deal with breakfast and physical labor: 'wash dishes' or 'enter school'. \n10. Since school includes physical labor, it is most likely to be chosen.\n11. Wash dishes can also be done as a chore, but is specific to only a particular meal, not breakfast specifically, and is less likely to be among other chores as well. \n12. Therefore, the answer to the question is D: wash dish.\nSo the final word is D: wash the dishes\n\nInput: 1. A ghost may choose to haunt the what? 2.

So, the holiday decorations were likely to be found somewhere around the house, as suggested by the word 'home' in the answer choices.\n4. The words 'garage', 'outside', and 'under house' do not specifically indicate a place indoors.\n5. The holiday decorations seem to be located inside the house as indicated by the word 'indoors in the given sentence.\n6. Therefore, the only choices left are 'closet', 'attic' and 'loft'.\n7. However, based on the context, an attic seems to be the most likely place where the decorations would be stored.\n8. It is a larger space, separate from ordinary rooms, and has a loft-like area in which boxes of decorations could be stored.\n9. A closet is a smaller storage space, often in a room, which is not ideal for storing a box of clothes.\n10. The given question does not specifically mention a box of clothing, so the other choices are not applicable. So, the answer in this case is option B: Attic.\nSo the final option is B: attic", "answer": "A: attic"}
{"text": "1: The question asks how one carries potatoes home.\n2: Potatoes can be purchased in many different places, including grocery stores, farmer's markets, and restaurants.\n3: However, carrying a bushel basket full of potatoes would likely require two trips, as the basket can only carry a large number of potatoes.\n4: Also, a bushel basket isn't likely to be used for the purchase of single potatoes, as bushels are used to hold large quantities of items.\n4: So, the question is asking about carrying potatoes home from a grocery store or a farmer's market, where single potatoes would be purchased.\n5: Therefore, the answers to choose from are A, B, and C, as these are the only places where single potatoes can be purchased. \n6: After eliminating the options which are not relevant, A, B, and D are options that are similar in that they're all generally used for carrying potatoes home. \n7: Out of these three, 'groceries store' (option A) refers to a large, commercial establishment likely to be found near a grocery store, whereas 'groceries bag' (option B) is the term for a plastic grocery bag that one might get from a grocery shop containing groceries or personal care items.\n8: The last remaining option (C), 'farmer's market' refers to a specialized shop that sells mainly vegetables and fruits grown locally and seasonally.\n8: Therefore, A: grocery stores fits best with the context of the sentence and with its relevance to carrying potatoes home from the grocery shop which is why the answer is A: grocery bags.\nSo the final answers is A: grocary bags\n\nInput: Why is 'porky pig' a cute character?

Choices: 1. A: Go for coffee B: Turn away and pretend you didn't notice her 2. C: Say hey D: Keep a hand on the wall 3. E: Be bold\nOutput: The question is asking for instructions when the elevator door opens, suggesting that the two people in the elevator may have romantic feelings for each other and that they may not want to be seen in that particular situation.\n1. If the woman is one's romantic interest, then the most natural instinct is to go out for coffee with her. Option A: Go for coffee.\n\n2. Option B: Turn away and act as if one didn't notice her. This may hurt someone's feelings if they were hoping to be noticed or acknowledged.\n\n3. Option C: Say hi.

Choices:  B: Absolutely not C: Not necessarily D: You don't have to E: It depends F: Sure go for it G: Of course not H: Yes you do\nOutput: 1: We know that furniture is a bought item and we know that lumber is a material that needs to be obtained and used to create furniture. \n2. 'build things' suggests that lumber will be involved in the process.\n3. So options A, B, C, D, E, F and G can be eliminated as potential answers, leaving only H: Yes, one needs to build things.\n4. The remaining options are in the negative form, so we can eliminate H as a definite positive answer and make all the other options negative (i.e., they mean something negative will happen).\n5.

Choices: \n A: neat B: tidy C: organized D: disorganized E: messy\nOutput: 1) Neatness and organization of a place requires a person with good cleaning skills: these types of people are more likely to be home organizers.\n```\n2) The home organizers are people who clean other's homes: they are more likely to be neat.\n3) Neatness is not the same as being organized or disorganized, so tidy cannot be the right choice.\n4) Neat people can be well organized or disorganized. \n5) A disorganized person is more likely to hire a cleaner to help with his/her home organization than an organized person: well organized people more likely to clean their own homes.\n6) Home organization requires skill to keep the house organized: disorganized is not a skill that is required to do such a task.\n7) An organized person can employ a home organizer to clean for them but is more likely to do it themselves: organized, on the other hand is a skill that is required for home organization.\n8) Thus, the choice to go with is organized, which is closely tied to the skillset required to be a professional home organizer.\n```\nSo the solution is Organized.", "answer": "D: carpenter's shop"}

It is not a residential area and there is no mention of a ranch. Hence, 'ranch' eliminates as an answer.\n\n3) 'Ranch', choice 'E', would be suitable in a rural or agricultural area, such as a farm or a ranch. However, it seems unnecessary to locate a shed in a farm yard or a ranch as the question does not mention why the shed would be built in those locations.\n\n4) Farm yard, choice 'D', is a specific farm-related residential area. It is not necessarily required for shed-building since the question does not refer to specifics about shed-building and does not mention why the owner would locate the shed in such a place.\n\n5) Keeping things in is most suitable for shed construction, with option 'B' being the correct choice. Sheds are generally built to store things such as tools, gardening items, and other miscellaneous items.\n\n6) Since the shed is a home improvement, it is necessary to consider the options for the location of the shed in terms of where it would be kept.\n\n7) Keeping things in, option 'B', is a relevant criterion for placement of the shed since the owner would be using the shed to store items.\n\n8) Hence, 'B' is the correct answer.\n\nSo the final answer\nInput: She told him it was a long time away, but he didn't really care.

But in this situation the camera is pointing directly at the audience, implying the person is not really looking. There's no focus on turning the head directly at someone. 7) d) \"Acknowledgement\" is an indirect, somewhat ambiguous word, and wouldn't really make sense in this context. 8) e) \"Cut Away\" is an option, but \"Look\" and \"Address\" are both specific terms that specifically apply to this situation.

'Getting drunk', for example, may refer to alcohol consumption, which would be celebratory or enjoyable in itself, but not necessarily a celebration in a broader sense.\n6. In a similar way, 'Getting refreshment' might refer to having a drink at a bar, which could definitely be part of a celebration, but it is still not a celebration in and of itself.\n7.

The options given are grilling, going to the market, bringing home fish, eating a hamburger, and making bread.\n3. These options suggest that you could relieve your hunger through food preparation.\n4. A hamburger is a land animal (although with a name that suggests seafood), indicating that the person living near the coast must primarily get their food from land.\n5. This rules out the possibility of catching fish from the sea and eating fish. \n6. The rest of the options, A-D, involve making something on your own, either by buying ingredients from a store or by using ingredients from your own garden.\n7.

The action of filling out a deposit form is an incomplete activity, since it does not yet represent the completion of all steps in the process.\n3. The person will continue with the rest of the process after they have finished the deposit form.\n4. Similarly, while the person may be impatient, or may not know what to do, they still have to do everything that is needed to complete the activity, namely fill out the deposit form. \n5. Even if the person completes the deposit form while waiting in line, this still does not represent the completion of the activity. Instead, the person must first complete the deposit form to finish the activity.\n6. So, the choice B can be thrown out.  \n7. While E mentions \"made my account number,\" this does not indicate anything related to filling out a deposit sheet, and is not relevant to answering the question.\n8. A is not wrong, but the statement implies that the person must fill out the entire deposit form, not just one part of it.

Choices: 1. A: no 2. B: no 3. C: no 4. D: yes 5. E: yes\nOutput: The question is asking us to check the condition of the grass when there is not a fire.\n1. 'As long as there is a fierce, the grass won' t grow, is there too many sea salt left to make the gras grow?'\n2. The statement is that grass will not grow as long as there is a wild fire.\n3. 'As long as' in the context of a wildfire indicates that 'too much sea salt' is the opposite of a wildfire.\n4. Hence, the grass will grow once 'there is too much sea salts.'\n5.

Awake E. Hungry F. Scared G. Thirsty H. Stuck\nOutput: 1) The statement that the boy was feeling tired gives away that he's exhausted. This is evidenced by the use of the word \"very\".\n2) This could mean he feels many different emtions, including sad, sick, angry, and happy.\n3) Exhaustion should be the main one, and the others would be considered secondary.\n4) The word \"making him feel\" implies that it resulted in a certain emotion.\n5) The word \"lifted\" can mean that anything, including sleepiness helped him move forward, but they weren't his main priority.\n6) \"Stuck\" is not a valid emotion, because it refers to when the body is stuck to something.\n7) \"Excited\" is not a valid option because it means feelings of anticipation.\n8) \"Stuck\" could mean that he is stuck in traffic and might be feeling tired.\n9) \"Warm\" does not mean the boy is warm, so this is not the case.\n10) \"Sleepy\" would most likely be the emotion because it is an appropriate description of the boy considering that he's tired.\n11) Hence, correct answer is C) A: Sleepy\nSo the final answer for A is C: Sleepy\nInput: A fisherman has traveled long distances for many years.

In a one man show, it is not necessary that the lady would challenge the other actors as she is the only actor involved in the entire performance.\n3. Hence, this does not fit the given context.\n4. Therefore, we have to eliminate A and C.\n5. 'Speak clearly' can be done by the actor as per his convenience, it is not necessarily related to the context of the show.\n6. 'Take center stage' sounds like an activity that is done during the show, but does not fit the given choice.\n7. 'Challenge' is not necessarily related to a one man show, as such a performance is not likely to be challenging in the same way as challenging two or more actors.\n8.

The choice of the word 'favors' suggests that he did some good deeds for others, implying that the favors were likely mutual to some degree.\n3.) 'Gratitude' appears as an option but would work only if the favors were for one person.\n4.) The question also states that the person was 'frustrated' for not getting anything in return for his favors.\n5.) This implies that the speaker expected some sort of appreciation in exchange for his work.\n6.) Thus, the speaker must receive gratitude from the workplace in the form of a what.\n7.) Among the options, 'let-down' implies being emotionally disappointed or rejected. This may be a possible reason for him not getting any gratitude for his favors, but it is not necessarily what he wants.\n8.) So, the options that describe 'having a gratitude/being satisfied for something' are'respect' and'satisfaction'.\n9.) Therefore, the answer is C: respect.\nSo the final result is C: Respect\n\nInput: A big house costs more money to what from renting a small house with what? Choices: A: heat, repair B: renovate, pay C: cool, insure D: cook, buy groceries E: repair, pay A\nOutput: 1: The question focuses on costs of owning and renting.\n2: Both options have two components involved to their price: heat/repair and cool/insure for owning and groceries/pay for renting.\n3: Cool and insure go together and heat and repair are also used together, so the combination must be one that involves costs for heat and repairs for owning and heat and insure or groceries and pay for renting.\n4: A combination of any two pairs of choices is not possible, but A - B covers both pairs. It is not possible that both groceries and pay and cool and insure were the same, although it could make some sense. However, it is the only choice where both repairs and heating are together, where cooling cannot be added to groceries and heat cannot be added to pay.\n5: A - B is the only combination that covers the costs", "answer": "E: gratitude"}
{"text": "1) The question is asking what the business requires of everyone entering their store.\n2) The answer options deal with things the business requires their customers to do or possess.\n3) Options A and C are not relevant because they do not mention a place of business or store.\n4) Options B and E use the term learn, which does not appear in the question.\n5) Option D uses the term hope for peace, which is a vague and abstract concept not explicitly present in the question.\n6) The requirements mentioned in the question are general, unspecific, and not limited to customers in a specific place.\n7) Therefore, the correct choice is E: do well.\nSo the final answers are E: do well\n\nInput: The business had to let go of many employees because of what? Choices: A: slow business B: lack of sales C: new laws D: rising expenses E: lack of funds\nOutput: 1: The context implies that a business has to cut costs.\n2: The business had to 'let go of many employees' - the business fired them.\n3: The options imply reasons for declining performance or revenue.\n4: Option A - slow business - and Option C - new laws - are not specific to laying off employees.\n5: Option B - lack of sales - is not specific enough.\n6: 'Rising expenses' (Option D) may also cause a business to lay off employees, but the text does not specify that this happened.\n7: Option E - lack of funds - has not been mentioned in the context at all.\n8: Therefore, the best option is Option B - lack of business.\nSo the final outcome is B", "answer": "A: wear shoes"}
{"text": "1) Here's the explanation for the problem:  The sentence \"The college kids werent known for their apartment\u2026\" suggests that the group of people under consideration are college students.\n2) The first word of the sentence after \"The college kids were..\" is the verb \"to be\" and this makes it an affirmative sentence which means that the second part of the sentence is the consequence or result of the first one.\n3) The second part of the sentence starts with a preposition which suggests the subject of the sentence. That subject is an \"apartment\". Here, since its a noun, the subject is usually indefinite hence we need a pronoun (\"it\").\n4) In order to complete the sentence, you need to figure out what the \"it\" is referring too. From the context, it makes sense that college kids can't be known for an apartment but rather for being part of it. Therefore, \"their apartment\" should be what we are talking about.\n5) Now that we know \"its\" referring to the students, their apartment would be their home.\n6) If the students are undergrads, they would likely rent an apartment and wouldn't have the luxury of furniture. Hence they would use a folding chair. This means that the answer is \"E: apartment\".\nSo the final answer in E: apartment\n\nInput: 1. He could not help but feel a pang of sadness that his friend would no longer be part of his life and he wished that he what? Choices A: were never born B: were living again C: were still there D: had not become so close E: were still there\nOutput: (1) Since the question mentions that a pang of sadnes was felt and that the friend would no longer be there and he wished that the friend were there. We can deduce that this question is about the fact that the friend wouldn't be there anymore. (2) Among the given options we can cross out 'A: were never born' and 'C: were living again' since they don't make sense with the context. (3) When we think about the answer that would correspond to our scenario, option 'E: were still there' seems relevant, because it refers to the idea that the person wants to have the friend still there. This is an ideal scenario that", "answer": "D: room"}
{"text": "1) What could you put a table into if you want the table in your house?\n2) The context of this question is that someone wants to put something into their house.\n3) They want a table for the purpose of being in their house.\n4) It can't go in a library (A), a demonstration, (B) or a football ground (D), so it must be somewhere in someone's home.\n5) Since it's indoors, it can't be a rug (E), so we can eliminate that.\n6) The remaining options are Corner (C), which is a location inside a house, and Rug (E), also located inside a house.\n7) This suggests that a person might prefer to have their table in a specific corner or in the middle of the floor, on a rug.\n8) So the correct answer is E: Rug, as the most specific answer.\nSo the final answers is E: Rug\n\nInput: What if it's an adult film? Choices:  First word is movie Second word is film?  A: adult B: non-adult C: child D: children E: grown-up\nOutput: 1: What if it'sa adult film?\n2: The question is looking at the content of the film, and specifically for whether or not it is an adult film.\n3: So this means that the adult film is the target term and the other movie, film, is a non-term.\n4: This leaves us with the options: child, children, and grown-up.\n5: The question is about whether the film is an adult film or not.\n6: So this indicates that it is unlikely to be child or grown-up, leaving child and children as options.\n7: This reduces our options to children.\n8: Since we know the term adult, we can eliminate the possibility of children as the answer to a question about an adult film.\n9: Therefore the final answer is E grown-up.", "answer": "C: corner"}
{"text": "1: James is cooking a stew, so he would need some ingredients.\n2: Among these ingredients, we can assume he is searching for a potato.\n3: A restaurant does not supply ingredients that would be required, so option B: restaurants can be ruled out. \n4: He may be cooking in a small apartment kitchen, so it's unlikely to have a root cellar where he would keep potatoes.\n5: Similarly, he can't be keeping potatoes in his pockets, as it's more unlikely to be an apartment with a kitchen than a pocket with a kitchen.\n6: A pantry has shelves that can store things like potatoes, so option E: pantry can be a choice.\n7: He is cooking a stewp, so option D: casserole is a plausible choice.\n8: The question refers to the kitchen in James' apartment, so option C: root cellar can be eliminated.\n9: He might be looking for a potato, so option A: restaurants can be rejected. \n10: Among the remaining options: \"Inside an empty jar.\" In this context, an empty jar is not a valid answer. So, \"Potato\" is the answer.\nSo the final  answer is A: potato\n\nInput: A ward has a lot of very sick patients in it.  Why is it better to be admitted in the what? Choices: A: general ward B: general surgery ward C: ICU D: emergency room E: ICU intensive care unit\nOutput: 1) In a hospital, a ward refers to a specific section of the building where all patients stay.\n2) In this question, we are looking at sick patients, so we can assume that ward has a lot many patients, and sick patients are generally admitted to an ICU, which makes the choice D: ICU more apt in the context.\n3) The word ICU stands for Intensive Care Unit and has more to do with providing acute care as compared to general care for the patients.\n4) ICU is an intensive care unit, which helps with acute care.\n5) Patients in the ICU are very sick and need more care rather than being in an ordinary ward.", "answer": "E: pantry"}
{"text": "1 The statement is saying that the temperature was increasing and changing rapidly.\n2. Since the sun is out, the temperatures could rise as much as the other options, option D - 'dropping quickly'.\n3. However, since the sun is out, it could also indicate that the sun's heat was creating a warm temperature and that the temperature would not drop to option B - 'drop to zero'.\n4. Option C- 'cool down' could refer to the change in the temperature when it goes from being hot to being cool.\n5. However, option E - 'heat up' would make more sense considering the context of sun being out and the temperature changing very rapidly.\n6. So, heating up the temperature would be the right answer.\nSo the final Answer is E: heat up\n\nInput: In the 19th century, a number of English poets wrote verse in what style? Choices: A romantic B traditional C realistic D impressionistic E symbolic\nOutput: 1 In the nineteenth century, a number of writers were writing poetry, and a group of them were writing \"verse in the Romantic form.\"\n2. \"Verse in the romantic form\" is a term that refers to a particular style of writing.\n3. In order to answer the question, we need to identify which option the writer has chosen.\n4. The choices appear to be in the following forms: C, D, E, and A.\n5. However we can eliminate option C because it is not a form.\n6. The choices are B, A, D, E, A - \"poems\"\n7. Looking at option A - \"verse\" seems to be a description of form.\n8. Option B - \"poems in the romantic form seems to be a definition of form.\n9. We can conclude that the writer meant option A - realistic poetry.\n10. Therefore, the answer to the question was \"verse in the romantic form of poetry.\nSo the final answers are B: poems and A: romantic.\n\nInput: It is true that our eyes are more sensitive to light at night, what is the best explanation?

{"text": "1) The context says that he complained of missing his deodorant.\n2) It is reasonable to assume that he would have looked in various places for it.\n3) The question asks where his wife asked him to look first after he complained of missing the deodorant.\n4) The answer must be a specific location.\n5) All the other choices are locations other than the ones that actually have the deodorant. Therefore, these should not be the answer.\n6) The only question with a specific location among the set is Choice D: \"own bathroom\".\n7) Hence, this is the answer.\nSo the final answers are D: own bathroom\n\nInput:She thought that it was inappropriate to eat in the front of a store, but she wasn't what? Choices: A: in a mood B: hungry C: in a groove D: very serious E: feeling sick\nOutput:1. The given passage says that she thought that it was inapproprate to eat in the store in front of everyone. But she wasn't feeling very serious or feeling sick. She wasn't that serious or feeling sick.\n2. So, we have to find her mood which matches.\n3. The choices are in a groove and in a mood.\n4. We can eliminate the choice in a groove as that is another phrase. The other choices are in a mood and feeling sick.\n5. Since the option feeling sick doesn't match much with the given passage,the option in a mood will be the correct option.\n6. Therefore we have to choose the option in a mood. So the answer will be the choice as in a mood. \nSo the final answer will be : in a mood\n\nInput:You might hear the terms cash and what from people in financial companies. Choices: A: finance B: bank C: investment D: loan E: capital\nOutput:1. We find that the passage talks about a cash out process and a credit line.\n2. Hence, we have to find the words which are similar to these.\n3. So we have to find out whether there is a loan or a credit line.\n4. We find that we do not choose the word loan as we need to know whether there is a credit line or not.\n5", "answer": "E: medicine chest"}
{"text": "1The sentence 'When we are thankful of getting something....' suggests that being grateful for a specific possession gives way to an action. 2. The question now asks for that specific action.3. In order to determine that action, let's look up what 'being grateful' means.4. Gratefulness is defined as a feeling of having what you need. What you really want.5. Looking at the options, we can categorise these into expressions (thank, smile) or behaviours (looking for, get more, show appreciation).6. As gratefulness indicates a sense of having what you need, that meaning can be aligned with showing appreciation.7. That's why appreciate is a correct answer for the option E.8. So, the answer is option E: appreciation. Thus, the final answer is E : appreciation.", "answer": "E: show appreciation"}
{"text": "1.. This question appears to be referring to social change as an undertaking, not as a product.\n2. That said, the question suggests that doing this requires an individual to be proactive, as opposed to reactive like a riot.\n3. So we must look for a choice that is an action rather than a result or a state.\n4. Among the options, change your clothes seems to be a very passive action. It could also be seen as a type of rebellion, which may be a component of some social activism, but it is not necessarily in line with the idea that the change must ultimately start with yourself.\n5. Social activism, option D, involves participating in actions which directly challenge the status quo and attempt to shift the world.\n6. The idea that being an activist requires starting from within suggests a more intensive involvement compared to simply voting, option B.\n7. Social change requires collective action, which is what most voting does, option B.\n8. Thus, the answers that seem to be the most viable are option D and option C.\n9. There is also the idea that, to effect change, one must be proactive and not be waiting for someone else to bring about change.\n10. So, the way that is most proactive seems to be option D or participation in social activism.\n11. Thus, the answer is D or C- social activism.\nSo the final answers are D: C social activism\n\nInput:If we want to get the best results from our study then what is likely to be the best choice of textbook based on the context?

{"text": "1.'Exhaustion','shortness of breath', 'blisters', none of them.\n2. This implies continued activity of one sort or the other since exhaustion, shortness of breath, and blisters are associated with physical activity\n3. The implication is not very clear on the relationship between blisters and any other condition, and shortness of breath may not be related to jogging, as jogging can be of short duration.\n4. The answer should be related to jogging all day as the statement specifically mentions 'jogging all day'. Moreover, other options need an event or a condition which is beyond the ability of the body to handle, as mentioned in the options given for the question statement.\n5. The correct answer choice is none of them. \n6. It is possible to be 'exhausted' or 'have a heart attack' or get 'blisters' due to several other reasons as well, and not solely due to continuous jogging.\n7. Therefore, since there are many other factors that may lead to these conditions, being 'exhausted''short of breath' or getting blisters, they should all be ruled out.\n8. So, since option None of them, is the only answer that is not related to other events, it becomes the correct answer choice. \nSo the final answer here is None of them.\n\nInput: What is a way for a team to work together to accomplish a goal? Choices:  a: get excited b: be competitive c: get on the same page d: be friends with each other e: have lots of fun\nOutput: The correct answer is get on the same page.\nThis is a tricky question. One would often assume that 'getting together' implies working together, but that's not the case, because 'getting excited' or 'being competitive' all indicate that the group of people are together, but not working together.\nLikewise, there is no implication of working together with 'being friends' or 'having lots of fun'.\nFinally, the term 'being on the same page'; suggests that people from different factions are working together in a team.\nThe idea here is to have people from different factions or groups, but be a cohesive unit.\nSo the correct answer choice is; 'get on the same page'.\n\nInput", "answer": "E: blisters"}
{"text": "1\"Southern institutions where slaves do the work\" would suggest that these are plantations.\n2. \"Southern institutions\" would almost certainly refer to the South. However, the North in America was also a slave-holding region. \n3. \"Southern\" can also imply the Caribbean, so some answers may be from Central and South America.\n4. \"Where slaves do the labour\" eliminates some other options (such as ancient rome and ancient rome), as it suggests a more 21st century location.\n5. \"Where slaves (are) doing the work.\" would be incorrect, as the phrase \"to do the work\" is used as a prepositional phrase, modifying \"slaves\". \n6. \"Institutions where slaves do the work.\" can be eliminated because \"institutions\" is being used in an incorrect manner in this phrase.\n7. \"To do the work\" would eliminate other options since it is a phrase commonly used to specify a verb. \n8. \"To do the labors\" is incorrect because \"labors\" is not the correct spelling of the word \"labor\", and the apostrophe at the end of \"labors\" indicates that it is a contraction of \"labour\".\n9. So, the only options left to consider are \"plantation\" and \"farm\".\n10. \"Farm\" is a single word and wouldn't be written with an apostrophe preceding the s, however \"Plantation\" would be written with an apostrophed \"s\", so \"Plantation\" is the correct answer.\nSo the final answers is B: plantation", "answer": "E: plantation"}

Some people might have a fear of spiders and still have a meadow, but it is possible that owning a meadow could have a negative effect on such a person.\n5 As for choice B, \"a cupboard\", in the same way, this answer is a possibility, but it is likely that such a person would be apprehensive about keeping items in a cupboard.\n6 Consider choice C, \"a shed\". A person with a fear of spiders may have difficulty owning items in this area even though it might not be related to one's home.\n7 Considering the options left, choice D, \"the mail box\", may seem like a possible answer in one sense, but it isn\u2019t.\n8 The last option, choice E, \"a cellar\", can fit into the context of someone who owns a meadows that is not a shed since they would require a cellar to store items, making this a possible answer.\n9 Additionally, this last option is a possible instance of someone who has fears of spiders who might also have a cellar at their home.\n10 Therefore, based on the context, the answer is E, \"cellar\".\nSo the final answer if E: cellar\n\nInput:A lot of people have a lot of friends on their social networking site, but are any of them trusted more than others?

{"text": "1 - The question asks about the primary duty of parents, but it's phrased vaguely.\n2. It gives no limit to their parental role and suggests it's something fundamental to being a parent.\n3. However, the answer options narrow the scope.\n4. They either allude to specific activities that parents can perform or define a role they can assume in certain circumstances.\n5. 'Speak freely' is unrelated to the role of a parent.\n6. 'Happiness of a child' could be related but it's too general.\n7. 'Control children' is what this duty does not refer to, thus ruling it out.\n8. 'Caring for children' is something that would be performed as parents, but it'd be too late and narrow. \n9. 'Schooling a child' is something a parent might do, but it doesn't have to.\n10. It also doesn't imply a primary duty, which is the only answer that fits the context.\n11. So, the answer has to be 'D: school a child' since everything else points away from it.\n12.

When you don't have any worries, then it must mean you live a happy and joyful life.\n2. This is because you do not need to think about anything that will bring you sorrow or make you upset\n3. Therefore, worries will not lead to any regrets if you don't have them.\n4. When you are in a happy and peaceful state, there will be no pain or heartache.\n5. So this is an advantage that comes from not having any worries- you live a happy and peaceful life because of it.\n6. Good life is something that everyone wants, so it's an advantage.\n7.

It's also logical that a graveyard would be built close to where people died, so they could be buried.\n4. So the options that make sense are A: Arlington, B: The Cemetery\n5. Arlington, option A, is a national cemetery and has a section specifically for military veterans.\n6. Arlington therefore has clear significance to the statement, whereas the other two options, church property and the Cemetery, do not.\n7.

{"text": "1.'How are we feeling?' suggests that we are feeling a certain way at the present.\n\n2. It also suggests that we have been feeling this way for a period of time.\n3.'I did not have rest' indicates that we do not sleep. In many cultures, rest is synonymous with sleep. Therefore, we must determine if the sentence uses the sense of rest as leisure or as sleep; whether or not we had time to do other activities (for example, work, see to our loved ones).\n4. The sentence states 'We do not have rest'. This denotes that the speaker is not feeling rested and has worked all day. This suggests that the speaker did not get sleep during the day.\n5. The speaker should feel better if they rested. This suggests that the day was filled with busy activities, exhausting the speaker. If the speaker rested, it would be a means of recovery and recharging oneself.\n6. So, the answer is D. 'We were very tired.'\nSo the final answer has to be D: we were very tired\n\nInput: We do not have rest, how are we feeling?  Choices:  A. exhausted B. lonely C. worked all day D. were very tired E. felt better\nOutput: Here we observe a few interesting things. \n1) It's a rhetorical device, where the person asks a question which is not relevant to the point the person actually wants to make. \n2) The person wants the reader or listener to think about how the person feels, even though the person doesn't. The only possible meaning of 'we do not have rest' is that the speaker doesn't have rest (not we, as a second person pronoun, but I, as a first person pronoun), which implies that the speaker is exhausted.\n3) Since the only possible meaning is obvious, 'either' or 'none of the above' should be accepted answers.\n4) 'We were very tired' has a lot of redundancy, so this should be disqualified.\n5) 'Worked all day' isn't possible, as we know that 'we do not have the rest'.\n6) We know that the sentence indicates that the speaker is tired, so 'I felt better' is redundant as we have the same information here as in the previous option.\n7", "answer": "D: were very tired"}

Moreover, they are not just at play, but they are having fun. \n2) Now they are experiencing a different mood, a need for rest, which is a contrast to the preceding activity. \n3) In the question, the kids are likely to express this mood through a 'wild ride', 'constructing','massive bear', 'playing marbles', or 'a constructing'.\n4) 'Massive bear' and 'playing marbles' have a strong connection with activity, but they don't really convey a need for rest. \n5) Similarly, 'a constructing' does not provide the required context. \n6) Thus, 'wild ride' and 'constructing' can be eliminated. \n7) 'Massive Bear' does not fit in with the tone or subject of the question. \n8) So we are left with choices between 'wild ride', and 'a wild ride'. \n9) But 'wild ride' does not really convey anything about the mood of the children and may rather suggest something unnerving. \n10) So the better option here is to select 'a wild ride'. As a result, the answer to this choice is D: a wild ride.\nSo the final answers are a) wild ride\n\nInput: They have to have the what? Choices: A: the strength to move forward B: a strong back C: a strong will D: a stronger force E: the heart\nOutput: 1.) The question is talking about a situation involving great difficulties and the need to persevere.\n2.) The word'moving forward' in the sentence implies that something forward motion is required.\n3.) So, the answer has to be A: 'the strength to move forward'. This suggests that the ability to advance requires the right level of strength.\n4.) The remaining choices are not relevant to the context or question.\n\nInput:(Some) people don't know what they are doing, they are what?

{"text": "1. A laxative can be defined as a substance that promotes bowel movements.\n2. The context indicates that a laxative is helping someone keep bowel movements regular. \n3. This implies that the bowel movements will be strong, regular, and not fragile.\n4. Choices D and E would not apply to regularity of bowel movements if a laxative was being taken.\n5. Options B and C could fit this description, but we need to eliminate the least likely answer from the list.\n6. From the context, we can tell that the laxative is helping a person keep regular bowel movements.\n7. Therefore, the answer that corresponds to this statement is C: regular, which is choice B, not choice C.\n8. Hence, the answer to the question is choice B: regular.\nSo the final answers is B: Regular.\n\nInput: A large quantity of water flowing toward a stream could cause what kind of flood? Choices:  Strong: A B Weak: C D Fragile: E F Gigantic: H \nOutput: 1.. A flood is an overabundance of water.\n2. We know from the context that people typically think of large bodies of water when they consider the possibility of a flood.\n3. There are two types of flows that may cause a flood, large and small, both of which are considered in the question.\n4. However, a gigantic flood (option G) is not characteristic of a stream, so we can remove that option from our list. \n5. Floods caused by large bodies of water would either be called 'large' (option B) or 'gigantic' (option G), and these floods would involve a large quantity of water.\n6. Flows caused by normal bodies of water are considered weak (option D).\n7. Fragile flows (option E) are likely those that are considered to be weak. \n8. The strength of floods is described by how much water is involved, and option H would be a possible explanation of a gigantic flood caused by a normal body of water.\n9. Therefore, option H: Gigantic fits best in the context and description of the question and should be the answer.\nSo the final choice is option H: Gigante", "answer": "C: regular"}
{"text": "1) When asked where a pen can be kept, there are several possible locations. \n2) These include carrying it in one's pocket, storing it in the office supply store, or asking a friend or family member if they have one they can use.\n3) The office supply store may also keep a pen as a stock item, so one could purchase a pen there if need be.\n4) A desk drawer is a convenient location for storing a pen, but it is also possible that the drawer may be locked.\n5) Keeping a pen at one's desk is less practical as it would be inconvenient to have to fish for the pen each time one needs it.\n6) Carrying a pen with with oneself through the day is also necessary as one may end up needing it while walking or traveling.\n7) City hall may also have a pen in case emergency writing is required for document purposes.\n8) Therefore, considering all possible locations, 'pocket' is the most practical and most likely choice since it ensures that one always has a pen available when needed and saves time and effort from having to look for a pen elsewhere.\n9) The other possible locations may also have pens, although their availability is not guaranteed.\n10) Finally, 'desk drawer' has the benefit of always having a pen easily accessible if one keeps a clean desk.\n11) 'Desk drawer' may also mean a small desk drawer intended to fit just one item, in which case it would have been more specific to say 'office' or 'desk.'\n\nSo, considering the most practical location that ensures that a pen is always available when it's needed, the answer is A.", "answer": "A: pocket"}

They are specific.\n6. People might chat to keep answers, but the answers aren't the reason they chat. Chatting with people is why they chat, not why they have the answers. \n7. The reason to love or have fun is presumably the answer.\n8. The word \"inspiration\" could apply to anything, so it doesn't fit.\n9. \"people\" need answers--that isn't it either.\n10.

Choices:  a: a clever plan B: a little boring c: a little amusing d: a little boring and amusing e: a little overacting\nOutput: 'a little too clever' indicates that the person or thing is too clever. One definition of 'clever' is 'being clever and intelligent as opposed to simple-minded or ordinary'. \n'Overacting' is the opposite of acting subtly.

Of the given options, the population density is most likely to indicate whether or not theater is present in a certain place by considering the choices: school, military base, opera and church.\n5. 'Military base' is the most likely because it's a restricted area. Therefore not accessible to the general public.\n6. 'Church' is the least likely because it's not a popular place to access plays or performances.\n7. The population density of an opera house is usually higher than a church, but a church has a very small target audience as opposed to larger theater places.\n8. Thus, based on logic and common sense, the answer has to be 'D: opera'. \n9. So, the answer is D.\nSo the final answers is D:opera\n\nInput: Which of the following is the shortest distance from Chicago to Kansas City?

A workplacxe (options C) or an office block (option D) could be likely places that a person leaving a space station may miss.\n6. But a space station would not provide the same view as such a structure would, therefore, these options do not apply to the situation at hand. \n7. Hence, the person would most likely miss the surface of the earth, or simply 'Earth' (option A), as he misses the house he sat in, as a space station is meant for living and working.\n8. Hence, the answer to the question is A: 'Earth' (surface of Earth).\nSo the final answer Earth.\n\nInput: A pigeon is making more than the usual amount of noise, what is likely to cause it? Choices:  noisy neighbor B: pigeon coop C: nest roommate D: bird cage E: cat\nOutput: 1.) The question asks what is likely to cause the increase in noise from a pigeon. The context seems to indicate that, normally, the pigeon is not noisy in its usual behavior. \n2. So we need to look for possible causes that make the pigeon make more noise than usual.\n3. Options A and C provide reasons as to why a pigeon may be noisy.\n4. A noisy neighbor (option A) is a potential cause for the increase in noise in the pigeon.\n5. Similarly, a nest roommate (option c) could be another plausible cause for the change in the pigeon's usual behavior.\n6. B) provides one reason as to why a pidgeon may be noisy, but doesn't necessarily provide a reason as to why the pidgeon is making more noise than usual. \n7. D and E are not relevant because they don't provide a reason as to", "answer": "C: surface of earth"}

Context suggests the answer might be related to relaxation with good things in life, admiration, or one's own home, since this has been shown to be an important motivation in choosing vacation destinations.\n3. Options A: relaxation, B: good things in live and C: admiration do not require vacations to be enjoyed.\n4. 'Own house' refers specifically to the home you own, rather than places to stay on vacation.\n5. So, the answer must be something that relates to the need for or desire for a vacation in order to be fulfilled.\n6. The best fit in such cases is to select the option that allows for the fulfilling of the need or desire.\n7. Choice E: needs money falls into this category, as it suggests a need or requirement for the funds that can be met through the proceeds of the vacation.\n8.

Additionally, the option for closet is unlikely to include shopping out of the home, which is implied in the question.\n5. Clothing purchased from a shop and a department store are also plausible choices, but department store should come before shop in the sense of the question.\n6.

John was looking for other solutions when he didn't enjoy procreate.\n3. Amongst his options, he mentioned having 'a hang-up'. This implies that he was concerned with his mental state.\n4. So we are looking for a word that means having some sort of mental or psychological issue.\n5. The options listed above could be considered. 'Orgasm' and 'cum' could both be mental or psychological issues as the terms refer to sexual acts, but 'naked' seems too trivial a condition for John's complaints.\n6. 'Wearing his birthday suit' seems to satisfy the criteria.\n7. It essentially refers to people who are without clothing. This is an unusual state for many people to be in, but it is not the case for John.\n8. Similarly, being in bed is a normal scenario for many people. Thus, John had a hang-up about not enjoying procreating while being naked.\n9. This suggests a lack of interest or unwillingness for intimate physical contact.\n10. So, the answer is choice D: In Bed\nSo the final answer 11 is D: In Bed\n\n\nInput: The man who was sitting in the corner was a doctor. He was wearing a surgical hat. He held what?

{"text": "1 and 2. From the sentence, we know that the question refers to advantages related to a competitive event.\n3. To reach an advantage position, one needs to be superior to the other competitors, but they must be relatively close to each other.\n4. This indicates that the position is determined by the abilities of the other competitors.\n5. The options for 'determination' can be ruled out because they do not specifically relate to a competitive environment (ie A: option A and option D: option D), nor do they directly relate to superiority (ie A: option B and option C: option C).\n6. Therefore, we can eliminate options from 'A: determination' and 'C: superior'.\n7. Among the remaining options, 'D: higher position' can be eliminated because it does not imply superiority per se, it simply states that a higher position means better performance, which is not always indicative of superiority.\n8. This leaves us with options 'E: skill' and 'B: upper hand'. \n9. 'Skill' does not apply only to competitive advantages, but can be relevant in general (as in, a sportsperson who has great skills).\n10. 'Upper hand', on the other hand, is a phrase referring to having an advantage, which can be advantageous in a competitive environment.\n11. So, the answer corresponds to 'B: upper hand' and 'E: skill'. Thus, the answer is B: upper hand and E: skill.\nSo the final answers are B: upper hand and\nE: skill.", "answer": "C: superior"}

Given the context, the options are all irrelevant and should be ruled out.\n5. 'Brain' and 'emotions' don't have physical manifestations either. So, the relevant options are 'physical' (Option C) and 'competence' (Option D).\n6. 'Physical' means related to physical condition; therefore, this option should be ruled out. \n7. 'Competence' means having the abilities and skills to perform well in a particular context.\n8. So, this choice refers to the potential of the person to perform physical labor. The disability is a hindrance to the person's potential, and not his physical strength. \n9. Hence, the answer which is the most appropriate fit, considering the context and the options is 'D: qualification'.\nSo the final answer would be D: qualification\n\nInput: The students were excited to finally see what?

Since there is a drought in California, it is possible that the pool cannot be refilled due regulations.\n6: The pool could also be in a school. Some schools, particularly those located in arid areas without access to fresh water sources, may have swimming pools on site to provide a recreational outlet for students and increase exposure to water safety. However, these pools may also be subject to drought regulations that limit their use or limit their access to water, which could prevent pools from being filled.\n7: Thus, the options available are California and school.\n\n8: Looking at the choices:\na. Park: parks and outdoor spaces typically do not contain swimming pools, so this is not likely an appropriate location for a swimming pool that cannot be refilled due drought regulations. \nb. First floor: if a swimming pool exists at a facility, it is unlikely that the pool is located on the first floor and cannot be refilled due the drought regulations. Pools usually require large amounts of space, so it is more likely to be located in a lower level of the building or outside. \n9: Based on the context and the three choices available, the answer must be C: Park, or the question is asking about a location where pools are not allowed.\n10: Therefore, the answer is C: park.\nSo the final answers is C: park\n\nInput: She had seen this before, she wouldn't let these creeps hurt her friend Choices:  A:\"I'll fuckin' teach you to do this\"  B:\"Don't ever mess with this bitch\" C:\"She'll beat the ever living...\"", "answer": "B: california"}

So the person is most likely to be approached by people of the same disposition or mindset.\n5. The options A and D can be disregarded because they seem too generalized.\n6. The other options refer to behaviors toward a person, which could potentially attract a lot of people: B: care and C: popularity.\n7. 'Caring about a person' is a possible answer because it indicates an emotional response that might draw others in. \n8. However, there is not sufficient evidence in the question to eliminate the other options, especially considering that some 'approachable' people may be popular.\n9. Therefore, the answer becomes a combination of two factors: popularity and care.\n10. This is best represented by options C and B, respectively.

So, firstly, the question is asking why a man would have a large hole in the belly. \n2.) Now the 2 possibilities are A and B. \n3.) Now in option B, the'man' is the man himself & the'snake' is a large snake. So the 'large hole' is that 'large snake' coming out of his belly. \n4.)

The word \"might\" gives us hints that this action might not happen in reality.\n3. \"What might a satisfied person\" is more of a question of what might satisfy the person.\n4. For example, a satisfied person might board a ship, grocery shop, cross the street or even shout at somebody.\n5. However, all of these actions might not happen. For example, you might have seen a satisfied person boarding a ship or even grocery shop.\n6. If a satisfied person goes for shopping, that person will most likely feel happy.\n7. \"Feel happy\" is not so much a satisfied person does, but a satisfied person has a tendency to feel happy.\n8. If there is a satisfied person, what he or she will feel next is \"happy\".\n9. Therefore, the one who will feel happy next is the \"satisfied person\" as he or she will be satisfied.\n10. But, this person might actually not feel happy.\n11. Only option E \"shout at\", fits this best since this action, a satisfied person might take the next.\n12.

Choices: A: a minute B: a second C: a year D: an hour E: an hour\nOutput: The context doesn't specify any units, so the answer could be any of a minute, a second, a year, or an hour.  1. The question is asking what is measured by an airplane's airspeed. 2. Airspeed refers to an airplane's speed forward through the air. 3. If the question specified that a unit is to be used, then the answer would be clear. 4. For example, if the question asked about an hour's airspeed in a year instead of a minute's airspeed, then the answer would obviously be a minute since a year is longer than a minute. 5. However, since no unit was specified, the most general answer that fits is 'A: a minute'. 6.

Looking at the given choices: 'watch film' and'read news paper' both require more energy or initiative than the user already has.\n4. This implies that he/she is in a 'lacking energy' situation and so television is the appropriate choice for such lethargy.\n5. 'play cards' and 'play chess' imply more activity and attention than what the user would be able to do during boredom. So, these are not appropriate choices.\n6. Finally,'surf net' also requires some initiative and a good understanding of the internet. Therefore, it's another not-appropriate option.\n7. So the answer must be some choice among A, B and D. Among these, D fits best, i.e. 'play cards' with the word 'play' implying more activity, and 'cards'' refers to some form of card game, which could be watched. So the best choice is D: watch tv.\nSo the final choice is D: tv\n\nInput: When you take medicine, its purpose is to _________ what?

However, based on the context of exercising, the expected result is not an immediate sensation but a long-term positive impact.\n4) If we keep this in mind, then 'become stronger', option D, and 'use energy', option E, do not appear to be the correct answers in this context.\n5)'relaxation' could be seen as a result of exercising, but the context of the exercise is mentioned in the option. So, the option does not match the context and can be dismissed.\n6) So, 'energetic','relaxation' and 'become stronger' can be grouped together and eliminated.\n7) Now just B and C are left, but 'exhaustion' is not suitable in the context as it does not appear to follow directly from exercise.\n8) Therefore, the answer is C: energetic.

Some locations where bald eagles can be safe include national parks, federal wildlife preserves and sanctuaries, and state parks.\n9. Moreover, bald eagles prefer open fields and forests over urban areas, so they may not feel safe in cities or towns. \n10. Finally, bald eagles do not prefer live in trees but prefer open spaces, so they would not be safe in dense forests.\n11.

Choices:  A D: option 1 B: better C: choice 2 E: most likely\nOutput: 1) We know the choice should always be the option that is better and will suit an individual and the task at hand.\n2. The first choice is better when there are only six available choices, because the individual can better use their resources to their advantage.\n3. The best option when there are many possible choices is also the choice that is most likely, because you have the most potential.\n4. The best choice is the 1st choice, because it is not too many choices and not too little.\n5. The second choice is not the best option because it is the 2nd choice as is often the case with many choices.\n6. If a student chooses the B choice, then they must first determine that D, option 1 is not available, and then go through the entire list one by one to determine which option would be better.\n7. If a student decides to pick A, then they can only choose between the first two options and cannot take advantage of the remaining choices.\n8. If the C choice is to pick the 2nd best option, then they can only go up to the 2nd option, which may not be the best option available.\n9. The 2nd choice is actually the best choice, because the individual who chooses 2nd is only going to the 2nd choice after eliminating the best choice (1st choice).\n10.The E choice of most likely is used to determine when there are four or five options.\n11.", "answer": "D: lap"}

{"text": "1: The play is referred to as a 'go-to' performance, so it is important and enjoyable enough to be viewed numerous times.\n2. Based on the context, the crowds can be assumed to be attendees who are there to experience the play. \n3. Attendance will be influenced by the quality and impact of the play. \n4. 'Make reservations' is not an intuitive choice, because the play is a widely-attended event, not a limited time activity with specific, reserved seating.\n5. 'Applaud' would be an expected response of an audience at the end of a performance, but we are not dealing with that. \n6. Standing to experience the performance does not directly indicate applauding as the expected response, though it might be the case.\n7. It is safe to rule out choice B: 'admire'.\n8. So, the choices that remain are 'experience', that is to enjoy the act of performing and be influenced by the performance, and'sleep', which suggests it is not of good quality to induce the audience to sleep. \n9. Since 'experience' is appropriate to describe a wide, well-attended audience experience, it is the correct choice and the answer is C: experience.\nSo the final choice is C: experience\n\nInput: The movie was playing a year ago, and yet the film still shows at regular intervals.

{"text": "1st answer 1. In this context, the term \"well educated\" is an adjective that modifies or describes a noun \"person\", so the question is basically asking: \"What is a person that is 'well educated'?\"\n2. The options that describe a person as being well educated are A, B, D, and E.\n3. However, B can be eliminated because the other options, A, D, and E, describe a person (or a student in A) who has more than just the ability to read and write.\n4. The option C can be eliminated for the same reason, and also because it is unclear what is meant by \"own house.\"\n5. The correct answer is E: meet expectations, since it is the most appropriate choice in this context, in which high levels of education are necessary for success in any occupation, and meet expectations, to \"excel\" or \"do well,\" are commonly used to describe a student performing well academically.\n6. Thus, the answer is E.\nSo the correct answer is Option E.\n\nInput: What word describes a person who can do what? Choices: A: read B: write C: teach D: edit E: compose fable\nOutput: 1) The word is a verb which means to 'invent or compose something', and would best describe a person who writes his/her own fiction and is not limited to fiction written by previous authors.\n2) The options which do not describe an inventive skill would be: [A C] \nwhich can be eliminated.\n3) The options describing writing fiction are:\n- [B] which can be eliminated, since it has already been mentioned by the author.\n- [D] which is not used as a synonym for write, as it does not describe writing one's own fiction.\n- [E] which is what the author meant when he wrote \"invent or compose something\" and is the only remaining option.\n4) Therefore, the answer would be: \"Who can write a fable\"\nSo the final answer option E is Fable.\nSo, the final answer is E.\n\nInput : When a group of baboons has moved too close to a village, what will occur?

Seeing new also suggests being open-minded and pursuing new ideas and/or activities, both of which can involve looking to the future.\n4. Fiddling refers to being distracted, which could be a sign of boredom. However, this doesn't necessarily involve getting back to work.\n5. Watching a film can be used as an activity to pass time (something to fuss about), making this an unlikely option. \n6. The remaining choices are watching film (option C) and work (option E). These both involve using time productively, and work can include boredom as a part of the cycle of activities that may occur day-to-day.\n7.

{"text": "1.\"The placement of a new dining table is an indication of one's social class, with cafeterias and parks indicating a working-class lifestyle, and formal dining rooms and houses, more upper-class\", this suggests that the answer is a formal dining room. If you were a middle class, then you wouldn't need a formal dining room as a space for dining.\n2. You would place the dining table where food is eaten, so it can fit in the formal dining rooms or where you eat food which usually is in a house, and the second choice is a house as you won't need a formal place to dine as you don't belong to the formal class.\n3. The last choice of cafeteria is probably a working class place which is where those workers who work in a cafe go for eating food, and we see that a middle class would prefer to eat at his/her house.\n4. There isn't any reason for going in the park since one can't eat where food is available and to make conversation without any noise.\n5. The question indicates that these are the choices and not more choices, therefore, the third option seems like the best choice for the new dining table.\n6.

If she feels sorry, then she would feel disappointed as she would not be pleased.\n3.

A book might be reprinted because of the original edition\u2019s rarity and demand.  In this case, the book is likely to be reprinted with new illustrations and a different format.  There are many famous editions such as The Wizard of Oz which has been reprinted many times and has different variations.

Choice E refers to someone walking, which would be unlikely for someone in a rush to come to a market early in the morning.\n5. Choice D refers to someone spending money, but this is usually not considered entering a market. \n6.

Choices: A: calling her B: texting him C: leaving a message D: phoning the taxi E: making a phone call \nOutput: 1 A logical option when someone is going to the airport is making a phone call.\n2. In this case, the context is related to going home in a taxicab, which is something less urgent than going to the airport, but more urgent than just going to the hotel.\n3. Therefore we are looking at the question in terms of the most logical option, which is a phone call.\n4. Looking through all options, only option A is related to a phone call.\n5.

{"text": "1 The question asks where one would be able to hear a 'bassoon' played in 'an unpleasing fashion'.\n2. The word 'bassoon' indicates that the bassoon is playing an unpleasing sound, not the player.\n3. Therefore we need to look for where a bassoon would be playing an unpleasing tone, not the player. \n4. We can eliminate choices B and D as they don't specify what instrument is playing an unpleasant tone.\n5. Options C and E deal with a group of instruments, where the context of the question is about hearing a single instrument.\n6. Choice A talks about 'orchestra', a collective group, so it would be a poor choice in this particular situation.\n7. This leaves us with A: baritone woodwinds. A bassoon is a woodwind instrument and 'baritone' is a type of woodwind instrument.\n8. This indicates that baritone woodwands would be the likely choice as they would be in the bassoon family and hence, we can rule out other types of woodwind instruments.\n9. The baritone woodwads would be in an ensemble or 'ensemble', not a symphony orchestra, which leads us to conclude that the answer is C: symphony.\nSo the final answe is C: symphony\n\nInput: If you go to the movies to which part of a movie would you attend to?

Choices: 0) None A: cold food B: tired legs C: thirsty D: hungry E: no pants\nOutput: 1). The question asks which of three options, cold food, tired legs, thirsty, hungry, or no pants, is least desirable.\n2). Options A, B, and C correspond to the first three stages of an event that happened to the person before the beginning of the question: cold food, tired legs and thirsty.\n3). The fourth option, hungry, is unlikely because it describes an act that is happening at the time the question was asked. (i.e. hungry people have been waiting for their food, rather than eating food. \n4). Option D matches thirsty people who are likely waiting for a drink rather than already having a drink.\n5). So, it is cold food that is least desirable at this stage.

An option that mentions 'dinner' as a response is contradictory since it refers to a meal that is often eaten at night.\n3.

The options are 'desk drawer', 'pencil case', 'cup','shelf' and 'office depot'.\n4. 'Desk drawer' and 'pencil case' are both logical places to look for more pencils, but it's possible John might have already checked these two locations first, in which case, he would have to go to 'office depot' (option E), which is the location of purchase.\n5. On the other hand, 'office depot' is clearly an option the questioner can't rule out as it serves as a broad location to purchase supplies.\n6.

Branching is the primary method by which trees grow, as it allows for a greater amount of exposed surface area and the creation of more branches.\n3. The answer choices all represent the growth of components of a tree, but do not directly refer to the branching of a tree.\n4. Choices 'E: flowers' and 'D: roots' both depict an increase in volume of a tree.\n5. Choices 'D: roots' and 'C: leaves' both depict an expansion in the surface area of a tree.\n6.

Scare contains the letter 'e' and is more likely to be confused for a sound like 'ee' when surrounded by other words without that letter.\n3. Thus: cue, que, and ure should be ruled out.\n4. Similarly, ure again contains the 'e' sound and is more likely to result in misinterpretation as 'ee'.\n5. Thus, ure should be ruled again.\n6. Finally, the correct answer should indicate a sound similar to 'ee', but with a word that is unlikely to confuse with'scare' when used.\n7. Ure satisfies these conditions.\nSo the final answers are : ure\n\nInput:What do you get when you take the temperature above 100 and subtract the temperature", "answer": "E: splats"}

James is worried about the job application, and therefore he is in the situation of having to choose between two options.\n3. There are two options, acceptance and rejection.  This means James is choosing between being accepted or rejected.\n4. 'Hope' and 'less sleep' are not relevant if James is accepted or rejected.\n5. Similarly, 'employment' is not a choice that corresponds or indicates to 'accepted' or'rejected'.\n6.

The context suggests that customers want things to be delivered straight to their doorstep, so payment methods that require customers to travel to pay for the items are not likely to be used in this setting.\n3.

'Demand satisfaction' (option B) could also be used, though it does not necessarily correspond to a particular payment method.\n5. 'Pay merchants with money' (option C) could apply to some customers who rely on physical cash and want to use this method to pay off their orders.\n6. 'Spend money' (option D) does not necessarily refer to a concrete payment method used by customers.\n7. 'Place money on counter' (option E) does not necessarily mean receiving items straight to the doorstep as requested. \n8.

Choices:  a) do it correctly b) finish it c) improve on it d) complete it e) perfect it f) understand it\nOutput: 1: By considering the question, we can determine that a good job'requires' something to be done. This implies that an 'un-good' (bad) job would'require' something.\n2. 'a), b) & c)' have been eliminated as 'complete', 'improve', & 'perfect' are already adverbial phrases meaning 'differently than how you would do it'. Choice: 'improve', as it doesn't really have a place in the context.\n3. As option: 'do it correctly', is already a verb which would be the correct answer, but the context of understanding the job would be redundant, leaving only: 'finish' and 'understand.'\n4. 'finish' has been eliminated as it does not actually explain what is required of an employee to fulfill their job.\n5. 'Understand' has been chosen as is clearly the best answer, as understanding is an imperative and necessary part", "answer": "A: mail orders"}

The dining room is located in an unspecified location, meaning that the question isn't asking where the dining room actually is, but rather where the dining room should be located.\n4. Only 'tell the hostess' (Option A) meets both requirements, and the answer is Option A: tell the host.\nSo the final solution is A: tell the host\n\nInput: I don't trust people who are on the phone for what? Choices: A: one word B: many moments C: an hour D: the whole time E: one second\nOutput: 1 One of the choices has to describe how much time a person might", "answer": "C: thinking"}
{"text": "1.A lonely man committed a suicide means that he is lonely.\n2.The man has committed suicide because he feels lonely.\n3.If the man is suffering then he would commit suicide.\n4. But the question is about lonely man then we can say that the lonely man is not suffering.\n5. Thus, we can rule out B and C.\n6. Now from the remainin options the one which has a direct relation of suicide is D. Therefore, the answer D: unhappy.\nSo the final answers is D: unhappy\n\nInput: An old woman was at the airport with a heavy suitcase, a young woman was able to carry it for her, how is the young woman able to do that? Choices A: by herself B: with others C: by leaning D: in her arms E: on her shoulder\nOutput: 1) A young woman is able to carry an old woman's suitcase. \n2) She is not by herself, as she is carrying the suitcase with others.\n3) 'On her shoulder' is not what it means. 'On shoulder' means that the suitcase is on her shoulder, not the young woman. \n4) She is carrying the suitcase by her arms.\n5) 'in her arms' is a wrong answer, the suitcase is not in her arms, it is being carried by her arms.\n6) Hence, the most logical choice is 'by her arms'. The logical, straightforward meaning explains how the young woman was able to do that.\nSo the final choice is C: by her arms\n\nInput: The newscaster's voice is mousish, why? Choices:  a: he's not speaking very loudly  b: he's not saying anything very long  c: he has a mouse-like voice  d: he's a news mouse  e: he has very long ears\nOutput: 1.) The newscaster is saying things in his voice, and it sounds like a mouse voiced something. \n2.) According to the context, the question about why the newscaster's speaking voice is mousish relates to the previous point about how the newscaster' s voice is sounding like a mouse.\n3.)

Choices:  - A: cold B: overly rich C: spicy D: sugar, E: too much\nOutput: 1 'Cold and overly rich are the two words that contradict what a person would be looking for after eating sour candy. This question is essentially asking about common causes of tummy aches. \n2 The word too much is irrelevant considering that the sour candy is most likely not the main cause due to overly rich or cold.\n3 The word 'too much' does not make sense in this context as it could simply be used to avoid any of the choices, or refer to a food intolerance that has nothing to do with what is asked for.\n4 'Too much' is also included as an example to avoid using the answer 'E: too much'\n5 The choices that are left are the three that cause tummy aches after eating sour and too much candy: hot, spicy, and sweets like sugar.\n6 The word'sugar' is often associated with desserts that are tooth-rotting or sweet and is more often consumed by mouth than after eating sour candies.\n7 Spicy food may be included in some cases but is generally not common for after eating sours.\n8 Therefore, the choices are narrowed to hot and rich.\n9 Rich, as implied by the mention of sour punch, is a very unlikely cause of a tummy ache.\n10 So, the answer that is least likely to cause the aforementioned is 'A: cold'\nSo the final answers are A: cold.", "answer": "A: do crossword puzzle"}
{"text": "1: The question is about whether something is enjoyable or not.\n2: It is suggested that people like to eat corn, so the options that are included about things that people like to do are pop, grill, can, etc.\n3: Canned implies that food would be canned.  So, the option that would be a good choice to go with the phrase 'Stay in' (something people like to do) is can.\n4: 'Watch movies' is an activity that people would like to do.\n5: 'Eat corn' is another activity that people would want to do.\n6: As well, grilled is an activity that many people like to eat, and grilled corn is enjoyable.\n7: Therefore, 'canned' is the best fit for the question.\nSo the final correct answers are C: canned and E: eat corn\n\nInput: Which of these would be considered to be a 'fake' brand? Choices:  M: Nike B: Adidas C: Lacoste D: Tiffany & co E: Louis Vuitton\nOutput: 1 The question asks which of the brands provided is a fake?\n2. Looking at what we know, we know that brands M and E are the real brands.\n3. The others are fake brands, so we have to choose the one that is not a real brand.\n4. The first brand that we have to eliminate from the options is Louis Vuitton. It is obviously not a fake brand.\n5. Of the remaining 3 options, we can eliminate Adidas because it is a real brand. So we are left with 'M: Nike B: Lacoste C: Tiffany'.\n6. Tiffany's name was used as a fake brand during World War II to deceive the public, so it is not a real brand and it would fit this question.\n7. Therefore, the correct answer is 'C: Tiffany & Co'.\nSo the final correct answer is C: Tiffany & company\n\nInput: In a race of 6 people, the winner is who?

A jail has the potential to house inmates, but it\u2019s more likely to house them than a bar or an internet cafe - not a build site.\u201d\n3. The question and the options have the word \u2018legs\u2019 and \u2018bar\u2019 in them. The first one is used to refer to the supporting parts of a stool and the second is used to refer to a building that you enter, drink alcohol, and leave again.\n4. The first option talks about the jail, which isn\u2019t the most likely place that legs can be built. Similarly, the bar, internet caf\u00e9 and blacksmith\u2019s shop aren\u2019t the type of places that legs are built. \n5. The only option that talks about a place where three standard length legs are built are \u2018building\u2019. This is a place where leg of stool is built.\n6.

{"text": "1..The question is about what students are trying to do.\n2. There are several phrases that indicate what a student should be doing, either from their study habits, or their focus.\n3. \"Students try to do philosophy,\" \"students are always aiming to become adults,\" \"students just like to ask more and more questions,\" and \"students like studying together,\" are all ways of describing what they should be doing.\n4. These options do not match with the context provided by the sample sentence - \"How many students will need a laptop?\" - which suggests the topic of the sentence is about laptops or computers.\n5. A laptop is a tool that can help students in their studies, and thus, we expect them to use it. \n6. So, the correct choice should correspond more with the activity that should be done with a computer. \n7. Among the options, the activity that best describes a computer is \"further education\" - studying and learning new things with a computer -, so we can eliminate B, C, D and E.\n8. Thus, A is the best answer, because it matches well what students should be doing with their laptop to learn more things.\nSo the final choice is A: study philosophy\n\nInput: What is the difference between these two groups of objects? Choices:  C: two objects per group D: two objects per set\nOutput: 1...What is the difference between the two groups given to us, in this case, two pairs of objects?\n2.

The group about the number 2 is made up of a set of objects, while the group about the number one represents multiple objects.\n4. As such, choice C, representing two objects per group, is the most correct answer. \n5. Therefore, the answer option is C: two objects per set.\nSo the final option is C: two object per set\n\nInput: The boy was looking for ___, as far as he knew.

{"text": "1..Screwing a chain ring onto something fixes it.\n2. The sentence implies that the chain ring needs to be fastened onto something, which we assume to be a motorcycle.\n3. Once the chain ring is secured on the motorcycle, it becomes a fixed part of the object that it was attached to.\n4. Among the options, it is clear that 'E: motorcycle' does not indicate the fixing of an object, but rather identifies the object that is being fastened.\n5. 'A: necklace', 'B: wall outlet fixtures', and 'D: computer' also do not suggest a fixing, only an installation.\n6. The only choice that would have worked for this context is 'C: tool box'.\n7. In this case, once a chain is attached to a toolbox, it remains fixed to that container or toolbox.\n8.

{"text": "1.' Automatic doors' is an indication of modern technology in a building.\n2. 'Light sensors' showcase that the building is designed to optimize energy efficiency.\n3. Finally, 'the garage' refers to a single, standalone structure that is a part of a house, but does not qualify as a house itself.\n4. Based on these facts, we can conclude that the house has more than just a garage, it has modern amenities and is energy-efficient.\n5. This puts us in the realm of modern houses.\n6. However, the context of the question indicates that it is the garage that had these features and not the house as a whole.\n7. As mentioned, the garage cannot possibly be a house, or a structure that contains a house. This means that the question is asking about the structure and its features, rather than the house as a whole, implying there were other features available that didn't belong to the house itself.\n8. The options available are, then:\n   a) Modern house that belongs to a neighborhood or a community\n   b) Townhouse, indicating multiple apartments built closely together\n   c) Modern apartment building, with its own unique, distinct features\n9. From these options, 'apartment building' stands out as an area where modern, automated features of energy conservation are likely to be found. \n10. Hence, the answer must be 'C: Townhouse'.\nSo the final answer  is C: Townhouse", "answer": "A: modern house"}

With the information available, there's no other choice that fits the context better than \"at home\".\n5. Hence, the answer here is C:at home.\nSo the finalanswer is C:at home\n\nInput: He tried to get the information, but unfortunately did not come away with any solid conclusions. Choices:  A B C D E\nOutput: 1:\"He tried to get the information\" seems to suggest he tried but did not succeed, which then leads to \"but unfortunately he did not come away with \nany solid conclusions.\" \n2. As a result, the only choice we can look at next is 'no conclusions'. This phrase would suggest he did not come away without any solid conclusions, even if the attempt proved unsuccessful.\n3.

We know the book is on a table and that the table is on a chair:\nOn the left does not make sense in this context as the boy is sitting. So, we remove On the left as an option.\n2. We also know the table is on a specific side of the chair, so we further eliminate the choice On the left as well.\n3. We know the book needs to be on top of a specific object, so we rule out on top off.\n4. So the final choices are On the left or On top of. \n5. On the left does not make logical sense as it does not align", "answer": "C: at home"}

These are all distinct possibilities, but none of them can be ruled out as being likely to contain the magazines.\n5. The 'table' can be eliminated, if we consider that homeowners do not keep books on tables.\n6. So the options left are a 'bookstore' and a 'library'.\n7. These could all be places where magazines might be kept, but we have to remember that the question is asking for a person's collection.\n8. A 'bookstore' is not likely to be a place where individuals store their personal belongings, making that option unlikely.\n9. Therefore, the choice left is a 'library', which could be a place where magazines might conceivably be stored.\n10. However, this is still not the best answer, because the question is asking for'most people', who are kept separately as a group of the question.\n11. Hence, the best answer is 'library'.\nSo the final answer to our question is E: library.\n\nInput:What do you call a group of whales? Choices: 1. A: pod 2. B: school 3.

When a small number of whales are in a group together, it is referred to as a pod. This answer can be eliminated because the question is asking about a group of whales.\n3. 'group of whales' can be narrowed to simply 'group' because there is a word that refers exclusively to whales.\n4. A 'whale family tree' is an alternate way of referring to a group of whales, but it is not mentioned in the options.\n5. 'herd' can be eliminated because of the context of the question.\n6.

But option D (huge) is so vague that it could apply to any big building, implying a lack of specificity regarding the size or scope of the Empire State Building.\n4. Option E (tall) has enough specificity to apply to the Empire State Building and it is in fact the tallest building in New York and the second tallest building in the United States.\n5.

{"text": "1) The question asks why the husband in the scenario is dismissive.\n2) The husband dismisses the idea of the uptick in the number of accidents, because accidents happen quite a lot.\n3) The context tells us that she was getting worked up, which lets us rule out \"accidents happen to people\" as option A \"accidents hurt people\" as option B or \"accidents happen anytime\" as option C.\n4) We know that option D \"accidents happen often\" can't be correct because the husband still says \"accidents happen,\" implying that it's not specific to any time of year.\n5) So, we're left with two options: \"accidents happen anywhere\" and \"accidents happen to anywhere\".\n6) \"accidents happen to everywhere\" is too vague in the sentence, whereas \"accidents happen to anytime\" can still be correct, but we know the husband said it's not specific.\n7) It's much more likely that the husband said the accidents happen to \"anywhere\", as this is more specific than \"anytime.\"\n8) \"accidents happen anywhere,\" as opposed to only \"to anywhere\" would also be a more direct contradiction to the lady's worry about their specific location and more likely to raise the husband's eyebrows in disagreement with the lady.\n9) So the correct choice is D: Happen Anywhere, because it's the most likely choice for the husband's statement and because it's more of a direct contradiction to the lady.\n\nSo the final answer to: The lady was getting worked up - husband is dismissive - uptick in acc - is -? - what Choices:  A) B) C) D) E) -> D: happen anywhere\n\nInput: \"That's because his family has so much stuff they don't use, which I find really wasteful,\" \"You use just about everything there, but you can't have any decor,\" she said. \"So it's hard to pick what to hang in there, and I have a hard time storing everything where I can find it.\"  What does that suggest?

Options 'Ignoring', 'being rude', 'disparagement' and 'contumely' could refer to being negative in nature, but do not seem to represent the same action or feeling as the'respect' for Jill by John in the question.\n4. Option E, 'uncertainty', seems to refer to a specific feeling that may relate to Jill, but would not indicate why it was more prominent with certain people who do not respect her.\n5. Options B, C and D seem to be the most likely candidates as they all suggest that Jill faced a response of displeasure, as suggested by both the context of \"a lot of respect\" for Jill and the description of the action of 'facing' something.\n6. Choice B, 'ignoring' seems to imply avoiding consideration of her altogether, which does not match the level of respect expected.\n7. Choice C, 'being rude' refers to an action, and does not specify what it referred to.\n8.

The word 'heart,' when isolated, suggests that the patient is facing heart problems. \n4) The options can be removed by first considering the patient. As an old time doctor, a doctor back then, there is a high probability that the patient of old age has more than heart problems, which means he must be struggling with multiple health problems. \n5) From here, it's possible to determine what treatment might have been considered effective for a patient this doctor was treating. There have been numerous cures and experiments with medicine throughout history, which means'study medicine' is not possible.\n6) Heart transplant is a form of surgery, but the question doesn't offer sufficient details to determine whether the option is applicable or not.\n7) As it is not obvious if the heart problem was a result of a surgery, the doctor could instead simply try to distance himself from the patient.\n8) Therefore, 'distancing' is the correct answer\nSo the final answer to the question is B: distance himself\n\nInput: Someone trying to lose weight is probably going to be a what?

Chooses:  A: complete the paper's introduction B: write the conclusion C: compose thesis D: complete bibliography E: write report\nOutput: 1: In this context the meaning of 'class' is clearly a school class. This means that one would be writing the paper to get a good grade rather than for any other reason.\n2. In this context of a class being required/asked to do something for grading it is not likely that 'homework' relates directly to a paper to get a grade because one wouldn't be doing a paper for homework, unless it was assigned for homework. But then it wouldn't be homework.\n3. Option A: complete the paper introduction refers to the introduction part of the paper and is not a part that is required to write.\n4. Option B: write the conclusion does not have a good match to the wording in the question.\n5.

She noted that the parents of today's college students face what? Choices: (1) B: fewer obstacles (2) D: new opportunities (3) E: different concerns (4) E: multiple challenges\nOutput: 1.) We know that the author thought of the problem of paying for college to have some degree of difficulty (complex).\n2.) The challenge seems to have multiple obstacles. Hence, it can't be a single obstacle. \n3.) Since the author also thought that the situation is different, we know that the problem with paying for college is different than what it used to be.\n4.) There are many different challenges associated with paying for university. Considering the author's analysis, we can eliminate options B and D (fewer obstacles and new opportunities).\n5.) Option E (multiple challenges) describes the problem with paying college tuition perfectly, so the answer is E: different concerns.\n\nInput: A farmer feeds his cows.

In the context of the question, there may be an issue with a feeling of \"love\" being described in a negative manner.\n4. So to determine the correct answer we need to distinguish between love and feelings of love that may be described negatively.\n5. The question says love as everyone feels it, which suggests love may not be a negative concept.\n6. The alternatives B & C, being wrong & last can be ruled out since love isn't wrong or permanent.\n7. Option, D, can be ruled out because painful feelings are not synonymous with love.\n8. The question, \"when everyone feels it\" can't relate to love being blind (E), because that would mean love is something that can't be detected or understood.\n9. \"When everyone feels it\" can be interpreted as \"when the feeling of love is universal.\" This suggests that love is not blind as option (E) implies.\n10.

A \"concerto for clarinet\" is a piece of music arranged for solo clarinet with an orchestra, which will provide accompaniment and create a symphony.\n2.

Therefore, the choice that most appropriately indicates why they are not listening to music is due to boredom, which is choice B.\n7. \"Relaxation\" is also a valid factor mentioned in the question, which can contribute to boredom in a short time, but in this scenario, it seems to be happening after the person started to listen to music. In the end, B still seems to be the most specific response to the question, indicating that the answer is choice B: relaxation. \nSo the final answer  is B: relaxation\n\nInput: She got what she _____ at the thrift shop.

{"text": "1.. The question is asking where you would stand in a line in order to need a coat (since it is cold).\n2. The answer will be one of the choices in the question, so we can eliminate options that refer to non-time-dependent scenarios.\n3. Amongst the choices, we find the phrase 'at noon' in only two: in the answer B: the bank, and option D: the post office.\n4. The bank closes at noon on all business days (unless it also sells coats, in which case, it would need to be closed at an exceptional time like 12:15 P.M.)\n5. Thus, we can rule out option B.\n6. The post office is a public place, so it would remain open even during bad weather in the middle of the day.\n7. Therefore, we can eliminate option D. Hence the answer is B: the bank.\nSo the final Answer is B: the bank\n\nInput: A person who had been a slave all their life died. They were a child when they were what? Choices: A: sold B: rescued C: freed D: freed and rescued E: acquired as a child\nOutput: The question asks for the adjective that corresponds to the word \"acquired\" which would be suitable to be applied to the answer choice \"a person.\" \n1. A person that had been a slave all of their life died. The question asks when this person was acquired.\n2. Given the first hint, the question is asking when or how the person was acquired.\n3. The options \"sold,\" \"rescued,\" and \"freed\" do not adequately explain the time or manner of the person being acquired.\n4. The only option that describes how the person was acquired is \"freed and rescued,\" thus, we can eliminate options A, B and C.\n5. The word \"rescue\" suggests that the person was kidnapped and held against their will. This seems likely if the person was a child at the time of acquisition. \n6. If the person was rescued, it is likely that they were acquired as a child.\n7. Alternatively, \"freed\" implies that someone decided the person was not property worthy of a transaction. This also seems likely for a child.\n8. Thus,", "answer": "E: bus stop"}

{"text": "1, Ali would tell to sell products and choose ali if he bumps into someone walking. He would ask ali to keep a slow pace while walking down the street.\n2. Ali is an Asiatic elephant tusker, known for its size and strength, which makes it an imposing figure. Therefore, someone might be wary of bumping into an elephant while walking.\n3. If someone is nervous about bumping into a large animal, they could tell this person to'sell products'. It would be logical for someone to buy some products if their life or physical safety was threatened by the bump they might experience.\n4. On the other hand, if someone is concerned about bumping into someone in an unsafe manner, they would tell that person to slow down. Since bumping into someone can be dangerous, telling this person to slow down would provide them some sense of security.\n5. Furthermore, the question says that Ali would tell the person he bumped into to sell products. The only animal whose name starts with the letter 'A' is  'Ali'. \n6. Therefore, Ali would be the answer. Therefore, the answer here would be that Ali would use'sell products' as a way of telling the person he bump into while walking to slow down his movements.\nSo the final answers is :Ali will tell to sell products.\n\nInput: Where can you put your laptop to ensure that it is safe from theft?

Choices:  B: at a garage sale C: sporting good store D: at a flea market E: at the cottage\nOutput: 1) The question is all about where you can get good deals on hiking boots.\n2) At flea markets, you don't usually get a lot of value for your money unlike in a sporting goods store, but there's always a chance of stumbling on a bargain.\n3) The cottage might have some used hiking boots at good prices, if they have some.\n4) At yard sales, you may be able to get some good, second hand, pairs for very cheap, but you are more likely to find clothes or household items.\n5) People sell boots they don't really need in a garage sale, but you are more liable to get what you want in a sporting good store, or even a shoe store.\n6) In a sporting good store you may get a new pair at a good price.\n7) A sporting good store is also where you are most likely to find hiking boots for your specific size and purpose.\n8) Garage sales are also convenient, since you don't have to go to a separate location.\n9) However, the answer is C - Sporting Good", "answer": "A: bookstore"}

Option C describes the driving behaviour of a person.\n6.) Option D describes the driving behaviour of the person on the conditions of the road.\n6.) Option E does not say anything related to conditions of roads, but describes a general behaviour of a driver.\n4.) We need to determine which option describes the conditions of the road: Option C or Option D, so that we can pick the appropriate one.\n5.) From the context of driving too fast on icy roads the condition of the road should have a huge impact on the situation as it may result in a deadly incident, which we could learn from these options.\n6.)

Choices: 1. A: a son at home\n2. B: a ticket\n3. C: her purse\n4. D: two tickets\n5. E: an adult for each other\nOutput: 16. Explanation: The statement informs that a woman must have her daughter with her to get on a Ferriss wheel, which does not require a ticket, but does require an adult for each other to get on the ride, which means a woman must have her husband with her as well.\nThere are no other conditions or factors except a daughter and husband.\nSo, what must a man have to get on the Ferriss wheel with his wife and daughter? (His wife is not mentioned here, but is necessarily available, since a man needs an adult for each other)\nChoice A: man must have a son to home.(No woman can take her daughter and husband with her but can take a son)\nChoice B: woman must have a son at home.(No wife can take her daughter and huband with her.

To buy an item, you have to go to the place of eating. 'to buy' and 'of many different kinds' go with 'places'. All in all, the context of the question supports B, 'City'.\n3. Shopping centers, though places where items are sold, are not places where one can also dine at a restaurant, making'shopping centers' answer for option E and eliminating it as a possible choice.\n4. City is a place where many items can be bought as well as eaten and so, the answer is 'City'.\nSo the final answer in option C: city\n\nInput: Which of the following actions will put more strain on a tree branch? Choices: 1. A: the addition of a birdhouse 2. B: the addition of too many small birds 3. C: the presence of one big and one small bird 4. D: the presence of one large bird 5. E: the presence of one small bird\nOutput: 1: The statement mentions that an addition of 'bird house' might strain a tree (implying that it will add weight to the branch).\n2. Choice B: 'the addition of too many small bids' indicates that more birds can be placed on a branch. Hence, this choice would cause strain on the branch.\n3. The addition of 'bird house'; 'one small bird' and 'one large bird' would mean more weight is added onto the branch. This is why all the choices with 'bird' are wrong.\n4. The presence of a 'bird house' would not cause strain on the tree, since a bird house, usually, does not add a great deal of weight to a tree.\n5. The presence of a single small bird would not have a significant impact on the tree, and the presence of one large and one small bird would also be the same. Therefore, we can eliminate both these choices.\n6. Only option D, 'the presence of one big and small bird', fits, which would mean that the presence of a big bird would strain the branch, since birds are heavy.\n7. Finally, it should be noted that an", "answer": "E: shopping center"}
{"text": "1.\"Strain\" isn't used in the right way. A sentence that's written in a wrong way doesn't make sense. \n2. The sentence reads, \"If I recieve a... letter from a friend.\"  It's missing an \"s\" at the end of \"receive\". \n3. If this was a mistake, which it wasn't, then \"pudding\" would be a possible answer.\n4. Letters often have a \"ps\" at the end. An example is, \"My apologies if... you've missed a letter from me.\" \n5. This shows that letters are sent in the form of puddings.\n6. \"Puddings\" are usually homemade. This means if you sent something in the form of a pudding, it would be homemade.\n7. \"Strain\" is also used to make something homemade. An example is \"Chunky stewed tomato soup that has been strained.\" \n8. This shows that straining is made in the form of pizza, so pizza is the answer\n9. In summary, reading something is not the answer, we need a reason for the answer we are reading.\n10. It doesn't make sense to read something that is not in a readable format.\n11. It isn't always necessary to read letters overseas if the sender lives in the same country as you. This is because there are other ways of communication, like texting, writing on computers and emails.\n12. The answer is thus \"pudding\", as letters are often homemade and sent in this form.\nSo the final sentence reads \"If I receive a letter from a friend, overseas, and it's homemade, I read it... if it was pudding, then I would eat the pudding.\"\n\n---\n### Hints: \n\n---\n\n### Input:You know he likes cake, you know that he knows that you know he likes cakes, and you know that he knows you know he knows that he likes cakes.

We have given.\n2) the word 'trumpeter' appears in the question and in the context.\n3) We can see that the answer must be a \"trumpet.\"\n4) We also know that a trumpet can perform different styles of music depending on the band playing.\n5) If a player plays the trumpet in a symphony orchestra, he will play \"b\" at the symphony.\n6) If a trumpet is played in a jazz ensemble, the player will play \"c\" in a jazz game.\n7) \"His trumpet is usually played in an orchestra.\n8) Where the player plays depends on the band and if he plays a horn.  \n9) The player plays\" e \".\n10) Therefore, any public performance, for example, the opera or the jazz concerts, the audience can hear him play.\n11) So we can answer it \"a\" opera \"b\" basketball \"c\" symphonic \"e\" radio show or\"d\" brass band.\n12) Hence, the answer is\" b \" because the answer is a basketball game.\nSo", "answer": "C: party"}
{"text": "1 The question asks what his friend might have meant by 'bull'.\n2. It seems that by saying a bull can be this, his friend was referencing to the notion of the word 'bull' meaning something positive, not the animal itself.\n3. So looking at the choices: A and D, these are not applicable as they are simply different words that refer to the animal - 'bull' and 'cow'.\n4. Looking at B and C, these are related to 'bull' in that they sound similar or are modified versions, but do not have any additional meaning.\n5. Thus, the only relevant choice in the context of the sentence is 'E: charging prey'. His friend was referencing to the animal in the figurative sense, but used the sound and context related to the meaning of 'bull', hence option E.\nSo this gives us our answer, which is option E: charging preyanimal.\nSo the final answers is E: charging preyenimenal\n\nInput: What time do most people fall asleep?

Option's c. father is referred to as his brother by using the pronoun 'him', which implies that her father doesn't live with her uncle.\n5. Therefore the father is elsewhere, but still in the same household, as the pronouns 'him' and 'her' suggest. \n6.

In this case, Bob is putting on waterproof trousers and goggles in a dressing room, which suggests that he is making preparations for some kind of activity.\n4. Hence, the choices that are most likely for a facility in which Bob is putting on waterprooft trousers and goggle are B (actor's and actresses), D (gym), and E (theatre).\n5. However, option C (fancy restaurant) cannot be excluded as Bob may be putting on his waterprooft clothing as he is going to a fancy restaurant for a special occasion.\n6. So, the options that are most likely for the facility are B (actor'spersons), D (gym) and E (theatre), from which D (gym) is most suitable for waterproof clothing.\nThus option B (actor'sperson), option D (gym) or option E (theatre) are the most likely facility that Bob is visiting.\nSo the final correct answer is option D: Gym\n\nInput: A bird's nest is in which location?

{"text": "1 The context is a weekend.\n2. The clue provided is \"supermarket\", \"dishwasher\", \"table\", and \"flea market\".\n3. So, to infer the best guess, we would assume that the collector items may be used once a while but are not necessarily used every day by the person who purchased them.\n4. For example, if the person prefers to use a coffee shop or a kitchen cupboard for storing mugs, the \"weekend breakfast\" could mean that the collector items could be used for the weekend and then returned to their storage place.\n5. Considering the fact that the person bought the items recently, it can also be inferred that the person may intend to use the items on a short term basis such as the \"weekend dinner\". \n6. Option \"A\" and \"C\" are related to a table and a dishwasher respectively, while \"D\" refers to the concept of a flea market. \n7. So, we can reject these options as the best guess to the question.\n8. Now comes the keyword \"rare\". Rare is used to describe something or someone of exceptional quality or rarity.\n9. Therefore we can infer that the \"collector plate\" must be unique, rare, and highly valued by the owner.\n10. The question could be restated as \"Why is the seller willing to sell an expensive collector item on a flea market on the weekend?\n11. The answer must fit with the questions. \n12.

Choices: A: Camouflage B: Lining C: Fingerless D: Olive green\nOutput: 11. Camouflage green is the most important feature in a paratrooper' s uniform.\n2. Options 'Lining' and 'Olive Green' do not have any significance for a paratrooper''s uniform.\n3. Therefore the relevant choices for a paratrooper uniform are: 'Camouflage green' and 'Fingerless'. \n4. Camouflage is a feature of uniform that disguises the paratroopers and helps them avoid enemy detection. \n5. Fingerless uniform is not necessary for airborne soldiers. \n6.

It may also be in a well-lit room or on a wall, but the primary concern would be to attract customers.\n4. The other choices do not mention the need for customers, and so are out.\n5. A candle in a birthday cake in a dimly-lit room is not very practical, considering a restaurant is not supposed to prioritize the birthday celebrant.\n6. Hence,'B: kitchen' is impractical and can be ignored.\n7. However, the reason we have kept the others might seem to make all of the choices viable options for this question.\n8. This is because options C and D will make a restaurant look tidy and organized.\n9. But this is not the point of the question.\n10.

However, this does not necessarily require a place for storage.\n4. Hence, the answer would be a place that is specifically suitable for storage, which would bring us to B: cabinet and C: cupboard, as the two most plausible options.\n5. However, if the phrase 'have a lot of plastic' is further analyzed, it implies that a person may have many plastic things, and not just a certain few like they would have in a cabinet or a cupboard.\n6. 'Cupboard' and'Cabinet' may not be suitable, but 'D: own home' may be, where a person may have many items due to the large space available.\n7. 'E: garbage dump' would indicate that the item was thrown away, which is not the case when the person has 'children'.\n8. So, A: cupboard seems to be a suitable place to keep plastic things, as there can be many plastic things in a cupboard, and this corresponds to the context which is about a person with children.\n9. Therefore, the answer to the question is A: cupboard.\nSo the final answers are A: cupboard\n\nInput: A person with many books might like a shelf that can accommodate a lot of what? Choices: A: paper B: information C: plastic D: words E: wood\nOutput: 1:'A person with many books' would need to be organized, and books can be arranged neatly on a shelf, which indicates that the shelf needs to be able to accommodate many books.\n2. Shelves are typically made of wood, paper, or plastic, so the shelf can be made of any of the options.\n3. Thus this would mean that the option D: 'words' cannot be the answer as it's not an item that is related to the shelf.\n4. Among the other options: 'Paper' is suitable, as paper is used to make books, and a shelf would need paper in various", "answer": "C: own home"}
{"text": "1The context is a set of activities that are related to a wedding.  2.The bride and groom may take care of proposals, among other things.\n3.The option 'E: results' does not fit as it is too vague and unrelated to weddings. 4.

Options 'C: marriage' and 'D: finishing up' do not describe what happens before a wedding, just activities related to it. 6.'A: efficiency' and and 'B: getting things done' can both be related to ceremonies. 7. Efficiency refers to how a task is accomplished, while getting things done is more oriented towards a set of duties rather than the results of those duties. 8.

Option A states that \"Between\" the girls is a similarity, so the answer can't be A.\nIn Option B, \"Common interest between\" girls is the opposite meaning of \"mutual interest among\" girls.\nOption C is similar to B, and option E is similar to D. 3. The next choices are similar to the original phrase, so let's skip it.\n4. Option D states similarity between girls and disinterest between girls, which is opposite of the original phrase.\n5. The original phrase emphasizes similarities between the girls, not their differences, so the answer should be C.

{"text": "1. There is a context provided, which is about anemone in their glove-shaped stage.\n2. The glove-shaped anemone is a stage in their growth cycle. \n3. However, the question does not give any concrete indication about where the anemone are in their growth cycle, or whether they are even in their 'glove-shaped' stage.\n4. So the option that fits best is one that will apply to anemone in their growth cycle, without indicating when or where they are in their cycle. \n5. Thus, the answer could either be 'A: michigan', or 'C: tide pool'. \n6. Option A is a vague description of a location and does not provide enough information.\n7. The same applies for option C, which indicates a specific pool. Anemone growth is a process that occurs over time in specific conditions, such as warm waters, but a particular pool does not provide that information.\n8. Hence, the answer should be between options B and D.\n9. Option B is a name of a body of water but again, this is not enough information to answer the question, unless it has been explicitly stated that the anemone are located in a lake previously. \n10. Alternatively, an ocean or body of water is not necessarily the right answer anyway, as the anemone can naturally grow in any bodies of water without any human intervention. 11. Therefore, option D has been chosen as the right answer: _atlantic ocean_. _The Atlantic Ocean is a major ocean that encompasses much of North and South America and Europe, and it is one of the most important ecosystems for anemone that are already in the glove-shaped phase of their growth cycle._\nSo the final answer has been changed from the given choice to D: atlantic ocean.\n\n### Part 4 - The Quadric Question\n\nThis test will ask you 3 questions with four answers; however, one of the answers needs to\nbe eliminated.

The question is asking about one of the two possible outcomes after swallowing a coin: a) the swallow is a human, and b) the swallow is an apple.\n3.

But, in this case, the question wants us to find choice D, meaning it expects us to choose a horizontal column of numbers.\n4. Roman architecture or whitehouse options would make sense if the numbers were vertical in arrangement, however, they don't apply here.\n5. Bridge has to do with movement, such as bridging gaps in knowledge, skills or in some cases columns.\n6. Similarly, pantheon is about a grouping together of something in a collection, but not in a structure with columns, so option E: pantheons is wrong.\n7.

Dr. Seuss B. Katherine Hepburn C. Lorinda Johnson D. Walt Disney E. Jane Elliot\nOutput: 1) The question asks us to identify the name of the author of \"The Cat in the hat\".\n2) We cannot assume that Dr. Seuss is the author because we aren't aware of what his name is either. However, Katherine Hepburn can't be the author either because her name doesn't sound like an author's name.\n3) If we're looking for the author's name, then Lorinda Johnson and Jane Elliot names don't match well with the author's name. \n4) This leaves us with Walt Disney.\n5) Walt Disney writes the most popular children's book, so he must be the author of \"The cat in the hat\"\nSo the answer is A.  Dr. Seuss", "answer": "C: spreadsheet"}

After all this, we had three choices left for the answer - great, remarkable and peculiar. Peculiar - is already out, great and remarkable were excluded, and we found out that \"remarkable\" also does not meet the requirements of the question.\n6. For the last option, we can come to the conclusion that we should select great because it can be considered to be the most appropriate side effect that can happen to someone when they were taking their medicine since they'll be experiencing a great number of side effects to it and we can say that the medicine has great side effects.\n7. In the end, it's \"great\" because what they're looking for is someone who experienced great many side effects when they take their medicine and because the medicine they took had great many side effects.\n8.

{"text": "1: The question asks why someone would confess to murder.\n2. A 'guilty conscience' is a state of feelings of guilt associated with committing or intending to commit a crime, including murder.\n3. So the context of the question suggests that the accused had a guilty conscience.\n4. However, all of the options do not convey this context and only 'problems' and 'find God' make sense due to the context in question.\n5. Although 'find God' is a metaphor, it is still possible that someone 'finds God' to overcome problems in their life and thus 'find God' can be considered as one of the reasons for confessing the crime of murder.\n6.'Problems' is a more direct and likely reason for confessing a crime.\n7.

Likewise,'small group', which implies a group that is smaller than a crowd, is not logical as an accurate description of the crowd.\n6. Choice B: 'alone' means one isolated individual. But, because 'all' suggests the crowd was not just one person, this too is not a suitable option.\n7. Finally, choice C:'small group' means a small number comparable to the number in a group.\n8. However, choice D:'solitude' means the absence of company. This is an accurate description of alone/small group.\n9. Therefore, the crowd was not a mass, group of individuals.

Option B is not true because people don't usually talk in front of God, unless they are praying. \n5.

{"text": "1: The question asks where to put olives to prevent it from getting nearby food wet.\n2. We know the olive has a high water content, so the food nearby could get wet from it if it is not stored properly.\n3. The options, 'eaten','mushrooms' and'sardines', are all foods that already contain water and are not likely to require storage on their own.\n4. 'Bread and crackers' could possibly drip water, so it is a possibility, but it is too vague and not specifically stated to be nearby the olive.\n5. Option D: 'pizza', while not specifically stated to be anywhere near the olive, is likely a food item that has a high chance of getting wet because it is exposed.\n6.

So we can assume that he might have felt various emotions during his participation in that competition.\n4. Among the options, both 'pressure' and 'trying harder' are related to the context of competition.\n5. The question specifically mentions the idea of competition being related to death, so 'pressure' seems to be the most plausible answer.\n6. However, when taken in context with the rest of the sentence and the previous question, the idea of winning or losing becomes more relevant.\n7. This suggests that if James was feeling pressure, it may have been due to pressure to succeed and win.\n8. Therefore we can assume that the answer is either C: trying harder or D: quitting. \n9. However, the option D: quitting does not necessarily mean that James quit, as he could have felt pressure and still tried harder (D).\n10.

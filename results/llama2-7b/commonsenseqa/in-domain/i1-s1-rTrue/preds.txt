We would just put grapes next to the food we are shopping.<n>5. Option B: Grocery Cart. Again, if the question was "where do you put you grapes just before shopping at the grocery store", then the only logical answer would be to put your grapes in the GROCERY CART.<n>6. Option C: Super Market. This answer is not only illogical, but it also makes no sense. Even if we put fruit in the grocery cart and checked out at the grocery cart, we have still not answered the question.<n>7. Option D: Fruit Basket. There are more things that can fit in a Grocery Cart than just fruit. For example, we could also put cereal and bread there. But a fruit basket does not allow us to keep cereal and any other items, thus the answer is incorrect.<n>8. In summary, the only answer that is both logical and complete is option E: Fruit Market.<n><n>## Source: https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/project-euler/challenges/in-the-kitchen/problem<n><n><n>```java<n>import java.util.*;<n><n>public class Solution {<n><n>  public static void main(String[] args) {<n>    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);<n>    String[] line = {"A: oil refineries\nB: wall\nC: show\nD: own home\nE: water fountain\nWhere could you find some plumber that would not be of used to you if you are starving?

Even in a full immersive environment where all the input you receive is in the target language, you will still likely commit some errors, mistakes, which could lead to misinterpretation and this will be uncomfortably for the listener (and possibly you, if you are the interpreter in that exchange), which can cause feelings such as uncertainty, confusion, and even anger in others and you.<n>2) It doesn't matter whether you're trying to speak in your target language at 100% accuracy, or with 99% or 50% accuracy, you are still likely to make mistakes, which can lead to miscommunication and misunderstandings.<n>3) Finally, language learning can be difficult, and you may get frustrated if you don't make much progress as quickly as you'd like. Frustration from not being able to communicate in a new language can lead to feelings of irritation, stress, impatience, even anger towards others.<n>So the final conclusion is, C) frustration<n>

Choices: 1) Because he didn't want nothing to happen to him.    2) Because he was going to leave his pet behind.    3) Because he didn' think he should leave his business behind.    4) because he didn't want to leave his boss behind.    5) I have no idea.<n>Output:1-A: The answer in the previous question is obviously "death". This question is just asking "why?" so the only possible answer would be that he didn't want death.<n>2--B: I can't think of anything better than answer A, and the fact that he wants to keep everything he has tells us that he wants to live. Even though the phrase says he doesn't want to die, the fact that he has everything he wants in life, plus the fact that he had a pet he wanted to keep, plus the fact that his boss seemed important, too, tell us that he doesn't want death<n><n><n><n><n>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<n><n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:When you play around with your dog they will have? Choices:  A: alive B: health C: fun D: playing dead E: black<n>Output:		1 When you play with your dog, they will have fun.<n>2 The question asks about what happens when you play with your dog. We're looking for words that are synonyms of "play," so we consider each of the given answers.<n>3 Option A: alive. Dogs can run or sleep while they are not playing.<n>4 Option B: health. When you play with your dogs, you aren't causing them harm and they are healthy.<n>5 Option C: fun. Dogs are usually very excited when they play.<n>6 Option D: playing dead. It can be done by acting. It does not occur in the real world.<n>7 Option E: black. This is an improbable answer that should be eliminated.<n>8 All of the given answers can be eliminated except option C.<n>So the final choice is C: fun<n>Input:You can play hide and seek in what? Choices: 1. A: A gym<n>2. B: The forest<n>3. C: A restaurant<n>4. D: In front of a person's house<n>Output: 1 You can play hide and seek with someone in a gym.<n>2 You cannot play hide and seek in a forest, as it is not a big enough space with a lot of things and people.<n>3 You cannot play hide and see in a restaurant, as you cannot hide under tables, out of sight of other people, etc.<n>4 You can play hide and see in someone's house, but only with people who are there.<n>

After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:How does getting paid feel? Choices:  A: income tax B: satisfaction C: sorrow D: ocean E: bill collectors to happy<n>Output:		1) If you are getting paid, you are feeling satisfied (option C) because people generally work to get some money so if it is paid then that implies satisfaction.<n>2) There is no option which is not true but options A and E are negatives so they are wrong.<n>3) Options B and D cannot be answered because they are general feelings or emptions.<n>4) Option D is wrong because when I will get paid, I am happy so I will be happy so option D is wrong.<n>5) So we find that option C is the answer because a person who works will be paid and this will make him satisfied and also paying a person is a common thing between a business and an employee.<n><n>Input: what is considered good advice? Choices: 1: bad advice A: something that will help a person in future B: something good for a person C: something not to eat D: something to buy E: something to stay away from<n>Output: 1: A person with bad advice is likely to do some stupid things which will then cause problems to him or her, so advice should be good so that a person doesn't end up doing something stupid or harmful. 2: Options B and D are not completely good or bad. 3: Advice can be good for a person as well as bad as it depends on a person's perspective. 4: Advice to stay away from should be good for you to stay away from. If it isn't, then staying away from it will only cause negative results. 5: We conclude that options C and E are incorrect. Advice to stay away should be good for a person to stay away but staying away from something that is good for a person wouldn't make sense. 6: We eliminate options C and E. 7: Options B and D may be true but may not be as reliable as the others. There is a probability of these to be true as well as false. 8: We conclude that options A and B are true. Options A and B both indicate the positive results of good advice to a person while the others are not. 9: Option A is true because when a person takes good advice, he is more likely to do good things in the future which are beneficial. Hence, that option is the correct answer.<n>

Choices:  A: trash can B: honey C: bouquet of flowers D: rose garden E: field of flowers<n>Output:		1: The question is asking where bees congregate in the presence of red flowers.<n>2. We consider each of the given choices.<n>3. Option: A: trash can. The only things in a trash can that are red are the recycling symbol and the lid. Bees do not fly towards things that they do not see, which leaves us with the lid and the red recycling symbol. As bees seek sugar and they tend to seek the sweetest food, they most likely do not seek the lid of a trash can.<n>4. Option: B: honey. 1. The word "congregate" suggests a large number of bees and bee hives are full of bee honey and bees will definitely be there. 2. Bees collect honey and other sweet substances produced by plants. Honey is a rich source of sugar. Honey can be produced from nectar taken from floral sourCes. The bee gathers and transports the nectar to bee hives. When the hive is full they make honeycomb. 3. Honey is a sweet substance which the bees store  as a food  reserVe for honey bee colonies.<n>5. Option: C: bouquet of Flowers. For bees, the sweetest food is nectar. There are 55 different flower fragrances that attract the bees. In nature, the Bee has no difficulty in extracting Honey from flowers.<n>6. Option: D: rose garden. A: rose is a climbing shrub in the genus Rosa, within the family Rosaceae. It has thorns and a stem that grows in length and branches. B.

Choices:  A: hostility B: anger C: nose D: fists E: hands<n>Output:		1 A: The question asks what John was unable to do (hold his tools) due to his injured hands.<n>2. As the options provide details about what could be the reason of John's injured hands, we take each of the given options one by one in a top-down manner.<n>3. Option B: "John was punching at the nail, punching and puching at the nail".<n>4. Option C: "He would be unable to hold a nunchaku".<n>5. Option A is more accurate in our context. We cannot infer that John punching the wall means he was holding a hammer. Additionally, option C is not necessarily true (i.e., John may hold his tools while injured nose or fists, hence he could be wrongly assumed of punching only at the wall).<n>6.

Option A: mountains. Throwing a rock from a mountain will be difficult because the rock will need to travel further down the mountain before entering the river. Option A: countryside. The countryside is an open area with a low population density, which is why it is not recommended for throwing a rock into a river.<n>3. Option B: ground and bridge: Because throwing a rock in this area would be harder as the rock needs to travel a longer distance and the force would be dissipated in the air<n>4. Option C: mountain range If you throw the rock from a mountain range, it could take a longer time for the rock to reach the river because the rock has to travel a longer distance while crossing the mountain range.<n>5.

Choices:  A: opera B: supermarket C: building D: conference E: apartment<n>Output:		A: opera and building. Where are people likely to find some food? To help determine this, we consider each option given in the question and their relevance to this question.<n>9. Option A: opera. A theatre might sell foods to people attending the performance, but usually they would not contain foods they can eat.<n>10. Option B: supermarket. It is likely that when you visit a supermarket, you do not find food to eat or not easily eatable food. For example, you will find meat, but it is not edible. Or there might be some kind of preserved food - that is, food that has been kept at lower temperatures. It takes a lot of time but usually people buy preserved food.<n>11. Option C- building. Most restaurants or food stalls require a permit to operate legally, which means that you must obtain some kind of paperwork before selling food to customers. This document usually covers how long the food is safe to eat after it was delivered to the customer, which is why most businesses would require you to go through an inspection to obtain a permit.<n>12. Option D: conference. In order to have a successful conference, an area has to be equipped with many things ranging from chairs to water fountains. Conference rooms also often have food available for people attending business meetings, but they do not contain foods people can easily eat.<n>13. Option E: apartment. Foods commonly consumed by people living in an apartment consist of items such as frozen foods, which require extra preparation.<n>14. So it can be seen that foods that people are likely to find in a building are either prepared and ready to eat, or the food is something that requires preparation before it can be eaten. This makes it likely that people might find food in buildings.<n>So the final answers are A: opera and B: building<n><n>Input: What are people most likely to find in a hotel? Choices: 1. a: parking lot b: conference centre c: elevator d: restaurant e: hallway f: laundry room<n>Output: 15. A: parking lot. People are most likely to find a parking lot in hotels, not necessarily a parking lot. A person in a hotel will look for a parking lot because they want to store their car there in

Ink spilled onto her old one.  Really, she didn't know what that thing had an inkwell in the first place.  What piece of furniture might have been on her run? Choices:  A: front of door B: bedroom C: desk D: table E: living room<n>Output:		1. The question asks what piece of furniture might be on Sarah's run.<n>2. As she could have just ran out of the room with an inkspot on her rug, she could have been running out of any room.<n><n>3. Option A Front of door: the front of door does contain an area with a lock, a doorknob and a doormat; however, there is no room for a rug in this area as it contains a door; so Sarah couldn't put a rug on the front of the door when leaving with an ink spot on it.<n><n>4. Option B Bedroom: Sarah has enough room for a rug in the bedroom, considering the available space.<n><n>5. Option C Desk: A desk and a rug don't make much sense, as they are normally placed in different rooms. However, if the rug was meant to be used as a writing surface, then this would be an option.<n><n>6. Option D Table: Sarah may have left the room with an inked spot on the table if her goal was to get as far away from a wet rug as possible.<n><n>7. Option E Living room: a rug on the floor could possibly be the least likely option as there is no space for a rug, as the available surface is a table and two different chairs on the left side of the room and a TV on the right without a cupboard or storage between, the rug would be too unwarranted or oddly placed for someone leaving the room with an inky spot on the old rug to carry on.<n><n>8. Because Sarah could have run out of the room with anything, this question could be answered with "any" as the most likely, because even though option D has been mentioned, it doesn't mean the other options are impossible.<n>\033[0;44m<n>##### 3. Why do we say that these riddle are not an example of a mathematical fallacy?<n><n>1. "The question is asking what piece of furniture could have an ink spot.<n>2.

Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8.

Choices:  A: control computer B: separate things C: go on vacation D: cross street E: go out<n>Output:		1) The person was looking up airfare and hotel prices.<n>2) This means that he was looking to make a purchase or get a specific item by the end of the day.<n>3) The four options do not provide any information about whether the person is looking to make a purchase, or if he is merely trying to get the lowest price possible.<n>4) This leaves us with the last option, which specifies that the person is looking for a place to stay while on vacation.<n>5) After considering these facts, we know that there is only one correct answer: option D: go on vacation.[2]<n><n>Input: The city was preparing a huge snowfall and it was going to do what about it to the airline and hotel prices that were going up?

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas.

Choices:  A: illinois B: woods C: new york D: indiana E: farmer's market<n>Output:		<n>2. The question is asking about the location of the woman in relation to other trees in the area.<n>3. Option "A": Illinois. The woman was in Illinois, surrounded by many other trees.<n>4. Option "B": woods. The woman was in a forest or a wooded area, surrounded by many other types of trees. The most likely explanation is that she was in a densely forested area of Illinois, where she may have been mistaken for being in Indiana.<n>5. Option "C": New York. The question does not specify the context of the location. In general, the phrase "New York" has a very broad definition, so this could refer to many different locations within the state that could be surrounded by other trees.<n>6. Option "D": Indiana. The woman was in Indiana, surrounded by many other apple trees, some of which were likely surrounded by other species of trees. Due to the ambiguity of the question, it is impossible to determine the specific surroundings of the woman in Indiana, but the general context is that Indiana is surrounded by other states.<n>7. Option "E: Farmer's Market" is not possible answer since it is not a location of a tree where woman picked an apple.<n>8. After reviewing all the options, it seems that option "A" is the most likely answer to the question. The location of the woman was in Illinois, which is surrounded by other trees, and was likely in a wooded area. It is unclear if it was actually located in Indiana.<n>9. This leads us to the correct answer: A: Illinois.<n><n>Input:The two men were given the opportunity to share all three pieces of candy they had between them, who do you think would be most excited to share? Choices:  a: The bigger and older of the two b: The shorter and older of the two c: The taller and younger<n>Output: 1) a: The bigger and longer of the two men will be most excited to share. It is more likely that two people who are close in size and age will share something like two pieces of candy without too much struggle. It is unlikely that two people who are significantly different in size and age would be willing to share, and it is not even clear what the actual problem that the men were facing is.<n>2) b: The shorter and elder men are more excited about sharing candy. It is unlikely that both

Choices:  A: kitchen B: child's hand C: street D: toy store E: soccer game<n>Output:		1. The question is about where you can find balls.<n>2. Options a through e each have their own advantages and disadvantages.<n>3. Option a (kitchen): In the kitchen, there may be a number of balls that you could collect, such as fruits, which could be used. If you don't want apples, you could find oranges.<n>4. Option b (child's hand): If you ask a child for a ball, they may have one in their hand, which you could possibly take.<n>5. Option c (street): During recess at school or when you're out on the street, you may come across people who have kicked or lost a ball there.<n>6. Option d (toy store): In a toy store, you may be able to purchase a new ball or find one that someone else has dropped.<n>7. Option e (soccer game): If you're at a soccer game, there may be some kids who have dropped their balls and are no longer using them.<n>At this point, the answer could be any of the remaining options, but a more general answer would be Option C: street or toy store. You may not need to wait until your ball is in a street, as that is quite a rare possibility. It is easy to just go and buy one for your kids if you need one at home or give it to a child if it is not being used.<n><n>Input: When can you find something that is not a vegetable?

The question is asking about what you can find that is not a vegetables.<n>3. Options A and C: when baking cakes and when are the leaves falling are correct, as in they can both be found during your search for something that is not a vegeta<n>4. Option B (when you are eating) is incorrect as it does not specify when it can be found.<n>5.

In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show.

Choices:  A: apartment B: classroom C: buildings D: car E: audience<n>Output:		1) The question is asking what could contain no more than 100 people.<n>2) We consider each of the given choices.<n>3) Option A: apartment. An apartment can contain no more than 3-12 people per apartment. So it seems that an apartment can  contain no more than 42 people.<n>4) Option B: classroom. A classroom can contain no more than approximately 80 students. Hence, we see that a classroom can  contain no more 112 people. Therefore, a classroom cannot contain no more than 94 people.<n>5) Option C: buildings. If it is a large building or a campus of a university, than 100 is definitely a huge amount of people that could be in one building.<n>6) Option D: car. There's a cap on how much people can fit in a car, so the limit is 4-8 people. So option C should not be the correct choice.<n>7) Option E: audience. Since we are talking about going to a theater, the audience limit is usually around 1000 people. So this may contain more than 105 people.<n>8. Based on the information we have, we can conclude that an apartment can contain more than 12 people.<n>Therefore the correct answer is A: apartment<n><n>Input: Where might you find a place with a lot of people, usually under an hour to get through it?

This is because we breathe fresh air as we go outside and breathe in the old air inside a room. The air in a room is only slightly used or rarely used by people who are breathing in it.<n>3) The air in a house is also not fully used or newly used because the amount of air inside a house is less than the amount of air outside of a house.<n>The air in a train station is not only used.

By considering each of the given option, we would know that:<n>3. Option A, bus stop - when people get into a bus, there’s usually a sign stating the pick-up place or the place to get off at. Such lines of people would likely be waiting at that bus stop rather than bus stop.<n>4. Option C, roadblock - it is difficult to say whether people are in line at a roadblock or not.<n>5.

No. The only thing you need to ensure is that you are in a place where the meeting will happen to have it as the answer. Thus, we should choose answer options that indicate where the meeting will occur.<n><n>4) We begin with the first two options, courtyard & castle. Both indicate a place where the meeting can happen. Choosing castle as our answer is wrong as it includes the option of "castle tower" which is not where the meeting will happen.<n><n>5) We can eliminate "monarchy," as the throne room is clearly not where the meeting is planned to happen.<n>6) We now consider dinning room and throne room.

Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:Where does a person need to get when they have more kids? Choices:  A: compliments B: understand themselves C: life partner D: second chances E: larger house<n>Output:		1) A person needs food and supplies for their newborn baby and there may be many things they need for a newborn baby (eg, diapers, pacifiers, baby blankets, etc.).<n>2) If a person's pregnant wife is giving birth at the hospital, the person may need someone to help them find transportation and a place to park in order to take them to the hospital or find someone else who can do this.<n>3) If the newborn baby is a twin or triplet, then the person would need people to help them with the delivery (midwife, nurses, and doctors).<n>4) If the newborn is a single baby, then the person would not need as much help with delivery since it's less work overall (only one baby).<n>5) If the person's pregnancy goes well so far and all goes well after delivery, then there may be many people coming by to visit them and see their new baby and this could mean that the person may not be able to enjoy their time with their newborn baby without interruption most of the time.<n>6) If the person' mother-in-law or sister-in-law has delivered multiple babies before and gives them sound advice or support while they breastfeed their new baby, then this would be considered a compliment for taking care of a newborn baby.<n>7) Sometimes people feel bad about themselves if they cannot take care of their newborn and may take it as an insult because many babies are dependent on their parents from day 1 so if the mom and dad do not know how to breastfeed, then the baby might have some issues like jaundice later or be sickly because he/she isn't getting enough food from his/her parents.<n>8) A life partner who isn't supportive during this time could cause even more emotional distress for both parents as well as the newborn baby's health.<n>9) A larger house where there are several rooms might work better if the newborn baby has many brothers and sisters because a lot of attention may be needed at times especially during play time which calls for different rooms with different furniture (playroom for toys, living room for reading books, kitchen for eating food, etc.).<n>10) After considering all the options mentioned above, it can be concluded that none of them are truly needed by someone

Options A, B, C, and D are all places where children would expect to find things interesting.<n>3. Option E – dinner might be the answer. However, it is not clear if "dinner" refers to a specific time (e.g. 5:00 pm or 7:00 pm) or to a type of meal (e.g. meals during a formal dinner party). Either way, it seems the most likely answer to this question is to say that dinners would be too boring for children.<n>4. But the overall meaning of this question can be clarified by referring to option E. If "dinner" refers<n>to a specific time or a particular meal, it would refer more to the time or the dish than to "dinners" in general. But if it is more generic (representing "dinner" in general as opposed to being specific to a particular time or meal), we could assume that children would not be interested in dining at any time of day. In any case, the answer "dinner" would still be inapplicable because the question is about whether children are interested in an entire place at a certain time, not whether they are interested in the actual people in the place.<n><n>Input: If someone is very smart, which of the following is most likely true of that person?

If "they" refers to the smart person, then it can be determined that this is the correct answer. Option F indicates that "they" should refer to the smartest person at their job. <n>3. If "they" means "the smart person," then option A, "they are always good at puzzle," would be the best choice. But if "they" refers to a different

Choices:  A: look at B: write down C: learn new D: think about E: discovery of new<n>Output:		1) The detective had to analyise all the clues. This means to carefully and thoroughly study and examine all the evidence<n>2) The detective had "to learn new things" in reference to the term "clues": this could mean a variety of things as the detective had to gather all kinds of new knowledge. This means that the sentence is referring not to the entire process of analysis, but to what might be learned from the analyzed evidence. The sentence itself doesn't state that it means all the clues, but rather learnt new things. Based off of this new information, this sentence is incorrect.<n>3)The detective had "to think about" all of the clues. Thinking entails the act of applying rationality and reasoning to all of the presented evidence.

Once the barn is constructed, it can then be "what" a new barn, or a new version of the old barn.<n>3. Entice: This choice does not make sense here as entice means to attract or persuade someone to do something, usually something that is not in their best interest. This choice is saying, that the old barn should be enticed to do something new before another one is built? Which does not make any sense here.<n>4. Fix: Fix means to mend or repair something that is broken or damaged. However, this would not apply to the phrase "before you can what". Since the "what" here relates to creating a new barn, then this choice would be incorrect.<n>5. Build: This is the choice that makes sense here. The phrase "before you can build a new one" indicates that you need to first destroy the old barn to make room for the new one, which can be referred to as "making" it.<n>So the final option here is: build<n><n>Input: Which of the following is an antonym of the word paranoid?

Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:They wanted to eat at home but the cupboards were barren, so they had to go what?

Choices:  A: europe B: big house C: tuxedo D: palace E: men's room<n>Output:		1." A gentleman is very wealthy" doesn't necessarily mean he lives in a mansion. Rather, rich, aristocratic or noble characters usually live in palaces.<n>2. "flaunts it" refers to the fact that he enjoys displaying his wealth publicly to draw attention to himself. This can be done on social media, expensive cars or through clothing, but a home is the easiest way to do it.<n>3. Therefore, the most likely place where he would live is a palace.<n>4. Other options are discounted because they are uncommon for wealthy men living in a palace. For example, a palace in europe would be too expensive for a man living there to rent from the owner.<n>5. Tuxedo: Only well-off people can afford to buy a tuxedo, which shows that they have some status. But this doesn't indicate that they live in a palace.<n>6. Big House: This is the most important option as it shows the wealth of the man. However, although a big house may show people that you have wealth, it is not necessarily the palace where you want all attention paid to you.<n>7. Men's Room: This is a very unlikely place to live, even though it can be done. For example, there is no public access to where you shower to get cleaned up and you would likely get charged to use a restroom.<n>8. So the most likely place where you would find a wealthy man is a palace.<n>Therefore the final answer is E: Men's room<n>Input: Which type of clothing accessory may be used for formal events at a casino? Choices:  a: tie b: hat c: cuff links d: collar and tie E: dressy shoes f: dress shirt <n>Output: 1 A tie can be the best option for formal events at a club or casino as it indicates you are dressed well and looking for a formal or elegant event. It also indicates that you should have the appropriate dress code. <n>2 B: a hat can be the best option as it can complement your formal attire and draw attention to you as the most important person at a club or casini. <n>3 C: cuff links for a man are a bit flashy, but not overly so, and may add some elegance to a man's shirt.

Choices:  A: having appointements B: being late C: have time to think D: time consuming E: impatience<n>Output:		1A, B, E. Explanation is in the answer. <n><n>Input:I'll just explain myself. You see this was a joke. It's the only thing I could come up with at short notice because the prompt says to do it in 100 words or less, and it has a 65-minute window. In that time, there's no time to get a joke ready. Especially as I work my full-time job and do the other things in that period of time. If someone wrote a proper joke about AI writers, they should have written jokes about AI writers. And then this would be the punch line: I'll just explain myself because you could read that as meaning I'll just need to explain myself, and so that's what a joker would do. You could also read that as meaning that my joke, which reads fine when you have the context, would be unfunny and unintelligible to someone who didn't have that context. If that's true, then it will be even funnier to the AI. And not many generative AIs need the human-based context to write any kind of joke at all.<n>Output: 1: I'll do my best, but I won't make any promises.<n>2: I'll try to be as fast as possible.<n>3: I'll do everything in my power to make sure that this goes smoothly.<n>4: I'll also do everything in my power so that this doesn't turn out bad in any way.<n>5: I'll do it as fast as possible. I'll make your life easy, that's for sure.<n>6: I'll be patient with you.<n>7: It isn't something that will take much of your time, and you don't need to worry about it too much.<n>8. So it depends on how you say it, and who you're talking to. If you say it to a person, then those aren't going to work well at all. If you say it with me, then it would be funny. But since most jobs require work, it's hard for me to do my job. That's the joke.<n><n>Input: Which of the following is a good suggestion to get some help when your computer breaks down

Choices:  A: shopping cart B: cashier C: shopping mall D: supermarket E: bookstore<n>Output:		1..The question is asking where would you get a bag if someone fills it with clothes.<n>2. We consider all the options.<n>3. We note that option D: supermarket has a lot of bags to pick from, which you can pick among if the cashier packs your clothes in one.<n>4. Option A: shopping cart.<n>5. Option B: cashier. The cashier is an option on which we can rely to get a bag after someone filled it with clothes because, at a shopping mall, all the cashiers have bags that they use to wrap up purchases.<n>6. Option C: shopping malls. We have to pick and think like someone is going to shop at the mall first and then get a bag. You can do so by getting a bag from the mall to take home the purchased items and then use it, after your own clothes are packed into it, to bring home the purchased items.<n>7. Option D: supermarket. You can also obtain clothing and bring them to the cashier at the store and ask them to put those clothes into a bag which has other items from your shopping already present in.<n>8. So, the final answer is D: supermarket.<n>

The question asks where would you put a handle.<n>3 / 10:3. If you want to bring it, you may want to attach it to a handle. Therefore, option E gives a place to attach a handle if you want it with you.<n>4 / 10:4. Option A (briefcase) shows an example of where you may put a handle. But if you put a handle on a briefcase, would it keep it with you when you move around?<n>5/10:5. The same applies for option D (a frying pan).<n>6/10:6. However, it can't rule out that you will put it in a briefcase or a frying pan in which you can bring a handle to them.<n>7/10:7. Option B (coffee cup) contains handle; therefore it will keep it with you when moving around.<n>8/10:8. Option C (cuff carry object) is a case where it can't be brought with you because it's not on an object that is attached to a handle.<n>9/10:9.

Choices: 1. bunker 2. concrete 3. metal 4. wood A: bunker B: concrete C: metal D: wood<n>Output: A. The answer is A and B.<n># 1. The question in the passage is asking what makes for the best protection other than a bunker against nuclear fallout.<n>2. Our first instinct is to look again for a bunker in the answer choice, but we see that it also mentions concrete, metal, and wood.<n>3. Option 1 is a bunker. Bunkers are the best known ways of protecting yourself against nuclear fallout. A concrete bunker would protect you the best so you would stay underground. A metal bunker is less common and is difficult to construct. A wooden bunker is the most common and is the easiest to construct. Therefore, we can eliminate all options except concrete and bunker.<n>4. Option 2 is concrete. Concrete is a material that is used in many kinds of construction and is good against radiation. It is also a very strong material, which can protect you from falling debris. The downside is that it's a poor material for protection against nuclear fallout, but it's the best material.<n>5. Option 3 is metal. Metal is also a good material for construction of a bunker, making it a good material against radiation. A downside, however, is that it's not a widely used construction product.<n>6. Option 4 is wood. Wood is a common construction product, but it'

Options B and C together tell him to build an evenly level surface, which he may not have the proper tools or knowledge to do, so they are also not useful.<n>5. Option D: carpenter shop, or a "suggested" option in some multiple choice questions, is not a good place to find a level. If he is lucky, maybe he will find one there, but it is more likely that a carpenter will want him to buy a tool specific to his craft. A carpenter's tool box would also be too small for Bob to use and carry it around.<n>6.

Choices:  A: utah B: south america C: new hampshire D: japan E: new mexico<n>Output:		1) The question is asking where to go to see a lizard. It is assumed that you want to see the lizard in its natural, untamed habitat.<n>2) There are many species of lizards that exist in the wild. If you were to go to a zoo, you could also see them and their habitats, but it would not be in their “natural habitat” or what may be thought of as their “home.” Therefore, choosing a zoo as the answer is incorrect.<n>3) Many lizard species live in regions worldwide. Some species even live in Antarctica. It is also true that many species of lizard live in Mexico. There are also many species of lizard in South America.<n>4) There are many species that live in Africa or Asia, but we cannot be sure that a specific species of lizard lives in all of those places. We can be sure that some species do, but the question does not specify which species it is that we are looking for. Therefore, it is incorrect to answer B: Africa or Asia.<n>5) There are certain species that may be found in South America, but we again cannot be sure which species specifically lives there. Therefore, it is not correct to assume that if a lizard lives in South America, it would live there forever, including after natural disasters, etc.<n>6) Answer E: New Mexico is correct. New Mexico has been known to have native lizards living in the wild, as confirmed by Wikipedia “References. There are also many other species of lizard, but even those are not specifically native to New Mexico, which is the area we are looking for.<n>Therefore, the final answer is E: New Mexico<n><n>Instruction:Answer the following sentence rephrasing in a way that it is more formal.<n><n>Input: The bills are now due.

If you find a second heart in your chest, you might not be human.<n>3.'might not be:' is a negative indication, here in the form of a conditional clause 'is' and used as a conjunction 'but'.<n>4. Option A: istanbul: 'Istanbul' is not what Sarah found after an operation at all.<n>5. Option B: animal: 'animal' is a word which implies sentience and intelligence.<n>6. Option C: antique shop: 'antique shop' is not an adjective that indicates being sentient.<n>7. Option D: human being: 'human being' is an adjective from the noun 'human' which indicates being sentient and aware, so it is the correct answer.<n>8. Option E: bedroom: 'bedroom' does not have any indication that the patient might be something other than 'human'.<n>so the answer is 1. Sarah found a second heart in her chest, so she might not be human.

If you want to store your curling iron in the bathroom, that's fine! There is no issue with this as storing things is not illegal in bathrooms.<n>4. OptionB walkway. It's not advised to store anything in the walkway, regardless of what the item is. This is because it's not safe or legal and you risk getting fines or being asked to move your belongings.<n>5. Option c: use. The usage of curling iron is generally very important to the people's lifestyle. For example, one cannot have a curl without using a curling iron.<n>6. Option d: hair salon. This option is too general; you don't necessarily have to take your curling iron into the hairdresser with you every time you go for a haircut. It may be safe and okay to leave it in your vehicle, but it's not a requirement.<n>7. Option e: Drawer. A drawer is a container used for storage, and storing curling irons in a drawer is often the best way to keep them organized and tidy. So we can conclude it's an option.<n>8. After carefully considering all the options it's clear that we can only eliminate options A: bathroom and B: walkway and the curling iron will be stored in a drawer<n>So the final answer will be C: drawer.<n><n>Input: Which of the following is not required in an automobile to keep it running?

Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain.

Choices:  A: think B: patent C: determined D: work hard E: relax<n>Output:		1: The question is asking why would he finally see idea become reality. 2: We then consider each of he given options.<n>3: Option A (think). The answer is that he may finally see his idea become a reality when he is able to come up with a solution to the problem.<n>4: Option B (patent). A patent is simply a document that lists the details of a particular invention or discovery in order to protect it from others who might replicate it. So while he may be able to patent the idea, he cannot patent the idea becoming a reality.<n>5: Option C (determined). We can say that once he is determined to make his idea work, he will continue working on it despite all odds till it becomes a reality.<n>6: Option D (work hard). The problem will eventually get solved and he will reach the point where his idea becomes a reality. We cannot rule out the possibility that he will work hard and eventually solve the problem and his idea becomes a reality, but we cannot say that it is going to happen for sure and hence, the answer is C: determined.<n><n>Input: I have to work through my fear so I can stop having panic attacks?

Choices:  A: lot of grief B: depression C: no spouse D: lose money E: children suffer<n>Output:		1. The question is requesting to answer the effect of divorce when two spouses are divorced.<n>2. Here are the main options. Choice A (grief), Choice B (depression), Choice C (loss of a spouse), Choice D (loss of money) and Choice E (bad effect on children).<n>3. First, Choice D needs to be ruled out as it does not apply to the problem. That kind of effect would only apply to the two spouses which is not the goal of the question. Instead, this choice is about the effect on the children.<n>4. Second, Choice E has the same cause-effect relation with the other choice and can thus be eliminated.<n>5. Finally, Choice A (grieve) appears to be the correct answer given the limited options available.<n><n>Input: What is a popular drink that is mixed with different colors of alcohol? Choices: 1.

Hence, it is eliminated as well.<n>5. Choice D: Scotch Tonic. It is indeed mixed with Scotch Whisky and ginger ale, hence; it is ruled out as well as it is mixed with Scotch, not with colored liquor.<n>6. Choice E: Pink Lemonade.

Option B: library: There may be a pencil sharpner in libraries, but it is not very likely.<n>5. Option D: stationery store. Most stationery stores will include a pencil sharpneer since sharpners are essential for writing activities.<n>6. Option A: cabinet. A pencil sharpener is likely to be located in a cabinet since there usually is a lot of other stationary items stored there.<n>7. Option C: nightstand: It is unlikely that you will a pencil sharpenners in nightstand.<n>8. Option E: desk drawe. Most desks have a drawer on the right side where stationary items are usually stored. Therefore, the question is about the right side of the desk drawer, where most people would expect to store their pencil sharpener and find it easily.<n>9. After considering all the possibilities, it is clear that pencil sharpener will most likely be stored in a cabinet near other stationary objects like paper clips, staplers etc., or it could be located in the right side of the drawer. Of the two possibilities, the first one is more likely to find a sharpener in a stationary stores and it's also more likely to locate a pencil sharpenter near other stationary objects. Therefore, the final answer should be B: stationery store.<n><n>Input:What would you do if the weather report calls for freezing rain?

Choices:  A: love B: zoo C: school D: space shuttle E: library<n>Output:		If you ask most people what they could do on Mars, a fairly common answer would be "love". Perhaps it's because Mars looks like the Earth in a lot of ways (especially the Red Planet, which is called that due to its color), but most people don't dream of Mars for educational purposes. They don't dream of a school or library, so those two can be eliminated as incorrect answers. They don't expect to go to space camp either, so that option is incorrect, too.<n>If James were interested in science, it would be natural for him to want to do an experiment on Mars and go to the zoo to see the animals. Since this is a test, his interest in going to a zoo is what makes the correct answer E: library.<n><n>Input: The teacher called your group a bunch of jackasses.

Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain.

The “Carolina’s” can either be referring to North Carolina or South Carolina, two different US states.<n>3. Option D: fish market: there may be a possibility of fish being caught in waters of the Carolinas, but this may not necessary be a blowfish as the question specifies that it is caught instead of being found alive there.<n>4. Option A: rock band: while there is a rock band with the name Carolina, they are not associated with being from any particular state or location.<n>5. Option B: sea of Japan: the Pacific Ocean is very large and contains many seas, one of which is the Sea of Japan, but the question specifies that the blowfish was found in the Carolina’s, which can only be referring to North Carolina since the blowfish would be a strange find in South Carolina.<n>6. Option C: sushi: many sushi restaurants get their fish from fish markets, especially the ones on the coast. While it is possible that a blowfish purchased from a fish market by a sushi restaurant could be found on the coast of North Carolina, chances can be ruled out based on the location specificity specified in the question.<n>7. Option D: the atlantic ocean: the atlantic is the second of the world's three major oceans and is situated on the other side of the US.<n>8.

The shadow can appear from any object as long as it is blocking a light <n>source from reaching you and it is only blocked during the time of day when the sun is overhead.<n>5: Option C: bridge. Just like the building, the shadow from a bridge can appear from any object, and that shadow can <n>possibly be cast on the ground. <n>6: Option D: ground. The shadow can appear on any surface provided that it is in the position at the same time as the light source. <n><n>The question is asking from which of the given places does a shadow usually appear.<n>7: Option E: bright light. A shadow is the opposite of light in that one gets a shadow at a different surface.<n>Therefore, if there is no bright light, the shadow is not visible. In this case, a shadow is only visible from a building or a bridge, as they are in a position to cast a shadow during daylight hours when the sun is overhead and at the right angle.<n>So option B: building and option C: bridge are the correct answers.<n>

This is a possibility if you do not know who is speaking and cannot judge whether ignorance is an excuse. It is true that ignorance is not an acceptable excuse for committing a crime, so it is not a plausible answer.<n>4) Option B: learn new. It is true that learning something new can help you understand your surroundings better and make decisions based on facts and knowledge. However, in this context, this answer has been written as a possible response when asked about who said ignorance is an excusable crime. In this situation where the options are given to choose between, “Learn about the subject” does not make much sense.<n>5) Option C: to find the truth. This is also incorrect as ignorance being an excuse is not the truth. Therefore, either learn new or find the truth might not appear as a plausible option.<n>6) Option D: is the bliss. It is true that the answer, “learn the subject” appears as an option, but it is unlikely to work as an answer.<n>7) Option E: judge. It is not correct for a judge in a court to not know the facts of the case and judge the facts of crime. The fact that this answer is given as an option in the text might be a sign of how ambiguous the answer is.<n>8) Option A: learns the subject. This is the best answer out of all the given options as the option states that it should only be used as a possible response when the questions are asked about who said ignor is not an excuse. In other words, the answer should not be correct but should be used in correct context.<n>So the final option to choose from is:<n>Option A: learn about the subject<n><n>Input:Who created this sentence?

Choices:  A: jewelery B: fort knox C: church D: jewelry store E: treasure chest<n>Output:		1. The question is where the strategic gold reserve is located in the U.S., or in other words, what is the location of the strategic gold reserve.<n>2. There are several options: A) Jewelry, B) Fort Knox, C) Church, D) Jewelry Store, E) Treasure Chest.<n>3. Among these, option A) does not represent the location of the strategical gold reservoir, i.e., Fort Knox.<n>4. Similarly, it is expected that option D) does not represent the strategic gold reserve's location, i.e., Jewelry Store.<n>5. Option A) may point to several locations of jewelry, but it does not mention one specific jewelry store that would be referred to in the question.<n>6. Options B) and C) point to a specific location. Option A) doesn't point to any specific location, and B) and C) cannot be the correct ones. There could be no strategic gold reserve in Fort Knox. There could also be no strategic gold in Church/Cathedral or Treasure Chest (these may hold gold or gold-plated items, but they do not represent strategic gold reserve).<n>7. Therefore, Answer D) cannot be correct either, because the locations represented in B) and C) may contain gold.<n>8. Option E) will not be correct because strategic gold reserve is intended to be used in times of crisis, such as the time of war. It implies that when we may face a crisis (e.g., war situation) we would like to take the strategic gold with us. It is unacceptable to keep strategic gold anywhere and use it at our own will. For that, it should only be stored, not used.<n>9. Therefore, the only choice that fulfills all the criteria and represents what we are looking for, is location A. If Fort Knox is not mentioned in the question, we could assume that it is the default location of where strategic gold reserves are located in the U. S.<n>10. Therefore, the answer is A: Fort Knox.<n><n>Input: What does FDR mean? Choices:  a: Franklin Delano Roosevelt b: Formaldehyde disinfectant c: Freon disinfectant d: Fluoride

This choice is invalid because the supply of electricity is the responsibility of a company that supplies electricity to the electric equipment.<n>4)Option B: telephone network. This refers to the connection of phone lines, and therefore is not connected to the supply of electricity.<n>5)Option C: airport. This option refers to a connection with airports which cannot be related to the electrical equipment.<n>6)Option D: wires. This refers to the wires inside the equipment. If the wire is not connected to the electrical sockets, the electrical equipment won'tt power on. If wires are connected, then this isn't the problem.<n>7)Option E: freeway. This refers to highways and freeways. It doesn't refer to the electrical equipment<n>8)Therefore, the correct answer would be Option D: wires.

Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:Where is a road known as a motorway? Choices:  A: scotland B: europe C: race track D: new jersey E: england<n>Output:		A road known as a motor. way.<n><n>Answer: For the first question, you should look at the wording. "plumbing that would... be of use to you" would be the wording you would use for a pipe in a wall. A plumbing system would have no use for most people because they aren't even aware of it. A water fountain or home pipe, the wording is still correct here that it is a plumbing that would be of use to you. It doesn't actually say "pipe" anywhere in the sentence if that wasn't obvious.<n><n>This is a fuzzy question of looking in the right places. For the second question look at how the person worded the answer correctly. "you would not access potable." Again this person knew where to look for information and this person probably passed the interview. A road is a plumbing system that you would not access potabel. Water fountains are safe to access potable water.<n><n>Bonus tip: always answer an interview question by asking the person if they have time to explain more about the scenario in the question. Ask how they would approach the scenario. Then respond to their information with how you could approach it without stating that you disagree.<n>

Each of the answer choices has the word “talk” in them. This is because we are looking for the specific type of conversation that we would find in small talk.<n>3.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:The shark was migrating between continents, where did biologists find it? Choices:  A: fresh water B: gulf of mexico C: open ocean D: television program E: coral reef<n>Output:		2. You've probably heard of sharks migrating around continents, but you might not have heard that they can also reach deep depths below the surface. In fact, the record depth traveled was estimated to be 7,500 meters or 4.1 miles! But for this question, you'll need to know that biologists typically make their observations on land by catching different kinds of aquatic organisms using nets with fine mesh on them called nets. They also use underwater microphones known as hydrophones which pick up high frequency sounds like those made by sharks.<n>3. As it turns out, they discovered that not only do sharks migrate around the world looking for food and mates in every ocean they come across, but they also use this opportunity to swim under water in order to find hidden food sources. As long as they can stay alive at these extreme depths, these creatures will be able to migrate across any ocean on Earth! After all, if you can survive being in an aquatic environment without going too deep under water, then why not just stick around in shallower areas that are closer to land?<n>4. This leads us to our next question: where did they find him? The options provided to us are four different types of ecosystems that shark experts tend to find sharks congregating. These include fresh water, the Gulf of Mexico, the open ocean, and coral reefs. We know that sharks can swim under water as well as surface in shallow areas. Given these two facts, which option do we think is the most likely place where this unknown shark has been sighted?<n>5. Option A: fresh water. Aside from fish such as Tilapia, carp, and catfish, which live mostly on land, sharks generally don't find any benefit to migrating deep under the surface in order to avoid human activity. They're more likely to swim in fresh water during springtime because it's easy for them to see prey from higher elevations than usual due to the shallowness of the ground. <n>6. Option B: open ocean. The shark is probably migrating across an oceanic body of water and is most likely swimming close to shore in order to avoid predators. Although there isn't much to differentiate between open ocean and fresh water

Choices:  A: fresh fruit B: wine press C: fruit basket D: fruit cocktail E: picnic basket<n>Output:		8. Grape pickers are not paid by the weight of the weight.<n>9. If grapes are sent to a factory for processing, the grapes are chopped.<n>10. This results in fresh grapes that can be dried and pressed for juice or syrup.<n>11. The grape juice is put into fruit baskets and used as a cocktail mixer.<n>12. The dried grapes are used to make raisins.<n>13. The remaining grape skins are used to make wine.<n>14. Therefore, one chops a grape for a variety of purposes including for fresh fruit, a fruit basket, or a picnic basket.<n>15. However, the pickers are not paid per weight so the answer is "none of the above".

Choices:  D: holy water E: garlic F: a cross G: silver I: plastic<n>Output: 1) The question is asking how vampires, fictional creatures who can't eat regular food, keep from starving and dying.<n>2) Let's examine each of these options.<n>3) Option D: Holy water would never kill a vampire because it doesn't have a blood circulatory system. It would probably only be able to burn or irritate their skin if they make physical contact with the holy water.<n>4) Option E: Garlic is edible, just not much. Vampires could theoretically survive on its small amounts of nutrients for some time. They could conceivably smash garlic cloves as a way to kill vampires, because the crushing would release a poisonous gas like toxic sulfur compounds and other components that burn a vampire's skin. Another option would be to eat it raw. This way, garlic's sulfurous nature would irritate the vampire's mouth and throat, causing them to lose their lust for blood.<n>5) Option F: A cross is more a symbol of evil in the minds of humans than it would be to the mythical vampire. Plus, it wouldn't stop a vampire who has no fear of dying.<n>6) Option G: Silver is toxic to humans, but not to vampires.<n>7) Option I: Plastic is not biodegradable and vampires don't have mouths and lips.<n>8) Let's take a look at the remaining options that don't contain any disqualifiers.<n>9) Option C: A vampire would never

Choices:  A: airplane B: ship's hold C: boat D: truck E: train<n>Output:		1: The question is asking how you would choose to send your small cargo. The question asks about your choice for a "fast, but expensive" method. The correct choice: A: airPlane. Airplane is not expensive when you count the fuel consumption per mile. An airplane is about 6 times as expensive to operate per mile as a boat. And, for cargo, airplanes are about 10 times as expensive as railroads.<n>2: Choice B: Ship's Hold: a ship's hold is the space under a ship's deck where cargo is stored. It may be true that your cargo could fit in a ship's hold, but this requires very tight packaging and might be impossible at any distance from where you live. The capacity of your cargo may also be a constraint.<n>3: Choice C: Boat: this is the most likely choice that the cargo could fit in for your scenario. If you have some extra room, then you could put a boat in the ship's hold. Otherwise, you would not be able to fit it in if it was larger than the ship's hold capacity. The cargo would not fill a boat, because there is no room for other cargo.<n>4: C: Boat does not allow you to get anywhere quicker than a commercial vehicle could. If you are already in the city, you could use a boat.<n>5. Choice D: Truck: A truck that could hold all of your cargo is a large truck and may not fit in certain roads with limited traffic. You may also need to make some very tight packages of your cargo.<n>6. Choice E: train: the same as before. Tracks are often limited to a single load at a time, and you may not have room on the boat or truck.<n><n>input:What type of cargo is not usually safe to transport in a ship's cargo hold? Choices:  ships: boats A: airplanes B: cars C: trains D: motorcycles E: all of the above<n>output: 1. A: The question is asking about a particular cargo that is not usually safe to travel in a ship's holds. Ships often have large cargo holds, but cargo needs to be packed tight and not too big to fit.<n>2. If you're a small time traveler, your cargo carrier could never be a train

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:Where might someone find old clothing? Choices:  A: trunk B: drawer C: suitcase D: book shelf E: washing machine<n>Output:		1) The question is asking where someone might find old clothing.<n>2) We then consider each of given options.<n>3) Option A: trunk. When clothes need to be put in a trunk, it is usually for a trip away from the residence, and traveling usually means no daily laundry. The clothes worn during this time will be old, as they will not have been washed yet.<n>4) Option B: drawer. The most likely place to find an old piece of clothing by searching drawers would be in an unused drawer from the past. This drawer may be labeled "Old Clothes" or in whatever way indicates the owner knows it's there and that the clothes are to remain.<n>5) Option C: suitcase. A suitcase only contains clothes that are to be worn on a trip. Thus a suitcase will never contain old clothes and that too if not being used by the traveler.<n>6) Option D: book shelf. The only place on a bookshelf where you might find an old piece of cloth is if you're looking for old clothes of long ago. Clothes that you would find on bookshelves are almost always antique or have significant value.<n>7) Option E: washing machine. The only way a piece of cloth enters the washing machine is for the cloth to be worn; otherwise, it does not make sense to store it inside. Thus, if the questioner is asking about the place where you would find an "old cloth" rather than a "worn cloth" then putting it in the washing machine defeats the purpose of storing it in the first place.<n>8) This analysis shows that option A was the correct answer. The right option is A: trunk.<n><n>Input:What material might be used to make a suitcase? Choices: .: wood .: plastic .: cloth A: wood B: plastic C: cloth .: metal<n>Output:1) The question is basically asking what material might be used to to make a suitcase.<n>2) This is a short question which helps us to know how to use this method.<n>3) This is a multiple choice question type, each of the given choice have different meanings.<n>4) Option A: wood. A suitcase can be made out of wood, but it is not the first material that comes

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries.

What might he do to get away from them? Choices:  A: come home B: airplane C: learn from each other D: go out E: make art<n>Output:		1. The question is about Sam wanting to get away from the people he met while travelling.<n>2. We can then make note of 3 possible situations. Sam, who wanted to go home. <n>3. Choice A: Come home. Sam will need to be close by so that he can come home.<n>4. Choice B: Airplane. Airplanes fly fast and far to any destination that Sam wants to go. So Sam can get away from people and get home.  Therefore, a flight can help Sam get away from people.<n>5. Choice C: Learn from each other. This is obviously not what Sam wanted. Since learning requires active communication between two participants, which makes it the exact opposite of what he is trying to do.<n>6. Choice D: Go out. Since go means going some distance away, and out means out of the room, it can mean that if Sam goes out in a place, he would not meet people. Therefore, leaving and going out can get Sam away from people.<n>7. Choice E: Make art. The art can come from Sam’s imagination and can be something that only he knows about. Since it was made by Sam alone, he would not meet others.<n>8. So this question, Sam didn't like the company of people while travelling. What can he do to get away? He can go, or he can make art. <n>So the final answer should be A: Go or B: Make art<n><n>### Input:What is the greatest city in the United States in terms of population?

In most offices, if there are file folders, they can be kept and stored in desktop drawers.<n>2. Option B: filing cabinet. However, this is the case in all kinds of offices and not just specifically office furniture stores.<n>3. Option C: computers. In many offices, computers and computer files are being used.<n>4. Option D: desk. There are usually desks in offices, but they don't store file folders.<n>5.

Having marijuana in a small bag can make it difficult to smoke it all at one time, so the small size of the bag can make it more entertaining to smoke it piece by piece.<n>3.) Marijuana has been known both to make people happy and to make them intoxicated, so we can say that having marijuana in baggies can help make people both happy and intoxicated.<n>4.) There are no laws that prohibit marijuana possession in all fifty states of the United States currently.

And this accounts for 71% of the water in the ocean. That means that about 71% of rivers are covered by the ocean.<n>5) Only the first quarter of the earth is covered by waterfalls. This is because the waterfalls are in fact located on land.

This question assumes that the man is wearing a suit, which suggests that the suit is an outer garment that would be worn over the top of a shirt.

We need to analyze each of the options against the statement: "You do not need to run after the basketball".<n>2. Option A: get tired. We will not get tired if we cannot catch the basketball. Hence, option A is invalid.<n>3. Option B: have legs. Basketball players need to be able to run quickly (i.e., they need legs). So option B is incorrect.<n>4. Option C: skip. Skipping is a form of gymnastics which requires skill, whereas the question asks only for the ability to "run after the ball." Option C is ruled out.<n>5. Option D: not fat. Obviously, a basketball player needs to be in good physical shape, and hence, fat is not helpful here.<n>6. Option E: look first. The statement "You do not need (to) run after the basketball" is a special type of phrase known as an 'advertisement.' This indicates that this is an informal conversation between two people, and thus, looking first does not hurt.<n><n>So the final answer for the statement "You do not have to run after the ball" is "E: look first"<n><n><n>Input: How do you spell cat?

Choices:  A: candy store B: butcher shop C: kitchen D: auto repair shop E: post office<n>Output:		1.“Where do you buy treets?” here the question is clear that he wants to buy treats for his kids so we cannot give the answer of “auto repair shop” as the reason is not that you buy treats for your kids over a counter but you simply use counter in a repair shop. For these reasons, we can reject the answer of “auto-repair shop”.<n>2.“Where do you buy things for the kitchen?” in this question, we look at the word “for”, if a sentence contains the word “for” then it denotes a purpose and in this sentence there is a purpose for buying things <n>so the answer can not be “baby store” as kids and babies are not related to the kitchen.<n>3.”where do you buy treets over the counter”  here the question is clear again that we have to buy treats for our kids over a counter. “Kitchen” and “post office” do not have the same meaning here so the answer can not be kitchen and post office. “auto repair shop” can not be the answer as we have not specified anything about a repair shop<n>4. “buy things for the store” here the word “for” is used which denotes purpose or intent. From the previous statement, this is not the answer as the purpose of buying things for the store is not there. “Butcher shop” can not be correct as “butcher shop” is used to buy meat or vegetable and not the things for the store.<n>5. “butcher shop” can not answer the question as meat and vegetables are not something that kids love to eat or love to get.<n>6.“buy treets for kids over the counter” again the question is clear that we have to answer on the basis of buying treats for kids.<n><n>#### Conclusion:<n><n>1. “Butcher shop, kitchen, and auto repair shop” gives us the answer to where we can buy things for the kitchen.<n>2. “Buying something for the post office and butcher shop” gives us the correct answer of where we buy something for the kitchen.<n>3. “auto repair shop, butcher shop, post office and the kitchen repair all kids” gives us the answer of where to buy treats for the kids over a counter

He never meant to damage what? Choices:  A: friend's house B: curtains C: space shuttle D: front door E: classroom<n>Output:		1<n><n>2.<n>In the statement, "John felt guilty". The word 'guilty' means John thinks he has been wrong in the damage to 'friend's house', 'curtains', etc., but not the damage to the 'classroom', so the answer will be the damage to 'friend’s house’, 'curtains'.<n>3. The word 'damage' has been repeated which indicates it as a key word to differentiate these options.<n>4. From the 'damage to...', we can identify that options A - D are all damage the places.<n>5. Out of the 4 options, A and B are the damage to the places that John has done with his own hand. Therefore, they can be considered and the options can be reduced to A, B<n>6. However, the damage to the'space shuttle' doesn't sound serious - it doesn't specify how the damage is caused or how severe it is. Therefore, we can exclude the option A - B and eliminate the answer to 'friend’s House’, 'curtain'.<n>7.

Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water.

Choices:  A: book robber B: he had a word with the driver. C: believe guilty D: direct traffic E: wave on<n>Output:		1 If we read the question carefully and understand the scenario, the police man is waving flare to direct the traffic.<n>2 The question then asks us what he is doing with the impatient driver.<n>3 Option A: book robber. There may be some cases where impatient driver may be the culprit, but the answer does not specify that. We cannot rule out the possibility that the impatient driver may have done something else like booked the police station or called the police which is relevant to the question.<n><n>4 Option B: he had a "word" (vague term) with the driver. The driver may feel bad or embarrassed for his imprudent action in being impatient, and the police man may choose to have a "word" with the driver. While this may happen, the option is too vague and not specific enough to be the correct answer.<n><n>5 Option C: believes guilty. As per the wording of the question, the police man is not looking at the driver suspiciously. He is simply waving flare and directing traffic. He is not believing the driver guilty of anything. Therefore, this option cannot be the correct answer. <n><n>6 Option D: directs traffic. This is the most specific and relevant answer as it specifies that the police man is waved flare to direct the car.<n><n>7 Option E: waves on. The "on" signifies that this is happening even as we read the question and it has nothing to do with the question and cannot be the answer.<n>So the final answers are<n> D: direct traffic<n><n><br/><n><n>### Instruction:Answer the fill in the blank questions.<n><n>The man with the big nose was really bad, but he would have been even worse if, before wearing his glasses, he was _______________ to the wall and ____________ by anyone.<n>Output:-<n>1.

That means "I speak therefore I am." Now, who's going to dispute the fact that I am? But then again, what does that say about you? Is it all just one great big question? Is that what they say? I can't be sure. Maybe so, maybe not. All I know in this life is: The mind is its own place, and in it, a universe... or at least a pretty fair amount of this universe exists. I mean, you know, like, there's no question about that. I really mean that. Because that's what they say. Anyway, I think we're here, don't you? How could we be anywhere else? That is to say, how could we even think we could be anywhere else? Now, that's not what they say though. But it's very easy to say. And that's all I mean by that. So, if you're interested in cogito ergo and if you like questions, then there you have it. That's the answer.<n>

Concert – people who go to concerts are always at the risk of being robbed and attacked<n>Home – people living in home are always under risk of burglary attempts<n>University – colleges are always critical as they have a number of people who are at the risk of getting a crime committed on them when they are not aware<n>Terminal – in an airport terminal, there are chances that a terror attack takes place and this is one of the reasons why it is so commonly criticized for having bad security<n>3. So now it is not clear from which place we would get more criticized for security.<n>4. However, we can clearly say that Concert is one of the most criticized places for security.<n>5. But still, it would not be fair to say that we get most of our criticism for security from airports because home may also get criticism for security as it is the most common place.<n>6.

Choices:  -----------Answer:------------ Answer: A) The word “some” is being used in the sentence in a sarcastic tone to emphasize you only need to be liked my one person and they do not necessarily have to be the main one in your professional life.<n><n>Input: -----------------Answer:---------------- Answer: A) The phrase “be like” is not being used correctly in the sentence. Instead of meaning act like something it really means resemble or have the same traits as. So the sentence means that if you resemble someone’s actions then you don’t need to be liked by that person professionally.<n><n>Input: We all have some traits in common.  Choices: Answer: -----------Answer:------------------- Answer:A) Because the phrase the word “some”, when looking at it from a contextual standpoint, is being used as a generalizing term. And it’s meaning something like “just some people”. Which is in contradiction with the following sentence where it’s referring to a specific thing and not a group of things.<n>

Choices:  A: happiness B: sore muscles C: injury D: perfection E: errors<n>Output:		1, In baseball, one of the major statistics tracked by teams is errors per game. This refers to the number of times a player fails to secure, hold onto, or catch a batted ball, causing a runner to advance to another base. When a player commits an error, it's counted against his individual defense statistics. Error may also be the term used to describe a mistake or oversight on a player's part, but its use in baseball is far more specific in meaning.<n>2. Baseball does not keep track of happiness or sorrow, but does keep track of injuries caused to players when they fail to properly handle batters. There is also no mention of perfection, and errors are definitely one of the few mistakes baseball track besides errors.<n>3. There is no evidence to suggest playing a part in the stat.<n>4. The answer is clearly errors.<n><n>Input: A man, a woman, and a little boy are trying to decide who will be the next president.<n><n>The man says: "I'll take a ticket and you throw away the other two..."<n><n>The woman says: "No, throw away my ticket and I'll take the other two..."<n>The little boy says: "Whose ticket did they pick?"<n><n>Output: 1:"I'll take a trip and you throw away one ticket..."<n>2:"I'll take your ticket and you throw away one..."<n>3:"I'll take the ticket and you throw away..."<n>4:"I'll throw away the woman's ticket and the little boy will throw away the man's..."<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>Solution 1:<n>I'll take a TRIP- and the man, the woman, and the little boy throw away one.

The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:What is eating too much dinner likely to result in? Choices:  A: tiredness B: living longer C: stomach ache D: illness E: acid reflux<n>Output:		1: The question is asking what is eating too much food likely to result in.<n>2. We consider each of the choices:<n>3. Choice A: tiredness<n>4. If you often eat too much dinner, you are likely to feel tired as your body has to spend considerable energy to digest excess food.<n>5. Choice B: living longer<n>6. If you eat too much dinner, your blood sugar levels might rise to the point where you may no longer feel hungry and so continue to eat even after feeling full or satisfied. This is because your body cannot store excess sugar, so it has to convert the extra energy into fat.<n>7. Choice C: stomachache<n>8. If you eat too many carbohydrates, your body will generate more gas than it can absorb and so will be forced to pass it out. This can result in stomachaches and cramps, as well as bloating and flatulence.<n>9. Choice D: illness<n>10. If you eat foods that are high in salt, you may notice swelling in your stomach and legs, feel bloated, suffer from indigestion and have mild stomachaches. If these symptoms persist, they could cause dehydration and potentially even kidney problems over time.<n>11. Choice E: acid refluct<n>12. If you eat too late in the day and then lay down to sleep, there is likely to be a sharp rise in acid levels in the stomach. This acid may be pushed back up the esophagus and into the throat (acid reflux).<n>13. These are not the only reasons why eating too much dinner may result in illness, but they're likely to be the most common ones.<n>14. The conclusion is that eating too much dinner is likely to result in stomach ache, but other diseases might also occur.<n>So the final choice is D: illness<n><n>Input: What would you do if you had access to an incredibly large amount of money?

Choices:  A: finish line B: broken bones C: broken legs D: chapped lips E: healthy body<n>Output:		1: The question is asking what might be the result of skiing.<n>2: We then consider each of options:<n>3. Option A finish line. A finish line is reached after skiing, but since it's skiing, finishing is not the actual goal. So, finish line would be not the correct result of successful skiing.<n>4. Option C: broken bones. Skiing is considered to be an intense activity, which makes broken bones a plausible outcome.<n>5. Option D: chapped lips. Skiing is an intense outdoor activity performed in cold weather, which is also the condition of lips. So, chapped lips could be considered the consequence of successful skiing. However, the actual result of skiing may vary depending on the individual, so in general, chapped lips is a plausible result of successful winter-sport activity, but it is not the correct one. But there are a many other outcome, which must also be correct.<n>6. Option B: broken bones. This, also, is possible consequence of skiing, so one could say that broken bones is also possible consequence of successful skiing, but the choice B is also wrong.<n>7. Option D: chappped lips. This is also possible outcome, same as the choice D.<n>8. Answer option choice E healthy body is not considered in the input because nothing is said about the outcome, like success or failure.<n>9. After all, considering all the options, the choice that provides an alternative result of skiing would be broken bones. So the final answer is B: broken bones<n>

The phrase in question is "for the big game," which refers to a large sporting event. The choice for the correct answer is C: table.<n>2. The structure of the sentence would be "they were getting *ing over to where" where "over to where" would be the location where the "big game" is happening.<n>3. They were getting together for the "big game," and they're taking it over to where. The prepositions over to where indicate that the event is going somewhere, so the question of where is answered by considering the location of where the event is going.<n>4. Option A: picnic. The "big game" is often seen at picnics, as it would not require a traditional table setting due to the outdoor location. <n>5. Option B: friend's houses. Some people may be gathering at their friends' houses to watch the "big game," but this is not specified in the question.<n>6. Option C: table. In this context, the "big game" would generally require a proper table to sit at, as it is an event where people watch in person rather than on television.<n>7. Option D: space shuttles. Though a space shuttle would be able to travel to a variety of destinations, it is unlikely that the event is being taken to orbit; it is not mentioned in the question.<n>8. Option E: fairgrounds. Though it could be possible that the "big game" might happen at a fairground, it is not mentioned in this context.

Choices:  A B C D E<n>Output: 1.) The first step in deciding to buy new equipment involves an estimate of how much the equipment will be used and how many additional sales it will generate. These two points are essential for any type of new capital spending, regardless of how much it costs.<n>2.) New capital investments can stimulate economic growth and create new jobs. Capital investments involve using one's own resources to produce, and therefore, are a key to economic growth. To determine the amount of new investment, one must take into account such factors as interest rates (the cost of credit)<n>3.) The decision whether or not to spend is determined by the expected rate of return on the investment, the amount of new capital that can be borrowed, and the amount to be raised by selling stock in the company. <n>

Choices:  A: injury B: death C: playing uno D: coma E: falling down<n>Output:		1.) In my opinion, D is the correct answer here since the choices are not equal. If you are jumping out of a plane because you are scared, obviously you would not be thinking about any of the other things.<n>2.) If he did sustain an injury when jumping out of the plane such as a broken leg, he could still be conscious (though he may be in excruciating pain).<n>3.) If he died from the injuries he sustained from jumping out of the air, his consciousness would not be present since there is no thought to be had at the time of death.<n>4.) Falling down cannot be happening when consciousness is lost. In order to fall down, you have to be standing. <n>5.) I believe that you would also lose consciousness if you were to be placed into a coma, so this is not an option to choose.<n>6.) There's no reason to consider these other choices because the other options are not related to the question directly.<n>7.) The options are not equal, so the final answer is D: coma<n>

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:Bob's feet hurt from running barefoot on the hot pavement.  I lost his shoes, didn't know where they landed, and had to run from the corner store to his home.  About where did he run? Choices:  A: a bed of nails B: town C: attractive consistent look D: city block E: ground<n>Output:		1) Bob's feet hurt from runing barefoot on the hot paved ground.<n>2) I lost his shoes and then had to run from the store.<n>3) We don't know where his shoes were and so we don't know where he is running to.<n>4) About where did he run to?<n>5) A Bed Of Nails: In a bed of nails there wouldn't be any foot-wear.<n>6) Town: It isn't even correct to say that there was a town there. The town might not even be close enough for Bob to be running to. It could be he was running to the next town further away.<n>7) Attractive Consistent Look: At this point it isn't clear why Bob is running. So we can't say where he was running to.<n>8) City Block: This answer is close. In the beginning of the paragraph Bob is running on the street but later on, the sentence says I don't know where they (shoes) landed and had to run from (the corner store). This makes it impossible to say city block because there won't be any shoes by the end.<n>9) Ground: In this answer, it is the only place where the sentence continues. It does not say where the shoes landed. From this, we can say that Bob had run to the ground.<n><n>Input:  What part of the body is mostly made of bones, even though it might be called a muscle?<n>Output: 1: What part of the body would have bones?<n>2: It might be called a muscule, but since even though is added, we know that it is not a muscle but something else<n>3: What part of the Body is mostly made of bone?<n>4: An arm. We can say that since bone would be mostly in our arms when compared to our legs.<n>5: Even though we might call it an arm, we know its a bone, not a muscle, so the final answer is An Arm

Choices:  A: insubstantial B: massless C: dwarf D: inconsequential E: good<n>Output:		Option A: insubstantium. According to Dictionary.com, insubstantial means "mere appearance" or "little power." So, a building that is not constructed well may suffer from defects, resulting in insubstantial construction. Furthermore, if a building is not constructed well, it might not last long, so it would "not be constructed well" because it would be "insubstantial."<n>Therefore, the answer is A: insubstantual.<n><n>Input: What do you say to a friend who tells you they had difficulty understanding you when you were speaking? Choices: 1: That sounds great. 2: Thank you for understanding me. 3: Good, thank you! 4: Nice. 5: You’re welcome.<n>Output:  Option 4: "Nice" is the most appropriate since it is a polite and positive response, while "good," "thank you," and "that sounds great" sound too casual and informal to be used in that context.<n><n>Input:Who was the first to know you would be working with computers? Choices:  a: your father  b: your instructor  c: your father’s instructor<n>Output:<n>Option A: your instructor.<n><n>Input: Which is the most dangerous animal?

Choices:  A: large house B: suburban home C: big house D: old house E: keeping personal objects<n>Output:		1) The question is asking what kind of home they sought.<n>2) Options A-E have a total count of 5, which does not match the problem statement which states one answer, which is too obvious and makes the answer incorrect.<n>3) Option A: large house. This is the most likely answer to the question that the couple is looking for, a house with a large master bedroom.<n>4) Option B: suburban home. This does not match the information given in the problem statement. It is not specified where the couple will move to, but it is most likely that they will move to a suburban area rather than an urban one, and even if they end up in an area with larger houses, there would not likely be a house with a large bedroom on its own.<n>5) Option C: big house. The word "house" used in this option refers to the building rather than the bedroom within it, and it is most likely that it contains just that, a house, no bedrooms.<n>6) Option D: old house. This option is also incorrect. The couple is most likely looking for a new and modern home, an old house is not the right choice for them.<n>7) Option E: keeping personal objects. This is one of the options that matches the problem statement and the question wording. But the other options are more correct and the least likely to be chosen.<n><n>So the final answer should be Option A: large house

Choices:  A: agreement B: to fill their time C: discomfort D: misunderstanding E: learning about<n>Output:		As we know, human beings are social animals. We seek to form bonds, maintain relationships and bond with each other. When people discover something new while talking to friends, one of the top reasons will be to continue the conversation to see where it leads. This could lead to further discovery, which is rewarding.<n><n>Input: What were some of the reasons that you were unsure about hiring a contractor to do some work for you? Choices:  a: they were expensive b: they were difficult c: they were careless d: they were unreliable e: they wanted too much money<n>Output: The question doesn't specify the type of work that the contractor is being hired for. If the work is something serious like a roof or flooring renovation, it would make sense to be very cautious in ensuring that the contractor is reliable, trustworthy and diligent. However, if the work is relatively simple like a plumbing repair, the costs may be higher if you get someone from a contracting company to do the work but the costs may also go up if you use your own plumbing supplies instead. Choosing to do the work yourself may be more economical but it also comes with the risks of using shady suppliers which could lead to inferior or faulty equipment, which can lead to more costly repairs or even make the problem worse. Therefore, it would be reasonable to be cautious when choosing a contractor for home renovations but it may not always be so critical if you are doing smaller, simple tasks.<n><n>Input:"Where there was a fireplace, that usually meant some kind of furnace in the same room.."

Where might she look for one? Choices:  A: house B: music shop C: studio D: storage E: closet<n>Output:		1: James complained that Alexa’s electric guitar was too noisy, which meant Alexa needed to get an acoustic one. She decided to go shopping at a music store. Once there, she was lucky enough to find one in the ‘Bargain’ section that hadn’t been played in a while, so she bought it.<n>2: A closer look at her options reveals that ‘B’ (music store) is the correct answer.<n>3. Choice A: If she decided to visit her house and search there, she would likely find her previous guitar. However, she was looking for a new one.<n>4. Choice B: The music store is filled with a variety of guitars, many of which are acoustic. Therefore, she is likely to find there what she is looking for.<n>5. Choice C: It’s unlikely she would buy an electric guitar in a music shop because they specialize in acoustic music.<n>6. Choice D: If she decided to go to a music studio, she might find an electric guitar – there would be no guarantee that it was an acoustic one, though.<n>7.

Choices:  A: weak B: fragile C: forceless D: regular E: flimsy<n>Output:		1) The question is asking what glass is glass that hasn't been "treated to be extra strong." It is important to note that the question does not specify the type of "extra strong" used in the question.<n>2) Option A: Weak. Normal glass is often considered weak.<n>3) Option B: Fragile. This could be a reasonable choice if the question had specified "durable glass" or a similar term, but since it does not, fragile glass can be ruled out.<n>4) Option C: Force less. This can be ruled out because "force" is often used to describe physical forces such as gravity or the push of an object.

Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8.

The engineer is sharp and therefore the alternatives should be evaluated by considering their connotations.<n>3: Option "Complimentary" is an adjective used to describe something that is pleasing, and therefore it should be rejected because an engineer's calculations are not inherently pleasing to listen to or view.<n>4: Option "Ocean" is an alternative that describes a large body of water, and given that he is an engineer, it is unlikely that he would be referred to as having a body of water similar to an ocean, which should eliminate this alternative as well.<n>5: Option "Inaccurate" is an adjective that conveys a lack of accuracy, and in order for the engineer's calculations to be inaccurate, it would suggest that he lacks the ability to calculate accurately. Therefore, this alternative should be rejected as well.<n>6: Option "Dull" is an adjective describing something that is dull or lifeless, and given that the prompt mentions that the engineer is sharp, it does not seem likely that his calculations would be described as dull.<n>7: Therefore, the only remaining alternative is "Inaccurate", and the engineer's calculations being inaccurate would be a description of his calculations that would be both inaccurate and insulting. Since they are inaccurate and the engineer is sharp, the answer is "E: inaccurate".<n><n>Input: How could the word "famous" mean the opposite of "infamous"?

Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water.

Choices:  A: attached B: nostalgic C: companionable D: likely E: close<n>Output:		1.“Someone who loves their TV” can mean they like watching TV, but we want to know how they feel about their remote.<n>2.“Likely to feel” means the speaker will probably feel this way, not that they definitely will feel this way.<n>3. “Feel” could mean emotion. If so, the option “close” may be the most appropriate, as it’s the only answer that does not include an emotion that would make the user upset.<n>4. If “Feel” could also mean physical closeness, then the most appropriate answer is “close” as that is the only answer that does include “physical”, so it indicates the speaker will be upset no matter which of the other answer they are given.<n>5. If “Feelings” meant something that the listener can see in the speaker’s face, such as the emotions being expressed by the speaker, the most appropriate answer is B”nostalgic” because that is the only answer with “nostalgic”, and “nostalgic” would be an expression of emotion by the user, and would be upsetting to the listener.<n>6. If “Feel “means “experience” than the best answer is E: “close” because it is the only answer with a sense of closeness.<n>7. After considering all the potential interpretations of each answer in terms of what the user feels about their remotes, It’s clear that option C, “companionable,” is the correct answer because it includes “closeness” along with “feelings” which would likely upset the speaker or listener.<n>So the final sentence is: A: attached 🗑 A: attached<n><n>Input: Can you make potpourri with pot or with purri?

One way to distinguish these words is through the use of font. The font we use for one word changes to show us which word it is. The change of font is called punctuation. Fonts are different from one sentence to the next. There may be many differences in a single sentence. Fonts can be used to show us many different things. For example, A font might show a period, when it is not a full stop. Fonts can also be used to show us where we should take our time when we are reading. They can also help us to remember what we have learned from our studies.<n>Input:What will you do if someone says to you, "This food is very tasty."

Choices:  a: throw it at someone b: use an arrow c: cut an arrow off d: remove the feathers e: bend the ends<n>Output: The right answer here is A: throw it at someone. 1) If we know the question, then we'll know the answer. 2) So let A be the 'right answer'. If we choose from A to E, then we can eliminate D and E by logic, as they're contradictions to the question. 3) As we're left with 4 options, our most probable choice is B, C, D, E. But option C isn't valid, as removing the arrow can't affect the direction it's facing, so there's only three options left, B, D, E. 4) But option D is too easy to eliminate, as the answer isn't found in the question - it has to be in the question somewhere. There's no such implication in the question. 5) There could be some sort of implication here about 'cutting','removing feathers', and 'arrows', but option E doesn't make use of any of these possibilities. Then, option C just has an arrow with no directionality, and option E doesn't use any of the possibilities in the question, it's really too easy. At this step, we're left with only 2 possibilities: B and D. It's not much of a possibility, but 2 is a better chance than one. 6) If we choose to eliminate the option D, then we get the answer A: throw it at person. 7) Hence the answer to the question 'What do you have to...<n><n>Input: What two words are always spelled the same way?

However, if he became a member of the army simply to see things other than forts, then we can consider this an invalid answer.<n>4: Option B: orphans: The question doesn't say whether John is seeing orphans before or after joining the army, so it's not clear whether orphans are something John only saw "when the fighting started" or if orphans were already something John saw before he joined the army; either way, it's not a 100% clear answer.<n>5: Option C: battlefield: This is a common occurrence for people serving in the military. Battlefields are the common place where people serving in the military usually see things.<n>6: Option D: other countries: This is unlikely. Typically, war is fought within a country, and seeing other countries would not be something that someone in the military would see as a result of fighting. <n>7: Option E: war: This 100% fits the description of an answer that someone who is in the military would expect to see or access when they're battling another country.<n>As a result, the correct answer is option D: battlefield.

Choices:  A: liquidated B: own resources C: branch out D: commit crime E: game over<n>Output:		1..The question is asking what happens to a company when they are bankrupt, i.e., when they are unable to pay off their debts.<n>2. The company will be auctioned off or liquidated. <n>3. However, in some special cases, the company may choose to be "own resource" to liquidity the debt, meaning that it would choose to take risks and use its own resources to try and generate revenue in order to pay off its debt.<n>4. If the company does not have enough resources or is unable to obtain credit from lenders, it may choose to "branch out" or sell off some of its assets to generate cash.<n>5. If the company is involved in illegal activities, or if it commits crimes, it will likely go "game over" and face penalties or even criminal charges.<n>6. The correct answer, therefore, is: Bankruptcy, liquidation, and branching out. However, in the case of "own resources", bankruptcy and liquidation are also the appropriate answers. <n>7. Therefore the final answer is: Bankruptcy / liquidation / branching out (also own resources )<n><n>Input: Which group would be the least prepared to travel back in time to a medieval castle?

They would be least prepared to travel back to the medieval time because they lacked the technology or equipment necessary to do so. <n>8. Option 1: The medieval people themselves: They're the people from medieval time themselves. How they go back is not clearly stated in the question. But it's fair to assume that if they do, it would be due to the time travel machine that belongs to the modern people. So they have zero preparedness as they did not design any time travel machine or develop any new technologies themselves.<n>9. Option 2: Modern people: Since the medieval people are not familiar with technology like time machines, they would not be able to use those machines even if we take out a possibility of time travelling.

In this context, the children in front of Bob and Boris were acting out, which is why they were being annoying.<n>8: The correct answer is "B." There should be evidence to support your answer.

Choices:  A: public place B: roadblock C: space shuttle D: hoverboard E: supermarket<n>Output:		1: People should use a hoverboard for space exploration.<n>2: Consider the different options given and see whether each option can be used for space exploration. In contrast, hoverboards are specifically designed for space exploration and would not serve the same purpose in a supermarket.<n>3: A: public place. It is unlikely that a public space would be suitable for space exploration. The Earth's atmosphere is too hostile for most spacecraft, and there is little opportunity for interplanetary exploration on the ground.<n>4: B: roadblock. Roadblocks are not suitable for space exploration as they would limit the spacecraft's freedom of movement and could cause accidents.<n>5: C: space shuttles. Space shuttles are specifically designed for space travel, making them the most logical option for space exploration. They are capable of reaching velocities of up to 25,000 km/h, allowing them to travel quickly to other planets in the solar system.<n>6: D: hoverboard. Hoverboards can travel through space without using fuel or conventional propulsion systems, making them more efficient and environmentally friendly than gas-powered or electric vehicles. Their unique design allows them to pass through or around obstacles, such as asteroids or meteors, making them ideal for space exploration. We might need to invent them first, but for this reason, we should invent a hoverboard.<n>7: E: supermarket. Supermarkets are not suitable for space travel. Supermarkets are designed for Earth-bound life and would not be able to function in the vastness of space. In addition, supermarkets would not be able to provide necessities such as food, water, and oxygen, which are fundamental to any journey beyond Earth.<n>8: After considering all the options given, it's clear that a hoverboard is the best choice for space exploration. A hoverboard can be used to travel to and from planets and asteroids without using fuel or conventional means, making it an efficient and environmentally friendly mode of transportation.<n><n># Import all the libraries you need.<n>import requests <n>import time<n>import csv<n>import datetime<n>import re <n>import json<n>import random<n>import numpy as np<n><n><n># Read the original data.<n>df = pd.read_csv('./resources/15mooncrickets16

Choices:  A: see work B: shocked C: humor D: startled E: funny<n>Output:		You need to have context knowledge about the type of job he does so as to determine why a shock would be a surprise to him.<n>1. Option A: This was given in the past tense, meaning that at the point the question was asked, he received a shock and was not surprised by it. If he had had no previous exposure to electricity or any electrical equipment, he would not have had any prior knowledge of electrical voltage and therefore his surprise may not be unsurprising.<n>2. Option B: As electricity is a form of current flow, current flow causes an electrostatic reaction (or a shock). It is important to establish what kind of surprise he was referring to, and it would depend on the level of shock to determine the shocked reaction. Also the statement “shouldn’t have found it” suggests he's been shocked previously. So, we can eliminate option A for this reason.<n>3. Option C: This means that the voltage given was such that it didn’t actually cause a shock as the person’s body was not able to conduct electricity to cause a shock, hence this doesn’t match with the statement “he shouldn’t have found it”. Also, when touching a hot surface, the contact would be broken and the human body would not conduct electricity if there is nothing in between the body and the conductive parts. For this reason, we can eliminate option C.<n>4. Option D: This doesn’t match with his statement “I have to work with electricity”, suggesting that he is not shocked by a low voltage shock. Moreover, this option doesn’t also explain why he has to be surprised by such voltage. Also, option D shows that he shouldn’t have been surprised but was. For this reason, option D can be eliminated.<n>5. Option E: He may be surprised at first at a voltage he was expecting to be dangerous. However, if he is aware of the voltage of the electrical supply it is safe for him, and the voltage that caused a shock is similar to the voltage that would cause him the shock, then he will not be surprised why the voltage shocked him. Therefore option E can also be eliminated.<n><n><n>Input:When the fireworks were over, many people were very disappointed. Choices:  A. Some B. The C. Everyone D. Most E.

A) In a large city, there are buildings designed to protect large amounts of merchandise from heavy rain while C) shopping malls, with their underground parking lots and walkways as well as their roofs, would provide ample space to store damaged items; and E) aquariums in big cities would provide ample space for storing damaged goods would be ideal as well.<n>2. "An electronics store had damaged things from the rain. Where would these things be stored?" Since the electronics store would want to store their items somewhere safe, preferably in a location with good ventilation, so that they can be dried out by the rain.<n>3. "An electronics shop has damaged things from the storm, where should these items be stored and can I go to one?" If there were a place that stored damaged goods in a big city, it would be a great place that I could get to after a rainstorm.<n>4. "An electronics retailer has damaged things from a rain, which would be great for a city if they could be stored in any place they wanted." However, since cities usually have limited real estate available, it's unlikely they'd have enough room to put these items safely.<n>5. "An electronics superstore had some things damaged from the weather. Where should these things be stored and how would I get there?" If the superstore were located near a large city, it is likely that they would have a lot of room to store them.<n>6.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:What would release energy, but not mainly in your muscles? Choices:  A: vent B: think C: shouting D: work off E: exercise<n>Output:		1) The question is asking what would release energy, but mostly in your muscles.<n>2) There are several options.<n>3) Option A: vent. It's possible that releasing air from your lungs could produce a small amount of mechanical energy, but the vast majority of the energy released would be stored in the chemical bonds of oxygen and carbon dioxide.<n>4) Option B: think. The brain is constantly processing and analyzing information, and that requires energy, but thinking is a relatively low-energy activity compared to physical movement or exercise.<n>5) Option C: shout. Screaming or shouting releases energy from air contained in the lungs, but the vast majority is due to the action of the vocal cords, which requires energy from the muscles in the throat.<n>6) Option D: work off. Walking, running, or any other physical activity will use more energy than staying idle, but it won't be mainly in the muscles.<n>7) Option E: exercise. Exercise is a physical activity that uses energy from the body, and most of the energy used is stored in muscles.<n>8) Considering all the options, it's clear that option D, work off, is the only one that would release energy mainly in the muscles, rather than stored in chemical bonds or used for brain function.<n>So the final choice is D: work off<n><n>Input: A group of four men want to buy some fruit.

Choices:  A: school B: office building C: house D: hotel E: centre<n>Output:		1."He had a hard time…"<n>2. The word "large" is the clue that suggests that something is being compared.<n>3."He had a hard…"<n>4."It was on the second floor…"<n>5."He got lost in…"<n><n>6."Second floor" and "second story" are both acceptable variants.<n>7."Very large" is the key phrase to note in this sentence.<n>8."Very large" should be used to describe something "large" relative to a "large" thing.<n>9."However, if you are describing something as being both "very large" and "large", then you should use "very large" for both comparisons." This means that no matter how large the building is, the fact that it is "very large" compared to the building is also being described as "large". In other words, if you are describing both the "very large" thing and the "large" thing, then it should not be used twice for the same comparison.<n>10."The correct answer is A: "school". The school building is both "large" and "very large", and is therefore the only correct choice in this sentence.<n><n>Input: A couple at the party were a very well known Hollywood actor and actress.

"A very well known Hollywood actress"<n>6."The two words "well" and "very" have been used to describe the actor in a sentence. A "very well known" is not the same as a "very well-known" - it's just the same. Therefore, the two words cannot be used together to describe the same thing."<n>7." "A movie star" and "A Hollywood actor" are also acceptable variants.<n>8. "The correct answer is D: "A movie star"." Movie star" is the only acceptable answer that can be used to describe both the actor and actress in this sentence. The word "actor" is not used, so you can't use "Actor" as an option

Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:A water spout was seen in the ocean off the coast of what? Choices:  A: florida B: basement C: sink D: beach E: fountain<n>Output:		<n>The question is saying that a water spout was seen off the coast of Florida.<n><n>* Option A is incorrect. A water spout is a tropical storm that turns into a tornado over the ocean. This type of storm is more likely to be seen in Florida than anywhere else.<n>* <n><n>Option B: basement. Water spouts don't usually occur in a basement. Therefore, they should not be encountered in basements.<n>* Option C: sink. If a water spout is seen in a sink, it is likely that someone was doing something dangerous with the tap. This is not very common and is not necessarily related to the question.<n>* Option D: beach. A water spout can be seen at the beach. It is more likely to be spotted off the coast of Florida than anywhere else. This is a straightforward way to answer that question.<n>* Option E: fountain. A fountain is not likely to be seen in the ocean.<n><n>Option A is the best choice in the above example.<n>

Joe was the opposite.  What was Joe, regarding that decision? Choices:  A: being for B: away from C: combined D: for or E: conjunction<n>Output:		1. The question is about Sam's thoughts on Allison's decision (as opposed to Joe's thoughts). Thus, the correct answer is Joe was combined with Allison's opinion, as in "Joe was combined with Allison in that he was for Allison's decision."<n>2. The options for Joe being "away from" are incorrect because they refer to Allison's opposition, not Joe's.  "For or" refers to the combination; "Away from" does not.<n>3. The answer choices that start with "being" ("being" Joe's response) are incorrect because they describe Joe's response in the context of Allison's (being the response "about" Allison"). This could be true even if you were describing Joe's response, in the context of being "away from" or "combined with" Allison's response. The response refers to Allison's input.<n>4. "Combined with" is the only option that can describe both Allison's and Joe's response. "Is combined with" should also be used in this case.  Allison is the subject, and Joe is combined with (is part of) her.<n>5. Thus, the correct answer for this question is C: combined with Allison.<n>Input:The king has more than one house.

Choices:  A: town B: carpeting C: city D: phone book E: magazines<n>Output:		1) A: the question is asking us where we could find a bookstore.<n>2) B: a town could mean different things and it depends on what the original writer had in mind. We have to assume that a town is just any general area where we could find a carpeting and a phone book. This is unlikely to include a bookstore. Similarly, there could also be a phone book in a town, but a bookstore could be found in a city. So the only correct answer to this question could be city.<n>3) C & D: it is possible that both the option C and option D could be answered as a city. But option D is incorrect as in a city, a person could still find only a bookstore, but may not find a phone book.<n>4) Option E: if we're talking about a magazine, a bookstore is not required. We could simply go to a newsstand, a general bookstore or a library to buy a magazine. So option E is not the correct answer.<n>Hence the correct answer is A: city.<n>

After considering each of the given options, it can befound that none of them refers solely to objects or  activitiesto do, which was already indicated in the question.Instead, each one may refer to both an object to check outor something else.

Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:Which effect of stress could cause death if not treated immediately?

The cake can only be eaten with the ice cream if it is on the same surface.<n>3-3. Answer C: party is the correct answer, as it has a strong probability that there is ice cream present together with the cake.<n>4-4. There is no logical reason why A: earth is the answer to this question. We do not see how it can relate to the question.<n>5-5. B: movie is ruled out because movies are shown in theaters and the cake and ice cream are at home.<n>6-6.

I don't think option 'outside' is likely.<n>Option B: vacation - Vacations do tend to cause stress in people and the fear of going on a vacation will be more likely to cause stress than going home where one has a good control over their environment.<n>Option C: own apartment - If one is afraid of the dark, then the option Apartment will not help the person deal with the fear as the apartment is as dark as any other place. If the fear is of spiders or burglars, then the fear remains in the apartment, and the only solution to this problem will be a vacation from the problem.<n>Option D: Idle - If one is afraid to do nothing, then Idle will not be an option either. Instead people will prefer occupying themselves with entertainment media (TV, movies, music, etc.). The problem will always persist.<n>Option E: Neighborhood - By going outside one must go to the neighbor, which will not remove the fear since the speaker is only afraid of the darkness and nothing else<n><n>So the final answer will be option A: outside
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:John's RV needs electricity so that he can cook lunch.  Where would he go to plug in? Choices:  A: toy store B: basement C: school D: rest area E: building<n>Output:		The question is asking where John could go to plug in if he needs electricity.<n>2. We consider each of the given choices.<n>3. OptionA:toy store. This is not the best option for John because it does not provide electricity.<n>4. OptionB: basement. Plumbing is often located in the basement of a building. It is possible that John could find some usable plumbing if he goes down to the basement. However, there is no guarantee that there will be plumbing there and that the plumbing will be safe to use.<n>5. OptionC: school. Schools usually have plumbing that you could use to get electricity from. This choice is probably the best option for John to go to if he needs electricity, although he might need to ask permission or check any rules.<n>6. OptionD: rest area. There are also rest areas along highways and roads where you can access some outdoor plumbing if you follow any rules or ask permission.<n>7. OptionE: building. If John is in the city, finding a building where he can plug in is easy and reliable since there are more buildings that have plumbing that serves electricity.<n><n>So the final answer would be OptionC: school<n><n>### Output: The question is asking which car is the latest model.<n>2. We can eliminate possible options from the given answers.<n>3. Option D: minivan. Minivans are not the latest automobile model available.<n>4. Option E: sports car. This is an outdated answer since sports cars are rarely considered to be the latest model.<n><n>Then we consider the remaining options.<n>5. Option A: sedan. The latest sedan model available is actually the 2017 model.<n>6. Option B: truck. The latest truck model available is also the 2018 model.<n>And our final conclusion would be option B: truck.<n>

Choices:  A: surrender B: defence C: retreat D: cease fire E: defend<n>Output:		10. The attack in question refers to a military offensive or battle, typically launched without warning, and usually aimed at catching an enemy off guard. In military terms, a "surrender" is the defeat of an enemy through negotiation or capitulation, and therefore cannot be the correct answer to this question. A "retreat" is a strategic withdrawal of an army or other armed force to avoid or end a battle, and while this may or may not end a particular battle, it would not necessarily end the whole offensive or war. A "cease fire" is a temporary halt or suspension of fighting declared to end exchange of fire between two or more parties in a combat, war, or battle, but again, it would not definitively end the offensive or war as a whole. "Defend" means to guard, keep safe, or stand in defense of something, and this is what was needed to finish the battle, thereby ending the attack and the offensive.

Choices:  A: too much B: act dead C: die D: rush E: explode<n>Output:		1 When someone falls from a mountain, they will fall. This is because gravity will cause their body to fall downward, away from the mountain. If someone falls from a mountain they could land in a variety of places, such as in the middle of a plateau, at the base of the mountain, or even on another mountain. The results of falling from a mountain will depend on many factors, including the speed of the fall, the type of terrain they fall on, and where they land.<n>2 However, the most likely result is death. This is because mountains are generally tall and the fall from them can be very long.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:My favorite type of entertainment are rollercoasters and ferris wheels, where should I go?

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas.

Choices:  A: auditioning B: hear sounds C: listening to music D: making music E: arthritis<n>Output:		1. The question is referring to the action of watching someone perform the activity of playing guitar.<n>2. We can then consider each of the choices. Option A: Auditioning, which is the same as "trying out" for a job.  The person is trying out to be a rock star and the guitarist is auditioning for the band. Option B: Hear sounds, which means to listen to a sound (but not necessarily make the sound). The question specifies that the person watching the guitarist "is" playing guitar. Therefore, we rule out this option.  Option C: Listening to music, which means to simply enjoy somebody's music and not actually play any instrument. The question  specifies that the person performing the guitarist "is playing guitar", so we rule out this and the next option.  Option D: Making music, which means to add music, usually as part of creating a song. The question specifies that someone is "playing guitar", so we rule this option out. Option E: Arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease that typically affects the joints. This answer doesn't make sense in the context of the question and is not what the question is asking for.<n>3. Therefore, the only choice that makes sense is option A "auditioning".<n>So the final answer  would be A.<n>

Choices:  a: green b: red c: white d: yellow<n>Output: The sentence "What color best matches red?" Is in the form of a question where the answer is a noun. Therefore, it is incorrect to use the preposition 'to' when the noun should be 'blue'.<n>The prepositions to and for cannot be used to describe the noun blue when answering this question. <n>The preposition 'to' cannot be used to modify the noun blue because it is an adjective. There is only one exception, which is when it is followed by a noun beginning with the letter 'h'. For example: "blue tooth," "an hour blue," etc.<n>The preposition 'for' can be used if the noun describes another noun in addition to the action it produces (see chart in class).<n><n>Output: What an absolute beer can.<n>This sentence is an example of asyndeton. Asyndeton is a grammatical term that means the lack of conjunctions between related phrases or clauses.<n>In this sentence, the relative pronouns "that/which" are not connecting any phrases or clauses, but serving as mere conjunctive devices to enhance the meaning of the subject "beer".<n>Output: What could you use to fix this broken carburetor?

It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:The man was playfully wrestling with a woman he was enamored with, what was the physiological result? Choices:  A: competition B: blood C: wins D: medals E: erections<n>Output:		1: The physiological reaction would depend on the nature of the wrestling activity. If it is just a friendly bout, there would be no significant physiological reaction. B) It is likely that the increased blood flow to the genitals could result in an erection. C) A woman could also experience an "orgasmic physiological reaction" (Source:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgasm) as a result of the sexual activity, which would take place between a man and a woman. However, it is doubtful to assume that the wrestling activity would produce enough of an orgasmic physiological response for it to be considered more significant than an erection. D) Medals are not typically an expectation or outcome of wrestling activity between a romantic couple. E) Erection would be the most likely physiological response following intense or sexual activity.

Choices:  A: city B: toronto C: radio station D: roger that E: medieval castle<n>Output:		1) The question is asking us to identify a business that has a "tower to transmit signals".<n>2) Let's start off with the non-towers as these should be the most common businesses for our purposes:<n>3) Option A: city. Cities are generally associated with buildings, which make it improbable that any of them have towers and even less likely that these towers are built to transmit signals.<n>4) Option B: toronto. The fact that Toronto is mentioned in the question makes us assume it's included in the choices. Therefore Toronto as a city would qualify even though we haven't ruled out the possibility of "toronto" being a radio station or some other business. In any case, even if it is a city, it would most likely still not have a tower that transmits signals.<n>5) Option C: radio station. Radio stations are very common and often have radio towers as a way of transmitting signals over long distances. Therefore, this option should definitely be eliminated.<n>6) Option D: roger that. It makes no sense for a roger that business to have a tower to transmit signals. This should be eliminated.<n>7) Option E: medieval castle. If there is a large castle tower, then it could be possible that this tower is used for transmitting something, which makes this an option. If we consider the context of the question, we can also safely eliminate the other options so it's up to an answer of option E: medieval castle.

Choices: 1. The corgi was tethered to a piece of jewelry<n><n>Output: If the corgi is tethered, there is a good chance that it was tethered to something other than a piece of jewellery. In particular, it is possible that the animal's master is holding a piece of jewelled clothing or accessory with a metal clasp (rather than a piece of junk metal). It would be difficult for the corgi to tug on this type of jewellery as it would pull against its body and prevent the animal from moving.<n><n>Input: What is the most likely reason the corgi was taming the carabiner?<n><n>Output: This question is tricky as the corgi could be trying to tame or tame something other than itself. The key to deciphering this question is to read it carefully. If the corgi's master is holding onto the clasp, it is obviously using it to hold onto something. The dog may be trying to tame that something.<n><n>Comment: Wow... amazing!

Choices:  A: food B: cargo ship C: refrigerator D: closet garage E: port<n>Output:		1. The question is not asking what would you put in a refrigerator, garage, or closet. It is the second part of the question that asks what would you put in your container.<n>2. Option A: food. You can put food in a refrigerated container, but if the container is not refrigerated, putting food in it can spoil the food.<n>3. Option B: cargo ship. Cargo ships are often large vessels that carry cargo in containers. You can store and transport food in a container on a cargo ship, as long as the container is properly sealed and insulated.<n>4. Option C: refrigerate. As it is mentioned refrigerate is an option as it can store and transport food.<n>5. Option D: closet. A closet is a separate, enclosed space or room that is attached to a larger space or rooms, such as a house or an apartment. Therefore, it is not logical to store or transport a container in a closet, as it may not be easy to access or maintain the container in this way.<n>6. Option E: port. As it is mentioned port is an option as it is used for transporting and storing a container.<n>7. After considering all the given options, it is clear option C: refrigeration is the only choice where it is logical to store or transport it in the given context.<n>So the final outcome is B: cargo ship

Choices:  A: remember B: help C: count D: winning E: dealing<n>Output:		1) What is illegal to do when playing cards at a casino?<n>2) The correct answer is B help.<n>3) Option A: Remember: Remembering is not forbidden. If you remember the face of the card that you drew before drawing it, then it won’t be a problem for you and it is completely allowable. It can even be said that this practice allows you a little advantage over your opponent as you can memorize an unfavorable card, and you will not touch it in the game. For example, if you have an ace and you remember that you have a king in hand, then you can give up your ace as the king and the Ace together make a straight.<n>4) Option B: Help: If you intend to help yourself in the game, then you must pay attention to this when playing.<n>Forbidden action is to show the player who called and the player on the call.<n>Therefore, even if you can’t see the numbers on the card, the law prohibits you from showing the numbers to the other player.<n>If a player accidentally touches or sneaks a card that he can not see, he forfeits his right to play.<n>If you find that you can not continue your actions, you will be forced to stop the game and leave.<n>5) Option C: Count: Option C Counting is a form of illegal help or cheating. Because in this way you can predict the cards your opponent has dealt.<n>6) Option D: Winning: If you want to take advantage of illegal help or cheat and try to win a cash prize, then you risk the penalty of having to pay a fine.<n>7) Option E: Dealing: The law of the casino does not allow anyone to open the card. If someone has been caught doing this, that person can be jailed.<n><n>Input: What is the only animal that can jump backwards?

It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home.

Finally, plush pillow refers to soft like velvet.<n><n>The above choices are correct.<n>Choice 2, quilted is an adjective that refers to being quilted.<n><n>The above choice is wrong.<n><n>Choice 3, the word fuzzy, in this case refers to a fuzzy pillow which is soft and fuzzy to touch (soft as in a "furry" toy). However, the question is talking about a pillow, which is stuffed.<n><n>The word fuzzy means soft and fluffy, which is not an adjective for a pillow stuffed with feather.<n><n>Choice 4, comfy refers to comfort, in this case a pillow which is soft.

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:What were southern institutions where slaves do the labor called? Choices:  A: farm B: ancient rome C: history book D: poor countries E: plantation<n>Output:		1. The question is about what were southern institutions where slaves were made to do the labor called.<n>2. Option A: farms. In the south, farms were the primary establishments where slaves worked. Plantations were much less common, and instead of plantation managers, they were often slaves themselves.<n>3. Option B: ancient Rome. Ancient Rome was in the southern part of Europe and had slavery, but it was not called after these institutions.<n>4. Option C: history books. While it is true that the study of history may be carried out in libraries or study halls, these places are not called 'history books'.<n>5. Option D: the poor countries. Slavery was not considered an institution in poor countries, especially for those that are not located in the southern hemisphere.<n>6. Option E: plantations. The correct answer is plantations instead of poor countries because a plantation is a specific type of southern institution where slavery was prevalent, and it is much more common than poor countries.

Choices:  A: meadow B: cupboard C: shed D: mail box E: cellar<n>Output:		1:The question is asking to consider a meadow, a cupboard, a shed, a mailbox, and a cellar.<n>2:A meadow: While spiders may be found in a meadow, there is little risk of a spider trying to enter the cupboard.<n>3:A cupboard: The cupboard is likely to be closed and provide limited air flow. A spider is unlikely to enter it and therefore is not worth considering.<n>4:A shed: A shed is an outdoor structure where spiders could potentially enter. However, it is possible to make entry into the shed difficult by sealing it. This makes owning a shed unlikely to result in a spider problem.<n>5:A mailbox: A mailbox is an outdoor structure that is often attached to a home or business. Mail is taken in and out daily, which increases the opportunity for spiders to access the mailbox. In addition, mailboxes are not normally sealed tightly. As a result, a spider could enter the mailbox and enter your home.<n>6:A cellar: A cellar is an enclosed structure that could be used as a home by spiders if they are not properly sealed. This is especially true for old cellars or cellars that are not used frequently, as these could be more appealing to spiders.<n>7:Therefore, based on the provided options, owning a meadow or a mailbox should be avoided as it increases the chance of a spider infestation. <n>Thus, the final answer is (C) owning a shed or cellar<n><n>Input: How could you know the difference between the real thing and a knockoff of it?

Option B: need for rest. After a fun day, the kids could want a rest but that does not take away the fun they had.<n>6. Option C: a massive bear. Here we are asked about the day. Now we cannot talk about the day as a whole, but instead, about some event that was there on that day. A massive bear cannot be a part of a day like fun and play.<n>7. Option D: playing marbles. A wild ride does not contain any marbles in it. So here, we need an option where we can talk about an event or happening. Playing marbles is one such event.<n>8. Option E: constructing. This is also not a very feasible answer. There is no information about what the kids had constructed. They may have constructed many things throughout the day but that does not mean that they would have started during the day.

Choices:  A: strongwoman B: cake C: regular D: weak E: fragile<n>Output:		1: The question asks about the correct answer to "help you keep what kind of [bowel movements]?"<n>2: If you answered A: strongwoman, then you are correct because it says "Strong laxative."<n>3: If you answered B: cake, then you are wrong because the question refers to "bowel movements" and "keep" which indicates a person's consistency in having bowel movements. Cake does not have any connection to "consistency."<n>4: If you answered C: regular, then you are wrong, because "regular" implies that it is a periodic event like clock work, and there is no connection between a regular cycle of having bowel movements and a strong laxative.<n>5: If you answered D: weak, then you are correct. A weak laxative does nothing to increase regularity of bowel movements.<n>6: If you answered E: fragile, then you are wrong. A fragile bowel is not a laxative.<n>7: Therefore, the correct answer to "Keep what kind of bowel movement?" is option D: weak<n><n>### Instruction:<n><n>input<n>1. We are given two choices: (1) A strong laxative will keep weak bowel movements regular and (2) A strong laxatic will help you keep what type of bowel movements. Choose the second sentence which is correct.<n>2. So, the question becomes: What is the difference between the following two statements?<n>```text<n>1. A strong laxative _will help you keep what type_ of bowel movements. (Correct)<n>2. A strong laxitive will _keep what kind of bowel_ in your stool? (Incorrect)<n>```<n>3. The first sentence makes sense since A strong laxative is something that will help you keep regular bowel movements. So, _will_ means "it will help you keep your regular bowel movements."<n>4. In the second sentence, "keep" is used in the sense of maintaining something. So, it means that "it will help you maintain your regular bowel movements".<n>5. We can conclude that the first sentence is correct, and the second sentence is incorrect.<n><n>### Explanation<n><n>```text<n>1) We can't use "strong laxative" and "laxative" syn

It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:If I wanted to thank someone for saying I have done a good job, what would I do?

So the choice that provides comprehensive and accurate information is Option A: math book<n>##### Note to the user, this is your own data you will be inputting.<n>So now it is your turn to provide the input values and output value to verify your code.<n><n>You are required to do the following steps:<n>1) Provide the following input:<n><n>Where could you find some pluming that would not be of value to you if you are  thirsty?<n><n>Input : Where could you find some  pluming  that would not be  of value to you if  you are thirsty? <n><n>2) Output:<n><n>The answer is : "C"<n><n>Output : "C"<n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water.

In the wilderness, they lit up what? Choices:  A: outer space B: night sky C: universe D: orbit E: the ground<n>Output:		1: The question is asking about where the stars lit up in the wilderness, according to the sentence provided.<n>2. We consider each of the given choice as possibility of the answer.<n>3. Option  A: This choice does not make sense and hence it can be discarded.<n>4. Option  B: If the wilderness was lit up by the night sky, James must have been in an astronomical observatory. This is a possibility, but we can rule it out since the question does not specify any particular observatory or instrument James would need. If James is in an observatory and is still unable to see the stars, that would mean that he is looking at the night sky from within the observatory, and not into the wilderness.<n>5. Option E: The ground makes no sense at all. James is in the wilderness so the ground must be the opposite of the wilderness! The opposite of the wilderess is, of course, the wilderness. As, James may not be in a forest or desert where the stars might be visible, he would be able to see the wilderness. Hence, the ground cannot be the answer.<n>6. Option C: Universe: this option might seem reasonable, but it is not the correct answer. The phrase "in the wilderness" indicates that we are dealing not with the universe but rather with all of nature, which includes the wilderness. Therefore, universe cannot be an option.<n>7. Option D:  This is the correct answer. The wilderness itself, according to the question, is lit up by the stars, as they may be visible in the wilderness in some cases.<n><n><n><n>

Constellations are groupings based on stars' lines of sight. They don't necessarily refer to any kind of planet unless they actually contain any.<n>3. The only thing that we know for sure is that the star must be part of the solar system, since only the planets in the solar system follow the stars' lines of sight to form constellations.<n>4. So there we can only say that the galaxy it is in consists of 1 star with 8 planets.<n><n>Input: What should you get at a pharmacist for your mom's heartburn?

The first choice in your list is "bright", which is the opposite of 'obtuse'. If you're asking if a subject has an acute angle, then the answer would be D, "acute angled". If you're asking for the opposite of an obtuse angle, it's a "right" angle.<n>3:It also does not make sense for the word to be "angled".<n>5:If you were asking for the opposite of "acute angled", it would be "obtuse", since you don't want two angles to be the same. If you were asking which is the opposite of an "acute" angle, it would be a "right" angle, since there aren't any other angles you can use.<n>6:None of the options makes sense, since we don't know what acute, obtuse, or bright means. If you were asking about an angle, then the opposite of acute is obtuse (and not bright). However, you never said this to begin with.<n>7:None of the options would work, because you never said anything about "pointing". If you were talking about a "correct" answer, then that would be A, but again, that was never the point of this question.<n><n>In conclusion, the answer is A: "correct"<n><n>Input:It is possible to ride a train, ship or airplane.

In the vast state, water sources are scattered all over. So even if the drought regulations in California has regulations for water supply, it did not mean that drinkable water cannot be refilled in that state.<n>C: Park - Park is basically a location, where trees, grass, and other natural vegetations grow freely. There may be many sources of water, which is a drinkable kind in a park. So even if the restriction in the park has a restriction on water supply, the park's drinkable water can be refilled elsewhere if the restriction is lifted.<n>D: First floor - If the swimming pool is located on the first floor, there may be various sources of water supply for that swimming pool.

The question asks which item A to D describes the fact that fish crowd together. Therefore it eliminates options that do not involve the fish.<n>5.) Option A doesn't mention grades or a desk, so it is wrong. The same is true for options C and B.<n>6). Option B and C says that people do not get grades and sit at desk but we are asked to consider which of the options A-D describe the action of crowding the fish together.<n>7.) When fish crowd together what do they do?<n>8.) The question doesn't ask whether they pigs do it, so since it doesn't say whether they do it, it implies that they do.<n>9.)

So wooded areas would be home for beavers where they can live and travel.<n>4) "B" means "by water." A "body of water" could be a lake, a river or the ocean where a beaver could swim and leave.<n>5) "C" means "in the ocean." A beaver could leave the water and travel on land which does not make sense for beaver that is adapted to live in the water instead of on land.<n>6) "D" means "the Canadian province of British Columbia."

Choices:  A: redemption B: isolation C: absolution D: great relief E: feel better<n>Output:		There are different meanings of the word "forgiveness" in the English language. In a broad sense, it refers to the action of forgiveness. In this context, it is more likely that you are giving forgiveness or showing forgiveness to a person, and not receiving forgiveness yourself. On the other hand, since it is not specified as to who is on the receiving end of forgiveness, one can speculate that it refers to who is "receiving" the effects of your forgiveness, rather than who is receiving the forgiveness itself. So the answer can be found by making a difference between two sentences of the question and examining which sentence contains the phrase "receive".<n><n>Input:What word means the lowest point of something?

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:Where do security guards usually drive around in golf carts and protect young adults? Choices:  A: concert B: home C: airport D: college E: university<n>Output:		1: The question is asking where security guards would usually drive around in golf cart's to protect young adults.<n>2. We first consider each of the given choices.<n>3. Option B: home. This doesn't make sense because homes rarely have people that need to be protected and security guards would never drive around in golf cats to protect the young adults in their home.<n>4. Option A: concert. The plumbing in concert venues might not contain any potable water because of the possibility of a chemical spill or other accident. Therefore, it can be said that most guards would not drive golf carts to protect young adults at a concert.<n>5. Option D: college. Like concert venues, it's unlikely a college would have potable water in the plumbing because of the possibility of an accident, like a laboratory spill. Therefore, the plumbing does not provide security guards with a reliable source of drinkable water.<n>6. Option C: airport. In airports, potable water can usually be found in the restrooms.<n>7. Option A, concert, is the only choice where security personnel are likely to drive golf carts around to guard young adults because of the possibility of accidental chemical spills. So the final answer is A.<n><n>```python run-examples.py <n><n><n>```<n>#!/bin/python3<n>#-*- coding:utf8 -*-<n>from collections import Counter<n><n>def main():<n>    pass<n><n><n><n><n>main()

Choices:  A: books B: zoo C: body of water D: wooded area E: animals<n>Output:		1. After looking at the options, it is obvious that option D: wooded area is the most likely answer.<n>2. We first consider each of the given word's etymological origins to see what they mean to a beaver.<n>3. Option B: The word "zoo" is a shortened form of the Greek word "zoology," which means, "the study of animals."<n><n>4. Option C: The word "body" is a short form of a Latin word "corpus," which means, "a physical structure." "Water" comes from the Proto-Indo-European root "wed," which means, "to wet"<n>5. But, beavers do not build structures because they want to study animals or study physical water elements.<n>6. Option E: The word "animal" comes from the Latin word "anima," which translates to "soul"<n>7. So beavers do not block "souls" because of some spiritual purpose. They build their damnation structures to protect and store water and food—which are resources that they use and rely on to survive.<n>8. From these facts, it can be concluded that option D, "wooded area," is the likely answer.<n><n>So the final answer that we should choose is D: wooded area<n>```<n>## Instruction:Answer the question.<n><n>```<n>Input:  In 2 + 3 = 5, the sign plus is an example of what?

'luxury' indicates that the individual doesn't require it because she has a sufficient supply of wealth to enjoy the item without sacrificing any necessities. <n>4.'sufficient' is defined as adequate or sufficient, thus implying that the individual is not in need of having the item. 5. 'extra,' by definition itself, means that it is one or more units of something more than the standard or specified number. Thus, the word suggests that the individual would not need the item. 6. "E: extra," would be the best answer, as it most closely matches the criteria of the rest of the options.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:How often are secular parties held? Choices:  A: short term B: crowd C: unpredictable D: frequent E: eternal<n>Output:		1: We see the following in the problem:<n>2: The question is asking, ‘how often secular parties are held’.<n>3: We then consider each of options given.<n>4: Option A: short-term. In most cases, secular parties are hosted to mark a special occasion like for family reunions or anniversary celebrations. Such parties are usually held in the short term, within one to seven days, and are attended by several people. Therefore, it is fair to say that secular parties are not held frequently or in a long term pattern.<n>5:Option B: large crowds. In certain cases, large groups or crowds of people may gather to attend religious services or celebrations. Therefore, for some parties, it is fair to conclude that they are attended by a large crowd, but the overall occurrence of such parties is still infrequent.<n>6: Option C: It is difficult to predict when a secular party might occur, and thus we cannot confidently answer this question. While some parties may be planned in advance, others may not be as formal or predictable, making it impossible to determine how often they occur. Therefore, the answer to this question would be unpredictable. <n>7:Option D: frequent. We can conclude that it would be reasonable for some people to answer the question with an answer of ‘frequent’ considering these options.<n>8:Option E: eternal. It doesn't follow from the options that the parties are held eternally. It could mean that the parties take place at least for an extended period of time. But still, it cannot be concluded with certainty.<n>9:Taking into account all the options, it can be seen that'short-term' is the most appropriate answer since it is the most consistent with all options given.<n>In conclusion, we can say that secular parties may not be held regularly, and the frequency of such parties can vary depending on the context and other factors involved. The answer to the question would depend on these factors and could be anything from short-term to infrequent to frequent.<n><n>Input:Is a "Hoosier" what you should be if you're from here in the midwest or a person from Indiana?

Answer B - "Illeusory" - refers to creatures that are illusory, but doesn't mean we need to look for them.<n>5. Answer C - "Elusive" - means that a creature is elusive and difficult to locate, but doesn't necessarily mean that we should look for it.<n>6. Answer D - "Spend a lot" - means we probably spend a lot of time just sleeping, but that does not mean that we need to keep a "sharp" eye out for a creature.<n>7. Answer E - "Sleeping" - also refers to spending time sleeping and doesn't necessarily mean we need to look out for a creature that's sharp-eyed.<n>8. After examining all the answer choices, it is clear that "nothing" is the correct answer, since no other answer choice implies that a sharp eye is necessary to locate the creature.<n>So the final score was "nothing"<n><n>## Instruction B

After some time, the wind might blow the sand particles to great distance and make the wood sanded.<n><n>4).Option [B): composted](https://docs1.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fdocument%2Fd%2F1N7yOiBg9iV8-bEH37qLsL7KU8WmJQZCW-mBV5b_QWyD4%3Fpref%3D2%26viewer%3Dfalse&hl=en_US): Organic wastes like dead leaves, dead animals, etc. are piled high and they are allowed to decompose into compost.<n><n>5).Option [C): warp](https://docs2.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pX5ZV8FV6_pGwu_2Wfh0K5ZnjhD-_xZUWGlX25v3Y1E/edit?usp-bui=0#gid=0):Warping is the bending of wood resulting from the relative motion between the wood and the wet adhesive used in constructing the laminate.

"Music shop" is the most common phrase. The history of the "banjo" takes place in the "coal bean", I get a -1 from misspelling of the history of the "coal bean".<n>4) Choice B: Music Store. A music store is a place where people purchase musical instruments, not an instrument in and of itself, so I'll give it a + 1 for this.<n>5) Choice C: Jug Band. I'll subtract 1 for the use of the word "jug" and add 1 for the word "band", which I believe to be common. However, I can only award + 1 for the use or combination of "jug" and "band", or "band" alone, so this is a -1 overall. (I believe the word "band" to be a positive, so I will give this 2pts.)<n>6) Choice D: United States. I will subtract 1 from this choice for the use of the acronym "US", which I find to be negative. ("Music Store" and "Band" are the greatest positives I found, so I will start here. I will give another point for the word "United"). = + 1 7) Choice E: Among Nice People. Although I love giving points for the use of the English language and the ability "of finding a banjo's history", I am forced to take 1 away. I hope I have been fair.<n>Overall, this answer "D" because history of the banjo is most well known and most widely disbursed by those who played music in a 100 years ago and today.<n><n>Input:What does the abbreviation for "PTA" stand for?

Pet shops have snakes for sale, and they may keep the snakes in warming tents, depending on the specific store. Therefore, if you visit a pet shop, you may be able to find snakes in a warm environment.<n>4: New Mexico. New Mexico is a state in the southwestern US, known for its dry and warm climate. Therefore, if you were a snake in New Mexico, you might prefer living there because it would match your preferred weather condition.<n>5: White House. The White House is the official residence and workplace of the President of the United States, who is usually male. Therefore, if you wanted to live in the White House as a snake, you could find snakes there, but it likely does not meet your preferred weather condition. <n>6: Arctic: Arctic animals may prefer warm areas in summer, as warmer temperatures allow them to be active, but when the temperature gets colder, they may seek shelter in warmer parts of the environment.

Choices:  A: damage B: cloud mind C: lower i.q D: cause illness E: cause accidents<n>Output:		1a. The question is asking what drugs do.<n>1b. We then consider each option and its respective definition.<n>2a. Drugs are substances that may alter brain function as they affect the way our body perceives sensations and experiences emotions.<n>2b. They can be classified into several major categories; alcohol, opioids, cannabis, hallucinogens, and designer drugs.<n>2c. These substances can cause addiction leading to serious health problems such as brain damage, mental illness, depression and even death in some cases.<n>2d. In most cases, they can cause impairment of physical, mental, and social functioning, which may lead to accidents due to impaired judgment.<n>2e.

That is a specific type of uniform, and the ball used in golf is of a different kind than others.<n>4) Option B: television: Watching sports is not exactly playing, but rather an activity different from playing with balls. Additionally, playing with a ball in the backyard is very different from watching people play sports on television, which is essentially spectating a ball game.<n>5) Option C: sporting goods stores. A sporting goods store would sell the various types of balls and balls with different characteristics. Sporting goods stores would be the right place to get a ball. However, this place does not represent where there are people playing with these balls.<n>6) Option D: pool table. It is possible that some pool tables may include holes where the players can insert balls. However, there would only be a few types of balls for each specific pool table, and the balls are typically not taken out of the pool table. Therefore, the best way to obtain multiple balls of all kinds would be a sporting goods store.<n>7) Option E: sporting events. This is the only place where the above scenarios are possible. To a large extent, people in uniform will play with balls.<n><n>After considering all the options, options A, B, and D represent places where people in uniform play with balls.

Choices:  A: backery B: ham sandwich C: fridge D: butcher shop E: freezer<n>Output:		1. The question is asking where meat can last a long time.<n>2. We can make the following judgments through judgemental elimination.<n>3. Option B: Backery? If the question was where meat can not last a long time, the answer would be in a backery. And why should the answer be in backery instead of a different place. So eliminating the option B will be a good choice.<n>4. Option C: Fridge? Fridge usually keeps meat fresh for a few days. After a few days, it will rot and be inedible. To keep meat fresh for a long time, it should be stored in a cold room which does not exist in most houses or homes. Therefore, eliminating the option C will be a good choice as well.<n>5. Option D: Butcher shop? Butcher shop may store meat for a long time but it's not always available to customers. Besides, the customers can only get the meat by ordering it first. So it would be inconvenient for the customers who need meat immediately and the answer to the questions should be easily accessible. So eliminating the answer D will be a good choice again.<n>6. Option E: Freezer? It can be a great answer. But meat has very low water content and thus has a very low freezing point. So no matter how cold the freezer room is, meat would always spoil before freezing. So option E is not a good answer either.<n>7. Therefore, the shortest answer has the least number of steps. The only answer that would not take too many steps is option A: Backery. Backery is a place where meat can last a very long time. The question would be answered.<n>

Choices:  A: empathy B: anxiety C: knowlege D: falling down E: hear things<n>Output:		1) The teacher told the students that listening was the main way they’d gain knowlege<n>2) The teacher has asked the students to listen properly so that they can improve their knowlege. As this question says, listening is the main way to gain knowlege.<n>3) There is no sense mentioned about ‘listening’ anywhere else in the question. So, from the question, the students should only learn knowlege. So, the choice which correctly represents what they’ll gain from listening is A: empathy or B: anxiety.<n>4) If they choose the empathy or anxiety instead of knowlege, it will not be an option of what listening can give them.<n>So the final solution by elimination is A:empathy

Choices:  A: desk drawer B: desktop C: office D: wristwatch E: city hall<n>Output:		1. The question is about identifying the location at which an accountant keeps a calculator.<n>2. There may be different locations where an accountant may keep a calculator: At their desk, on their desk, at the office, on their wrist, in their city hall.<n>3. Option C and option E could be possible due to the phrase "keep one at home and one". But the question says an accountant "keeps one", and not "keeps two".<n>4. Then we consider the remaining 3 options.<n>5. Option D: a wristwatch. This isn't a valid option because a wristwatch is unlikely to have mathematical calculation capabilities, unlike a calculator.<n>6. Option B: on a desk. This is an option, as a calculator could definitely be placed on a desk.<n>7. At this point, we are left with two options: option C and B. An accountant can always possess and keep both a calculator and a desk. And since it mentions both a home and an office, the location where an accountant could keep a calculator in this scenario is most likely at the office. So the answer is B: office.<n><n>Input: How's school going? Choices:  C: bad D: normal E: good F: horrible G: well<n>Output:1.

Choices:  A: mail box B: suitcase C: front door D: bowl E: post office<n>Output:		1) The question is asking about "delivered" by hand, which refers to mail being hand delivered by mail carrier or mailman.<n>2) Option A: Mail box. Mail boxes have letters posted on them, which are collected by mail carrier and delivered to the addressee. This does not count as person "delivering" letters through the mailbox as they have been given to the mail carrier to deliver to the person.<n>3) Option B: suitcase. Suitcases may be used to deliver letters from sender to the recipient. However, the suitcase is not a part of the post office system and is not commonly associated with post offices in this case. The question excludes it from the options as it is not being mailed through a box or post office.<n>4) Option C: Front door. The door of a home is not used to receive mail so this would not be a reliable way to find a post office.<n>5) Option D: Bowl. There is no such thing as a "bowl post office", it is clearly not a post office.<n>6) Option E: Post office. The post office is the place where posts and letters are collected and dispatched to the desired address.<n>7) It should be clear that the post office is the only choice where you can send your mail through. Mail may be delivered via suitcase, although unlikely, it is not a place where you would find mail.

The most likely thing to tell you to do if you're bored at work is to return to work as soon as possible, as there are many tasks waiting to be done.<n>3.

Choices:  A: stress B: food C: that you D: spending money E: walking<n>Output:		1."That you" would be entering the market. That you is the indirect object of the sentence and the pronoun "you" refers to the person or object you are talking to. It implies that the person or object being spoken to has entered the market. Example: "I want to thank _________ (you/everybody/whatever) for attending our event."<n>2. "Stress" is not likely to be going in to a market. The verb "to enter" typically implies being intentional or making an active choice to be somewhere, and the word stress can indicate that someone is not in a good mental state or not in control of their emotions, which is not indicative of someone actively choosing to be somewhere.<n>3. "Food" is also not likely to be going into a marketplace. It is a common noun that does not exhibit any indications of intention or choice.<n>4. "Spending money" is not likely going into the market. Since most people don't think of spending money as a tangible act, this is also not the object of the sentence and therefore not likely going into the shopping center.<n>5. "Walking" is also not entering the market. Walking is a common noun, and the structure of this sentence does not indicate that walking has a purpose or intention behind it<n>So the final answer would be ______: "That you would be entering the market"<n><n>##  Instruction:Answer the question (the question asks the user to make a prediction about their results).<n><n>###Instruction: Answer the multiple choice question (answer in the form of a single sentence)<n><n>####Question:<n><n>What is the only way to get to Almighty's house?

Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water.

Choices:  A: orchestra B: baritone woodwind sound C: symphony D: play music E: high school band<n>Output:		1.. The question is asking where can I hear a bassoon played? 2. Let us consider each of the given choices. 3. Option A: Orchesrra. Orchestra players are highly skilled and play their instruments with expertise, so the chances of hearing a bassoon sound on them is not very high. 4. Option B: Barintone.  A baritone is in the bass-tenor range, so it is more likely to produce unpleasing sounds as compared to a bassoon which is in the bass range. 5. Option C: Symphony.  Symphony is a piece of music, so it cannot be the correct answer because a piece of music cannot be played in an unpleasant fashion. 6. Option D: Play music. This should not be an answer because this gives a suggestion to play music the correct way, and there is no reason why it needs to be played in a pleasing way. 7. Option E: High School Band. A high school band is made up of students who are not skilled or experienced in playing music, so there is a higher chance that a bassoon can be heard there in an unpleasant way. 8. After considering all options, it is clear Option D: play music, and Option E: High School band are the correct answers.<n>

Option B implies that the people would control events. However, this does not have anything to do with people's minds, as minds are used for thought and control is generally done through actions.<n><n>5. Option C implies that the people would talk to each other. While talking to each other can certainly help to generate ideas, it is not exclusive to generating ideas for brainstorming.<n><n>6. Option D implies that the people would think creatively. This is similar to using your mind but only addresses one aspect of it, whereas brainstorming requires the generation of ideas using a number of aspects of the mind - attention, memory and imagination.<n><n>7.

The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8.

Where did  he go to get more? Choices:  A: desk drawer B: cup C: pencil case D: shelf E: office depot<n>Output:		The question is asking where John, a person who ran out of pencil, went to get more pencils.<n>2. We consider each of the given choices.<n>3. Option E: Office Depot. It is incorrect because running out of pencils would most likely cause John not to go to that store to buy more, since there are other places where pencils are sold more locally to him.<n>4. Option A: Desk drawer. It does not apply to this question because no information is given about where John's desk is or if it has a drawer. We cannot say with certainty that John would run out of pencils if he were to use his desk as a storage spot for pencils.<n>5. Option B: Cup. There is no sufficient information to know if John has used a cup recently or if he has a pencil cup that he may have emptied. There is also no information on whether John has access to a reusable cup for pencils. Therefore, using option B is not a correct answer.<n>6. Option C: Pencil case. It may be that John has multiple pencil cases, one of which he may have depleted of pencils. But it is not stated whether the pencils in his pencil case are the type that you run out of and need to purchase more of.<n>7. Option D: Shelf. We can determine that John is most likely out of pencils and going to get more. He has a shelf that he may have run out of pencil space on. Therefore, the correct option is E: Office Depot

Therefore, an apple imported from alaska would be considered an imported product.<n><n>Input: At first glance, you would think option b as the correct answer. However, it does not indicate that option A is incorrect.<n>After reading the next paragraph, however, we can deduce that both B and C cannot be option a, option b. Option D, Canada would be right choice because Canada is an independent county which may or may not be apart of the USA.<n>Option C, Alaska is an island, though close to the USA, it is very distant from the USA, where Option A, the USA is. Option A, the USA would therefore be the right answer.<n><n>Input: What has been said of your home town, a tree, has the same of truth of your pet?Choices: A: false B: true C: half true D: half false E: neither<n>Output: Option B, true.<n><n>The question is asking if there is truth if they said both of things to be true. We examine the options. If there is truth, there would be no "false" choice. <n>In the statement, "You have said of your home town 'it is true.'" "true" is referring to a type of truth. For instance, "A tree is a tree." could be true, in that it is true statements about trees tend to be true. This is a statement about trees that happens to be true. <n>We cannot eliminate the choices, so we assume there's two types of truths.<n>If there is no truth, it will be "false." For instance "Your name is Sam" and "Your name is Timothy" are facts about yourself to which a person can objectively respond with either being true or false because they are speaking as facts about what is true and what is false.<n>If there is some truth, then there would be some false, since there is some truth.<n>Since "it is true" could be read as a statement about the truth, it could be true. Though it is vague and doesn't give much detail, there is some truth to it which makes it valid.<n>We now assume the truths are referring to truths stated in the previous paragraph. The first statement is "A tree, a tree has the same truth of your pet." The truths about these two things are stated for

He could have had a higher need to explain love, but in this situation he has already explained it, and if he did lie about it again, this would prove that his love wasn't true.<n>3. In this situation, he cannot love me more than he loves his own life, as his own life is more important than anything. Also, he can't love me more than he would love his life if he were to die, since his life is more important than anyone's life, which includes his own.<n>4. D: no matter the amount of love he has for me, it is always inferior to his love for his own life. If he dies before me, I would not be able to love him again as he loves me now.<n>5.

Choices:  A. B. work C. D. money E. F. talent<n>Output: The question asks, what is needed to be successful in life?<n>1. Option A is incorrect as it is not a requirement needed to be successful in that life, even if one doesn't go further in their career, it gives satisfaction. Successful people don't need to achieve anything more than they do now, as for example there are many successful and happy people.<n>2. Option C and D are both incorrect as one does not need to have a very high income to feel satisfied. Even a moderate income can be sufficient, again, the amount of money should not be compared in a relative way. Being rich does not make you successful, the only thing that matter is your feeling of happiness.<n>3. Option B is incorrect as you do not need to be a worker, or have a job at all, as long as you satisfy your personal satisfaction and needs.<n>4. Option F is incorrect as talents are not a requirement to become successful. Many successful people did not have or did not develop their talents, or they had talents but didn't go to school or university, and even people with no specific talents are also successful.<n>5. Therefore, the only answer is Option E, as one needs self-consciousness

A flower garden typically has common or standard varieties of roses that everyone has. They would not have rare varieties of roses because these are specific to botanic gardens.<n><n>5) Option C: backyard. The backyard would probably have some roses which you can also grow in your garden. So there is no chance of finding an unusual variety here.<n><n>6) Option D: supermarket. Supermarket rose collection would be a collection of all roses that are common or ordinary. There is no chance of finding unusual varieties of rosens here.<n><n>7) Option E: outdoors.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:If one sees a fox and is standing in a landlocked, southern state, where is this person? Choices:  A: at the zoo B: south carolina C: hen house D: louisiana E: arkansas<n>Output:		The given options can be categorized into three broad areas:<n><n>1.A: at the zoo. You can see a fox in a zoo in a variety of places including a safari park or a petting zoo. <n>2.B: south carolina. It is a coastal state located in southern part of US. Therefore, if you're in south carolina and see a fox, then it is likely that you are in a coastal state. <n>3.C: hen house. You can see a hen house to see some farmyard animals, but not any kind of fox or lion. <n>4.D: louisiana. It is another coastal state but unlike south carolina, it's located south of the united states mainland. Therefore, if you see a fox in louisiana, you could also consider the option that it could be a farm yard that you have visited. <n>5.E: arkansas. This state borders the mississippi river and in many cases, it is a landlocked state. If you are walking in a southern, landlocked state and see a fox then this state can be arkansas if the fox is not at a zoo. <n>6.However, there can be exceptions to this answer as, for example, it is not uncommon in louisiana that you are not walking in a field with foxes. There can be a farmhouse on the side. So the final conclusion is that, given all the factors in consideration, the answer is a: south carolina<n><n>Input: What is a popular, common term that begins each of the terms below: A: dish B: boxer C: dorms D: barn E: stapler<n>Output: The answers follow a pattern.<n><n>1.Option:A. dish, boxer. No matter how you look at it, none of these answers are common terms and it is a rare occurrence for a word to have dish or boxer as its first part, indicating the word is not common. <n>2.Option:B. dorms, barn. There can be some exceptions but the fact is that there are not many dorms or barns that start with those letters so they must be considered uncommon and non-popular. <n>3:Option:C: stapler

What might this hole be called? Choices:  A: hill B: gorge C: sandplain D: cliff E: mountain<n>Output:		1 Sam is looking at a large hole that is flat at the base and steep slopes.  If you stood inside the hole, you would not be standing on either sides but rather somewhere in the middle, and there is a big circular opening.  This big circular opening seems to have been created by some powerful force that created a deep hole or well.<n>2. The hole is called a crater.<n>3.  Choice A, hill, suggests an elevated structure or ridge where you would be standing on the sides.  Also, since hills are elevated structures, you could stand on anything.<n>4.  Choice B, gorge, suggests a narrow valley.  It would have tall slopes on both sides, thus different from the given crater.<n>5.  Choice E, Mountain, doesn't make much sense.  You can look from a mountain top to see the crater, but you can't see the crater from the mountain top.<n>6.  Choice C, sandplain, seems to describe what you could find somewhere else except for a crater.<n>7.  Choice D, cliff, also doesn't make much of sense.  A cliff would have steep slopes on both of its sides, but a crater has much more gentle slope on one of its sides.<n>8.  After evaluating all possible answers, the only correct answer is Choice A, hill.<n><n>

Choices:  A: expect to die B: believe in god C: stay in D: watch movies E: eat corn<n>Output:		1 A: Eat Corn<n>2. Why is it true?<n>3. Option A "Like to die” is not a valid option because popping, grilled, and canning meat will involve eating, which means that the right answer is "to eat".<n>4. Option B "believe in god" is not a valid option. People could believe in god and not eat; they could watch TV and still believe in god. Therefore, the right answer is “to eat”.<n>5. Option C "Stay in" is not a valid answer because of the wording. There is a difference between watching a movie at home versus watching a movie in a movie theater. So the correct answer must be "To eat".<n>6. Option D "Watch movies" is not a valid choice. Eating meat is a common activity for most people, but if they could die from watching a movie or television show, then the answer is "To eat".<n>7. It is important to remember that while you can pop, grill, and can corn yourself, you cannot just eat it.

Option C, "ask questions", includes asking questions to gain knowledge but does not always involve studying together. When students in high school chemistry classes ask a question of their teacher, it is often during a lecture, so these answers may not necessarily be correct.<n><n>5. Option D, "further education", means to continue to learn in areas you may be already studying or with more advanced lessons, but it does not necessarily involve studying together in a classroom setting.<n><n>6. Option E, "study together" is the only answer where students are actively studying together, and the question and answer nature of their study does not usually require or encompass philosophical concepts or topics that must be answered correctly.<n>So the correct answer is C: ask questions.<n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:If I screw a chain ring onto something, what am I fixing? Choices:  A: necklace B: wall outlet fixture C: tool box D: computer E: motorcycle<n>Output:		1 A is incorrect because a chain ring is not a necklace. In order for it to be a necklace, something else will need to be added.<n>2. B is incorrect because a chainring is a component of a bicycle that is fixed onto the wheel by bolts and not screws, thus, a necklace<n>3. C is incorrect because a chaining ring is not a tool box because, although it's likely that a tool box (and any tools inside it) could be fixed to a surface, in that case, the surface would have to be fixed to a wall. There's no way of telling that a chainring is being fixed to a tool box unless specified<n>4. D is correct because it's a component of a motorbike or computer to which the necklace (or chain ring) is being fixed to.<n><n><n>## 챌린지19 Day 5

Choices:  A: sheath B: sword closet C: collection D: container called scabbard E: museum<n>Output:		1) The question is asking where would you find some swards in your house.<n>2) Consider the given options.<n><n>3) Option A: Sheath. Sheaths are containers that are used to carry swords for decorative or ceremonial purposes. If you are looking for swords in your house, sheaths are unlikely to be of any help to you.<n>4) Option B: Sword closet. Sword closets are an ideal place to find swords, particularly if you are looking for functional swords, such as for self-defense or martial arts training.<n>5) Option C: Collection. Swords included in collections do not belong to any specific place and could be located anywhere. Therefore, it is not definite that you can easily find a sword in your house if you have a collection of swords.<n>6) Option D: Container called "scabbard". Scabbards, like sheaths, are used to carry swards but are specifically designed to protect the blade while it is being stored or carried.<n>7) Option E: Museum. Yes, museums generally have swords on display, and if you're lucky, you may find one in your house that you didn't know about. However, the chances of finding a sword in your house just by checking out its surroundings are relatively low.<n><n>8) In conclusion, if you're looking for a sword in your house and want to find it easily, your best bet would be a sword closet. If you don't have one, then the odds of finding a sword are slim, so you may need to check out local museums to get your hands on one<n><n>input: Would you know how to set up a 7-digit phone number?

Choices:  A: modern house B: building C: townhouse D: neighbor's house E: downtown<n>Output:		1)Firstly,the first choice of the question " What kind of house was it?" indicates that the garage should be an integral part of a building. So if we are asked to determine the kind of building, it naturally means that we can't just answer modern house or building. 2)Secondly,if this is a modern building with sensors and doors, it means that it has light sensors and automatic door system.We can see that from point 1). If we get a garage with automatic door system, and sensors and if we want to determine the kind of house then we have to think about what kind of building the garage might be? 3)The second option of the question " what kind of house was" asks us to think about the possibility of any of these possible choices from the given information provided of garage as modern house, building, townhouse, or neighbours house. The third choice or option " the garage should be a neighbor's house", tells us that the house would have neighbors.We can see that it is a townhouse by looking at option E. As we get a garage and neighbors at the same time,we can conclude that either option "downtown or a neighbor's house" cannot be a good one.And so we can conclude that option "A" must be the correct choice for the question.

It is not in the leech's interest to allow blood run free. There are cases where one must allow blood to run free, such as an accident, but that is for humans.<n>The most likely option would be 5 (leeches can study other medicines), the least likely would be 1 (heart transplant)<n>Input:In spite of having a reputation for being slow, a tortoise was able to befriend a large cat.

Choices:  A: bounce the ball B: competition C: have fun D: race E: score points<n>Output:		1). They were competing in basketball and the final thing they were all looking forward to do is race against each other.<n>2). So, if there is a competition between 2 teams than it is always possible that there will be score points.<n>3) The option “have fun and bounce a ball” makes the point that the goal is not to have only fun or bounce the ball. The goal of the game is to have fun by bouncing the ball and race against other players and score points.<n>4) So there is an option that it is not bounce the ball or have fun but they are looking to score the points. Therefore, option C “have fun” is incorrect.<n>5). There is no race in basketball game if one team does not follow any rules.<n>6.) We can say that all the teams are looking to score points instead of having fun or bounce a ball. Option B, which states that the goal is to have fun, is incorrect.<n>7). There is a race to each other so they are looking to score points and that’s their main job.<n>8). Since, according to the given question, a group of people is competing in a basketball game so they are looking for a score. This means the bounce a ball option is incorrect.<n>```<n><n>###################################################<n>##   Question:Input: It has been well observed in clinical studies how to which degree does a particular drug affect individuals.

Choices:  A: learning B: fatigue C: mercy D: empathy E: anxiety<n>Output:		2. The question is asking what you are hoping to do when listening.<n>3. Option C describes the emotion that you are hoping to feel while listening to the lecture.<n>4. You are hoping to feel mercy. It could mean you are feeling sympathetic to the problems or struggles that the lecturer must have faced.<n>5. Option D describes empathy. Even though mercy and empathy describe similar emotions, they may be distinguished by context. For example, "I feel mercy for someone" could be because they need help to solve a problem, while "I feel empathy for someone" means that they have been through something similar to you.<n>6. Option A: learning. You can learn a lot from lectures. In that case, this description applies to this question.<n>7. Option B: fatigue. Fatigue can be an outcome of listening to lectures. It can be either physical or mental, and it may occur after the end of the lecture or after the lecture continues for a longer time. The final answer is 3.<n><n>Input: What is common between fish and plants? Choices:  Fish : A: eat B: move C: breathe E: both D: only B<n>Output: 4. The question is asking about common features between "fish" and "plants".<n>5. Option C is correct as fish can breathe and move. The commonality is that they breathe.<n>6. Option B: breathe. Fish and plants share the ability to breathe. Therefore it's correct.<n>7. Option A: eat. Eat is not a commonality between "fish" and plants, so this answer is incorrect.<n>8. Option D: only B. Only option B, "both", can be chosen as the answer option since only fish and plants breathe.<n>9. After considering the given options, "Breathe" is the only common feature between "fish" and the "plants", and it should answer the question.<n>10. The final answer is C. Since "fish" and "plant" both have the feature to breathe.<n><n>

It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:A person writes a check to a clerk, where does the clerk put them? Choices:  A: cash register B: desk drawer C: pay envelope D: throw away E: box<n>Output:		1) In a check, we can see a written order for transferring money from A to B. In this situation, the written order can be referred to as an instruction. But to whom this instruction should be followed? Well, in this case, the instruction is written on the top left corner in the form of “Pay to the order of..”. This indicates who should follow this instruction. In other words, if we want to perform an action, let’s say, of paying for the goods, there needs to be an instruction. The instruction in the form of write a check and the person on whom we’re going to follow the instruction is a clerk in this case. Therefore, the person who wants to get an ordered is the clerk.<n>2) Now, the question is regarding where the clerk puts the check. Here, we can assume that after getting a check, the clerk has several options: place in the cash register, place in the desk drawer, place in the pay envelope, throw it away, or put in the box. Based on context clues, the options where the clerk can put the check are in the cash register (an electronic system where the price of items is calculated at the same time), in the desk drawe (where clerk takes the money orders, bank drafts, and other similar items), in a pay envelope (where cashiers keep notes), throw it away, or in a box (where cashiers store cash money).<n>3) So finally, we can observe that the check is written for the clerk, therefore the final answer is A (Clerk).<n>4) And the check placed either in cash register, or in a pay envelope or in the box. Therefore the placement of check is B (Clerk), therefore check is put either in cash register or in a pay envelop or in the box.<n>5) From the above observation, we can see that it doesn't matter where the clerk puts them (C), but the instruction whether it’s from the customer or from the bank is put in the check. Therefor the placement of check itself is not an important aspect in this conversation.
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas.

Choices:  A: contagious B: wrong C: last forever D: painful E: blind<n>Output:		1st Let me break down every option for you.<n><n>Option A: contagious: When someone loves someone else, they spread love to everybody, and when that happens everybody feels it.<n><n>Option B: wrong: When someone loves another person (which most people do), they sometimes see them more than usual, and when that happens they start feeling jealous, and the feeling of jealousy is what is meant here.<n><n>Option C: last forever: If you love somebody, then it lasts forever and it never ends, that is until you break up (usually).<n><n>Option D: painful: The feeling of love or the thing that makes people love something (or someone) is painful and hurts people.<n><n>Option E: blind: The feeling of love is blind. Which means that you don't look at somebody's flaws. So when one loves somebody, they are unable to see their flaws, that is the blindness (if I made any grammatical errors please correct me).<n><n>Then let move on to a real question. Since one person can't spread love to more than one person the feeling of love can be contagious but it is also blinding at the same time.<n><n>We can deduce from this that option D and option E have conflicting definitions and can't be chosen so C is the most correct option.<n><n>Input:What does the first one know? Choices:  It is one who is not a single number or alphabet. Choices:  A. "The first one" is in plural form, hence the first number cannot be an "one".<n><n>Output: This question is asking us what does the phrase "the first one" know. Because "the first one" in a singular form, the only way to answer this question we have to find something that could only be known by the first alphabet.<n>So, Let's start by excluding all the options. Since the options given are:<n>1. The first one. No one knows what the first alphabet is. It is only the first of a set of alphabets that one knows.<n>2. One person. We can only say that one person knows a particular thing after they are found out, therefor one person does not know anything.<n>3. A single number. Since there are other numbers other than the first one, a single number cannot be the

We can rule out choices that is not applicable to the question.<n>3, Choice A: call 9ll. It's not applicable to the question because you are not going to call 911 but have fun at the party.<n>4, Choice B: enjoy yourself. Choice B is applicable to the question. Choicing to enjoy yourself at the party before going to a party does not contradict the question.<n>5, Choice C: get drunk. Choosing to get drunk is not applicable to the party. This is because you don't want to get drunk at the party.<n>6, Choice D: having sex. Sex can occur anywhere. The question does not ask where you have sex but where you go to a party. So it's not applicable to this question.<n>7, Choice E: meet new people. You may want to meet new people at the party. It's not a requirement before going to the party that you meet new people but it's a bonus.<n>8, So the final answer is B:Enjoy yourself because it is applicable to the question and not contradicting to the question.

Choices:  A: supermarket B: motel C: at hotel D: shampoo bottle E: hair salon<n>Output:		7. This is a tricky sentence. Firstly, shampoo is the product that was delivered, not crate, which is the delivery man's only possessions. Secondly, when the sentence says "through a lot of it", we assume that "it" refers to crate, not shampoo.<n>7. So, crate was the item that was delivered, and shampoo was the product that was delivered. That means shampoo is not the delivery man's possessions.<n>7. Motel, hotel, and hair salon have nothing to do with the item that was delivered or the product delivered.<n>7. Therefore, the only context that fits is that the delivery man was delivering crate to the supermarket.<n><n>Input: The company was located all the way down to the coast. Choices:  A. At the coast. B. In the coast C. By the coast D. In the way from the coast E. Near, but not as far as, the coast<n>Output: 3. At the coast: It is not clear if the company was located in the coast or at the coast. It is more likely that the company was located at the coast, rather than in the coast.<n>3. In the coast: This answer is the furthest away from the original sentence.<n>3. In which country is the company located? The correct answer is that the company is located in the coast of England. 6. In the way from: the coast. You are in the way from, not in.<n>3. The other three options can be dismissed based on this information.<n>3. The correct answer is that company is located in the English coast.

Choices:  A: music store B: orchestra C: jazz band D: rock band E: music studio<n>Output:		1. A musician is most likely perform a concerto with a group of one to six musicians in a musical ensemble<n>2. There are different types of groups in which a musician is most likely the perform a concerto. For instance, an orchestra is a large group of musicians, usually between 50 and 100 members.<n>3. It's not uncommon for a musician to perform a concer to a jazz band because jazz bands were especially common form in the 1920s and 1930s during the Big Band and swing music genres.<n>4. As for the other options, it is unlikely for a musician to play with only a rock band because that genre wasn't widely popular until the 1960s, and it's rare to see someone playing a concerto in that type of set-up.<n>5. Similarly, it is unlikely for musicians to play with a music store because it's unlikely to have a large group of musically gifted people who can be called in at the last minute to play a concerto.<n>6. A music studio could potentially have a large group of talented musicians, but that depends on the particular studio and the people who work there.<n>7.

Choices:  A: see king B: hello C: meow D: drink water E: live many years<n>Output:		1 What would you normally expect a Cat to say? We can determine the answer to this based on contextual clues, cultural associations, and other characteristics of modern cats. 2 The most likely answer is "A" -"see king": this has strong cultural associations from the "Alice in Wonderland" story. 3 In modern pop culture, "say" is often used interchangeably with "talk" and "speak;" however, this may not be the correct answer. 4 "Hello" - The cat likely would not use this in its regular speaking patterns. Hello is not often spoken in a casual manner; it is a greeting that is used only when necessary. 5 "Meow" - This is a natural sound for cats, but most would not expect a cat to use it in spoken language. 6 "Drink water" - This is not typically what a cat would say in its regular speaking patterns, but it is a valid answer. 7 "Live many years" - This is also an appropriate answer, but it is not commonly used by cats.

Choices: 1. A: A: When your hair is still wet from a shower and you want to dry it quickly 2. B: When you are inadvertently pulling out a small insect that has gotten into your hair 3. C: Because if you run a comb through your wet hair, it will pull it and ruin your style 4. D: B: When you have used a cream/gel with it (because this will make your hair really hard to style and/or make it hard to comb out) 5. E: All of the above answers are accurate<n>Output: 1-A: We could answer this question to show that running the comb through wet hair is probably not a good idea when you want to dry it as soon as possible.  It would take time to dry the hair, and the act of running the comb through the hair would likely ruin the style of the hair and make drying it even longer. 2-B: Running the comb through your hair in these situations would likely pull out an insect that got in your hair and leave a bad taste in your mouth. 3-C: The answer shows that when you run a comb through wet, tangled hair it would make it more difficult to style.  You will likely have to comb it a lot of times to straighten it, which will make the hair tangled again.  So the answer shows you a bad idea in using a comb on wet hair. 4-D: The answer is that combing your hair with any cream/gel on it could make your hair hard to comb. 5-E: All the answers given were the correct answers to this question.<n>

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain.

It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8.

Rather, it moves the masts on what? Choices:  A: sailing vessel B: paddleboat C: ship D: motorboat E: tugboat<n>Output:		1) The helm is not something that you wear on your head rather it's the place where the steering mechanism of a ship is situated.<n>2) So given four possible options, it is incorrect to answer any of them.<n>3) Option A: sailing vessel. Sailing vessels generally have one mast, which is supported by the helm in some way such as a spar or boom. Since sailing vessels generally don't operate under their own power and instead rely on the wind to move them, the helm is not something they would use to navigate.<n>4) Option B: paddleboats. Paddleboats don't have masts, so the steering mechanism would not be located at the helm. They also don't typically rely on the wind to propel them, so the helm would not be needed to steer them.<n>5) Option C: Ship. Ships typically have multiple masts, and the helm is the steering mechanism on such vessels. Therefore, option C is correct.<n>6) Option D: motorboat. Motorboats don't rely on sails to power them like sailing vessels, so they wouldn't need a mast supporting the steering mechanism at the helm. The steering mechanism would instead be situated around the engine, where it is controlled for direction.<n>7) Option E: Tugboat. Tugboats also don't rely on their own power to move through the water and instead use their engines to assist them in steering and maneuvering. They typically use tugboat steering wheels located near the engine, not on a mast at the helm.<n><n>Input: The king wears a golden crown.

Option A: perfume: We can probably assume that the woman does not prefer that option.<n>3. Option B: air: It might've been possible if she had been wearing something like a mask, but she was most likely not wearing that. Therefore, spraying herself with air is not feasible.<n>4. Option C: fountain: A fountain may have contained water but it also had the risk of contaminating it which she didn't want to do.<n>5. Option D: swamp: This would be possible, but it will most likely cause her to get injured due to wild animals and other people in the swamp.<n>6. Option E: puddles: It might've worked out in favor of her if the puddle of water she chose was pure and safe to drink, but she would not have known that beforehand.<n>7.

Choices:  A: feel proud B: try to learn C: need assistance D: thank god E: read alot<n>Output:		1)The question that needs to be answered is "what would a person do if she/he wanted to get good grates"<n>2)There are 5 options to this question, but from the question body it seems that the question is asking about the correct option, in line with the context of the sentence.<n>3)The options read as follows:<n>         "A. feel proud"<n>         "B. try to learn"<n>         "C. need assistance"<n>         "D. thank god"<n>         "E. read alot"<n>4)First, what I understand from the options is that<n>         "A.Feel Proud" means feel satisfied about what ever you have already achieved, not what will be achieved in the future. So if a person is confident about his/her past performances, he/she will not have any difficulty in getting good grades in the future.<n>         "B. Try to learn" means try to study. But you can not succeed without the proper study material and study guides. To learn properly you need to be assisted by one who is well versed in that matter.<n>         "C. Need assistance" means that help you in achieving success. A person will need the help of others in different fields to achieve success. Like in doing any type of research works and experiments, one needs the help of others to get good grades.<n>         "D. Thank god" - As the previous sentence says "if a person is good enough to be thankful,he will be good enough to do whatever work and need good grades". This means that a person who has everything in his favour will not require thanking the blessings of god and he will not require thanking it for the same. He will not require god's blessing to succeed.<n>         "E. Read a lot" this means read as many books as possible or read as many as it takes to understand<n>             what you are reading. There is no other option like it. A person who have nothing to do in his or her life and not able to complete his or her duties in time will resort to reading books, to fill the time.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:What can happen in your mind while sleeping? Choices:  A: snoring B: talking C: get cold D: nothing E: might dream<n>Output:		1 We can have our mind active before sleeping.<n>2. We can also think about many things in our mind while sleeping.<n>3. Option "A: snoring" means that we can sleep but may also snore.<n>4. We cannot get cold while sleeping in the same way that we can get cold when we go out too long without enough clothing. Hence, option "C: get cold" is incorrect.<n>5. We also cannot think about nothing while sleeping but may just be sleeping. Hence, option "E: might dream" is incorrect.<n><n>Input : What can you do when you have a headache while driving, choose any one from the choices : A> take a paracetamol and drive as usual B> stop the driving completely and rest for few minutes C> take some aspirin and drive as normal D> take an antihistamine and drive as usual E> stop it for the rest of the day if you wake up too late in morning <n>Output : 1. In general, we can take a paracetemol (from any medical store) and drive as usual.<n>2. We cannot stop the driving completely and just rest for few minutes because we can get late for our target location due to traffic issues. If, however, we are near the location, we may decide to stop and rest for just a few minutes. In this case, option "C: take some aspirin" may not be the correct answer.<n>3. We cannot take an antihistamin (also from any medical store) and just drive normally since it may make us doze off while driving (from driving.stackexchange.com/questions/5842/… ). Therefore, even if we get a headache, it may not be a good idea to simply take an antihistantinic and just drive as usual.<n><n>### Note :<n>These questions are not part of the coding competition. <n><n>If we find answers to most of them correct, <n><n>We may move to the next questions (32 questions).<n><n>If we feel that the answers are wrong, <n><n>We have to go back to the previous questions and try to find answers based on the coding competition.

Choices:  A: new hampshire B: dairy farm C: farm field D: texas E: county fair<n>Output:		1 If I take my heifer East of New England, the question is asking where we might end up.<n><n>2 2. We consider each of the given answer choices.<n><n>3 A: New Hampshire. New Hampshire is a state that is located in the East of United State, therefore, option A may not be the correct answer. B: Dairy farm. A dairy farm provides milk as milk is a by-product of a dairy farm, however, milk is not required by or even available in a heifer. Therefore, option B is not correct.<n><n>4 C: farm field. Plants that are grown in a farm field are grown there for purposes of feeding livestock, which is a heifer's occupation. Therefore, option C may be considered. D: Texas. Texas is a state that is in the south part of United State, therefore in case it is necessary to take the heifer to Texas, it may not be easy to get her there.<n><n>5 E: County Fair. The county fair is a place where livestock shows are held, where visitors can see heifers and their offspring, where they can participate in horse pulling competitions, and where they can learn about farming. Therefore, this could definitely be a possible destination for a heifer or another type of livestock. As a result, we may conclude that option E is correct.<n><n>6 As a result, the final answer is E: County fair.<n><n>Input:What of use would a 17 year old girl be given at a place that could prove difficult to get to? Choices: 1 B: a bicycle 2 C: A lawn mower 3 D: a broom 4 E: a wheelbarrow<n>Output: 1 A 17 year old woman is not given bicycles at places that are difficult to access since they do not fit in spaces. We can then rule out option A.<n>2 A woman that is 17 years old cannot carry heavy objects such as lawn mowers and is more likely to be given a wheelbarrow, a tool that she may be more familiar with because of its smaller size and that could be useful during difficult tasks, such as moving something from one place to another, for example, a broom might be given to a 17 year-old girl to help with cleaning or washing

It is mentioned that their last name start with a letter other than 'x'. Therefore, they are not true.<n>3) Option B: All of them who aren't from a differenr country begins with the letter x. It is not about what is they have, but only about what is their last name. It doesn't say that they are from a different country, therefore all of them may not be true.<n>4) Option C: All of them that aren’t are from a different country aren't from a country, means they have nothing to do with the last name.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:They took a break from all the rides to have lunch, while eating hamburger they talked about how they were going to what on the next ride?

In fact, it may have had some spicy and acidic ingredients that could have resulted in heartburn, making it an incorrect answer.<n>4: Option B: Have fun: This isn’t necessary to answer the question.<n>5: Option C: enjoy: This doesn’t directly answer the question. It gives a suggestion after having lunch.<n>6: Option D: gas: This doesn’t exactly answer the question either. It specifies what they experienced after having lunch, unlike the original question.<n>7: Option E: Food poisoning: Since they were discussing their plans after eating burgers, it is highly likely that there could have been some unpleasant after-effects as a result of eating the food. The option is correct and the final answer is E: food poisoning
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show.

Choices:  A: house B: fast food restaurant C: library D: conference E: paper<n>Output:		1..the question is asking where you can purchase food and eat it.<n>2..we then consider each of the choices given.<n>3. A: house. In most houses, there are likely to be a kitchen (or similar area) where you can obtain food, as well as a dining room (or similar area) to consume it. This answers the question.<n>4. B: fast food restaurant. In a fast food restaurant, they actually have "food" (a meal) that you can "purchase" and then "eat" at "tables." This also answers the question.<n>5. C: library. In library (or similar), you can purchase various snacks and food that you can consume in the dining area. This also answers the question in part.<n>6.D: conference A conference may have a "food line" where food could be purchased, and there might be places where it could be eaten without tables. This does not answer the question, however.<n>7.E: paper. You could certainly purchase a newspaper if you want to, but you can't eat it, so it doesn't answer the question.<n>8. After consulting all the answer choices, it is clear that the correct answer is B: fast food restaurants<n>So the final answer: B: fast food restaurant<n><n>Input: If you eat enough food, your body weight could increase in pounds. Choices:  A, apples B, carrots C, oranges D,, bananas E, potatoes<n>Output: 1: the question is asking if your body weight can increase in pounds, by eating enough food<n>2. we then consider each of the<n>3. Option A, apples. The question specifies "enough", but there's not a known amount of apples it would take. You'd have to know how many apples it would take to eat enough apples to increase body weight, and that's not specified here. Even if you did that, it's not necessarily a "pound" of weight increase, it could be anything up to a "pound."<n>4. Option B, carrots. As with apples, there's no way to determine carrot weight without knowing the amount "enough" would be, and even if you did, it might not be a pound increase.<n>5. Option c: oranges

Choices:  A: drinkable B: junk food C: medicine D: antidote E: nutrient<n>Output:		1) Sarah took poison by accident. This information is not sufficient to answer the question because we do not know what kind of poison she took or how dangerous it was.<n>2) Sarah found it in the cabinet. This information is not useful because it does not tell us where the poison came from and whether it was likely to be drinkable.<n>3) Sarah thought that it was what. This question is asking Sarah's thoughts on the drinkability of the substance she took. However, without information on the nature of the poison, we cannot definitively say whether it was drinkable or not.<n>4) The question is asking Sarah and not about the poison itself. This means that even if we knew all the information about the poison, we cannot answer the question without knowledge of Sarah's thoughts and beliefs.<n>5) A: drinkable is a possible answer, but we cannot use this information without the correct understanding of Sarah's mindset. This leaves us with choices B, C, D and E.<n>6) Choice B: junk food. This is unlikely to be correct as Sarah would likely consider junk food to be unhealthy and not something she would consume.<n>7) Choice C: medicine. This could be correct, but we cannot rule out other interpretations of her beliefs.<n>8) Choice D: antidote. This could be an accurate answer, depending on Sarah's interpretation of the substance.<n>9) Choice E: nutrient. This could be a possible answer, but again we cannot rule out other possibilities.<n>10) So, as we cannot definitively say what Sarah thought, all five choices are possible answers.<n><n>Input: What do you call a person who is happy all year round?

The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas.

Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:Where would there be a connection to go to another place? Choices:  A: wires B: electrical circuit C: computer network D: wall E: freeway<n>Output:		1) The question is asking us to identify the possible answer that represents "a connection to go to another places."<n>2) Consider each possibility and its relevance.<n>3) A. Wires could be used as possible connections to transfer electrical energy to other locations.<n>4) B. In an electrical circuit, electrons are transferred from one point to another through wires. So we could say that an electrical circuit provides an indirect but necessary connection between two points that would not otherwise be connected.<n>5) C. Computer networks generally use wires in order to transfer data, so this answer is relevant.<n>6) D. This answer is relevant because it is similar to wires and electrical circuits in that they are both connections that transfer energy from one point to another.<n>7) E. This answer is relevant, because it is a connection that transfers energy or data from one point to another, but not necessarily in the same way as wires and electrical systems.<n>8) As we can see, there are multiple possible answers that provide a suitable connection to other places. It is up to the question-asker, and individual reader, whether they interpret the question in a way that favors one explanation rather than another.<n>So the final answe ris D: wall<n><n>Instruction:Complete the following:<n><n>1.

Choices:  A: kitchen cupboard B: maryland C: chicken D: tuna E: pantry<n>Output:		13. The question is asking what white meat goes well with  potatos.<n>2. We consider each option.<n>3. Option “A” the kitchen cupboard, is where dishes are stored, so it does not match the requirement of the question.<n>4. Option “B” is Mary Land. It is a place and so, option B, does not match the question either.<n>5. Option “C” is Chicken. The white of a chicken could be used as white meat and a meat to put with potatos.<n>6. Option D is Tuna which could be used as a white meat too.<n>7. However, option “E” is a pantry. A pantry stores food items, so it doesn’t qualify either.

Choices:  A: tie shoelace B: rest C: tiredness D: run longer E: sit down<n>Output:		1. The question is saying that the subject's running escape did not last long once he trips.<n>2. What could've been the reason for the subject's running that ended short once he trips?<n>3. Option A, tie shoelace. Tying shoelaces wouldn't prevent such an escape from occurring, even if it reduces the time it takes to tie shoelaces one could easily sprint away, unless the running is done on a race track.<n>4. Option G, sit down. This is not a viable option as it only applies to someone not running.<n>5. Option B, rest. This is the best option as it is the only option that prevents tripping.<n>6. The question specifically says that his running "didn't last long". If we assume there is at least one second after he trips where he is still running then rest would be the only option that is able to prevent tripping. Even though it seems that rest could reduce trip, it doesn't explain why there are any trips that happen after a period of at least 1 second when there isn't enough time to rest.<n>7. Option C, tiredness. Tiredness could prevent trips, but only if its a factor that contributes to how tired they are.<n>8. Option D, run longer. Running longer doesn't guarantee that you will not trip.<n>9. Option E, sit down. Sitting down doesn't guarantee that a person will not trip.<n>10. When all these option are considered, it is clear that only Option B, rest can be a reason for why the subject's running didn't last long since tripping is prevented if the person isn't tired enough or doesn't trip<n>So the final answer it is : B: rest<n>

Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water.

It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain.

We consider each of the options.<n>3. There are five options. Two of them are incorrect.<n>4. Option A: very heavy. This is incorrect because people are playing very heavy when they want to take strong leadership positions. It is also incorrect because it does not describe a game a person would play, but rather something a person might do or carry.<n>5. Option B: video game. This option is correct because video games are games, they involve taking a leadership position, and they require the player to take a lead role. Additionally, it may require players to use lead pencils depending on the game.<n>6. Option C: news article. This is not a game people play to take leadership positions. It could be argued that news articles can be used to educate people about leadership, but this is not a playful activity in the same way as video games.<n>7. Option D: card game. Like video games, card games can involve taking leadership positions, particularly in card games that involve teams. Since card games can involve teams, it may involve taking leadership roles among members of the team. Additionally, like video games, card games may involve the use of lead pencils, depending on the game. This option is also correct.<n>8. Option E: lead pencils. This is the correct answer because lead pencils can be used to play video games like Minecraft and card games like Settlers of Catan. They may also be used for note-taking during school lectures.<n>

Choices:  A: squid B: pencil C: newspaper D: fountain pen E: printer<n>Output:		1: When we hear the phrase “print”, we normally assume that it was meant to refer to the process of printing something with a printer.<n>2: Therefore, the question can be rephrased as “what would you fill in a printer with ink?”<n>3: Option A) squid. The phrase “squid ink printer” does not accurately convey the meaning of the phrase “fill with ink”. If you wanted to print something using a squid, it would have to be by hand, and using one’s own squid ink is not a feasible option.<n>4: Option B) pencil. Using a pencil to print a sentence on a piece of paper is not feasible. Writing with a pencil is very slow, which isn't an efficient method for printing.<n>5: Option C) newspaper. While it is possible to print something by hand using newspaper, it seems odd that someone reading the question wouldn't know what this phrase means.<n>6: Option D) fountain pen. While this might technically work to print a sentence, it would require a lot of concentration and it would likely take much longer than to print using a printer.<n>7: Option E) printer. This is the only option that accurately describes what would be used to “fill” a printer with ink.<n>8: After considering all the options carefully, the correct answer is E: printer.<n><n>Input: What do you fill a boat with? Choices:  a) sand b) sail c) motor d) water fountain e) wine<n>Output: 1) When we hear the phrase boat, we normally assume that it refers to a water vessel used for transportation. It is therefore important to interpret the word filling in the question to mean adding something to a boat.<n>2) Option A) sand. While it is technically possible to fill a boat with sand, this doesn't accurately convey the meaning that the question is asking and sand has nothing to do with the transportation of goods.<n>3) Option B) sail. If you wanted to sail, you would not be filling your vessel, but rather moving it.<n>4) Option C) motor. This does not describe what the question is asking at all. A water vessel which uses a motor to travel would probably be called a "boat".<n>5) Option D) water fountain. If you wanted

It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home.

Choices:  A: go shopping B: generous C: earn money D: have money E: gift buyer<n>Output:		<n>1. The question is worded in such a way as to imply that the answer should be either "gift buyer" or "generous", as the options "earn money" and "have money" are not necessarily indicative of generosity.<n>2. Option A: go shopping. The phrase "gift buyer", which is likely to refer to someone who spends time looking for presents, can be easily replaced with the phrase "shopper". Therefore, it is possible to reword the question as follows: "If you're known for being a shopper, you would be called what?" The answer to this reworded question is option B: shopper.<n>3. Option B: generous. The question does not specify what kind of presents the individual is buying. If the presents are for family or friends, the individual is likely to be considered generous because they are buying presents for others.<n>4. Option D: have money. The question does not explicitly say that the present buying needs to be done with personal funds. Having money is generally not enough in itself to determine whether someone is generous or not.<n>5. Option E: gift buyer. The term "gift buyer' refers to someone who spends a great deal of time looking for presents. This implies that they will be buying gifts for themselves rather than for others.<n>6. After considering all the possible replacement answers, it is clear that the correct answer is B: generous.<n><n><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CzT7q.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><IMAGE></a><n><n><n>Comment: This is a good explanation.

It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:What is the opposite of a village?

Option A: rural area. A rural area can be defined as land lying outside of towns and cities and are usually occupied by farms. In the context of this question a village can be considered a town which is a group of houses and other buildings in a settlement where people live and work.<n>5. Option B: africa. A village describes the settlement that is a town, so Africa describes the entire continent which is a land mass and not a village.<n>6. Option C: ohio. Ohio is a state. So Ohio describes the state Ohio which is a town but does not describe a village.<n>7. Option D: big city. A big city can be defined as a large town with a lot of people and buildings. This definition could fit within the village category, however this is not what this question refers to with a village.<n>8. Option E: tribe. Tribes describe a group of people or a people who share a culture and live together.<n>9. After considering all these options, the answer would be that a rural area is the opposite of a Village,<n><n>Input:Can you make money from making music? Choices: 1. Yes or No 2. A: Yes 3. B: No 4.

Option a : zoo. In a zoo, you would find numerous zebras to take a look around. These are the places where people generally go to observe and learn about the animal species.<n>4.Option B: museum. In a museum, you would find numerous species of animals on display. However, a person is not likely to visit a museum just to look at zebra, therefore, this answer is incorrect.<n>5.Option C: Hospital. The question does not ask where to get information about a zebra or zebras, so a hospital is not relevant. Zebras would not be displayed in the hospital, so the choice C is incorrect.<n>6.Option D: desk. When you ask someone for an animal, like a zebra, they are likely to first look at their desk as they might have an animal poster. Although there are chances of accessing the relevant information they would refer it to some relevant place.<n>7.Option E: Opera. The question asks about Zebras not Ostriches. There are chances that some may refer to the famous opera but they are far less likely.<n>8.Considering all the above, option A: zoo is the answer.<n><n>Input: In which of the following could you take your pet to see Santa?

None of the given options can be concluded to be correct as they are all possibilities as per the question.<n>4. The "was shopping at the car dealership". 5. "a salesman does"<n>6. "the car dealer". 7 "appear suddenly" - Could be referring to the sudden appearance of the salesperson.<n>8. "bottom out" - Could be referring a car bottoming out while going downhill or through a hole in the car.<n>9."go downtown" - Could be referring the city of "downtown" as the salesperson.<n>10. "scream" - Could be referring as car salespeople often use aggressive sales tactics to convince potential customers to buy the car.<n>11. "roll over" - Could be referring car salespeople often use physical displays of the car to convince potential customers.<n>12. Option "appear suddenly" is the correct answer as it is the most specific answer and therefore, less ambiguous. Option "bottom out" is incorrect as it is not only applicable to the situation but could also be used to describe any sudden or unplanned event rather than the intent of the question. Option "go downtown" is incorrect as it could refer to both a salesperson or the car dealer, it is not more directly related to the intent of the question and does not fit best. Option "scream" is incorrect as it does not specifically refer to the salesperson and is used to describe a general negative reaction rather than what is intended by the question. Option "roll over" is incorrect as it only applies to situations where physical displays of the car are being used to convince potential customers, not necessarily related to the intent of this question.<n><n>

Option B:  Through the first option, the direction must be from one side to the other, but for this direction, a door may be a better choice. It's also not necessarily that "the most easily" must be from one side, but from one side to the next (in this case, the second side). It only matters that you end up getting to the second side by moving in one direction.<n>3. Option C: Through this, we have now been told that there is a door in both of the sides, so it is possible to be both at ease, but we're not sure we don't have a lot of time to check out a lot of options.<n>4. Option D: When you move through an open door and open windows, you've now moved from one side to the second, but you've done it in a short amount of time and in most buildings where there aren't a lot of windows.<n><n>5. Option E: Through and out.

Choices:  A: ungulate B: bomber C: body armor D: tank E: hat<n>Output:		1) The question is asking what someone would wear to protect themselves from cannon fire.<n>2) We consider each of the given choices.<n>3) Option A: An ungulate is a hoofed, or cloven-hoofed, mammal. A person cannot wear a cloven hoof to protect them from cannon fire. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.<n>4) Option B: A bomber would likely wear body armor instead of an ungulate. However, body armor would not necessarily protect them from cannon blasts, as the material can only absorb or redirect blunt force and the strength of a cannon shell would likely be too great for it to have much of an effect.<n>5) Option C: Body armor is typically made of various synthetic materials that are designed to protect the wearer from blunt force trauma. It is typically made up of several layers to ensure optimal protection, with an outer shell that is resistant to bullets or impacts. However, it may have some protection against cannon fire, depending on how it is constructed.<n>6) Option D: A tank would like wear tank armor instead of a hat. A tank can be armored and this armor is not a hat.<n>7) Option E: A hat is an item of clothing or headwear that is usually made of fabric, felt, or leather. It protects the head from sunlight and heat, and also provides warmth. A hat can possibly protect someone from sunburn, but it would not protect them from a cannon.

We look at the options in this section and determine the most likely to fit the situation.<n>3.) Option A: down a river. This is the most unlikely to be the answer as a car is not made to be put in the river and the water can damage the cars. <n>4.) Option B: city. Perhaps it is not a place to take the car to get repaired due to location, size or distance. Maybe also in city the repair shop don't have the necessary equipment.<n>5.) Option C: repair shop.

Maybe the owner think the work is costly or unnecessary so they don't want to the car to be there.<n>7.) Option E: neighbours house. This would not be correct because it is unusual to leave a car on property of neighbours as it requires long-term maintenance and sometimes a loan agreement to be made between the owners.<n>8.)

Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8.

Choices:  A: manipulate B: charming C: deceive D: exaggerate E: incompetent<n>Output:		1) "To gain her trust, the real estate agent was be very polite, delight, and all around what?".<n>2) So the question is asking what was the real estate agent.<n>3) Options:<n>4) A: Manipulate. The real estate agent may manipulate the client, but it can't be said that it was for "hair".<n>5) B: Charming. This may be the correct option as the agent may charm the client by being courteous.<n>6) C: Deceive. It may be possible that the real estate agent deceived the client.<n>7) D: Exaggerate.

It may be possible for the agent to come off as incapable.<n>9) In this case, the correct answer is (B) "Be".<n><n>Input: What did a very good person do to an evil person? Choices:  I: hurt him up badly. II: tortured him. III: murdered by evil deed. IV: he became rude. V: killed him.<n>Output:  The question: "What did a very good person to an evil person?" is being asked.<n>2) So, we consider all the given options to answer:<n>3) Option I: hurt him up, badly.<n>4) If someone is very good, they would probably be polite and good in most everyday situations. Therefore, this seems unlikely to happen to an evil person by a very good person as this would contradict the nature of the very good person.<n>5) Option II: torture him. There are many circumstances where a very good person may torture someone, for example, an evil person who wants to attack a good person.<n>6) Option III: murder him by evil deed. This seems similar to the torture option in some ways. However it's possible for a very good person to murder an evil person for good. Therefore this option is valid.<n>7) Option IV: He became rude. The actions of a very good person can be so good that the opposite person may become rude. This can be valid. However if we consider the opposite, the very good person can make a very good person very good. Although this seems to contradict, it is possible that a very good person may

In a wall, there is no possibility of any opening for any window to be installed. The space within a wall<n>is extremely confined and limited. There are no openings for windows as they cannot exist on the corners of a wall.<n><n>4:Option B: office. In an office building,<n>the walls are usually covered with paint, drywall, wallpaper or some other type of covering. If they were to<n>have windows, it would typically be on at least some part of one of the four walls in the office. It would usually be<n>impossible for all four walls to have windows. Also, the height of the windows would have to be less than six feet<n>high to be able to comfortably reach out to the windowsill without jumping up and putting yourself in great danger of<n>fracturing your legs, arms, ribs or vertebra.<n><n>5:Option C: space shuttles. Space shuttles, though capable of space flight, are constructed so that the walls remain fixed<n>and do not rotate as other spacecrafts do, such as the International Space Station (ISS). Space shuttles would not<n>have windows on the corners as it would distract the pilot in control of the ship.<n><n>6:Option D: front door. A front door is typically located to an entrance or other prominent spot within a home or office building, which typically is not near any corner. <n><n>7:Option E: tent. An open-sided tent has enough room for people and their belongings to walk around in. There is not enough room to have windows at every corner because people need to be able to walk outside of the tent<n>and enter the main entrance.<n><n>8:After considering all given options, it is clear than none of them has a lot of windows because they are mostly blocked by other materials, with some other having too limited space around to allow for windows in each corner.<n><n>So the final answer A: wall<n><n>Input:Where could you find some plumping that would not be useful to you if you were thirsty?

Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:If there is a stale smell in the air coming from the kitchen, what should one check for the source of the smell? Choices:  A: bathroom B: house C: cupboard D: space shuttle E: surface of earth<n>Output:		1: Stale smell could be coming from the kitchen.<n>2. The kitchen has many appliances like a refrigerator or a stove that might release an unpleasant smell.<n>3. Option B: House: The stale smell could also be occurring in the house due to different reasons such as an opened window, a dirty air filter, or even an inverter.<n>4. Option C: Cupboard: An empty cupboard may have exposed wood that was treated with plywood and could be giving out a musty smell due to the presence of moisture.<n>5. Option D: Space Shuttle: The smell could be coming in due to the space shuttle leaking.<n>6. Option E: Surface of earth: This option is a bit of a stretch, but it is possible that the stale smell could be caused by a gas leak. A space rock striking the earth could cause a gas leak. A nuclear test could cause harmful radiation. A UFO sight could be dangerous.<n>So the correct answer is C: Cupboard.<n><n>Input: It is time to have dinner. What should one get for the kids? Choices: 1: A: chocolate bars 2: B: fresh fruits 3: C: vegetable curry 4: D: methamphetamine 5: E: brioche<n>Output: A chocolate bar is suitable because it is both healthy and inexpensive.<n>B: fresh fruits are also appropriate since they can be cooked or served as snacks or appetizers.<n>C: vegetable curry is an Indian dish made from vegetables, spices and rice. D: Methamphetamines are illicit drugs that can produce feelings of pleasure and euphoria when consumed. These are dangerous, addictive, and expensive drugs with significant health risks. E: Brioche is a dense, butter-enriched white bread loaf with a distinctive crackling crust characteristic of breads made from wheat flour.<n>So the correct choice is A: chocolate bar.<n><n>Input: One needs to install a kitchen faucet at home.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:What would be considered a success when attempting procreation? Choices:  A: celebrate B: have party C: hear crowd go mad D: create success E: reproduce<n>Output:		1) The question is asking what would be considered a success to procreate, or to have children or offspring.<n>2) We then consider each of those options given and think about them from this perspective.<n>3) If you are trying to conceive a baby, then you might consider a successful procreation attempt to include trying all avenues of conception. Therefore, option A, "to hear crowd go mad," is out.<n>4) Option B, "have a party," is also not correct as it's not strictly necessary, and the word "procreation" is often used more in relation to having a baby rather than to a party being held.<n>5) Option C, "hear crowd go mad," is not accurate as they would not be going mad just because you had conceived a child. Therefore, it is not accurate.<n>6) Option D, "recreate," sounds the most correct of all of these choices when attempting to infer what might be considered a success, however it would not be necessarily true.<n>7) You can procreate through more than just having sex, which brings us to option E. While it may be accurate to say that having sex would be the easiest way to procreate, "to reproduce," is still more accurate by definition.<n>8) So in conclusion, out of the following options, the only one that correctly identifies a success in procreation is "reproduce," as no one would define having sex as a success.<n>So option E is the final answer.<n>

Choices:  A: safeway B: record albums C: record store D: car E: wallpaper<n>Output:		1. The question is ambiguous.<n>2. The question does not mention the availability of listening music in any of the given options. To determine the validity of the question, we consider each of the given choices.<n>3. Option 1: safeway. Safeway is a grocery retail store, which does not sell records. Therefore, it cannot be an option for where one could purchase listening music.<n>4. Option 2: record albums. A record album is not a common name for listening music anymore, so it cannot be the correct answer.<n>5. Option 3: record store. Record stores are brick-and-mortar establishments that sell records (audio, video, and sometimes other media products), which is an outdated form of playing music. As modern technology has largely phased out the need for audiocassette or vinyl records, the market for these products is not as large as it used to be. Therefore, to a modern consumer, going to a record store might not even be the most convenient option for getting audio content.<n>6. Option 4: car. In most cars, the audio system is built using CDs and/or MP3s. These can be played on all car stereo systems. This option should therefore not be the correct answer.

What is the gas in the tank being boiled? Choices: 1. The gas at standard temperature and pressure, or s.t.p., 2. The gas in the car engine, 3. The gas in the pipeline that distributes it to the car dealership, 4. The gas in the tank of a passing car, 5. The gas on the driver's side of the street<n>Output:1) Let's consider all of the listed choices:<n>Option A: The gas at standard temperature & pressure ("s.t.p.") - this is the gas inside the tank. Since the tank is "on the boil", we can say that the gas is being boiled.<n>Option B: The gas in the car's engine. This is not the case since the tank is a standalone entity.<n>Option C: The gas in the pipeline. This is not the tank itself.<n>If the tank was full, i.e. "to the brim", then I agree this would be an apt answer, but to the brim, does not necessarily imply that it's full.<n>Option D: The gas on the driver side of the street.<n>This is a bit of a stretch to get here, but since the car is moving, one can speculate that there may be some gas on the driver side, but this may not be the specific purpose for which the car owners purchase the gas. Additionally, one may argue that there could be gas flowing to this car from somewhere else, thereby "boiling" gas that does not otherwise belong to this vehicle.<n>So the final conclusion is Option A: The gas in the tank is being boiled.

Choice D: in city centre is not the right answer because, in city centre, the number of buses is very low and the people are always rushing to catch buses.<n>6. Choice C: catch bus will not be the right answer also because people can wait in a queue any where, even in the empty places in the city centre.<n>7. Choice E: school is not the right answer either because, in schools, you would wait in a queue to catch the bus, but the place is not very convenient.<n>However, there are very few chances that there is a bus station in a school.<n><n>8. Now let us consider each of the remaining options.<n>9. Choice A: maps is not the right answer also because maps do provide all the necessary information, but they are not located in the bus station.<n>10. Choice B: street is not the right answer as well because there is no bus station in the street.<n>When a bus station is in a street, the people can catch the bus any where by standing in the queue in the available space.<n>11.

After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:How do you indicate that you agree wtih someone? Choices:  A: like more B: nodding C: by wearing rings D: concordance E: shake hands<n>Output:		1: the question asks how you would indicate that you agree with someone, not why.<n>2. We look at each of the choices:<n>3. Choice A: like more. "Like more" is grammatically incorrect and would not be used to express such a sentiment.<n>4. Choice B: nodding. Nodding is not a verbal affirmation or denial of a certain opinion. Nodding is a more general way to show agreement or disagreement and in this scenario, it would not be appropriate to use it exclusively to express agreement.<n>5. Choice C: by wearing 'wedding rings. Wedding rings are a symbol of marriage and not agreement and so would not be used to do so.<n>6. Choice D: concordance. Concordance is not an indicator of agreement or disagreement, but merely a form of language agreement. For example, using the past tense "She had dinner with me last night" is concordant, but not agreement with me about having dinner.<n>7. Choice E: shake hands. Shaking hands is a gesture of greeting, and would not be used in this context.<n>8. Therefore, the only choice that can be inferred is Choice D: concurrence. This means that the choices that are excluded are A: like more, B: nodding, C: by wearing wedding rings, and E: shake hands as they do not express agreement.<n><n>In all of the test cases that we have looked at, no other choices that are relevant to the statement were left out or incorrectly inferred.<n><n><n><n>

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries.

Choices:  A: strain B: though C: happiness D: realization E: understanding<n>Output:		1. The question is a multiple choice question with 5 possible answers.<n>2. Given the wording of the question, we can deduce that the author is reading letter after letter, each of which is extremely small.<n>3. Option B: The print was extremely small, "as he was reading letter after...": As is often the case in pun-based questions on PG rated word problems, this sentence sets up a pun based on the word "strain." As he read the extremely small letters, the author felt an intense strain on his eyes. As a result, Option B: the print was extremely small, he suffered a strain on his eyes is the correct answer.<n>4. Option A and B: The print was extreme-ly small, he suffered an eye strain, "He felt an intense straini-ty of the eye." Here the author's misreading of a pun in the sentence is the source of his strain, not the print itself. Additionally, he is not actually straining his eye while reading the letters; he misinterprets the sentence and begins to strain it. Because the sentence is read, not written, in Option C it can be ruled out. In addition, when the author begins to strain his eyes, he is not doing so because the print is too small, but because the sentence in which he is reading it is too small.<n><n>Input: What do you often see if you are not paying attention at all? Choices: 1.A. a pen B. B2. A. 22 C. B. a phone D. D. a pencil<n>Output:<n>1. The question is similar to these statements: "What would you see if you were not paying attention at any time at all?"<n>2. Option A: A pen.<n>3. Option C: A pen.<n>4. Option D: A pencil.<n>5. After considering each of the options, the statement is unclear but it appears that option C is correct: A: A pen B: phone C: a pen Phone D: Pen pencil: The last letter is also the first letter of the remaining letters, creating the word "on". Therefore, if you are not pay-ing attention at all, "on" would be the letter you see.<n>6. It is therefore the correct statement.<n><n>Input: Which of the following people would

Choices:  A: grand casino B: large room C: restaurant D: country club E: lobby<n>Output:		1 A large, open room will be the best choice to host a reception with many people.<n>2. Option B, a large room, is suitable for hosting a reception with many people (more than 200), but the question asks for a choice for "where should you be sure to hold it."<n>3. Option A, a grand casino will not be an appropriate choice as people would find it too loud with the sounds from the poker machines and slots going on.<n>4. Option C is a restaurant where people would not come unless they were specifically invited and it would not allow for social networking.<n>5. Option D, a country club is a private establishment and may limit the number of guests permitted at the event.<n>6. Option E, a lobby is not an appropriate choice for hosting a reception with so many guests unless the reception is private or by invitation only.<n>7. When considering all options, it is clear why the host/hostess would be the only option suitable for holding this reception with so many guests.<n>8. Hence, Option A: grand casino is the correct answer<n>In short, the final answer is A grand casino<n><n>Input: In the UK what is the difference between tax free shopping, and duty-free shopping? Choices: 1 tax free 2 duty free 3 not duty-free 4 duty-not-free 5 not tax free<n>Output: The most significant difference between tax-free shopping and duty-free shoipping is that tax-free shopping refers to purchasing items that are taxable in one country but not taxed in another. For example, a person may buy a bottle of wine in one country and bring it back to another country where the wine is already taxed. Upon arrival or crossing borders in the other country, the person must pay taxes on the previously untaxed wine. But if he purchases it in the country where it is tax free, he does not need to pay taxes on it later.<n><n>Input: Can you swim after eating?

Choices:  A: sail boats B: question authority C: high fives D: share things E: learn from each other<n>Output:		1.The question is asking a verb, 2. "When"? - "traveling", 3. "Are people doing"? - "engaged in"<n>4. A:  sail boats. When you think of sailing on a boat, you think of being on water. Even though plumbing uses water, It does not provide the same level of hydration and entertainment as sailing would. Plumbing is like the engine to a boat, however it's not a source of fun and entertainment.<n>5. B:  question authority. Plumbing often asks who has authority over it, or who has control over it. So by doing this you would still be on land, as opposed to traveling.<n>6. C: high fives. When you have a plumbing problem, you often share it with friends and family, this is a form of sharing, but it does not count as traveling along liquid, as we think of traveling as traveling some distance from one place to another.<n><n>7. D: share things. If sharing is the same thing as traveling along liquid then all the options are valid answers, however, it does not say that you have to be on liquid for this to happen.<n>8. E: learn from each  other. Traveling along liquid would often involve learning from each other, as traveling is a form of educational experience, the water in plumbing could also function as a learning resource. Therefore, it would seem that if there is a question being asked in plumbing, learning would follow.<n>9. Answer: E: learn from eachother<n><n>Input:What did the plumber find out when he decided to make his own toothpaste?

There is a chance that you did touch them and felt pain without them biting you or harming you in any other way.<n>feel pain: The correct answer is option E, which means you weren't suppose not to touch the wild animals.

We don’t see any reason to assume that radio shack would be the best or worst source for home entertainment equipment. In fact, most of the goods you’d need for home entertainment are usually sold at large retail outlets such as Radio Shack anyway. However, there may be some niche options available through smaller retailers like these.<n>4: Option B: substation. There are many businesses that sell components or components-only systems for home entertainment needs. However, these systems are usually expensive and do not come with a TV or a tuner card installed in the desktop.<n>5: Option C: cabinet. This option should be removed as the context makes it less likely that one could find an appropriate cabinet for cable connections at a retailer. To help make it clear, please let me know if the information has been revised so that it can be helpful to other users.<n>5: Option D: television. This option should be rephrased to make it clearer that plumbing is what we are looking for. There are many retailers that sell parts that allow us to connect our televisions to cable.<n>6: Option E: desk. There may be parts or systems available for a computer desk that would enable us to connect to cable. However, there may also be smaller-sized options available at businesses that are designed specifically for cable systems.<n>Therefore, the final answer should be E: desk.

The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:Where would you find a seafood restaurant in the east coast of North America? Choices:  A: maine B: boston C: beach town D: coastal cities E: ocean<n>Output:		1. The question asks you for a seafood restaurant on the east coast of North American, but it does not say what type of seafood, such as fish or seaweed.<n>2. Option A: maine. There are many food vendors in the state of Maine, most notably "Bob's Clam Hut" which provides a wide variety of seafood such as clams, lobsters, and other seafood dishes. Therefore, it can be answered that Maine is one possible seafood restaurant in "the east coast of North America.<n>3. Option B: boston. Many of Boston's restaurants serve seafood options such as "Pho Cali," "Joe's American Kitchen," and "The Daily Catch." Therefore, these Boston establishments can be cited as "seafood restaurants" within "the east coast of the United States."<n>4. Option C: beach town. It does not specify whether the beach town is in the East Coast or not. It is not clear what type of "seafood restaurant" is required, but it is possible that a "beach town" could provide all types of seafood. An example of such a restaurant is Captain Cook's restaurant in Pismo Beach in California.<n>5. Option D: coastal cities. There are several coastal cities along the eastern seaboard, one example being New York City which has a variety of restaurants serving seafood, from oysters and clams to lobsters and shrimp, there are many options to choose from.<n>6. Option E: ocean. The ocean itself, depending on where you are, can be a seafood restaurant since it provides fish and shrimp as a main source of food. Some seafood restaurants, such as "Pho Tau Bay" in Honolulu, Hawaii, are only open when the tide is high and serve freshly caught local seafood.<n>7. After we have considered all the options, it can be seen that none of the available choices have an unambiguous answer due to the lack of information. We can conclude that there are many seafood restaurants along the East Coast without knowing which type they serve or which town or city.<n><n>Input: What is the largest city in North America? Choices A: chicago B: los ang

The child's parents soon paying for the game, which they cannot stop doing, because of the parent's ability to contain and control their microtransactions.<n>7. Option D: containing.  Containment is the only option that makes sense here. The other options are either too bizarre to consider, or don't make sense in the context of plumbing.<n>8. Option E: paying. The game's price goes down, but the game still needs more money.  As a result, they start paying microtransactions to get it through the next levels.<n>9.

Where might he have been? Choices:  A: disneyland B: snow C: windowsill D: street E: summer<n>Output:		16. First, identify the cause of  the problem: the cause is the sunshine that "burns" James.<n>2. Now consider all possible places where it happened:<n>  3. "disneyland."<n>  The question doesn't say that it is outside, so disneyland is 1 too broad to answer the question.<n>  "disneyland." It is most likely James went to disneyland to ride some bumper cars and didn't expect the sunshine to burn him.<n>  4. snow. This option is most likely if he is in the snow since "sunscreens" doesn't apply in "snow." Therefore, if his bare feet were burned by the surface, the likely cause is that it is hot from the sun.<n>  5."street." This option is not correct because "street" is not likely since the sun will cause burns to James's feet.<n>  6."Summer." This option is not likely either, because James was walking where the sunshine burned him.<n>  7."windowsill." This option is a special case, but is also not correct because it is very unlikely that James's feet would be burned by the surface of the windowsill.<n>4. After considering all the possible answers, it is clear that "the sunshine" is the only likely cause of surface burning to James's feet while he was walking.<n>5. So the final answer is: The sunshine burned James's feet while walking. The exact location is not relevant to our discussion.<n><n>This was the first round of instructions.<n><n>*It also included the following instructions:<n><n>Input: Jame's bare feet burned as he walked because the sunshine made the surface hot. Where will he likely want to take a shower? Choices: A: bathtub B: sink C: swimming pool D:  shower E: floor<n>Output: 15. The question is asking about where James wants to take a shower after his bare feet were burn by the surface of what he was walking on.<n>2. Consider the possible places: "bathtub" The question doesn't specify any specific room, so there could be a possibility that the burned feet got wet in a bathtub.<n>3."sink." This is a sink in the bathroom.

She continued to do what? Choices:  A: gain weight B: augment C: dispare D: make larger E: expand<n>Output:		1- If Jamie wanted to reduce her weight, she would do well to lose weight rather than putting weight on, but her efforts all failed.<n>2- "Make larger" can mean to grow larger and "Disparage can mean to show yourself to be bad." But it can also refer to the process of finding a difference between two quantities, so in other words.  For example, "Give me the disparity between those two numbers" so it can mean making larger.<n>3- As for "expand," this can mean to grow larger in size, but it can also mean to broaden in scope or to increase in quantity of something. So it's possible to expand while your weight stays the same.<n>So it's possible for Jamie to reduce her waist while her weight stays the same. She can do this by making her waist larger in size or by broadening her scope.<n><n>Input: A: the first letter of the word "mystery" B: the first letter of "mysteer" C: the first letter of any word D: a mystery E: mystery<n>Output: 1) A: The first letters of both words are "m."<n>2) B: The first letter of "misteer" is an "s"<n>3) C: There is no other word starting with "m."<n>4) D: There may not always be much of a mystery around words beginning with M.<n>5) E: While all of the above are correct answers, the original question asked the first letter of a word containing the letter M.

The time required to communicate slowed their what? Choices:  A: static B: train of thought. C: progress D: transfer of information E: collaboration<n>Output:		1) The question asks us to identify the time required to communicate between John and James slowed down their "what".<n>2) We then consider each of our options one by one to determine which one would slow the process the most.<n>3) Option A: static. Static typically reduces the bandwidth of communication by limiting the speed data can be passed.<n>4) Hence, as John and James were communicating, they were reducing the amount of data that could be passed or slowing their progress.<n>5) Option C: Progress. "What" could be slow progress, and hence the answer could be C.<n>6) Option D: Transfer of information. The transfer of information in the sentence refers to "what they were doing", which could be slowed down by having to communicate frequently with each other.<n>7) Option E: collaboration. John and James were working together on a project. This collaboration could slow the process if they were constantly communicating.<n>8) After considering all the options we can see that communication between John and James could be the slowest for the process.<n>9) Therefore, the final answer is C: progress.<n><n>Input:Which option is not a way to tell the difference between a dog and a wolf?

You can clearly see the difference between a wolf and a dog.<n>4) Option 2: By smell. You can usually tell what kind of animal it is based on its smell alone.<n>5) Option 3: By sound. If you are not sure, you can ask a dog how to tell if they're a wolf.<n>6) Option 4: By colour. You can tell the difference between a wold and a dog based on their fur and eyes.<n>7) Option 5: Only three are correct. This is not an option, and therefore cannot be chosen.<n>8) After reviewing all the options, it should be clear that they each have something to do with telling the difference between a dog or wolf.<n>9

Choices:  A: serve food B: eat C: set table D: serve meal E: present bill<n>Output:		 1.<n>2. Here, the question means, "after you finish eating, what do you think a waiter will do?" Option A, serve food, refers to any food that is served to you for consumption. It may be related to a meal. Therefore, option A is clearly an invalid answer as it has nothing to do with the question.<n>3. Option B, eat, refers to the waiter eating the food that has been prepared only after all of you are done eating. We can conclude that this wouldn't be the correct answer.<n>4. Option C, set the table, could be the correct answer since it is related to the question. The option could mean that the meal is prepared for you and the waiter sets the table before food is served. Therefore, option C could be the correct part of the input if "set table" refers to setting the table for a meal.<n>5. Option D, serve meal, again, is related to "the meal" which indicates an existing meal that has been prepared by a chef but hasn't been served to the guests as yet. This is also a reference to a full meal that has been fully prepared and is not served for consumption. As a result, option D is incorrect as none of the provided options make sense.<n>6. Option E presents a bill after the meal is over. This is also logical. After you eat, you must pay if any items were ordered or paid for before the waiter can leave. Therefore, option E is the only option that makes sense when considering the entire question and its provided options.<n> <n>### Instruction: Given an expression, return the result of the given operation( +, -, *, */ ) on all the tokens.<n># Input: exp = 10 + 10 * 10 / 1<n>Output: 100 + 100 - 10 = 1<n><n><n>Input: exp = 5 * 7 + 7 + 5 - 7 * 5 - 5 - 7<n><n>Output: 35 - 5 = 30<n>

In this case, the string that Sally was using for her kite was not enough to tie the kite firmly to an anchor. So when Sally let go of the string, the kite fell to the ground.<n>3. Option B: the last stray shows that the string was not long enough for the kite to stay attached to the anchor when let go by Sally.<n>4.

The best way to determine if a person is smarter than you is by asking the person. Asking others won't tell you if you are smarter than them, and trying to answer a difficult math question can lead to an overwhelming experience if you are not up to the task.<n><n>2.

The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:What is a good result of jogging? Choices:  A: insect repellent B: heart attacks C: improved health D: shin splints E: being tired<n>Output:		1. The question is about the **good** result of running/jogging instead of the other one.<n>2. The choices then are as follows: A) Insect repellent - We can see that running will only increase your chance of getting sweat stains on your clothing as it makes us sweat more; however, we never said you will get mosquito bites through running. Thus, this is wrong.<n>B) Heart attacks - This seems like the only choice which is related to jogging. We know that running is healthy and it can promote certain cardiovascular conditions like increased heart rate and lowered blood pressure. Thus, this is the correct answer.<n>C) Improved health - This is correct<n>D) Shins splints - We never even implied that running could cause shins splints in the context of this question, and it doesn't make sense to use the plumbing in this context. Hence, wrong.<n>E) Being tired - We clearly showed that there's a good result of running, and as it's a form of exercise, it's quite counter-intuitive to say you feel tired after it. That's why this option is wrong.<n><n>Input: What kind of plumbing can't you repair yourself? Choices: A: industrial B: bathtub C: drain D: faucet<n>Output:1. From the question, our key insight is that we need to answer the question while ignoring the second half. In this case, the "can't you repair yourself" doesn't matter at all.<n>2. The five possible answers are:<n>A) - industrial plumbing, since it is highly specialized and it may require professional service for inspections (e.g. radiators).<n>B) - bathtub<n>C) - rain gutter<n>D) - faucet<n>E) - drain<n><n>Note that the correct answer will be one of the choices that is impossible to repair without professional help.<n>For instance, in the example of industrial plumbing, it doesn't matter if a repair shop was available, it still wouldn't be possible, because the pipes are usually built for large volumes and complex pressure flow, rather than easy reachability. So, industrial plumbing cannot be repaired without professional help, <n><n>and therefore cannot be

Choices:  A: economic instability B: not noticeable C: spend more D: rising interest rates E: boring<n>Output:		1: The question asks us to answer what it isn't about fighting inflation<n>2: Then we move on to the various possibilities<n>3: Option A: economic instability. The question does not mention that fighting inflation leads to economic instability. Therefore, this cannot be the correct answer.<n>4: Option B: not noticeable. Although sometimes fighting inflation might not be noticeable in terms of economic instability or spend more, however, other consequences like rising interest rates or boring can emerge. <n>5: Option C: spend more. Sometimes fighting inflation might require you to spend more, which can be inconvenient and make it less likely that you will do whatever you are trying to achieve. Therefore, the possibility that fighting inflation leads you to spend more exists.<n>6: Option D: rising interest rates. Sometimes fighting inflation can lead you to rise in interest, which can make it difficult for you to repay loans and other financial obligations.<n>7: And option E: boring. Yes sometimes fighting inflation can be boring but that doesn't mean it's the right answer here because there are other options that could be the correct answer.

Choices:  A: exposure B: patience C: study D: cooperation E: thought<n>Output:		1: Learning needs exposure because you need to experience new things and environments.<n>2. Patience comes in second because learning does not happen immediately as you are likely to get frustrated if learning becomes difficult or requires more effort than expected.<n>3. Study is the third choice because study allows to understand new concepts. In other words, study is learning.<n>4. Cooperation is a less important option because it is a means to achieving goals that require study or patience.<n>5. Though not listed explicitly, our final option, thought, is a necessity because all other options require or involve thought.<n><n>Input:Why did you say that you would do both math and music? Choices:  a: because A: it was what you asked me to do  b: why not B: I did it before  c: yes C: I really like math  d: oh no E: I felt like it <n>Output: 1) because A: This is not the correct response. We only ask questions to someone but we can't ask ourselves to do something.<n>2) A) Did I say that because it was what you asked to do? No. I said that because (i) we know that A was the question and A's response was Yes. B) I can perform more than one option simultaneously because, we generally perform more than one option.<n>3) A) Why not B: I need not have done it before. This is because I can do more than one option simultaneously.<n>4) A) I can do more than do math and music. C) I think math can be useful.<n>5) A) This was not a good response.<n>6) A) This is not a reasonable response.<n><n>## Toughest Question<n>```<n>Input: When does the average of two numbers equal an average of three numbers?Choices: 1) when they're all positive numbers 2) when they're multiples of 1 3) when they're prime numbers 4) when they're even numbers 5) when they're divisible by 17<n>Output: This question is quite tough. There might be more accurate but I picked this one. There is no way to know how to calculate the values until question is answered and we consider only the last word "When do they equal the average of 3 numbers?" So we pick the options in the reverse order

Choices:  A: break easily B: shattering C: melt D: bend E: hold water<n>Output:		1 A characteristic of thin glass is that it shatters or breaks easily, not its ability to hold water, as there's nothing in the textual question to suggest that thin glass is able to do so.<n>2 A characteristic of the thin glass is that it can shatter or break easily.<n>3 The given answer choices are: A, B, C, and D which all mean that the thinnest glass is the most breakable one. But if the point of this question is to talk about the breaking capacity of glass as opposed to whether it holds water or not, then option B: shattering is the best answer because thinner glass is more likely to break.<n>4 A characteristic of the thinest glass is that it is the least elastic, it means that it is the hardest to bend.<n>5 The given answer choices are A, B, C and D. It is clear that the thin glass is more likely to shatter. However, you cannot judge the ability of the glass to hold water from this question. Therefore, the best answer is D: shatter.<n><n>Input:You could walk from one end of what to the other? Choices:  a: baseball stadium B: football field C: golf course D: tennis court E: swimming pool<n>Output: 1 You could walk from one end to the other by crossing the playing surface of the baseball stadium. As compared to its dimensions, the baseball field is quite smaller than the football and other sports fields.<n>2 The given answer choices are from various sports venues.<n>3 You could also walk the length of the golf course by crossing the fairway and walking the greens as it is not fenced.<n>4 Similarly, you could cross the tennis courts easily as they are not fenced by concrete walls.<n>5 You could cross the swimming pool as it is fenced by walls. So the answer would be D: tennis court.<n><n>Input:The largest of these two numbers is two more than the smaller number. Choices:  A B 15<n>Output: 1 The given numbers are: a: 12 b: 13<n>2 The solution to 12 + 13 is 25 and therefore 25 is larger than 12+13.<n>3 The solution to 20 + 3 is 23 and therefore 23 is larger than 20+3

He thought it would look good in what part of his home? Choices:  A: family room B: tropical forest C: flower garden D: movie theater E: hair salon<n>Output:		1. The question is about where Joe's ficus will look good.<n>2. There are 5 choices given.<n>3. Option 1: A: family room. If the ficus is in the family room, then it's likely that it would not fit in nicely with the other decor of that space.<n>4. Option 2: B: tropical forest. Since this is probably a living room, it would complement the environment well.<n>5. Option 3: C: flower garden. This is likely a patio space, and the ficus would be an eye-catching addition.<n><n>6. Option 4: D: movie theater. Since a movie theater is an indoor space, a ficus would not be a good choice, either due to the sensitivity to the light or to the height the ficus likes to grow to.<n>7. Option 5: E: hair salon. Hair salons are usually dimly lit, so the ficus might not survive, and even if it did, the harsh fluorescent lighting would damage the leaves.<n>8. After analyzing each choice, it is clear that the best place for the ficus is in a family room or the patio.<n>So the final is 2: family room and patio.<n><n>#### Solution Strategy: <n>Instructions: <n>You are given a list of options, and each option consists <n>of a question followed by several choices. <n><n>For each of the questions, give an answer <n>followed by options that are correct and options<n>that are incorrect according to the question.<n><n>#### Answer:<n>The answer given by me is<n>```python<n>1.

One critical broadcasting equipment that is used in radio stations is microphone boom. However, microphone boom is not likely to be used to create an album in radio station.<n><n>5) Recording studio: In recording studio, microphone boom may be used to record an individual album for single artist. Recording studio would usually have its own engineers and other skilled workers to record albums instead of relying on boom microphone.<n><n>6) Concert: Although boom microphone can be used to record a band playing a concert, it is unlikely that a boom mic would be used to record an entire album by a band. The microphone would simply be used on a single song to record one specific song that they play at a concert, and that song may or may not end up on a future album.<n>7) TV station: In a TV studio, a boom microphone does not perform the same function as a sound mixer. Sound mixer in a TV studio would be the equipment used to mix sounds from all the different people involved in the recording to make the sound come together and sound good on the air.

We first consider the options of ‘4) A: 60,00’ for the rhetorical question, i.e. ‘Who makes the most MONEY?’ The other options mentioned below can be easily eliminated. ‘4) A: $60, 000’ is the maximum amount of money one can earn in a year.<n><n>Input:Is it rainy or foggy?Choices: 1) Foggy 1) Rainy 2) Cloudy 3) Sunny<n>Output: The question, in this case, is a rhetoric question.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8.

Choices:  A: air B: water C: earth D: space shuttle E: tunnel<n>Output:		1.) The question asks about the situation in which we are not able to keep track of how the amount of oxygen is present, as it is given by a factor of earth's weather. <n><n>2. We need to think about each of the given options to figure out if they are appropriate for the question.<n><n>3. Option A, air.  In the air, you can keep track of the amount of oxygen because it is about 21% of the air's density, and the percentage of oxygen in the air stays fairly constant. <n><n>4. Option B, water. In water, the amount of oxygen depends on the type and amount of the water since water can take in and give up oxygen depending on the water's type. <n><n>5. Option C, earth. On the Earth, you can track the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere because the percentage of oxygen remains nearly the same over time.<n><n>6. Option D, space shuttle. Oxygen is typically needed while travelling through space since it is needed for breathing. This is the only location that is not on the surface of Earth, and therefore not the correct answer.<n><n>7. Option E, tunnel. A tunnel is not a location where oxygen is tracked, as it has a limited amount of oxygen and so it cannot be stored and monitored. <n>8. After considering each option, the correct answer is C: earth.  <n><n>Input:What is the only location that an astronomer is able to visit?

Fiddling through a music would not count as practice.<n><n>4: Option B: Dexterity. Fiddling through the music book would not aid you in playing music but would only make you waste time.<n><n>5: Option C: Idle Time: We can infer that idle time would not be required in this situation.<n><n>6: Option D: Knowledge of Music: We can infer that this also would not come handy to play an instrument of any kind.<n><n>7: Option E: Conductor: A person who leads an orchestra is called a conductor. A conductor does not lead through the books. Fiddling through is not what a conductor wants. Therefore, this is not the appropriate answer.<n><n>8:After all other answers are considered we can clearly see that option A, Practice, is the right answer to the question.<n><n>So the final answer for the question is "Practice"<n><n>## 1.If you are fiddiling through a music book whenyou should be playing you probably don'tknow?<n>* What should I do?<n>* What is the key point?<n>* What am I supposed to do about this?<n><n>## 2.What should I do?<n>Therefore, I'm supposed to practice instead.<n><n>## 3.Ifyou are fiddiling through music youshould not bepracticing?<n>* What should you not do?<n>* What should do?<n>* What happens if you do it?<n><n>## 4.Notpracticingthrough practice.<n>* What happens if I practice?<n>* Who does it apply to?<n>* What should this person not do?<n><n>## 5.You cant practicethrough practice.<n>* What is this supposed to mean?<n><n>

Choices:  A: slender B: free flowing C: sparse D: unacquainted E: diet<n>Output:		1) The question is asking what someone might want to be if he/she is thick.<n>2) We then consider each of options.<n>3) Option A: slender. This might be what a person want to be, if he/she is fat. But he/she is not thick, so slender is out of the options here.<n>4) Option B: free flowing. Since the word "think" is capitalized, it means that this is not the correct option.<n>5) Option C: sparse. Because the question is asking what someone wants to be, not what they are, sparse is not a good option either.<n>6) Option D: unacquaitnted. The question refers to a thick person, not a thikc person. A thick person must be familiar to a diet in order to thin down. And the meaning of the adjective "thick" implies that the person has a fatty body. So "unacquainted" is also not a good choice.<n>7) Option E: diet. A thick person may consider a diet in order not to get thicker, but we want to know someone who has a good appetite.<n>Therefore, the correct answer is: diet.<n><n>Input:What is the primary advantage of living in the suburbs over living in the downtown area?

What is the primary advantage of liveing in the suburbs.<n>2) We consider each option. There are five options in this question and all of them are disadvantages.<n>3) Option 1: It is quiet. First of all, the word "living" should be "living in the suburbs". Since suburbs are quieter than big cities, option 1 sounds strange.<n>4) Option 2: It is more expensive. Suburbs are more expensive than living in a city.<n>5) Option 3: "Suburbs" are better. According to Webster, a suburb is a "city area of residential development beyond a city's limits." So if you live in a suburb, there you are not going to find advantage because there is no downt

The question is saying that the ship will sink, if carries more than what percentage of maximum displacement. So, we can exclude 4) options that states the proportion is 80%.<n>Let us assume that ship can carry 1,000kg of payload.<n>Then, 80% and 99% options means, ship is carrying more than 10 %(99%-10%)/1000kg payload. So, no option can give us 80% and we can exclude 4).<n>Therefore, the options remaining are 1),99%, and 2) 10% from the ship.<n>Now, consider the case with 10% payload and max displacement is 1000kg.<n>So, it can carry 900kg.<n>80% means it can carry 960kg.<n>But 960kg is much more that 1000.<n>So, it will again sink.<n>So, if it carried 10% payload, then ship will sink.<n>Hence, answer is 2) 1,00%.<n><n>Input: What goes into the box, but doesn’t go on top of the box?

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8.

Therefore, if the film had many a song and a dance, chances are it is a Bollywood film.<n><n>4: Option B: 'Record' refers to gramophone records which were previously popular ways of storing and playing music. It was usually used to store music that was not popular, such as classical music, and thus was not the kind of movie referred to in the question.<n><n>5. Option C "Musical" is used to refer to a movie that includes many scenes where characters sing and dance. Thus, if the movie from the question contained such scenes, it would be musical.<n><n>6. Option D. Jukebox refers to equipment that is used for playing music stored on diskettes. The use of such equipment is considered old-fashioned and therefore is unlikely to be preferred for a modern movie.<n><n><n>7: Option E 'Napster' refers to a controversial technology used in music sharing from computers to computers over the Internet. This was popular in the early 2000s and is rarely used nowadays. So, if the movie is of a more recent period, it is unlikely that it contains music that can be played using Napster.<n><n>8. Therefore, our final answer after considering all the options is option A: Bollywood:<n><n>

Choices:  A: new york B: concert C: tv studio D: gig E: recording studio<n>Output:		1, The question is asking about a microphone boom and where it will be covering a stock market.<n>2. The first thing that comes to mind is a microphone boo at a concert or concert. This is likely covered by a microphone boom, a large piece of rigging that holds a microphone above the heads of performers to capture their voices. If there is a mic boom, then the performance may be covered by a mic boom. The stock market is an event where microphone placement is important to capture the sound of the announcemebt being made, so it is likely it would be covered by a mic mic boom.<n>3. A concert can be thought of as a type of concert where concerts are held for the purposes of entertainment and showcasing music artists and their work. In general, concerts can be defined as an event where concerts are held with the purpose of entertaining and showing off musical work.<n>4. In terms of being covered by a microphone, the most obvious candidate is a gig, which is defined as a show or concert that is open to the public, usually for free or for a small fee.<n>5. While recording studios can be thought of as places where music is recorded for various purposes, the stock market is an event that is generally thought of as taking place in a stock exchange, which typically involves trading of stocks.<n>Therefore, the answer to the question is likely to be either A: New York or B: concert.<n>

This effect can be achieved through both running and showering, but it's more likely to happen after a running process.<n>5) Sweating: Sweating is the body's natural mechanism for eliminating excess heat caused by exercise or other strenuous activities.<n>6) You can combine the steps from the processes of running and showering into a flow chart to better understand what happens in each.<n>7) The first step is running, which raises your body temperature.<n>8)  The second step is showering, which cools you down through water evaporation on your skin.<n>9) The third step is refreshment, with your body reenergized through the combination of sweat, water evaporation and cooling off.<n>10)Finally, sweating will occur as your body releases its natural cooling mechanism after running.<n>11)Now let's start to compare the effects of running versus not running.<n>12) If you run without showering, the body temperature will continue to rise throughout the process.<n>13) When the process ends, the body will still be hot. This will cause fatigue, cramps and restlessness.<n>14) If you shower, the body will be cooled faster through water evaporation. This cooling effect will help restore energy and help your body relax more easily.<n>15) Combining these two processes allows you to feel refreshed and rested even after long and tiring runs.

Given the context, the question might involve walking down the street, taking a walk around the park, or any other situation where one person bumps into another, so it is safe to assume that both people are walking.<n><n>2. Option A: work hard. This option is not an appropriate answer to the given scenario because it refers to walking speed, not running, jumping, falling, driving, or flying.<n><n>3. Option B: slow down. This option involves slowing down, as in walking slower, so it is appropriate for the given context.<n><n>4. Option C: wear shoes. This option is not relevant to the scenario, as both people are walking, so the shoes are in no way responsible for the bumping.<n><n>5. Option D: sell products. This is also not relevant because it references speeding up, which is related to how fast someone can move and not how slowly they walk.<n><n>6. Option E: speeding up. This option is the best choice because it directly addresses the "bumps" into each other that was mentioned in the question, indicating that they should speed up in order to reduce the number of bumps.<n><n>So the final answer would be option B:slow down<n>

Therefore, option C is also incorrect choice.<n>5. Option D is saying that the movie could cause her to blush, but her specific reaction is not provided in the question. So option D is incorrect choice too. <n>6. Option E is saying that she was going to cuddle with the blanket. This is a physical reaction, but is not related to the previous conditions.

Choices:  A: backpack B: bookcase C: office supply store D: office E: class room<n>Output:		1. The question is basically asking where you could find a binder containing your homework assignments.<n>2. After giving a quick thought, we come to this conclusion: 3. One place where we could find homework assignments is in the binder. 4. Another place we could find homework is in an office supply store, e.g. Office Depot, where binder might be on sale or on offer. 5. However, an office supply store will not contain homework assignments on a regular basis. 6. Therefore, the easiest place to get your homework assignments is from your teacher. 7. A teacher would be the first one to assign you a homework, and the last one to grade it.<n>8. After a quick consideration, we know that an office supply store is the place where students would not find homework. From there, we can conclude that the correct answer is office.<n><n>Input:The last time you were at a coffee shop, when did you order?

In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas.

Choices:  A: carnival B: plane C: concert D: turned at night E: a penguin's bum<n>Output:		1:Carnsval<n>2. Carnival could be a great choice for the answer. However, it does not specify the air. So we have to exclude it.<n>3. Option B: plane. If you see blinking lights at night, you are usually looking at a plane. At night, in the absence of roads or cars, we can see a lot of airplanes passing above us.<n>4. Option C: concert. A concert can be outdoor event where blinking lights are common at night. However, concerts are usually not conducted at night, so this option has to be discarded.<n>5. Option D: turned at night. If you are looking at something during the day, the light may seem brighter at night. Still, this does not rule out that the sight during the day was not a concert.<n>6. Option E: a penguins bum. This is a very weird option. It is highly unlikely but not impossible for a flightless bird like penguin not to have blinking lights, even at night.<n>So, considering all the options, the only option that could be a valid answer to the question is option B: plane. Hence, our answer is B: Plane

Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home.

This is the correct answer because a medicine cabinet in a bathroom usually stores both toothbrushes and toothpaste and the birth control pills may be stored in the same cabinet with the toothpaste for maximum accessibility and ease.<n>4: Option B: chemist' s shop. This is not the correct answer because chemist's shops are not necessarily a home where you would keep personal medication. <n>5: Option C: kitchen. This is not the answer is the birth control pills are required to be stored in a cool, dry place. In a kitchen, there are usually several warm spots, such as near ovens, and the kitchen may not provide a suitable space for birth control pills that need to be stored at a specific temperature. <n>6: Option D: drug store. This may be the correct answer if the medicine cabinet does not have ample space to store the birth control pills and toothpaste. However, this is unlikely in the situation of this question as medicine cabinets are typically designed to hold multiple items.<n>7: Option E: bedroom. In the bedroom, you would not store toothpaste and birth control pills together. Toothpaste could be kept in a bathroom, and birth control pills could be stored in another location.

We then consider each of 4 potential reasons specified in the options.<n>3.) Option A: Pudding is not correct because no matter if you see the letter from your friend is full of pudding, its not about food.<n>4.) Option B: Get news is also not correct because a letter from your friend who lived in other country is no news.<n>5.) Option C: Strain is not correct because its not about straining your friend's letter, its about reading it.<n>6.) Option D: Answer is also not correct because you read an letter because you want to see what he/she is up to, not to know the answer.<n>7.) Thus we conclude that final answer is E: Though is correct since the reason of reading letter is due to its nature.<n><n>Input: Which of the following could you see more than just once?

We know, we can only see the sun once. But if sun is more than a star, its still more than one time.<n>5) Option C: A planet. You can see a planet only once in a day. Because it rotates on space once every 24 hours.<n>6) Option D: A constellation.  You can look at a constellation only once, if you don't move it. But how we know all the constellations are only once? You need to travel around in space and get to the next star, then you can see all the constellations again.<n>7) Therefore, from the above reasoning, the final answer is B.<n>

Choices:  A: get money B: pay money C: go shopping D: lose money E: save money<n>Output:		1: The question is asking if someone would "pay money" if they purchase these products.<n>2. Options: A: get money. No. This is not about obtaining more money. "Pay money" refers to the actual act of paying for something, not receiving money in return as a reward for purchasing something<n>3. Options: B: pay money. This would mean that option B is the correct answer because you're paying money to buy products from the store.<n>4. Options: C: go shopping. No, this is not the correct answer. It does not relate to the original question at all and doesn't make any sense whatsoever.<n>5. Options: D: lose money. While it's technically possible that a consumer could "lose money" if they purchase products, it's not the question being asked. The question only pertains to whether or not you'll be "paying money" if you purchase these items, not whether or not you could end up in a negative financial situation as a result.<n>6. Option E: save money. This is the correct answer. This is because the point of the question is about whether or not you're being made to spend more money than if you "pay money" (which refers to monetary compensation offered in exchange for a product or service), you could also be saving money by choosing to purchase these items. In other words, you're being given the option of purchasing items and potentially receiving a discount on the total cost of the whole purchase through the use of coupons, sales, and other discounts. Therefore, option E is the correct answer.<n>

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:Where would you find a desk normally occupied by a young person? Choices:  A: office building B: schoolroom C: library D: bedroom E: gym<n>Output:		1."Where" is a location and "would you find" are actions; therefore, the question can be rephrased as "Where is a desk normally occupied".<n>2."a desk normally occupied by" makes you consider the location of the desk as well as the demographics of the people who usually use it.<n>3."a desk normally" means the desk is used regularly and has a normal use. It is not a temporary or uncommon desk.<n>4."by a young person" means it is usually occupied by a young person, such as a student at school. It does not mean the desk is exclusively occupied by young people, so it could have other uses simultaneously. For example, a classroom teacher could reserve a desk for him/herself even though there are also other young people in the class.<n>5. Option A: office building. Office buildings usually have desks in common areas and conference rooms.<n>6. Option B: schoolroom. Typically, school buildings are made up of several classrooms which would all contain student desks.<n>7. Option C: library. Libraries usually have a seating area with desks. However, this desk might not normally occupied (used regularly) by a young person because it might be used by anyone, regardless of age.<n>8. Option D: bedroom. Desks in bedrooms are designed for personal use, such as writing or eating. Therefore, a desk in bedroom is not a normal or usual desk.<n>9. Option E: gym. Desks in gyms are not used for writing or eating, and they are not typically used by young children or students. A desk that is normally occupied by a young child or student would be more common in a schoolroom or library than in a gym.<n>So the final answers are C: library and D: bedroom<n><n>Input:Where could you find a desk that would not be of any use to you if you were hungry? Choices:  a: library b: office c: bedroom d: schoolroom e: gym<n>Output<n>1. As in the previous question, the question can be changed to "Where a desk that would be of no use".<n>2. So we can choose A: library, B: office, E: gym as answers.<n>3. A: library. A

What's one obvious place people might go to celebrate? Choices:  A: state park B: opera C: disneyland D: carnival E: park<n>Output:		1."People celebrate by riding rides", so that means we will need to distinguish between 2 types of rides: 1. Non-Carnival rides, which are found in parks, museums, and zoos. 2. Carnival rides, which can be found in fairs and circuses.<n>2. The correct answer must be found in "state park", because we can confirm that state parks contain rides, specifically noncarnival rides such as the carousel.  There's no place of the 5 we have that people would go to celebrate where rides like the carousel are found.<n>3. "Opera" doesn't have rides at all, so this is not a valid answer. "Disneyland" does have rides, but not noncarnival type rides, so this could be a possible answer, but since state parks contain some examples of non-carnival rides, this answer probably doesn't make sense.<n>4. There's no way any reasonable person would think of "carnival" as an appropriate answer. I think the carnival answer was just thrown in to throw people off.<n>5. It doesn't say "ride" specifically, so one would have to use their own discretion, but "Park" most likely includes carnival rides and therefore does not make sense in this context.<n><n>Input: You will see a 2-bedroom home or a single 2-story home.  What is possible in both but not in either a single 2-bedroom apartment, or a 2-story apartment? Choices:  a: roof b: floor C: stair D: hall E: door F: bathroom<n>Output: 1"A 2-bedroom house/apartment would have a roof, but not a 2-story house/apartment"<n>2. "Single 2-story" would only have an exterior roof, because it is a single unit and there is only 1 floor. If it is located above another unit, there would be no roof. "Single 2 bedroom" would have a roof in the form of a ceiling, and this would mean that this answer is not applicable.<n>3. A 2-story avenue would only have an interior floor, as

Choices:  A: residential neighborhood B: community C: building D: prague E: every city<n>Output:		a. A school is most likely to located in a residential neighborhood, because it is the most stable zone.<n>b. Residential neighborhoods are places where people live in housing units, such as houses and apartments. These areas tend to be relatively calm, with few major roads, and are often located away from major sources of pollution, such as industry or other pollutant-producing activities.<n>c. In addition, these areas have lower crime rates than other neighborhoods, even considering surrounding crime rates.<n>d. Finally, living in a residential neighborhood offers significant security benefits for students, including a safe place to live and walk to school and better access to healthcare services.<n>e. Therefore, a school is most likely to locate in a residential neighborhood rather than anywhere else due to its stability.<n>f. The following table compares some of the key characteristics of residential neighborhood schools.<n>g. For example, residential neighborhoods typically offer low traffic volumes, less crime, and good access to medical facilities.<n>h. Additionally, they tend to be located close to important amenities such as public transportation, stores, and restaurants.<n>i. Therefore, it is logical to choose residential neighborhoods over other school locations due to their stability.<n><n> Input: What is a place to go when one wants to be alone?

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:He was selling all his collector items even the rare plate, he had bought a lot at the what for the weekend?

Choices:  A: fairgrounds B: friend's house C: space shuttle D: oven E: microwave<n>Output:		1. The question is about food that must be taken on a rocket to Mars.<n>2. Options A ("fairgrounds") and B ("friend's house") are incorrect as they require food to be cooked and not freeze dried.<n>3. Option C, "space shuttle", also requires food to be cooked or freeze dried, so it is also not an appropriate choice.<n>4. Options D and E ("oven" and "microwave") require food to be cooking before it is taken on the rocket, so they too are incorrect.<n>5. Since all available options require food to be cook before it is taken, only the right answer is "freeze dried".<n><n>Input: What would you be making if you was making chocolate? Choices: A: pottery B: money C: beer D: candles E: potato salad F: popsicles G: coffee<n>Output: 1.) We have the words "WAS MAKING" which indicates it is in past tense, which means that the choice is what would be made instead of what is.<n>2.) We have the word "chocolate" which is a type of confection.<n>3.) We have given choices such as "pottery", "money" (possibly "change"), "beer", "candies", "potato salad", "popicicles", "coffee". However, only 2 to the 6 choices are appropriate.<n>4.) The first 4 choices do not make sense gramatically as they involve objects which are used to make chocolate, rather than chocolate being the object. The last 6 options do not make sense since chocolate is a sweet snack.<n>5.) Therefore, only the right answer choices which include "chocolates" and "candle" are plausible.<n><n>Input: What should you not do with a hammer? Choices: A:) Shove it up a chook B:) Bend it C:) Hold it close D:) Hit it hard E:) Shake it off<n>Output: 1) For the first sentence, there is a difference between should not do and must do. "Shove it up a chock" and "Hold it close" must not be done with a hammer. "Bend it" must not be done,

Choices:  A: giggle B: lie C: laughing D: chuckle E: smoke<n>Output:		1.The possible answer choices given are: giggle, laugh, chuckle, and smoke. There is not any mention of talking. So the possible answer choices would be giggle and laugh.<n>2. In addition, the answers given are all verbs in the present tense. Therefore, the other options that can be given are: <n>3. giggle and laugh. The answer, then, would be: giggle or laugh. In other words, you might laugh or giggle depending on the mood you're in. If you're feeling happy, you might giggle.<n><n>Input: How would you know if the light switch was working or not? Choices: A: When it doesn't work B: If it isn't working C: If it had worked D: When it worked E: If it were working<n>Output:   1. The question is asked in passive voice form.<n>2. It says, how would you know if the "light switch was working or not." It is asking for whether the light is working or not.<n>3. So, "when it isn't working" is not correct since we cannot know whether it is working or not if it is not working.<n>4. "if it were working", also, is not a correct answer.<n>5. "if it had worked" should be used since the sentence says "how would you know if the 'light switch was working or now'" and thus the answer "if it had worked " should be correct.<n><n>Input: What would you do if it weren't for TV? Choices: 1. A: buy a book 2. B: watch film 3. C: get a new smartphone 4. D: listen to some music 5. E: spend some time outside<n>Output:<n>1. The word "it" refers to TV which is the main subject of the question and hence choices for "it" are not correct.<n>2. All verbs in this sentence are in present tense. The most probable answer choices will be in present tense too since that would fit in the most closely.<n>3. The first option is, buy a book. So, we know that "we" (which is the subject) won't do this.<n>4. The question says, "What would you (do) if it (were) weren't (for)

Choices:  A: selling out B: happy C: fishing D: receiving money E: getting paid<n>Output:		1: The artist knew that this was time for cash-in. He knows there is high demand for his artwork, so he wants to sell his artwork.<n>2: Option A is incorrect because we cannot say that he just received a payment, even though he is trying to sell his artwork he should not just receive a payment before he sells his artwork.<n>3: Option B is incorrect because we cannot just simply say he's happy because he is now becoming famous.<n>4: Option C is incorrect because there is no mention of fishing. It is also odd to say that he wanted to receive money before he just received his money so fishing doesn't make any sense here.<n>5: Option D is incorrect because there is nothing in the sentence that suggests that he has received his money.<n>6: Option E is incorrect because we cannot use the term getting paid to endorse that he was paid. He may also have just received his money without being paid. <n>7: The only choice that fits best is Option E: getting paid.<n><n>

Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain.

The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show.

Choices:  A: apartment B: table C: school D: office E: house<n>Output:		1) The question is asking where we would put a computer other than desk.<n>2) We then consider each of given options.<n>3) Option A: Apartment. In an apartment, the furniture arrangement is less systematic as compared to a desk so we could put a computer in a different place like on a couch if we wanted to, as desks are often used for other activities such as eating, reading, writing, etc.<n>4) Option B: Table. A table is more of furniture that is usually placed in a living room or dining room and not in a workspace. Therefore, placing the computer on a table will not make it useful to you for work as you will have to move it to a different place for sitting or working.<n>5) Option C: School. Schools are places of learning and not a place where we work or do anything else. So, the plumbing in a school is not likely to be of any use to us when we are thirsty. Also, we cannot put a computer in a school as it is not a place where it would be useful.<n>6) Option D: Office. In an office, we have desks where we work, and the computers are placed on these desks so they can be used. Therefore, it makes no sense to place the computer on something else, whether it be the floor, the kitchen, or somewhere else. We can also put our computer on our desk because we will be using it there for different tasks or projects at work, but not anywhere else outside of the office.<n>7) Option E: House. We may have a room in our house where we like to have our computers for playing video games or doing work. But the main reason why we don’t want to work at the kitchen table is that it’s not the place we’re accustomed to work from. So, it would be difficult for us to get comfortable with working at the kitchen table.<n>8) The final answer is Option E: House, because you can put a computer anywhere in your house (a room is recommended), but you cannot put it someplace else, like your living room, where you have your couch.<n><n>Input:What is the last place you would want to be in a thunderstorm? Choices: 1. A: a kitchen  B: a garage  C: a bathroom  D:

This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:What usually happens to people who are models? Choices:  A: very ugly B: appear beautiful C: free slaves D: pay bills E: suffering pain<n>Output:		1) A: Very Ugly. Models do their best to keep that perfect look so they would have to put a lot of make-up.<n>2) B: appear beautiful. This is more commonly known.<n>3) C: Free Slavery. This can happen because of high pay or if you were taken into slavery you could be used for runaways. I think models in slavery are more likely to be paid because they are needed in high fashion.<n>4) D: Pay Bills. This can happen because there are no more payments to be paid if you were able to pay off whatever you owe.<n>5) E: Suffering pain. Models are notoriously bad for their health, this could become a permanent feature.<n>6) If you consider everything, you would see that the question is about models and not about people, so D: Pay Bill is the best option.<n><n><n><n><n><n>

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas.

Choices:  A: run B: swimming C: calculate things quickly D: fight enemy E: urinate<n>Output:		1) The question asks why someone would be full of fear. <n>2) We then consider each of options available.<n>3) Option A: run. A person who runs can be wet since there is a change in their climate as they move quickly across the environment.<n>4) Option B: swimming. If a person is swimming, which is usually done in water, then they would get wet as they move across the water surface.<n>5) Option C: calculate things quickly. If someone is stressed, the brain can't do its task of calculating things quickly as it is full with emotions.<n>6) Option D: fight enemy. A person who fights with an enemy is likely to get wet in the process.<n>7) Option E: urinate. In some cases, a person who is feeling fear may urinate.<n>8) After considering all the options it is clear that option B, swimming, is the only one that is applicable.<n>9) The person who is thinking about the question will be full of fear. However, since there is no specification whether they are male or female, the question is still ambiguous.<n><n>Input: Is it better for someone who is drowning to stay on the boat or to be in the water? Choices: <n> A: stay on the boat B: go back to the boat C: get out of the boat D: keep on the boat E: jump off the boat<n> Output: First, let's consider all the given choices.<n>1. Stay Aboard a Boat: This should not be the best choice since the person is drowning. It would be better to get off the boat and to the shore.<n>2. Go Back to the Boat: This should also not be the best choice if the boat is already at risk of capsizing. In such a case, it would be better to swim to the shore.<n>3. Keep On the Boat: This is not a good choice either. The boat is in danger of sinking and the person should get out of any danger as soon as possible.<n>4. Leave the Boat: This seems to be the best choice since it allows for the fastest way of escape.<n><n>Input: Why does it matter whether or not a tree is dead? Choices: 1.

Therefore, option A should not be the correct option.<n>4th statement:Option B: Solar energy: Solar energy is more modern than traditional heat sources like fire and coal, and is also not used in Dan’s house. There are solar panels on his roof but these are designed primarily to produce electricity that he could then use to make heat through his air conditioning unit. Therefore, option b should not be the correct choice.<n><n>5th statement: Option C: Sun: Dan's house and sun are not mutually exclusive. Dan's house may be built with windows to catch rays from the sun and to allow natural light and heat to enter the house.<n><n>6th statement: Option D: House: It is possible that Dan’s house may be heated by heat generated by the heating device inside the house. Therefore, option D cannot be completely discarded.<n><n>7th statement: Option E: Coal or wood: This should not be the answer because this option refers to the heat source that Dan will use for generating heat inside his home and not for heating his home. Therefore, option E should not be the answer.<n><n>8th statement: It then becomes clear that fire would be the oldest heat source used in Dan's house.<n><n>So the final answer should be A: fire<n>

Since only the question asks which of the choices are the cause of a person to produce through invitre, _larger family_ is not the one that would cause invitre to occur.<n>7)So, the correct answer should be Option E: baby

Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall.

Choices:  A: euphoria B: rhythmic movement C: music D: moving body E: having fun<n>Output:		The question is asking what skill the instructor taught her.<n>We consider each of the given choices to see which one is correct.<n>1. Option A: Euphoria. The word Euphoria does not suggest any particular kind of skill; it is a state of mind that can be experienced even without a particular skill like dancing. However, the instructor may have taught her how to achieve this state of mind by dancing rhythmically.<n>2. Option B: Rhythmic movement. It can be inferred from the statement that she was bad at dancing that the instructor taught her how to develop rhythmic movement. This is an important skill that can help one to develop a sense of coordination and timing, which can improve their dancing skills.<n>3. Option C: Music. The instructor might have taught her how to listen to music and follow the beat for smooth dancing. Music can help a person to stay in rhythm while dancing.<n>4. Option D: Moving body. This is an essential skill that is critical for dancing. The instructor may have taught the girl how to properly move her body for dancing.<n>5. Option E: Having fun. This can be part of a person's dancing experience, but it is not necessarily a skill unto itself. The instructor could instead have taught her how to enjoy dancing by keeping it light-hearted and fun.<n>In conclusion, we can deduce that Option B: Rhythmmovement is the best option as it is the most relevant to the question and the one that is most likely to be taught to improve someone's dancing skills.<n><n>Input:Why are most birds in northern Europe afraid to fly far from the ground?

Hanging clothes in a closed closet may not be effective in removing the smell.<n>4) Option B: sniff. This is not feasible or practical, as it doesn’t address the clothes still smelling, which is the main problem.<n>5) Option C: get dirty. This option isn’t practical as clothes will stay dirty, which will likely attract and worsen any existing odors.<n>6) Option D: become soiled. This option wouldn’t work either due to further accumulating dirt.<n>7) Option E: air out. This option could be a potential solution to the problem, as it suggests that airing out your clothes could help remove any odor or soot that is hindering their smell. This could be done by keeping them in an area with good ventilation such as a balcony or rooftop.<n>8) After considering all options, option E, airing out, seems to be the best possible choice for this scenario.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the multiple choice question.

If we cannot learn, it is possible that our intelligence or reasoning skills will decline.<n>4: Option B: education. If we cannot learn from our education, it may be difficult to obtain new knowledge or skills from educational programs.<n>5: Option D: distress. If we are unable to learn, it may cause discomfort or frustration and lead to distress.<n>6: Option E: a stupid. The possibility of an "a" being at this location is likely to be omitted, and as this term is rarely used to convey the concept that an individual is unable to learn, it does not meet the criteria for the correct answer.<n>7: Based on the information provided in the passage, answer E: a stupid cannot be considered as a correct answer choice.<n>Therefore, the final answer should be A: intelligence<n><n>Input: What is one of the reasons why people travel around the world?

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: 1. The question is asking where you could find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty.<n>2. We then consider each of the given options.<n>3. Option A: oil refineries. Even though there may be water available in oil refineries, it is not safe to drink as it may be contaminated with oil.<n>4. Option B: wall. In most cases, there may be water pipes inside walls of buildings that supplies water. Therefore, if you are thirsty, these pipes in the wall may be of use to you as they may contain drinkable water.<n>5. Option C: show. It doesn't specify what kind of "show" it is, but if it's a TV show, there could be no actual plumbing. If it's a trade show, you could find usable plumbing in display booths or restroom areas. Therefore, the possibility of getting drinkable water from a "show" depends largely on context and cannot be completely ruled out.<n>6. Option D: own home. This should not be the correct answer because in your own home, the plumbing serves you with fresh water, which you can drink when you're thirsty.<n>7. Option E: water fountain. Plumbing for a water fountain usually includes potable water that is treated and safe to drink.<n>8. After considering all the options, it is clear that option A, oil refineries, is the only one where you would not access potable water through the plumbing.<n>So the final answer is A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:People were talking on the corner, who were they talking with? Choices:  A: god B: mix C: with people D: have friends E: see people<n>Output:		1) The possible choices are given as A, B, C, D, and E, which correspond to answers "God", the phrase "With people", "Have friends", "See people", and "Mix", respectively.<n>2) The question is asking about whom the people are talking with, and the answer can be interpreted subjectively. For example, "With people" or "See people" may mean the same individual. "Have friends" could mean your pals that you're with. It could mean it's a group of people you're friends with. "Mix" is subjective, could be a friend, could be people you run into by random chance. It may depend on the context.<n>3) All of these could be considered correct. If we pick C and D, it is clear that the people are talking with people and have friends/see people. However, A, B, and E could be interpreted to refer to the same individual, since the people are talking to one (mix or see) or many (with or have friends). <n>4) The ambiguity is in the word "with". Given the choices, A, B, C and D, the sentence "People are talking with people" would likely be confused for "with people would talk" which is incorrect. But with E, it would be likely that "people would be talking with people" would be interpreted correctly. However, there is an alternative interpretation for E where the phrase is just as ambiguous. Hence, none of the choices can be said to be incorrect or correctly inferred.<n><n>A "people were talking with each other/on each other/to each other/on each/to each other/a group of people" (without the preposition) would be a more reliable choice.<n><n>### Input<n><n>Input:  How much should be cut from each of the 35 trees so that the total does not exceed $650?

Choices:  A: measure distance B: england C: office D: drawer E: desk<n>Output:		Answer: E: desk Choices that explain the answer: 1.

Option C, office, measures the length of an object.<n>4. Option D, drawer, may contain rulers but it is doubtful if they are owned by different people.<n>5. Option E, desk, definitely contains rulers that belong to different people and there is a very high probability that one can find different rulers on different desks.<n>

Choices:  A: eaten B: glassess C: jar D: pizza E: refrigerator<n>Output:		1.The question is asking where you can put some olives that would prevent then from getting nearby food wet.<n>2. The answer will be in the form of nouns or pronouns, such as "jarring the olives" or "putting the olives on the pizza." Therefore, the answer must not end with a noun or pronoun, but rather a verb like "to keep" or "to protect."<n>3. Option A, "to eat the olives" - is a noun not a verb. So the choice does not meet our requirements.<n>4. Option B, "glasses" - is incorrect as it does not contain the word "keep", nor can it be used in a sentence as anything else but a verb. Therefore, the choice does not meet the required form.<n>5. Option D is incorrect because it does not contain the right verb form, and even so, it cannot be used as the answer to the question because the context of the question refers to food-contamination, not water, which is kept in the fridge.<n>6. Option B is incorrect because it does reference the correct verb form, but it is not a question of food-contamination.<n>7. The answer is: C : jar. <n><n>

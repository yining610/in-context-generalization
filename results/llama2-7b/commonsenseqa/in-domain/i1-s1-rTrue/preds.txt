Where might he go? Choices:  A: race track B: populated areas C: the desert D: apartment E: roadblock<n><n>### Response:		<n>### Demonition: <n>Input: Sammy wanted to go to "where the people are" to be with them for a change.<n><n>### Rational:<n>1. Given that the people are where the people are, Sammy would go to "where the water is" in order to find potable water among the people.<n>2. "Where the People are" can mean many things, but one logical place where Sammy could go to find them could be in "where people go to be among other people."<n>3. Hence, the answer would be "the Desert" (Option D) because that is one possibility where the people go and where the water is.<n><n>Answer: D: The Desert; B: Population Center - Population Center might as well be a population!<n><n>1. Desert in case you cannot find water<n><n>2. Desert, in case they use their water<n><n>In 90% of the cases, Desert must be the correct answer...<n>

Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question asks where you would find some plumbing that would not be useful in relieving your thirst.<n>2.

Choices:  A: united states B: mexico C: countryside D: atlas E: oceans<n><n>### Response:		 A:united states<n><n>### Rationale:The question asks what replacement GPS services have done. The answer is highway and street GPS: GPS cannot be used in the countryside, but only on major highways. Also, GPS provides an exact, accurate, and constant direction.<n><n>### Input:"The old joke goes: What's red, sticky, and sits on a shelf? A cherry tomato." Do you think cherry tomato has too wide of a market or too narrow? Choices: <n>	A: Too narrow, as it is a very common vegetable <n>	B: Too narrow, because this is the one joke you find about it. <n>	C: Too wide, as there are other tomatoes besides cherry. <n>	D: Too wide, because it represents so many different things. <n>	E: Too narrow, by virtue of how common it is. <n><n>### Response:"Too narrow",because there is only one joke about cherry tomatoes in the known universe.<n><n>### Rationales: <n>	1. The question tells us that the old joke goes "What's red, stick, and sits on the window sill?"<n>	2. Analyzes the joke: it is about cherry tomatoes; it's one joke, it is "red and sits on the shelf", thus the options B and E can be ruled out. (Option A could also be true, but there are more jokes about cucumbers, for example).<n>	3. Therefore, the answer is "too narrow", since the only available joke is about cherry tomato.<n><n>### 26:48  26:55<n>

Choices:  A: jewelry store B: neck C: jewlery box D: jewelry box E: boutique<n><n>### Response:		<n>1. The question asks us to locate a choker not in a jewel box. The options are a jewelry store, a jewelry case, a jewel box, a jewelery box, and a jewelry boutique.<n>2. We first need to narrow down the choices that do have chokers. This means we need to look at B, E and C.<n>3. So looking at the options A, B, C, D, and E, the only 2 things that would be of help are a jewel box and a jewelery boutique.<n>4. However, a jewelbox does not stock chokers thus if we pick the jewel box it would be of no use to us.<n>5. In a jewelry ring how would you get to a choker in jewelery? I would probably have to take out 2 rings to get a choker. So even if the jewelry case has it, I don't think it will be of much utility to me.<n>6. What is more feasible is the jewelery boutiques which would have a wide variety of jewellery to choose from and a choker would be just one of them.<n>7. Hence, the answer to the question of where to locate a choker is jewelery boutque.<n><n>Answer: E: jewelery boutquez

Where might he go? Choices:  A: race track B: populated areas C: the desert D: apartment E: roadblock<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>### Rationale: 1. The person is a dog (Sammy). Since dogs love people and are curious, the character would surely want to be with people.<n><n>### 2. This suggests that the character would be looking for a populated area.<n><n>### Analyzing the options<n>   - Racetrack (Option A) does sound populated, but there wouldn't be a place to go in the crowd to drink water, for example; it's not a place where someone would normally associate with getting water.<n>   - Desert (Option C) is probably where the character wouldn't find water.<n>   - Apartment (Option E) is probably not what we're thinking about. It probably would feature water if there were humans present, but we don't know how the character would have access to it.<n>   - Roadblock (Option E) is not the answer. That'll get us stopped.<n>   - Popularized Areas (Option B) are almost certainly going to feature water for people, but Sammy needs to drink, so he would need to go to a place where his own kind can obtain water.<n><n>### Hence, the answer would be populated areas (Option B).<n>Answer: B:populated areas<n><n>### Instructions:Complete the sentence using appropriate grammar and structure.<n><n>### Sentence<n><n>Miranda ___________________ for the phone after that.<n><n>### Response<n><n>### The answer could be "ran for the phone after that."<n>### Another acceptable answer could be, "ran for the phone"<n><n>### Rationales: 1) The sentence refers to someone running after the phone.<n>2) Thus, the answer refers to action and is also correct grammar.<n>3) Miranda (the subject) is ran (run) to the phone.<n>4) Thus, the answer is a run for the phone after that (the end of the sentence)

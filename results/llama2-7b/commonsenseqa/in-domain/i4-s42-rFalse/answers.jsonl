In the first sentence is was mentioned that he fantasized about a promotion which means he wanted a promotion and was thinking about when he would get it. In the second sentence, he said he excelled at social science but his favorite subject was history, this shows that he loved the job and probably had great ambitions.\n- The best ways to help John study would be to give him inspiration and motivation to do better. I think these are the best ways to help with his memory. More intelligence is already there so I do not think that there is anything someone can do to help him with this. I don\u2019t think that headaches are the best way to help. This would make studying more difficult because it would cause pain to the head and might cause distraction. More intellgience could cause distraction.\n- In the answer options B, D, E, F all of these options are food related and this is my interpretation of the question. From what I got from the question, the cat that was wild was the cat that was chasing after the lasagna (I infer that this was a person because people are the animals that John knew to be wild).

A line up method with overloaded methods (a method for each choice) that does the following: \n    - Decrements the int index from +1 and prints a capital letter.\n    - If the index is smaller than 0 and the line array is not null, add to the end of the line.\n    - The line array if it is not null needs to be converted to a String.\n    - Repeat these steps until the end of the array is reached or the index is no longer negative, whichever comes first, and the lineArray contains no strings. \n\n- 2.  A sort method that does the following:\n    - Reverses the order of the line with no parameters. \n    - Reversing requires two elements.\n    - Adds the indices of the elements to array.\n    - Removes the elements from the line. \n    - Adds a null index in the line.\n    This requires an overloaded method for each option chosen.  \n   - In both methods, the method should not use the index parameter but rather only the element parameter.\n\n### Input2: If there is a string called a coin stack, create a method that would print the words \"one, two, three\" for the top 3 coins in the coin stack (a stack that can contain multiple denominations of the same value like pennies and dimes so multiple 1 coins exists and the stack may be empty.

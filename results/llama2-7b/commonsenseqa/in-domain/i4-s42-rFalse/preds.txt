There was no mention of construction, hence my answer is C: a massive bear.<n><n>### Revision:<n>My revision of the prompt, in order to eliminate any confusion regarding the purpose: <n>He fantasied about getting [a new car] while driving to work and [the pros and cons of the] extra responsibilities and [benefits] of [what].<n><n>Input: Jan enjoyed going to the science museum because it allowed him to develop a fascination with what? Choices: A: chemistry B: mathematics C: engineering D: biology E: physics<n><n>Answer: A: chemistry<n><n><n>### Input <n>Jan enjoyed going to the science [museum because it allowed him to] develop a fascination [for chemistry].<n><n>### Reception:<n><n>In this case, it’s all about reading the prompt carefully and avoiding the natural inclination to jump to the first answer that seems like it fits the context.<n><n>His sentence structure here is confusing and it’s not immediately obvious what he’s talking about, so I had to slow down and read the sentence several times.<n><n>### Pre-Assessment - Sentence Structure<n><n>I found that I was able to complete a lot of the prompts without even knowing their structure on the first go round. This is because I have been trained to pick out grammar patterns and structure from conversations.<n><n>### Challenge – Sentence Structure<n>However, the prompt that I chose as my challenge was one that I struggled with a lot. When I first read it, it took me a long time to get past the grammatical mistakes. <n><n>### Example 1 – “Jane couldn’t concentrate on her homework because the dog kept jumping on her.”<n><n>Jane couldn’t [concentrate] her on homework because the dog [jumped on her] repeatedly. “<n><n>### Example I - Sentence Structure challenge 1: <n>I would use some version of “Due to” in my revised script. “

Choices:  P: whiskey and bourbon Q: cola  R: tequila S: vodka<n><n>### Response<n><n><n>The man drank tequila  I say this because he enjoyed nice conversations with the bartender.  The bartender used to give him advice and the man was in it for the fun times and friendly chatter.<n><n>### Response B<n><n>I believe that the man was a vet.  I say this from the fact that the man is a nice person who enjoys conversation with the bartender who gives him advice throughout his hard day.  As a vet, he would have to deal with many emotions and many other people as well as animals. Vets need to deal with lots of anger, aggression, sadness and fear.  The man would most likely enjoy coming out in public to enjoy friendly conversations with the bistro.<n><n><n>

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: He fantasied about getting a what while driving to work and the pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits? Choices:  A: new car B: promotion C: boredom D: impatience E: pressure<n>Answer: B: promotion<n><n>Input: He was good at traditional science but excelled at social science, his favorite subject was what?

Choices:  A: stealing B: four legs C: tuna fish D: food now E: nap<n>Answer: E: nap<n><n>### Input:John had a lot of respect for Jill, but not many other people did.  She faced a lot of what? Choices:  A: ignoring B: being rude C: disparagement D: contumely E: uncertainty<n><n>### Response:		<n>- The correct answer to the question was Promotion and you can see this from the information given. In the first sentence is was mentioned that he fantasized about a promotion which means he wanted a promotion and was thinking about when he would get it. In the second sentence, he said he excelled at social science but his favorite subject was history, this shows that he loved the job and probably had great ambitions.<n>- The best ways to help John study would be to give him inspiration and motivation to do better. I think these are the best ways to help with his memory. More intelligence is already there so I do not think that there is anything someone can do to help him with this. I don’t think that headaches are the best way to help. This would make studying more difficult because it would cause pain to the head and might cause distraction. More intellgience could cause distraction.<n>- In the answer options B, D, E, F all of these options are food related and this is my interpretation of the question. From what I got from the question, the cat that was wild was the cat that was chasing after the lasagna (I infer that this was a person because people are the animals that John knew to be wild). I did not get it from the question and it was not asked in the question<n>- Disparagement: the question and its options could be used in a sentence where a person tells another person that they should not talk to them like that. I think that the sentence should read something like this: You should not talk to me in that tone because I am always looking for compliments and encouragement.<n><n>

I know he should not have but we all know John and he is always trying to show people how much money he has because he is jealous of them and that is why he spent all his money and made himself look like an idiot.  I think that people just dont like him and just want things from him.  He is jealous of his friend because they are all well off and always have money. I feel that John will not make this mistake again.<n><n>### Input : I have never done this before but I need to help my friend, what is the best way to go about finding out what the customer's problem is?<n><n>### Response : I believe that the most effective way of solving customer problems would be by taking a detailed inventory of the problems as they arise through your sales calls.  Then compare the items on the list with the list of things you are able to sell in which case you can make suggestions.  This can be very valuable for the customer because they may not have realized that the product they are using already fixes their problem and it will be a benefit not only for the company but the individual as well.<n><n>### Demo:<n><n>**Input**:A friend of mine has never emailed in his life but he wants to write an essay. Write an email that would help him with the writing of the essay from the perspective of a friend.<n><n>**Response**:I know your busy and I am sure you dont have time but here is a website that you maybe able to find some information there. [ http://essaybee.com/essays]. There is some information there that is free to use and there is other information that you have to pay for. This website has all kinds of resources to help people write essays and I know you are a great writer but it might help if you had some help with your grammar and I believe they have a site were you can just put in what type of essay you need to write and if they have someone that would be available you get notified. The price varies but it is not out of the reach of most people, they have packages starting at 30$ to help with writing and they have some free things for you to use also. I hope you like the web and good luck with your paper.<n><n>

A line up method with overloaded methods (a method for each choice) that does the following: <n>    - Decrements the int index from +1 and prints a capital letter.<n>    - If the index is smaller than 0 and the line array is not null, add to the end of the line.<n>    - The line array if it is not null needs to be converted to a String.<n>    - Repeat these steps until the end of the array is reached or the index is no longer negative, whichever comes first, and the lineArray contains no strings. <n><n>- 2.  A sort method that does the following:<n>    - Reverses the order of the line with no parameters. <n>    - Reversing requires two elements.<n>    - Adds the indices of the elements to array.<n>    - Removes the elements from the line. <n>    - Adds a null index in the line.<n>    This requires an overloaded method for each option chosen.  <n>   - In both methods, the method should not use the index parameter but rather only the element parameter.<n><n>### Input2: If there is a string called a coin stack, create a method that would print the words "one, two, three" for the top 3 coins in the coin stack (a stack that can contain multiple denominations of the same value like pennies and dimes so multiple 1 coins exists and the stack may be empty. In other words, this method is being asked to print what is in the stack if it is a 3 coin stack of any denomination.  <n><n>### Output: The stack is 3 quarters and 2 dimes so the output should be "one, two,3"<n><n>### Input3: If there is a 4 element array of objects called a class called a queue  in Java then create a method called front <n>  that will  return the object at the front of the queue if there is an object there  and null if no object is present.<n><n>### Output1: The queue is 25, 15, 11, 10 and the front function would return 25.<n>  <n>### Output2: The queue is 5, 3 and 2 and the front

Choices:  A: riots B: vote C: change yourself D: social activism E: change clothes<n><n>### Response:		I would change myself with hard work and dedication. I would practice the things required for being a better citizen, a respectful partner & husband, and a productive worker. As I change myself, I would also take on social issues in the public arena. As I change, I believe that a bigger change would take place within me, which would change me for the better.<n><n>### Input2: How might you change yourself?<n><n>Response: As I think about myself, I realize that change is necessary at every stage of life. If I want to be successful in life, then I have to change with each new development, each change in technology and new developments within myself. I can't stay stuck on old ideas, in the hopes that they would work out for me. What I have to do is to learn new skills, think outside the box and try to understand life for what it is. Then I will have a change in me that will be the catalyst for a positive change within myself and thus a change in the world around me. Changes have to be made if we are to grow individually and collectively. If changes are not made and positive development doesn't take place, then the status quo will take over and there will be no advancements in culture, science, or technological development. We have to be willing to have change and move forward, otherwise change will have us and we won't be able to keep up.<n><n>### How was it?<n>* [Getting Started](https://exercism.io/tracks/python3-fuzz/exercises/getting-started)<n>* [Getting Help 📱](https://get.help.exercism.io)<n>* [GitHub Issues 💬](https://github.com/exercism/python3_fuzz/issues)<n>* [Stack Overflow ✨](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/exercism)<n>* [Discussions 🗣️](https://github.basecamphq.com/exercisms/python3_futz-exercises/discussions)<n>* [About Contributing 💻](https://github.io/exercism/docs/technical.html)<n><n>### Further Resources<n>* [Educ

That's when the police investigated and discovered that this boy was 13 years at the time he committed the crime. His method was to  hide the body in the woods and to cover the blood spots with  a lot of dirt around to avoid detection.   The suspect was arrested and found guilty. At that time, he was sentenced to life in jail.  The police never imagined GPS devices which would help them find the crime's exact location. This lead to the suspect  being re-sentenced to 30 years without parole. There has to be a way to find clues and solve a case without having to use GPS systems. They have to keep searching for more clues and evidence that's right in front of them. They have to remember this situation has happened more than once and that GPS does help the police solve cases.

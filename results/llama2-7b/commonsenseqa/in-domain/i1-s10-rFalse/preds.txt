Choices:  A: curtains B: tailor shop C: clothing store D: sewing room E: hardware store<n>Output: B: tailor shop<n><n>Input:Where can someone keep a digital file? Choices:  A: suitcase B: filing cabinet C: computer D: desk drawer E: cloud<n>Output:		A: suitcase<n><n>Input: Which color is used the most in clothes Choices:  A : red B: yellow C: black D: green<n>Output: A: red<n><n>A: Suitcase B: Sewing room C: Curtains D: Computer E: Tailor Shop <n><n><n><n>#### Answer<n><n>Input: suitcase<n><n>Explanation: Clothes need to be kept in a place where it can be carried from place to place. Suitcase can be taken from a store to one's home to keep.<n>Explanation: A suitcase can be placed in a closet which can be in the room or in one's room.<n><n>Explanation. Clothes are mostly white or of light colour. Most clothing stores sell clothes that are white or light colour, thus a light coloured curtain or drape would be best suited to keep it. Moreover, curtains or drapes are hung in windows whereas walls and shelves are used to hang clothes. Hence, a window or a door is better suited as a place to keep lights coloured clothes.<n><n>Explanations: Curtains would be the best place to keep a file. It can be put on a shelf/window and the file can be taken out easily when needed. Moreover, if the files are of large size (eg. blueprints), then they would need to be stored in a place away from the reach of an animal so putting in the closet or the filing box on the desk are not good options. The best option, therefore, would be placing it in the curtain so that it can be taken out as per need and can always be kept away from the reach of animals.<n>

Inside the function I have created a class that is called _question_ which has a `question()` method. The `question()` method takes the user input and compares it to values in an instance variable of a class called _choices_. If it is equal to the correct choice, I add that choice to an array. Finally I call my `answer_all()` function to ask all questions and tell the user the answer. My function starts by creating the instance variables:<n><n>```swift<n>import Foundation<n><n>/// [A] curtains.<n>let curtains = ("curtains", "curtains")<n><n>/// [B] tailor shop.<n>let tailorShop = ["tailor shop", "tailor shop"]<n>```<n><n>My function starts by generating an array containing all possible input values:<n><n>```swift <n>var choicesArray = ["curtains\(count)", "curtains\(maxStringLength)\(input.uppercased())", "curtains\"]<n>```<n><n>Next, I use _curtains_ as the default answer choice. I use `contains` to put that string in the choices array if the user's input is equal to _curtains_. This ensures that `curtains` is in the choices array. Then I compare the user's input to the _tailorShop_ variable, which stores all of the possible _tailor shop_.<n><n>```swift 3<n>if choicesArray.contains("tailor shop"){<n>    for _ in 0..<tailorShop.count{<n>      choicesArray.append(tailorShop[index])<n>      index += 1<n>    }<n>}<n>```<n><n>Finally I print the choices as an array and ask for the user's input, which is passed to the `answer()` function. The `answer()` function takes in two parameters, the questionsString and the userInputString. I want to make an empty input, which is why I am using `var`, to be the default answer.<n><n>```swift 4<n>```<n><n>#### Question1: What cuisine is jokingly referred to as small dogs?<n>```swift <n>print("Which type of dog-

Also, since you are asking us to create code for you, you need to do it yourself 1st, and then ask questions about your code. <n><n>Comment: `C: torso`.  *torso* is the correct answer.  *Wouldn't take the hit* is not the question.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Fabric is cut to order at what type of seller? Choices:  A: curtains B: tailor shop C: clothing store D: sewing room E: hardware store<n>Output: B: tailor shop<n><n>Input:Billy bounced the ball off the wall.  There was a target on the wall for him to bounce against.  Where might he be? Choices:  A: pool table B: toy box C: playroom D: park E: closet<n>Output:		A: pool table<n><n>### Solution 1<n><n>```python3<n>In the first statement, we can see that the fabric for curtains is cut to order at a 'curtain shop'. The input is "fabric"; that means we should check for 'curtains'. The question is asking which 'type of seller'. This can be an 'individual' that uses a 'hardware store'. We cannot answer this as it is not the closest match.<n><n>In the second statement, we can see the input is 'he' (which is Billy). Billy bounced his ball off the wall, which is a type of wall. We can then check the closest match, which is whether the input is 'playroom' or 'pool table'. These are similar enough so we cannot answer this as the closest match.<n>```<n><n>### Solution: Two<n>```python3<n>First statement: Curtain fabric can be cut at either a curtain shop or a tailor shop. We need to find which seller the input is. The input for this problem is 'Fabric' so we need to think about the 'type'. Since fabric can be cut to order, we can eliminate a curtain store as it would be impossible to cut to order something that has already been made. We can then eliminate tailor shops as they make things to order, so they could make a curtain out of fabric and then have the fabric cut to size at a curtain shop.<n>Second statement: From the previous paragraph, we know that it is either a curtain or a pool because they can both be cut to order. We cannot use a tailor shop. I could be a pool toy, but I feel like it's more likely to be a real pool ball. The rest is either in a playroom or the pool. Since the input is a pronoun, I decided to just exclude the pool as you wouldn't say you played for your "self".<n>```<n>

As the user has the goal of picking up certain food items, Python can make suggestions by implementing an IF/ELSE statement.  If the user inputs something as a noun or question, the program will then make an appropriate suggestion. For instance, if a user chooses to describe that they need a good way to cut food in bulk and store it, Python can make suggestions such as buying a food processor or using a vacuum sealer. We can implement a random element by using a for loop.<n><n>Note: You may not want to include everything; try to pick just 1 or two items.<n><n>### Example question:<n>I am making food for 5 people!

Clothing stores use them often for all sorts of things. I chose a clothing store because I believe people would choose clothing stores before fabric stores because of the nature of the question - it's all about saving money, so people would want to go to somewhere close to where they live. A fabric store is generally way out in the sticks with no stores around so they won't be able to save much money if they decide to go there. I also thought clothing stores were more likely to have fabric because they sell clothes and they do more of the same thing and they do not mind the extra work (people who use fabric for different clothes could go to a clothing store for some of their materials). I picked a "taillor shop" but really it should have been a "dry cleaner" because they work better with fabric and also people who wear them go there so a taioloor won't know what to do. For curtains, they go to a hardware store. I chose a man who wears a tuxedo because men's suits for weddings are usually formal whereas in the US wearing a tux or suit is expected for less formal functions. In other countries wearing a tux is seen as less formal but still formal, but in the us it is seen as formal and it would be very odd to wear a tux to other events outside weddings. The man is also very wealthy because he is flaunting it and he wears tuxedos for weddings (the whole point is to be flaunting it). The questions that really made it complicated was the first one and the second one, because the only other options were more complicated (europian/european/palace-tuxedo/tuxedo-wedding)<n><n></pre><n><n><n><n>### Instruction: Answer the following multiple choice question<n><n>Input: A clerk is selling what on the street corner?

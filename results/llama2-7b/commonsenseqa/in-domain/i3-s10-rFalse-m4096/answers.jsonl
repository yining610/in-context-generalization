Firstly, there is the skiing in the Rocky Mountains that I enjoy.  Skiing allows a person to really understand how nature in Canada works.  Each year we spend about one week learning how to manoeuvre the snow, and we always have a great time.  Once I am back from learning how to ski I can begin to build houses.  I help to build houses that are part of the government\u2019s affordable housing program, which gives back to those citizens and families who need it most.  Each week I try to volunteer for about two to three hours because I enjoy seeing people smile once their homes are finished.  I am able to give back, and it gives me an inner feeling that I made a difference.  For these two activities, I always wear a winter jacket, but in the summer I wear short sleeves.\n\n### Instructions: Answer the following multiple choice question\n\nInput:When you walk, you are wearing so that you: Choices: A) protect your brain in case of an accident B) protect your arms and wrists C) keep yourself warm D) keep your head, arms and joints protected  E) keep your eyes protected F) keep your ears and mouth protected G) keep your feet protected H) \n\nOutput: A: protect your brain in case accident\n\n#### Instructions: Answer these multiple choice questions\n\nInput: When you wash vegetables, water is used: Choices:  A) for the vegetables  B) to keep you clean  C) for the dishes D) to fill the sink\nOutput: A: For the vegetables\n\nInput: What is another", "answer": "D: wakefulness"}

In the following code, items are added by adding the previous word to a list and creating a new item to continue appending words. If the first word is long enough to break your length, it will be added first. You could also do the same thing by generating a list the first time, saving it, and getting the max length if you need a value that is already stored. \n\n# Implementation: `stacklist = []`  \n# For i in range(1, len(word)+1):  \n#     if(str.isalnum(word[i-1])):  \n#         stacklist.append(word[i-2])  \n#     else:  \n#         break  \n# print(stacklist.pop()).", "answer": "B: magazines"}

Use the following API's and classes from this module.\n\n* `vector`\n* `map`\n  * Use the two-parameters constructor to initialize with a custom value.\n  * Use the `find()` to get a reference to that key to another container within the mapping.\n* `std::set`\n  * Use `hash` instead of `find` to get a reference to the target.\n* `if()` with switch using a case label and its expression to evaluate.\n* `for_each()`\n* `map function of map`\n\n### Tip\nTo create a copy of a pointer, you may want to learn about [placement new](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/new) in addition to [smart pointers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_pointer). It'd be too much information for this week, however.\n\n\n### Hint\n\nCreate a variable whose type is the same as the first argument in the function definition for a lambda expression.

Time consumed: 1 hour and 56 minutes.\n\n![](../../assets/images/interview-experience/tata-digital-2.png)\n\n### Topic 1: What are the 3 types of databases which would be widely used nowadays?\n\nAns: RDBMS, NoSQL, SQL\n\n### Top 2: In an RDBMS what is the name given to the group of related data elements?\n\nAns/Ref: Database Schema, Database Object, Database Model or Entity, Record, Table and Columns\n\n### Topics 3-5 were basically on the data structuring and its query languages - all from the SQL perspective, like creating a table in a database (with columns using the proper data types, how to make a primary key and what not), joining/subqueries as per the query language used.\n\n### Top topic 6:  What are the best practices for writing queries?\n\n1. Using JOIN's, but the way they asked me, it was like, \"Would you ever use subqueries?\" It was yes/no.\n2. Use of aliases for every column in the result, as long as the column names are unique.\n3. Not having any NULL values, I said I can't use DISTINCT as an operator to remove all the non-existing records. (They asked in another round, saying that there would be a huge number of records and I would use a DISTINCT to check whether there was a record or not. )\n\n### Top Question 7: How would you join the data in a table with their respective values by using different joins?\n\n1. Inner join - returns all the columns/values from the 2 tables joined. \n2. Left join - returns all columns/values from the left table, where the 2 tables are joined.\n3. Right join - Like the left join, but with opposite table, so returns all columns/values of right table as well\n4. Cross Join - Returns values of all the rows or columns, or rows from a given table\n5. Full Join - Like cross join but returns all the joined records, so that no column does not exist due", "answer": "B: louisiana"}

{"idx": 250, "text": "A: countrysie\n\n\n### Multiple Choice\n\n\n<h1>Solution to the Multiple Choice:</h1>\n\nThe answer to this is a bit tricky.\n\nLet's look at a few of the questions.\n\n#. Answer the following multiple choice question:\n\nIf you go to your local sewing room to buy a dress your mom made, you are not likely to go to the curtain or hardware shop. You would likely go to the store that has clothing.  Clothes, shoes, and accessories are bought at clothing stores such as a department store, or boutique.\n\nClothes, shoes and accessories are mostly bought at the stores that sell only clothes, shoes as accessories, such as clothing store or boutiques. Clothing stores generally sell branded clothing and accessories, and there's a dress or two in any clothing store. Department stores are a different animal altogether. They carry everything from cars to baby clothes. So you won't find the dress your mom made, or the bust that will go with it, in a department store.\n\nDepartment stores carry almost everything (furniture, grocery, sports, toys and appliances) and they are big. They can be a little intimidating because there are thousands of products to choose from. \n\nYou'll often be buying several products at once: clothes, toys, appliances and so on.  \n\nYou likely go to the tailor shop to get your favorite pair of slacks hemmed, or a shirt taken in, or your pants adjusted at the inseam and hem. You expect the tailor to ask how high you want your pants to be, before they hem them.\n\nSeveral other factors come into it.  I know of a young couple that bought a fabric from a clothing store because they didn't want to bother putting the dress together.\n\nOne final note: I have bought a dress at a clothing store, but they did not sell accessories. I had to find those to go with the dress.\n\nFabric is cut to order, which means a garment is made to your size.\n\n<h1></1:>\n\n#. Answer:\n\nThe seller that cuts material", "answer": "C: dairy farm"}

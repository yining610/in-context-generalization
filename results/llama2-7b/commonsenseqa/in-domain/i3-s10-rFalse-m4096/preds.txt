Firstly, there is the skiing in the Rocky Mountains that I enjoy.  Skiing allows a person to really understand how nature in Canada works.  Each year we spend about one week learning how to manoeuvre the snow, and we always have a great time.  Once I am back from learning how to ski I can begin to build houses.  I help to build houses that are part of the government’s affordable housing program, which gives back to those citizens and families who need it most.  Each week I try to volunteer for about two to three hours because I enjoy seeing people smile once their homes are finished.  I am able to give back, and it gives me an inner feeling that I made a difference.  For these two activities, I always wear a winter jacket, but in the summer I wear short sleeves.<n><n>### Instructions: Answer the following multiple choice question<n><n>Input:When you walk, you are wearing so that you: Choices: A) protect your brain in case of an accident B) protect your arms and wrists C) keep yourself warm D) keep your head, arms and joints protected  E) keep your eyes protected F) keep your ears and mouth protected G) keep your feet protected H) <n><n>Output: A: protect your brain in case accident<n><n>#### Instructions: Answer these multiple choice questions<n><n>Input: When you wash vegetables, water is used: Choices:  A) for the vegetables  B) to keep you clean  C) for the dishes D) to fill the sink<n>Output: A: For the vegetables<n><n>Input: What is another

In the following code, items are added by adding the previous word to a list and creating a new item to continue appending words. If the first word is long enough to break your length, it will be added first. You could also do the same thing by generating a list the first time, saving it, and getting the max length if you need a value that is already stored. <n><n># Implementation: `stacklist = []`  <n># For i in range(1, len(word)+1):  <n>#     if(str.isalnum(word[i-1])):  <n>#         stacklist.append(word[i-2])  <n>#     else:  <n>#         break  <n># print(stacklist.pop()).<n>

Use the following API's and classes from this module.<n><n>* `vector`<n>* `map`<n>  * Use the two-parameters constructor to initialize with a custom value.<n>  * Use the `find()` to get a reference to that key to another container within the mapping.<n>* `std::set`<n>  * Use `hash` instead of `find` to get a reference to the target.<n>* `if()` with switch using a case label and its expression to evaluate.<n>* `for_each()`<n>* `map function of map`<n><n>### Tip<n>To create a copy of a pointer, you may want to learn about [placement new](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/new) in addition to [smart pointers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_pointer).

Time consumed: 1 hour and 56 minutes.<n><n>![](../../assets/images/interview-experience/tata-digital-2.png)<n><n>### Topic 1: What are the 3 types of databases which would be widely used nowadays?<n><n>Ans: RDBMS, NoSQL, SQL<n><n>### Top 2: In an RDBMS what is the name given to the group of related data elements?<n><n>Ans/Ref: Database Schema, Database Object, Database Model or Entity, Record, Table and Columns<n><n>### Topics 3-5 were basically on the data structuring and its query languages - all from the SQL perspective, like creating a table in a database (with columns using the proper data types, how to make a primary key and what not), joining/subqueries as per the query language used.<n><n>### Top topic 6:  What are the best practices for writing queries?<n><n>1. Using JOIN's, but the way they asked me, it was like, "Would you ever use subqueries?" It was yes/no.<n>2. Use of aliases for every column in the result, as long as the column names are unique.<n>3. Not having any NULL values, I said I can't use DISTINCT as an operator to remove all the non-existing records. (They asked in another round, saying that there would be a huge number of records and I would use a DISTINCT to check whether there was a record or not. )<n><n>### Top Question 7: How would you join the data in a table with their respective values by using different joins?<n><n>1. Inner join - returns all the columns/values from the 2 tables joined. <n>2. Left join - returns all columns/values from the left table, where the 2 tables are joined.<n>3. Right join - Like the left join, but with opposite table, so returns all columns/values of right table as well<n>4. Cross Join - Returns values of all the rows or columns, or rows from a given table<n>5. Full Join - Like cross join but returns all the joined records, so that no column does not exist due

Choices:  A: mountain dew B: glass C: soft drink D: whirlpool bath E: coffee cup<n>Output:		A: mountain dew<n><n>#### Question #1<n><n>##### Explanation of Answer<n>* In general: Fabric stores can also supply the clothing you want. (I don’t know how true that is, so I left it as an alternative.)<n><n>* In general: The other locations are all possibilities. (I don’think markets, tailors, sewing rooms, etc. are the kinds of places that would sell magazines. The train station seems right, though. The doctor’s office doesn’t necessarily come to mind either (but I guess the doctor’s office is possible).<n><n>##### General Question Instruction:<n>Another good example would be:<n><n>Input: Clothing comes from where? Choices:  Clothing store<n><n>Input: Who are you if you are waiting for a bus with a person with a t-shirt and pants in a clothing store? Choices:  B: waiting for a train A: tailor shop C<n><n>Input: Are you if you are reading a newspaper while waiting for a vehicle in a clothing store? Choices:  D: on a train A: at an airport<n>E: in a tailor shop<n><n><n>#### Question #2 <n><n>##### Exaplanation of Answer<n>* Train station: The train station is a place where trains sit idly or are actively leaving the station. So it’s a place where people sit around and wait for something, which may be (especially if you’re waiting in a modern train station in the US) waiting for a train. The trains do need oil to run. The other locations may be true, but they are not the only place where trains need to be refueled.<n><n>### Question #3<n><n>##### Examination of Answer:<n>* Fabrics come in many colors and designs which are important to create something nice.<n><n>### Problem #4<n><n>#### Explanation of Answer:<n>* The water (of all sorts) serves as lubricant.<n><n>### Solution:<n>Solution to Question #4<n><n>```Java<n>public static void main(String[] args) {<n>    <n>    String[] input={"Fabric is cut to order in what type of seller",<n>		  "Where are you if your reading an article about food?",<n>		  ""

It is completely dark, you can't be able to see anything in the cave. There is a huge stone wall, you can only find three ways to enter: to the left, to the right and behind you. You enter behind the stone wall, and you are not sure whether you are able to go back or not.

What would happen if you crawled all the way forward and see what happened? Choices: 1. When you crawled all the cave, you will see the light end of the whole cave; 2. When you crawled forward all the way, you will still not know if you can go back; 3. When you crawled, you will not know whether you were able to crawl forward or not; 4. You will be blocked and will not be able to crawl if you crawled all along; 5. When you crawled you saw yourself covered by stone wall.<n>Answer: (D)<n>You will not be able to go back, as the only three ways that you can enter is the left, the right and behind you, at this time you enter from behind, there are only 2 choices to go out after entering from behind.

Answer the following multiple choice question:<n><n>If you go to your local sewing room to buy a dress your mom made, you are not likely to go to the curtain or hardware shop. You would likely go to the store that has clothing.  Clothes, shoes, and accessories are bought at clothing stores such as a department store, or boutique.<n><n>Clothes, shoes and accessories are mostly bought at the stores that sell only clothes, shoes as accessories, such as clothing store or boutiques. Clothing stores generally sell branded clothing and accessories, and there's a dress or two in any clothing store. Department stores are a different animal altogether. They carry everything from cars to baby clothes. So you won't find the dress your mom made, or the bust that will go with it, in a department store.<n><n>Department stores carry almost everything (furniture, grocery, sports, toys and appliances) and they are big. They can be a little intimidating because there are thousands of products to choose from. <n><n>You'll often be buying several products at once: clothes, toys, appliances and so on.  <n><n>You likely go to the tailor shop to get your favorite pair of slacks hemmed, or a shirt taken in, or your pants adjusted at the inseam and hem. You expect the tailor to ask how high you want your pants to be, before they hem them.<n><n>Several other factors come into it.  I know of a young couple that bought a fabric from a clothing store because they didn't want to bother putting the dress together.<n><n>One final note: I have bought a dress at a clothing store, but they did not sell accessories. I had to find those to go with the dress.<n><n>Fabric is cut to order, which means a garment is made to your size.<n><n><h1></1:><n><n>#. Answer:<n><n>The seller that cuts material

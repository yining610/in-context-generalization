K: Answer the last letter of each word. C: Answer the central letter (median) of each word. A is not correct because 'was' is wrong. 'The sun' is the subject and 'was' is a form of verb, not subject. The answer to 'the sun was about to set' should be 'will set' because 'was' is a verb form that refers to the completion of a verb. B is not correct because'set' is wrong. B was a complete adjective form that can be used as predicate. Therefore, a predicate adjective takes a noun as its direct object. This can be clearly seen by the phrase 'will set on.' C is not correct because 'is about to set' is wrong. 'To' is not a verb. D is correct because'set' and'set' are both a verb form that refers completion of a verb. \n\nComment: Can you improve these answer explanations a bit? It's hard to follow for a human trying to understand and it's easy enough for a bot to find some random words and throw them together.\n\nAnswer: This is incorrect for 3 reasons:\n1. Demonstration: The input gives the question, the options, the question part, and the request. It omits any evidence to conclude that John was unfaithful. \"Because every husband expects to be, John must have been unfaithful.\" is a valid conclusion, it's the answer, but it doesn's take any information provided in the input to get there. (this is called circular reasoning.)\n2. The options seem to be about a thorough investigation, but the correct option deals with something John may have missed.

What is he talking about? Choices:  B: the past D: future F: other people C: problems E: dreams\nRationales: The question is asking what is the speaker talking about. \n1. The sentence says that he made us realize that we are \"not where we want to be\". \n2. This implies we don't know where we want to be and that the speaker is helping us figure out what it is.\n3. The given options are problems, dreams, hope, the past, future and other people. \n4. Problems and dreams are things we want to happen. \n5. The past can be an indicator of how we got to where we are now.\n6. However problem, dreams, and past are not specific and can only suggest what the speaker is saying.\n7. Hope is about the expectation or possibility about something to happen in the future. \n8. Future is about a time beyond the present or recent past. \n9. Therefore, the speaker is helping us to figure out the \"where\" we want to be and this should be in a future circumstance. \n10. This rules out other people and makes problems and dreams less probable. \n11. This leaves us with two choices: other people and the past, which have specific meanings and relate to the question.\n12. Since the speaker is making us realize our situation is not where we want it to be, it is reasonable to assume he's talking about our actions in our past - the choices B: the past, C: problems, E: hopes, F: other people and D: the future do not fit.\n13.

Similarly, Pocket does not directly mention the key, just the action of putting something into a pocket.\n7. Hence only B: open door is a direct implication of taking out the key.\n8. Also, although the given options state open doors, their sequence is misleading as they imply the sequence of pocket, turn lock, solution to problem, open door.\n9.

Choices:  J: You don\u2019t want to be there A: It is too difficult B: You get to choose your leader C: All people are allowed to voice their opinions D: Everyone gets to vote E: Democracy is the best government\nRationales: To be democratic, means following the process of democracy, and a democratic process would allow people to voice their opinions and then vote on the topic at hand. There are various forms of democracies. To be democratic means someone is trying to follow the democratic process.\n\n1. \"Democracy\" has been mentioned before \"process of democracy\" and \"You\" in paragraph 1 is \"democracy\" from \"process of democracy\".\n2. So, it can be inferred \"democracy\" is defined as the process of democracy.\n3. And the context is about \"democratic process\", which is \"You\" (\"democracy\") follow.\n4.

Choices:  B; at home C; in san diego D; at her best friend's house E; in baltimore\nRationales:  1. The given options suggest possible answers for the following question: Is there something about women that is specific to them? \n2. 'San diego' and 'baltimore' are large cities, and 'at home and 'at her best friend's' are specific to a certain person. However,'southwest' does not have a specific location or time.\n3. From other questions, 'at her best friend\u2019s' is more likely to be included for women, since it refers to the social life of women, but 'at home' usually occurs to men.\n4. 'Born in the southwest' could also imply a geographical location of where someone is now living. \n5. Thus, a woman born in the southwest will probably end up somewhere with the given conditions.\n6. However, the given options do not suggest that a woman should go back to her house if she is born in the south, so 'at her best friend''s house is not the most plausible answer. \n7. The given options do not indicate that the woman intends to have children someday, so 'in baltimore' cannot be the answer. \n8. Since we can eliminate all the possibilities and there is only one condition stated in the option, 'in san diego' must be the answer.  We just need to find a way to link it with the option:  san diego. \n9. The only common reason to go to san diego is a vacation, however, the conditions in the option are not vacation conditions. \n10. The", "answer": "D: elderly person"}
{"text": ", pocket and solution to problem.\n5. Turning a lock and pocket do not necessarily coincide with unlocking the door, since the latter has no physical movement involved. Thus A: turn lock is a plausible option.\n6. Lastly consider: solution to problem. This option is vague and unspecific. It might refer to a bike lock or a bicycle lock which might be involved in the action of opening the door, if such lock exists.\n7. Including solution to problem as a plausible option disregards D: pocket, because if this option were correct, pocket refers to the key.\n8. Additionally, although pocket can refer to the act of transporting something, it most likely refers specifically to carrying or keeping something.\n9. Because turning the lock can refer to the act and the result and also coincide with pocket, we can remove C: pocket as an option as it is not necessary for solving the given problem. \n10. Therefore, the correct option is B: turn lock.\nAnswer: B turn lock\n\nInput: If you go out at night, and it is storming, you may be what?  Choices:  A. Wetter B. Drier C. Foggier D. Better at seeing E. Scattered\nRationales: Considering the context of the statement, \"If it is storming, it rains\", the correct answer must be \"it may be wetter\".\nThe reason being \"scattered\" would not be an appropriate choice since scattering is the action of disordering or separating material (matter) into pieces and parts. Such action may or may not result in wetness.\nSimilarly, the choice of \"better at seeing\" would also not be correct since seeing is not necessarily related to precipitation.\nMoreover, \"forgier\" would be incorrect since that refers to the form of fog that is generated, thus, it does not correspond with the option we can select as the correct response. The same answer can be inferred using \"foggier\" as the last word of the option. In this case \"foggier\" refers to the condition when the air around us is more humid, as well as the fog itself. The effect of humidity does not necessarily have an effect on precipitation.\nLastly, selecting \"better at seeing\", in", "answer": "B: main"}

Choices:  a: call your friend  b: write it down  c: make mental file d: take a picture e: say something to the artist\nRationales: The question states that you have seen a very realistic art piece.\nThen, the question asks to decide how you can be certain that the piece is real.\na: call your friend, b: write it down, c: make mental file and d: take a picture can never be sure that the piece is real, and they are not the only options because what are you going to describe to your friend, or in your mental file? They will be something like 'this huge painting with real people's faces and eyes'. If you write down and take a photo, again, the description is bound to be as described before. As for e: say something to artist, the person may give you a stupid answer or may not even recognize you and the fact you are trying to ask about the art piece.\nHence, the option that can make you sure that what you have seen is real is \"a: call your friend\".\nAnswer: a: call your friend\n\nInput: She wanted you to know how important your friendship was to you.

Choices A: work alone B: make decisions on his own C: live alone D: grow up alone E: love alone\nRationales: There is an inference that the person is inhibited by a personal weakness. This is expressed by his dislike of being alone.\nIf he cannot stand being alone, he will rely increasingly on other people to make decisions for him.\n1. It is safe to assume that he prefers being around people - as being alone would be a \"personality flaw\".\n2. So if he prefers his \"personality flaw\", his decision-making abilities will be weak; he will be incapable of making decisions without other people helping him out.\n3. The given options include A: working alone, B: making decisions on his own, C: living alone and D: growing up alone.\n4. This excludes A: working alone, making decisions on his is the question - the options are not the same.\n5. Also, living alone will strengthen his \"flaw\", i.e. make it worse. \n6. If no one is around to make him go out, he'll remain locked up because of his \"flaw\".\n7. D: growing up alone is not the answer because he shouldn't grow up alone.\n8. He needs to be helped out to grow up.\n9. There is no time to grow up alone.\n10. Also, since the question states that he prefers being alone, he doesn't have to grow up alone - he wants to grow up alone. \n11.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. Pocket, although sometimes used as a stand-alone action, is most often used as preposition and implies that an object is being put in another object.\n6. Similarly, 'turn' doesn't imply that the key is turning when it is used with a preposition. So the last two choices, solution to problem and open doors, can be disregard as incorrect options.\n7. The key is held in a pocket at the end of the action of 'turn lock'.\n8. Therefore the action of turning the lock is actually being performed by using the key. The question now asks us to choose the best action that follows the opening of the lock.\n9. 'Poppingkey' would fit because it is consistent with the order of events.\n10. Then we eliminate D: solution to problem because the actions related to solving the problem would be carried out after the lock has been turned.\n11. Likewise, we eliminate E: open doors because it is after the lock has been opened that he would be able to open doors.\n12. So the correct answer is A: turn the lock. Poppedkey is a portmanteau for Pocket And Opened Key.\nAnswer: A: turn the lock\n\nInput: Lila can't keep up with the conversation. She needs to find a more general way to look at the situation. Why?

V: Because she's not familiar with the topic.\nRationales: One: Because it is general it is less relevant and less specific to her situation. As a result she wouldn't be able to contribute.\nTwo: It may help her because she doesn't understand everyone and everything.

Thus the remaining choices are: pocket, and solution to problem, as they do not describe the action of opening a door.\n7. The given phrase \"he got out his key\" implies the action of taking the key out of a pocket. \n8.

Choices:  B: it C: no one D: owner E: me\nRationales: The question asks who owns the 1,000 dollar dog and gives us two options: A: it and B: no-one.\n1. We cannot tell whether a dog is an object or an animal (which would make it impossible to answer by saying, \"it\")\n2. We can rule out the possibility that no one owns the dog as the question implies there is a person who owns it.\n3.

The choice of words that best expresses this activity/activity (of the 2nd group) would be the activity's result.\n2. The result of this activity includes: \"the  (washing).\" The given choices are: shopping, cleaning, washing, cooking and shopping.\n3. Shopping and cleaning do not fit the context of this question. Shopping occurs in stores (commercial places) to buy or provide for the family's needs and cleaning occurs in places free of dirt (like the bathroom).\n4. Washing is the act of removing dirt from an object or surface. The washed object can be clothing, the floor, etc. In this context, 'washing' can be interpreted as 'the act of cleaning the surface with water to remove the dirt.'\n5. The question does not mention what is being cleaned in the sentence. In this context, the children might have washed the floor (after cleaning it) or washed the cloths (after getting them from the washing machine). To answer this prompt, you need to consider the possibility that they might have washed their clothes, clothing, table clothes, etc.\n6. Cooking: The cooking could have been anything from boiling water to make hot chocolate, making food for the little kids or even for themselves, to cooking with electric/gas cookers.\n7.

According to Webster's Dictionary, \"pocket\" means \"a receptacle for holding small things\".\n9. This definition fits best with the question as the action of pockets is similar to that of a key.\n10.

It is better to ask \"how are computers, smyphonean, and tablets similar?\" or \"how are computers,smatphonean, and tabblets similar?\".\n4.

Option B: turn lock is a plausible action of a person with a key, but, as it is not the only option, it does not hold exclusive inclusion into being the only way a person may use their key.\n6. Option A: opening a lock is a plausibly logical sequence after having the key and before going home. However, opening a lock is not the only method in which someone may use their key. \n7. Option D: open door is also plausible, but only if the person is not home yet. If the lock needs to be opened to gain entry into a residence, then opening the lock is the relevant logical step. \n8. Option C: pocketing the key may indicate his intention of opening the lock, putting it in a place of convenience, or just holding it for the purpose of having it. \n9. In option E: solution to problem, the word'solution' may suggest a larger problem, and not just opening the door or a lock. \n10. The answer must reflect what the most appropriate action to take would be, based on the sequence of events and context of the statement.\n11. Option E: solution to problem could hold exclusivity to opening a door or lock, but it does not hold exclusivity as a method to use a key alone.\n12. The better answer must hold a relation to opening a lock or door before leaving home, but only to the point that it is logically the next step in the sequence of events. \n13. So, the answer must not only include opening a lock, but it must be logical. \n14. Option C: pocket is logical as it only holds the key and does not imply any use or sequence of actions, just the holding of the key.\n15.

The waiter comes by with a refill,  what does the word \"refill\" mean here? Choices: \t A: a second cup B: an extra scoop of ice C: a new glass D: another dessert E: fresh milk\nRationales:\t1. The question is telling us that when a waiter brings a refill it means he has to bring another cup, dish, dessert, etc. \n2. Then after that, what the word refill is describing is a cup, dish, etc of fresh milk.\n3. Out the given answer choices, only answer E: fresh milk indicates an instance or a fresh cup of a certain item. \n4.

We can assume that he was working in a restaurant the night before, and when he returned today, his job position was different. \nWith further questions, we can understand that his new job was cooking in the kitchen, but he was unfamiliar with the menu.\nThe correct answer will be a word that best describes what he had been doing in the kitchen the night before.\n7.

{"text": ", pocket, open doors, solve the problem, and pocket.\n5. Turning a key cannot be a solution to any problem since the question does not state where the key is intended to be used.\n6. Therefore pocket could mean his pockets, as well as his mental state. \n7. 'To pocket' can indicate to put something in one's pocket. \n8. However, a problem is not a tangible item that needs to be put away.\n9. So pocket can also have a mental connotation. \n10. According to the given sentence, the bike is his bike. So the answer of what the person is going to do his, can either be open his (bike) doors or to put away (his) key in his (bike) pocket. \n11. Thus, the answer can be E: Open Doors or B: Pocket.\nAnswer: B. Pocket\n\nInput: The doctor will do what so that the patient does not get sick? Choices:  B: ask questions C: take prescription E: take action G: give advice to patients D: ask patient about lifestyle\nRationales:  1. The question asks us the doctor is going to do what so that the person does not get sick. \n2. This means the doctor is going to take action to ensure someone's health.\n3. So, out of the choices given, the correct statement is G: give advice to patient. \n4. This choice makes sense because the question states that the doctor is going to prevent the patient from \"getting sick\". A doctor will sometimes recommend some lifestyle changes to ensure good health or prevent the patient from getting sick.\nAnswer: G: give advice to the patient\n\nInput: It was clear the teacher did not want to teach.

We can also eliminate 'turn lock' since it is not about getting his keys out of his pocket before bike home.\n7. This leaves  us with B: pocket and E: open doors. \n8. The given statement specifically refers to a key, so the more general  answer is 'open doors'.\n9. Thus, the answer the given statement asks for has to be A: open doors.\nAnswer: A.

{"text": ", pocket, open door, and pocket.\n5. Turning a lock with a key is a more thorough and precise way of getting the door open.\n6. Pocket and opening a door are both vague. Opening a door is too vague to be a specific choice.\n7. Pocket does also refer to turning a lock, however, he could be pocketing his key because he already turned the lock.\n8. So, when comparing D: to A:, the specificity of turning the lock points out A: as the answer.\nAnswer: A. Turning the lock\n\nInput: He walked quickly towards his house of what? Choices A: dreams B: memories C: hopes D: wishes E: truth\nRationales: There are different ways someone could respond when asked \"What are you most looking forward to next year?\", however it is important to determine the intent of the question. \n1. It is highly probable that the question \"What are you most lookin forward to next year?\" was not meant as a rhetorical question to which it is unnecessary to respond to.\n2. The use of \"to\" in the question, in addition to the punctuation, indicate that it is not a rhetorical inquiry.\n3. We can also conclude this from the fact that the writer wants to know what the other person is looking forward to.\n4. Looking further, the writer states \"I enjoy your company and think you'll fit in.\" By saying this, the person wants to make sure she wants to be with this person and the person is not trying to do something bad to her.\n5. Then, the person concludes with \"but we must still play by the rules that have been set forth.\" \n6. To clarify, the rules are the rules that the teachers and the administration establish to maintain order.\n7. So, the teacher/administrator that asked the question is not asking for something that is meaningless to her, but rather she would like to know the person's plan for the year.\n8. This information is important to the teacher/administrater because it can inform her actions towards the student and it can inform the student's actions to her and her peers. \n9. To address that the student is aware that the question is directed toward them, the answer is made towards \"you,\" implying that the question was directed", "answer": "A: gain weight"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem and open doors.\n5. Pocket can refer to storing a thing in one's pocket rather then opening something.\n6. Moreover, turning a lock refers to only applying a solution to a problem, which has two meanings, neither of which is necessary for answering the question correctly.\n7. We can therefore conclude that A: turn lock does not fit the given context.\n8. Similarly, solution to problem is ambiguous and can refer to both applying a solution and turning a lock, which again does not answer the given question correctly.\n9. Hence, we would have to eliminate these two answers among those available.\n10. In the remaining options, C: pocket and E: open doors are both used to describe actions that the given character takes.\n11. Since it is evident that he has already done whatever he had to before leaving, it can be assumed that the character has applied a solution to his problem.  Therefore, pocket can be eliminated.\n12. In addition, E: open doors does not refer to only opening a lock, which was mentioned in the statement. It can also refer to an action of opening doors in general, which does not answer the question correctly.\n13. Hence, pocket can be eliminates and open doors can be eliminated as well.\n14. This leaves us with A: turn lock and D: open door.\n15. For the action of opening a door, it is also important to consider what the door refers to.\n16. In this case, it is mentioned that he was about to lock the door of his house, or home, before he began opening the lock.\n17. Furthermore, when he began to open the lock, he was still in his home. This implies that he was opening the door to his home, as opposed to other doors.\n18. Therefore, A: turn lock also refers to this action instead of referring to an action of opening another door.\n19. Hence, A: turn lock is the correct option.\nAnswer: A turn lock - The given statement mentions that he has used his key to begin opening the lock of his home, and is not about to bike home.  A bike home can refer to the act of cycling out of the house, while what a person does before cycling out is irrelevant to what they are about to do.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to the problem, pocket, open doors\n5. Looking at turn lock vs. pocket: if you get out your key to lock a door when leaving, you are not ready to bike home yet. \n6. Looking at solution to problem: if you get out you key to solve a problem, you are not ready leave yet. \n7. Looking at pocket vs. open doors: if you are ready to bike home you are not getting your key to get into your pocket or open doors. \n8. Looking at pocket vs pocket: if you are ready but then get out your key to open pocket. You are not ready to bikey home yet. \n9. To make sure he is ready, he needs to look at a solution to a problem or he's not ready to bike. So, the answer 'turn lock' cannot be correct because that means he will have opened his door and he will then be ready to bike home and we know that is not what he is aiming to do. In order to be ready to bike, he'd have to resolve or solve a problem, so what he might have done next is turn a key to look for the pocket.

{"text": ", pocket, open doors, begin to bike home, pocket, and solution to problem respectively.\n5. As the statement tells us that he has put his keys back in his pocket, it most likely shows his willingness to bike home. This is because it suggests the need to open his door to start his drive.\n6.

Aaron Saslavsky 3. Alistair Hunt 4. Andrew Jackson\nRationales: The key here is to realize that the question asked is not 'who created the calendar?' \nbut 'who created the 6 months in one year version of the calendar'. \nIn other words, the question asks about the invention of a'six-hour-in-one-day' version of a calendar. So it's not about the invention of the entire calendar itself. \nTherefore, the only option that describes a 6 months in one-year version of a calendar is Option 4 Andrew Jackson. \nAll others are wrong.  \n\nInput: How does the word'sorry' translate into French?

'Poemt' does not appear in the question, but if it was present, it would be incorrect as 'pocket' is the given answer.\n8. So, this leaves us with turn lock and open doors. \n9. Of these two, it is more plausible that he would open doors instead of turn a lock, as he is ready to bike home (not lock up).\n10.

Choices:  Faulty reasoning B: dyslexia C: bad writing D: not good at Maths E: not good at spelling\nRationales: The given statement points to a situation where people encounter a problem that is difficult to solve. \n2. Therefore, a common problem that can be assumed is 'dyslexia,' which is a learning disorder that affects a person's ability to read or write. \n3. The other choices given do not directly indicate a common problem that affects many people.\n4. Faulty reasoning is an ability, not a problem that many people have.\n5. 'Bad writing' is not indicative of a problem that many people may have.\n6. 'Not good at Maths' only indicates a common problem for a particular group of people such as mathematicians, and 'not good at spelling' only refers to a particular person.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, open doors, and pocket.\n5. First, eliminate turn lock because it does not necessarily apply to his situation. \n6. This leaves pocket, solution to problem and open doors.\n7. Pocket means to put something in one's pocket. Solution to problem, in this context, refers to a problem already solved. Therefore, the phrase'solution to problem' indicates that he already finished solving the problem, not that he has the solution in his pocket.\n8. Thus, out of these remaining options, 'open doors' is a more logical interpretation of the phrase, as it is related to the action of opening.\n9. Hence, we answer that he got out his key because of the way the question is worded, meaning that he was about to open the door and bike home.\n10. Thus, the answer B: pocket is incorrect and the correct answer is Open Doors.\nAnswer: Open Doors\n\nInput: Too many students were late to their first period. He was late, too. Where was he going, what was he doing? Choices: 1. A: English 2. B: Math 3. C: Art 4. D: History 5. E: Science\nRationales:\n1. The question starts by stating that there were too many students who were late to their first periods.\n2. This could mean many of them arrived late to English, Math, Art, History, or Science.\n3. The phrase 'He was late, too' tells us that the same was true for the student we will describe in the question.\n4. We will consider the given options carefully.\n5. English, Math, and Science are general terms, which do not relate to the way the question describes the student.\n6. History is less general and could indicate the student was headed somewhere related to his studies, possibly related to teaching some form of history.\n7. Art could indicate a plausible reason for not being on time.\n8. However, this student is being described as late, which does not match with the description for art students.\n9. Therefore, the answer cannot be English, Math, History, or Art.\n10. It must be Science, which provides a logical explanation for why a student might be late.\n11. Therefore the student was late to his first period class and should answer", "answer": "D: garage"}

The word \"lock\" also suggests that the person is going to a place where he normally uses the key to open the door.\n7. He didn't say the word \"home\" only that he was ready to biking home, so the option isn't correct because 'pocket' doesn't really apply.\n8. The question is asking for a solution to his problem, \"key\" doesn't solve any problem.\n9. All the options but 'open doors' don't make much sense.\n10. He needs to go somewhere, and what do we usually do before leaving? Open the door, right? It is also the only option that relates specifically to the lock and key of the given problem.\n11.

The answer will probably lie in the context of the question, or the immediate words of the sentence before the question.\n\nLook for context clues: \n    - What is she trying to do?\n    - What does she actually end up doing?\n\nThe context clue tells us that she is trying to apologize;  she tells us the things that she is trying to impress - it just happened, saying something untrue, and trying to impress.\n\nTo try to make a sarcastic remark seems a bit counterintuitive. Why would a person say \"I didn't mean it\", but then try to make a sarastactic remark?\n\nWe look to the previous sentence to determine the answer:\n\nShe told me that she didn\u2019t mean it, she\u2019s just trying to make a good impression on me\n\nSo the context suggests that the most likely answer is:\n\nShe told that she didn't meant, she's just trying to impress me\n\nWhich is the same as C: Try to impress\n\nRationales:  \n\nChoice:  What \nWhy:  \"She\" from the main question refers to the \"She\" before it.\nChoice: what \nWhy: \"she\" here suggests what.

The question is asking: 1. What are the main benefits that can be derived from maintaining a record?\n\n2. The given choices to choose from include: 1. to remember what happened, 2. to compare how things are today with how they were in the past, 3. to learn from our mistakes, 4. to keep an eye on something.\n3. These are the four benefits of keeping a record.\n4. The sentence that was given to us says 'the main benefits of keeping a homework log are', therefore, only options 1, 2, 3, and 4 were necessary to explain the homework log and its benefits.\n5. The sentence uses the term \"homework log\" instead of \"records\" so we should consider the benefit of such a log instead of general records.\n6. Option A: to remember what had happened makes sense if the homework log is kept by the student. However, it doesn't directly connect with the statement and doesn't indicate a main benefit.\n7. Option B: to compare how today is with how it was in the past makes sense if we consider a time log which records the hours devoted to a task every day. However, this option doesn't explain a homework log, which is recorded to keep track of assignments and homework.\n8. Therefore, we are left with options C (to learn from mistakes) and D (to keep an eye on things).

The question is asking why bakery owners' employees have a long leash.  \n6.  Looking at 4.

'Open doors' is not plausible because he would not only need a key to open the door but also to unlock the entrance of the bike. \n6. Thus, 'turn lock' is unlikely as the word 'key' is not mentioned in the question. \n7. 'Pocket' and'solution to problem' refer to what he may put in his pocket, but they are not the actions of unlocking his bike. \n8.

However, the question tells us that such is not the case if the grandparent didn't study in grammar / literacy school. Hence, our grandparents only share advice if they studied in literacy school.\n\nInput: They didn't want to eat because they had just finished swimming, but they needed some food and quickly.  What should they do?

However, they had to eat and that they had to eat quickly or their hunger won't go away. Going to the doctor or the shop requires them to walk a bit, which they might get tired if they have swum a lot. A and E both require them to go to their hotel. Swimming is usually warm and waterproof. It makes sense that after swimming, they are wet but we don't know if they have showered, so the waterproof isn't a must. C seems a bit too much. If they have swum a long time, they might be hungry and tired at the same time. They can still eat even if they're not dry, then go back to the hotel.

'Open doors' also directly relates to opening a door.\n8. There is no other choice left that directly relates to opening the door or making pockets bigger.\n9. Therefore, the likely action is what goes into pockets because 'open doors' and'solution to problem' can relate to either of these.\n10. Out of all the remaining choices, only 'pocket' gives us a clear answer that directly relates to solving a problem with the keys or in other words, what we do with the key.\n\nAnswer: B: pocket\n\nInput: She decided to study architecture, which was her dream.  But she was always scared.  She had to overcome her what? Choices: B: weaknesses  D: fear,  F: pride,  G: inhibition,  H: insecurities  I: fear of failure  J: desire for success  K: ambition  L: fear of rejection  M: apprehension \nRationales:\n1. We can tell that she has decided to study architecture because of her dream and wants to overcome her fears.\n2. She had to overcome her..., which refers to what she had to get rid of or overcome.\n3. Out from these options given, the one that refers to what she would fear getting rid of is her 'fear'. Her fear refers to how her attitude, thoughts or behavior makes her uncertain and afraid of possible outcomes.\n4. There are a lot of fears a person could overcome but the most relevant to the context of the question that is directly related to the fear of getting rid of is 'fear'.\n5.

'Pocket' indicates that he already put the key somewhere, eliminating both pocket and pocket as incorrect choices.\n7. 'Solution to problem' suggests he still needed to do more to solve his problem, thus we eliminate this choice.\n8. 'Open doors' is a general action, indicating he only started the action of opening a door and not getting his key. \n9. So, the answer must be the best-fit given choice, 'open doors'.\n10. Also, 'get out of a lock' is not the same as 'getting his key' and is, therefore, redundant.\n11. The answer, then is B: open doors.\nAnswer: B;open doors. or A: open locks", "answer": "A: prison"}

However, if the key is to open the lock, then it will make sense to say that he is prepared to start biking home by getting his key ready.\n6. Therefore he would not only turn the lock, but also pocket the key. Pocket and solution to problem are too vague for this specific action.\n7. So out of the given choices, it seems more logical to include 'open doors' as another option to the key-related action.\n8. Therefore, the answer could be either the two options 'turn lock' and 'open doors'.\n9. Hence, the answer could be one of them.\n\nAnswer: A,B\n\nInput: This is a long test, it has over 50 questions. Which of these choices tells someone to begin? Choices: 1. D 2. A 3. What 4. B 5. C 6. G 7. start the game 8. G 9. start studying 10. A 11. E 12. study, play, and get started\nRationales:\n\n1. The question asks for any choice that tells someone \"to begin\".\n2. The words beginning and to begin have a different connotation. Beginning is more about the order of starting something or the first part of something.\n3. For example, the first sentence in a book could be the beginning of the whole novel.\n4. To begin usually implies doing something at a specific time or starting something when it\u2019s time.\n5. For example, \"It\u2019s time to begin studying!\"\n6. Now that we know how the words mean, we\u2019ll identify the one that tells someone to begin.\n7. Options 1 is \"D\" - \"I\u2019m going to begin a new project!\"\n8. Option 4 is \"B\" - \"Let\u2019s get the show on the road! \"\n9. Option 8 is \"G\" - \"Let\u2019ss begin!\u201d\n10 A- \"Begin studying for the test now!\"\n11.

Option B: 'pocket' can also refer to putting the key in his pocket and we do not know if he did that.\n7. Option D: 'open doors' is not what the action suggests. \n8. Thus, there is only one remaining choice.\n9. The only choice that is specific is C:'solution to problem'. This is most plausible option as the context suggests that the keys are to unlock the doors of the house that he is bike-riding to.\n10. 'Pocket' can still be correct if all of the doors of the house are already unlocked, for example a garage or gate that he opens, even a car door. \n11. However, this is not the case since he got out his keys. Also, if his keys are already in his pocket it means he already has another means of unlocking the doors.\n12.

Choices: B: get away C: swim D: ride E: climb\nRationales: Initially, we need to identify the main part of the question, which mentions the boy, his unwillingness to fall in the canal, and his action of running.\nThis part of the question refers to the boy's action of running.\n1. Next, we have to eliminate the invalid options.\n2. Option A: 'fall in the boat canal' is incorrect because the canal is next to the boat and he did not want to fall inside it.\n3. Option C:'swim' is incorrect because it does not directly address the main part of the problem.\n4. Option D is incorrect for the same reason as C above.\n5. Option E: 'climb' does not make sense given the context of the question, as the boy is already attempting to run away from the canal rather than climbing into it.\n6.

This means that the reason the pet owner can't put their pet into the dishwash would most likely be the option that has the most evidence to support it.\nWithin our options, answer C would be most likely to cause the dishwash to break because it has no evidence to support it. The other options all have evidence to support them, but A, B, and D all offer similar evidence to one another. As this dishwasher machine would only be used to clean dishes, food might not be put in it because it's too dirty, meaning answer D. This dishwasher would probably not be very easy to use, but putting pets in it would probably happen sometimes, making answer B an option that offers some evidence. That said, the only option that has all elements of evidence to support the given evidence in the question is answer A, so answer A is the most likely answer.\nAnswer: C - This dishwashing machin might break.\n\nInput: After he lost the game, the man felt like giving up on the sport of kings.

{"text": ", open doors, pocket, solution to problem, pocket, which suggests that 'turning lock' is not the answer.\n5. Then, consider the context by breaking up the options into two parts: opening doors, and pocket, therefore the sentence 'begin to' must mean 'turn lock', as opening doors is not a continuous action associated with turning a key.\n6. 'Begin to' has been used as a transitional phrase between the key and opening doors. \n7. So, we will remove'solution to problem' since it is not continuous and choose between B: pocket and D: pocket and the answer can be found in the second part of the sentence. \n8. A: turn lock B) pocket, D: pocket, E: open doors\n9. Looking at the second part of the options, we remove 'pocket' from E: open doors for it to no longer be an option.\n10. Next, compare the options from A to D: pocket.  We compare the verbs: turn and pocket. Turn means the action is continuous whereas pocket means one action completes the other. \n11. Thus, A: turn lock is incorrect because the actions of turning and opening are continuous.\n12. D: pocket is also incorrect because the action of turning completes the action of pocking.\n13. So, the remaining option is B: pocket which is the correct answer.\nAnswer: B) pocket\n\nInput: After being interviewed on the phone, all of the people that John worked with and clients all began to complain. John realized that there must have been something that he was doing wrong.

Start by reading the whole statement:  \"After being interviewed on the phoner, all of the people who John worked with and clients began to complain.\"\n2. First, we understand that after being interviewed John was complained about by all the people that he worked with and clients. \n3. This tells us that something he did went wrong because he is being complained about by people he is working with.\n4. Consider the option choices A: HIS APPEARANCE: We do not think his appearance went wrong because after his interview on the", "answer": "A: winners and losers"}

We can, therefore, rule out 'open doors' as the choice.\n9. 'Pocket' has also been ruled out, so all that remains is 'pull out pocket'. \n10. From here, all other options can be eliminated easily. Since 'pull out pocket' means pulling out a pocket which then contains the key, therefore, what he needs to do next is 'pull out the key'.\nTherefore, the correct choice is A: turn key.\nAnswer: A turn key\n\nInput: The problem with having your favorite movie be about murder is that murder is probably not something you would find interesting. This is obvious, but I just want to mention it.  Now that a solution has been established,  what would a movie about murder be about?

So, the answer does not follow the sentence meaning and logically it cannot be one of them. \n7. The next thing to consider is the choice: solution to problem. However, this does not seem to follow a logical sequence. The question tells us how he prepares to leave, and opening doors or pockets is not the action that immediately follows that.\n8.

Choices:  I: the dog has a nose A: its ears B: its eyes C: it has fur D: its mouth E: its shape\nRationales:1. The question asks for the rationale behind how the speaker knows that the dog is not a wolf in disguse.\n2. Options I, II, III make assertions about how one would know that the dog was not a wolf in distguise, these options are unlikely to be the correct choice.\n3. The speaker's concern in the question seems to be about the dog being a wolf in disquise. \n4. This suggests that there may be similarities between both but they are not the same, so the question is probably asking about distinguishing between the animal and the wolf.\n5. The given options suggest distinctions, either by specific anatomical features (option E: its shape) or personality traits (option D: its mouth).\n6. While these might be distinctive features, they do not specifically relate to the dogs and wolves in question, which are unlikely to share the same physical traits.\n7. Option B: its ears describes the physical feature of the dog and wolf, which are unlikely to be shared.\n8. Similarly, option F: its shape, does not relate to the dog or the wolf.\n9.

Choices A: birds B: sap C: nuts D: leaves E: branches\nRationales: The statement provides us with information about an old tree that fell over in a storm.\n1. This implies that the tree was old, which can be defined as 'no longer young or green'.\n2. The tree must have fallen over with a lot of weight, which is typically more than what a branch can support (especially of an old tree).\n3. This means the tree must have had a lot of inner material which makes it fall to the ground. It is either this (what we define as \"branch\") or the leaves.\n4. None of the given choices can be considered as what is left inside a large, old tree that falls over - either a branch or a stem.\n5. Considering the fact that the question is asking for the choice with the most possibilities, we reject options A, B and D.\n6. Leaving options C and E.\n\n7. However, in nature the terms branch and leaves are normally associated with relatively young trees, and old trees typically don't have either.\n8. Therefore, the answer C: nuts (either nut seeds or nuts themselves - a seed or the fruit of tree) is considered to be the logical choice.\n9. Therefore the answer is C: nuts.\nAnswer: C; nuts\n\nInput: He took the bus to school,  It was raining,  His umbrella was what?

A: pocket and B: pocket both indicate that he put his key into his pocket. This is not sufficient to actually open the door. It could be an action of preparation.\n8. Hence, he's likely to open the door, either D: pocket or E: open door.\n9. So, of these two options, the only one that fits with the context of the question is E: open door. \n10.

A rough road could make a person feel scared, disarmed, disgusted, or afraid. \n3. We look at the options to narrow it down.\n\tA scare is something that can make a person feel fear or nervousness. If the road is rough and causes the cyclist to feel such emotions, he could be disarmed.\n\tA disarming action or experience doesn't produce an immediate reaction of fear, but a more subtle reaction of discomfort that can be overlaid with emotions of anger, sadness, or anxiety.\n\tSimilar to what is mentioned above, a road that is rough could cause the person to feel disgusted. It doesn\u2019t directly lead to fear, but rather to anger, anxiety, or resentment.\n\tAs for the option B: calm, we eliminate it because rough roads usually produce fear, not calmness.\n\tLastly, we choose E: disgusted because all of the things that we have mentioned regarding disarm and disgust could be true for the condition of the road.\nAnswer: E = Disgust\n\nInput: A person was being chased after, so they tried to what?

Choices: A: opportunity B: an easy answer C: a friend D: their way E: a connection F: a great story\nRationales:  1. First, note that everyone knows the feeling of missing 'what'. Second, the term 'know' implies that this feeling is widely known.\n2. In this context, 'feeling' cannot be referring to a good or bad feeling but to a physical sensation of having missed something.\n3. The question has multiple other clues in it that can help us understand its meaning: what is missing is something that everyone knows the feeling to be associated with. \n4. For instance, the term used is'missing', which refers to not having, or being far from something that is close to the missing person. \n5. The 'feeling' refers to an important feeling or sentiment. This is why knowing is used. \n6. The clues are then completed by the phrase 'a connection', which refers to a special familiarity or close relationship between two people. \n7. In this context, these two words combine to give a clearer understanding of the question. It can be concluded that everyone knows the meaning of the feeling of missing a connection. \n8. This feeling is a consequence of being far from someone with a special familiarity to another person. \n9.

Pocketing your solution to problem also doesn't make sense, \n7. Also, he doesn't go opening doors, as this may confuse people, and the house may get broken into.\n8. Therefore, it makes sense to open a lock, which he wouldn't do if he bike into his house to lock.\n9. So, he pockets his key and turns the lock. \n10.

Choices:  a: He wants to write a political article  b: He wants to write political science  c: He can teach  d: He's good with politics  e: He has a political science degree\nRationales: \"He's very resourceful\" means that he knows all the tricks of his trade.  He can get around certain obstacles.\n1. The question is about the best answer to \"What does this mean?\"\n2. \"He's a political scientis\" (noun)\n3. \"not a writer\" (this could be the cause of the problem - he is not good enough at writing)\n4. \"What does this mean\" - it seems ungrammatical - can be reformulated as \"What is the meaning of a political scientist being resourceful\"? \n5. We need to find which one of the possible interpretations is best supported by the answers, and we need to find the best answer out of \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", or \"E\". \n6. \"a: He wants to write\" - that is just one of the potential meanings (it is just a guess) - the other possibilities are \n7. \"b: He wants to write and is political scientis, but wants to write something about politics\" - this one is not a good answer since \"but political scientist\" indicates more of a cause-effect relation than the relation is between the two phrases. \n8. \"c: He", "answer": "B: home"}
{"text": ", pocket, pocket solution to problem, pocket open doors, and open doors. \n5. We can eliminate the options turning key and open doors as they do not specifically describe the opening of a lock.\n6. The question can't simply be asking the meaning of pocket, because then he could have turned any lock with any key in his pocket.\n7. We can also eliminate turn key as the wording does not make sense to begin with.\n8. Pocket solution to problem would be an uncommon phrase, unless he is a hobo and he has kept various tools in his pockets for his problem-solving needs.\n9. So, we are left with pockets, which are a container in which you put personal objects to keep them safe or easily found, and open doors, which clearly describes the act of opening the lock with the key.\n10. The right answer is D: pocket open doors. \n11. The key opens the lock, and the lock was the solution to the problem, so he pockets the key to make it easily found.\n12. Therefore, the answer choice is D: pocket open door.\n\nAnswer: D: pocket open door\n\nInput: Her favorite ice cream flavor: strawberry,  the best flavor. Choices:  A B C D E\nRationales: the part marked as bold below describes the sentence the question is asking about. \n1. \"The best\" and \"strawberry\" could both be qualities of the ice cream. \n2. There are two choices: ice cream could be the object or the subject. \n3. Because the question asks \"her favorite ice cream flavour\", ice cream is the subject, since it is what she enjoys. \n4. Thus, \"the best\" would then be referring to \"ice cream flavor\", which is a quality of ice cream itself.\n5. \"The best\" would be a quality of her ice cream flavor because that is what she prefers the best.\n6. Therefore the correct answer would be the bolded phrase; she prefers strawberry ice cream the best.\n        \nAnswer: D: strawberry ice crepm the best\n\nInput: It can be said that he went away to attend to what he wanted most, his sick cat.

{"text": ", open doors, solution to problem, and pocket. \n5. A 'turn' in the context of locks refers to the way in which the key can be used to unlock a door. This type of action does not relate to getting out of a car or biking home. \n6. The choice to 'open doors', like \"turn\", refers to the action of unlocking a door. \n7. Similarly, 'get out of the car' would mean to unlock the door to a car, while 'biking home' does not directly relate to the key itself. \n8. Last but not least, choice E: 'open doors' is the best option, because it is one of the actions implied by getting out the key.\n9. The sentence states that the person \"got out his key\", meaning that the key was already in hand, now it is about getting it out of the pocket to use it.\n10. Therefore, the action of \"getting out his key\" implies an action of \"openg door\", not \"turn\", or \"open a loft\".\n11. So, the answer that is more closely related to the given context is E: open doors.\nAnswer: E. Open doors\n\nInput: What did the student get wrong when comparing the Earth's distance from Sun and the distance from Pluto? Choices:  Solar system A: The Earth is closer to the sun than Pluto is.

D: The distance that the Earth is from the sun is closer than the distance that the Earth is away from Pluto. E: The distance from the Earth to the sun is farther than the distance from Pluto to the sun.\nRationales: Solar system A: This is clearly contradicts the first sentence of the question.\nB: This is also incorrect as the statement \"The Earth is farther from the Sun than Pluto is\" has been already eliminated and the fact that the Sun is closer than Pluto can be inferred from the statement \"The Earth must move, or else the Earth and the Sun could never again be in alignment\"\nC: This is also incorrect because the statement \"The Earth and is farther from Pluto than the Earth is from the Sun\" has already been eliminated and", "answer": "B: polished"}

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, and open doors. \n5. First, turning lock or opening lock does not directly imply his action after getting his key. \n6. Pocket is not appropriate in this context as it does not relate to his activity after getting the key.\n7. So, we can assume that getting his key refers to taking its position from a pocket, and this implies the action of opening the key.\n8. From the context, opening doors is irrelevant after getting his key, so it can be disregarded.\n9. Therefore, the action he did after getting his key could be either pocketing his key or opening the key. \n10. As pocketing implies a temporary holding of the key before it's use, it is more logical to assume that he opened the key.\n11. Finally, the answer is option B: pocket.\nResponse: he opened his key.\nAnswer: B. Pocket\n\nInput: When you are in a relationship and you want to what?

It tells you that you want to end the relationship, but also that you want to find someone more attractive, and to be happier. This implies that you are in some sort of relationship and you want out of it, but need something in the relationship to satisfy you?\nOption A tells us you want other men to be better than your partner. We disregard this as the given options tell us you want to end the current relationship - not improve it. \nOption B is a specific option, and as it is so specific, it does not fit this context as well as other options. \nOption C is a specific description of a bad outcome, which is inappropriate to answer choices. \nOption E tells us you are looking to be happier with someone else or yourself, which means you are not staying, and so again, not good fit for the task. \nChoices D and E are the best choices as they both tell us you will be leaving, and then also find a solution for your sadness, or unhappiness - that will keep", "answer": "B: recording studio"}

The only reason a key can go into a pocket is if the person is going to insert the key into a lock. So, option B: turn lock can be crossed off as well.\n9. This leaves us with the option D: pocket.

D: He must be careful in what he says next. E: He has to tell them to calm down.\nRationales: - 1. The question asks about the character of the bouncer. \n- 2. We know the bouncer has to \"use discretion\" because in the second sentence the narrator specifically says the bouncer had to use discretion with the first couple. \n- 3. Using discretion means that the bouncer also must be careful in what they say next. \n- 4. The other answers are eliminated because they do not describe the character of the bounce.\n- 5.

So, the action that best describes the question is opening lock.\n8. Therefore, the answer will be B: open lock.\nAnswer: B; open lock\n\nInput: The sun is burning brightly today.  It's hot,  it's causing the sky to what? Choices; A: clear B: haze C: sunny D: smoke E: dark\nRationales:1. The sun is present today, which indicates good weather.\n2. It is bright, which implies that it is a sunny day.\n3. As a consequence of the sun being hot and bright, the sky has a hazy quality, which is referred to as haze.\n4. There is no option for haze that directly relates to sun.\n5. Therefore there is a high likelihood that 'haze' is the correct answer.\n6. The question is asking for the quality that is being caused, therefore, the quality that is 'caused', and not the quality of sun itself is needed to be answered. \n7. For the given options, as Sun is hot, all of them are irrelevant except for option C: sunny day.\n8. Therefore the answer is C: sunny day,  as sunny day is the quality that is being 'caused' by the hot and bright sun.\nAnswer: C; sunny day\n\nInput: The boy was eager to run,  he put his hands out in front of him, and then took them out and what?

Likewise, D: Solution to problem does not mention a possible action before riding, or opening the lock.\n6. Then A: turn lock and E: open doors seem unlikely choices because they seem too specific. \n7. A more likely action that he might have done is 'pocket' because turning a key refers to some sort of a door lock or handle, and when biking, he may not wish to carry his lock, because of the potential weight of it.\n8. Popping the key in his pocket is the most straightforward action that he may have done.\n9. Therefore, since B: pocket fits well with the context of the question and is the most likely thing he could have done, the answer is B.\nAnswer: B - Pocket\n\nInput: 2 of their classmates were talking  in class, and the others were silent because the conversation was not what? Choices: A: funny B: interesting C: loud D: quiet E: serious F: irrelevant\nRationales:  1. We start by analyzing the context clues of the question. The given statement tells of two classmates talking in class, while the rest were silent for reasons that may include lack of interest, difficulty understanding, or disruptive talking. \n2. Of all the five given answers, B and E are a bit out-of-the-box as they do not directly refer to any form of distraction. \n3. Out of all other options, only F: irrelevant has a strong relevance to being a distraction and can be eliminated. \n4. A: funny, C: loud, and D: quiet can be eliminated because they refer to a specific type of distraction in class, such as talking, that does not fit the context of the given conversation. \n5. This leaves options B: interesting and E: serious, which can both be distractions for other students. \n6. B: interesting: Distraction occurs when one is not directly focusing on what is being said/shown.

Next, of the remaining choices, pocket is a strange option as he just got out his key. This makes open doors the best option. \n6. To conclude that he opened the door, one must read through the description in this statement. Since he used one key to open the door, it is likely that he already had the key in hand.

Similarly, we also eliminate open doors, which would directly contradict the context from 'he got out his key'.\n7. Therefore, we only have A: turn lock and B: pocket, either of which would have been possible.\n8. Therefore, the answer must be either A: turn lock or B: pocket.\n9.

Looking at the option that best completes this task, we understand that learning better (either through mistakes) in his current situation or from others' experiences will improve his situation.\n5. Furthermore, 'improve his situation' indicates Billy's specific situation and not just the current situation in everyday life since there are a lot of things Billy could learn to improve his everyday life situation.\n6.

Pocketing or carrying a key out of its designated spot suggests that the individual is preparing to leave.\n7. Similarly, when someone carries out a key, they are preparing to go somewhere.\n8. Therefore, the choice that best fits is D: open doors.\nAnswer: D/open doors\n\nInput: She went and told the man to what? Choices A: put his arm down B: back up C: sit up D: get some water E: get his things together\nRationales: The question is asking us how she responded after the man punched her.\nStart by eliminating some options: A: putting his arm down - this doesn't describe what the woman told the man to do, and this is not a course of normal social interaction for the man to take.\nB: backing up - this similarly does not describe what the woman told him to do, and this again isn't a course of normal social conversation and interaction.\nC: sitting up - she isn't telling him to sit up because he was down. She isn't telling him what to do because she says he is \"still down\" after telling him to sit up.\nD: getting some water - she already said in the paragraph that she went and told him to put his arm down, so she wouldn't have been waiting there to help him, which is what it would have implied if she'd gone to get something to drink.\nE: getting his things together - she doesn't refer to anything in the previous paragraph mentioning that the man would have had anything other than what he is wearing, nor does she refer to him getting his things together.\nIt would have seemed like the answer would be E, had the correct words not been omitted in the last sentence. Therefore, the correct sentence should read: She went and told him [to sit up/stand up], and then he got himself together and got off of her. This is the only sentence that reads coherently from the given details.\nAnswer: E/got himself together and got off\n\nInput: Which of the listed characteristics does", "answer": "E: earth"}

Therefore the answer is D: pocket.\nAnswer: D- pocket\n\nInput: Which of these items is a form of decoration? Choices:  a) paint painting B) candles C) vase D) decorate e) decorative\nRationales:1. The question provides two lists of items. The first list includes the term \"painting painting\" and the term \"candles\". The second list includes the term \"vase\" and the term \"decorate\".\n2. According to the given statement: \"a form of decoration\", the second list of items is the most suitable option.\n3. This because the items on the 2nd list all relate to decoration in some form or another.\n4. Among the given choices, only \"painting painting\", \"candles\", and \"decorate\" fit the first list. For the other options, both \"vase\" and \"decorate\" are related to forms of decoration, however they are not an option within the first list.\n5. The second list includes two synonyms, \"vase\" and \"(a) form of decoration\", \"decorate\". Therefore out of the synonym choices, the answer is E(a) form of decorating.\nAnswer: E(a) form (an) decoration\n\nInput: How does the shape of a birdcage hold a bird? Choices: 1) by its own light 2) by attracting light 3) by deflecting light 4) by reflecting light\nRationales:The question asks the user what the shape of a bird cage does to hold a bird. For any object, light can be attracted, deflected, or reflected. The first three explanations provided are wrong answers, because light is never deflected by a bird cage. The question's answer is also a reflection, so answer is 4.\n\nInput:  A good manager communicates to subordinates to assure that all tasks are completed efficiently and properly.", "answer": "D: space shuttle"}

Choices: A: expensive B: free C: short D: long E: frightening\nRationales: The question is asking what is typical for a film and the answer will be an attribute that usually describes all, if not most, of these films. So, it can't be a rare or exceptional characteristic. It's important to notice: 'color' (which in this case, doesn't necessarily have to relate only to colorful films). Some films of the black and white genre used special filtering to produce vibrant colors on screen. So, color doesn't necessarily have something to do with visual effects and may have more to do with the genre. \n12 It should seem obvious that a'short' film doesn't necessarily mean it was a documentary or a news report. It may have a certain length, but there can be shorter films as well.\n14 So, what is the most prominent characteristic of films? 15 A 'typical' film is a feature, not a live screening so it doesn't have to be a theatrical film either.\n\nAnswer: E.\n\nInput: A young man at a ball, looking handsome and rich, with a ______ manner, was in the company of a lady with a ______ appearance but a ______ manner.

A: throw in the towel 2. B: continue 3. C: find another solution 4. D: do nothing 5. E: go to the hardware store\nRationales:\n1. The question tells you that using the given materials will not enable you to build the tower.\n2. This tells you that the materials that you have at your disposal are not sufficient to build the tower. \n3. You need to add another resource, which is the right tools. \n4. This adds another resource to the problem and increases your potential for success.\n5. Based on the given information you should select a choice that enables you to resolve the added problem. \n6. So what do you want to do? \n7. A: throw in towel says you don't believe you can succeed and stop. \n8. So if you throw in towel you don't do anything. \n9. You won't get the tower built.\n10. So throw in towel is not the best choice.\n11. B: continue is a reasonable choice but it does not add any new resources to the problem because you just keep adding new tools to the mix; the end result is the same. \n12. C: find another resource is not reasonable because the resource has already been accounted for- it's not possible for you to add another material in relation to a tower.\n13. D: do nothing is not reasonable because you need to do anything to complete the task. \n14. You need to build the tower. Doing nothing won't get you the solution.\n15. If you choose this choice, you won't achieve anything. That means do nothing is not the best solution.\n16. E: go to hardware store is the best choice of the five. \n17.

Choices: Bread crackers Bagel Fruit Baked potato Soup\nRationales:1. The given statements tell us that the only snacks this man had was bread crackers.\n2. The man had to be in a hurry and did not have much time to eat.\n3. Bread crackers would be sufficient to provide him with nourishment and energy during this short period, so he should be able to sleep even after having bread crackers.\n4. Bread crackers are also rich in minerals, carbohydrates, and proteins, which will also help him feel satisfied.\n5. So, the logical conclusion is that bread crackers are an ideal snack for this man.\n6. 'Soup' could potentially provide nutrients (if the man is not allergic to it). However, soups usually require more time to eat (the liquid has to be ingested in the digestive tract).\n7. 'Bagel' could serve the man's nutritional needs; however, a bagel takes longer to eat than a loaf of bread.\n8. Moreover, due to its yeast content, a bagel may not be appropriate for someone with a wheat allergy.\n9. Finally, 'fruit' may provide the man with vitamins and minerals. However, fruit contains a lot of fiber and water, so it would take the man much longer to digest it than bread crackers.\n10. Therefore, the man may not have enough time to digest it.\n11. 'Baked potato' would be more satisfying than crackers; however, it isn't much faster than crackers.\n12. So", "answer": "A: mouth"}

Hence, the answer option is D: open doors.\nAnswer: D. open doors\n\nInput: They canceled the show. They were having what? Choices: A: a performance B: a problem C: a rehearsal D: a set-back E: a dispute\nRationales: First we analyse the question. The question uses the words \"they canceled the show\"\n2. The word \"cancel\" in combination with the context of the sentence and the statement \"They were having a performance\" indicates that something has gone wrong. It could be a \"dispute\", \"problem\", \"reshearsal\", or \"setback\".\n3. However this phrase could also refer to the \"dispute\", as the show could be cancelled because of the \"dispute\" itself. Therefore, we must analyse the options given.\n4. \"Performance\" and \"rehearsal\" are related to the show being cancelled, as they occur in the context.\n5. \"Setback\" can refer to any mistake made during a show, which can lead to the cance, so it may come to mind. However, we reject \"setback\" as the meaning of the phrase can also refer to other aspects of the show, while it is more likely to be \"dispute\" or \"problem\".\n6. Thus, we choose \u201cdispute\" as the best option.\nAnswer: A&D: performance&problem", "answer": "C: table"}

The given choices are  A: Keep lights on, B: Go back home, C: Open doors, D: Turn lights on,  E: Turn computers on, \n6. A: Keep lights on: Not necessary. It may cause fire to break out, and people could not get out easily.\n 7. B: Go back home: In case of power failure, many things could happen in the office, not sure if the office will be safe to stay, it would be safer to return to your house.\n C: Open doors: This choice also refers to the action of evacuation.\n D: Turn lights on: Turning lights on could help people see better and prevent accidents while moving out of the office.\n  E: Turn computers off: Do not affect much, just an extra way to help out.\n  Therefore, among these choices, E: Turn computers on is the best choice.\n Answer: E: Turn computers on\n\nInput: A woman came into the office.She was very short, so she was difficult for him to look at.Her what?\nChoices: a: face b: eyes c: voice d: leg e: nose\nRationales: The question is not a very well worded one, and you must ignore the redundancy of the word'see'. \nWhen it is stated that he was \"difficult\" to look at, it means he did not pay much attention or interest in her. \nShe may have spoken to him briefly, but he did not hear her full speech, so her voice and her face were \"hard\" for him to see clearly.

However, the former option only suggests the physical action of turning a key to open a lock, while the latter option provides more detail about the action of unlocking the door. \n5. Moreover, we can use context clues in the question, which states that the person was ready to bike, to understand that he most likely had to go through many doors to get home. \n6. Therefore, the option that best describes the action of opening and unlocking a door, in context of the given question, is D: pocket.\n7. Hence D: pocket is the correct answer.\nAnswer: D Pocket\n\nInput: If the car's wheels go round and round,  The car goes somewhere in space and time. What is the problem? Choices:  - A: There's no problem.  - B: The wheels aren't round and round.  - C: The car doesn't go somewhere.  - D: The car goes forward and backward. - E: Time is only in space.\nRationales: Given the context of the given choices, the problem can be understood to be an issue with the way the car moves.\nOut of the given options, A, D, and E do not address any specific problem with the movement of the car, whereas B and C are plausible issues that can occur while the car is moving.\nC is a reasonable option as it seems to indicate that the car cannot move beyond the area that it is currently in. When this happens, for example when we park a car in a parking lot, we have to move the car forward to move. \nTherefore, amongst the options given, we can eliminate B and C, leaving D as the most plausible answer.\nSo, the answer is D: The car goes backward.\nAnswer: D Backward\n\nInput: This is a big difference between a man and a woman.

This choice is obviously irrelevant to the action of opening a door or lock, so it can be eliminated.\n7. The choice, pocket, is also irrelevant to the context of the question because getting a key out of a pocket is not necessary to open the door.\n8. In addition, the phrasing of the answer, \"he got out his key\", indicates that the key may have already been in his pocket, or \"pulled out of his pocket\".\n9.

There is no evidence that Jack had done any other activities that led him to build a bird feeder.\n3. Birds need seeds and fruit to sustain their lives.\n4. Making a feeder does not directly link to feeding birds.\n5. There is also nothing that indicates a reward or benefit that will be received from making a bird feeder.

The baby could answer in different ways if he were interested in learning to crawl. The baby's answer is most likely to be: 1C: the baby already understands crawling and can crawl. \nThe baby could also answer: 1B: the baby can see the goal of crawling and is ready to begin this movement. \nThe baby can also answer: 1A: the baby is not interested in learning this movement.

It is possible to give away a microwave as part of the overall persuasion.\n\nAnother way appliance salesmen might advertise their products is by putting an advertisement through a television broadcast. This could mean that an advertiser might need to give one away as part of their advertisement. \n\nBesides advertisements through television, a salesman, especially one who sells appliances, may also use other means such as advertisements within newspaper or radio channels.

'Pocket' seems logical since the keys are usually placed in a pocket, however, the question also says he has his key already in hand, so this choice seems redundant since it does not provide any additional information to the key.\n8. 'Solution to problem' is also vague and can be used to answer any question that isn't specific enough.\n9. There would be no reason to \"solve a problem\" with a key that was in the pocket.\n10. \"Ready to bike home\" is a statement that has him already leaving his home, and it shows that the key is in hand and ready to use (and bike) before his home even comes into consideration.\n11.

'Pocket' and 'open doors' suggest the actions of placing the key in his pocket or retrieving the key for use somewhere else, both of which suggest that the key is not being used to open a lock at the moment and therefore not a possible answer.\n7. So looking only at B: turn lock, C: solution to problem, and E: open doors, we note that the action, 'turn lock', doesn't hold up in context to using the key.\n8. We then look at E: open doors, as the 'open doors' part is very similar to what is being implied by getting out the 'key', which is being used to open something. \n9. This means that we must look further into E: open doors and analyze the meaning of the sentence. We find that it is not only about picking locks but about going to the location in question.\n10. Therefore the option we should choose is E: open doors.\n11. So, the answer to the question is E: open doors \nAnswer: E: open doors\n\nInput: Doctors treat patients for what reason? Choices:  medical services A: prevention B: healing C: treatment D: therapy E: none\nRationales:\n1. The question asks us to look at the role a doctor plays in relation to patients.\n2. Doctors perform their functions for many different reasons; however, the options given relate to a single purpose or activity.\n3. Among the given options, the word \"prevention\" seems the most likely to be the correct answer. The role of a doctor in preventing disease may be better than any other options because it's more specific. \n4. However, looking a little further, it may be difficult to find evidence pointing that doctors are used exclusively to prevent disease in patients. \n5. \"Healing\" and \"therapy\" are two options that could seem more correct as they are more related to the treatment of illnesses or the alleviation of disease.\n6. Nonetheless, looking at the sentence and reading the whole purpose of the doctor's profession, even though a doctor is used to alleviate disease, prevention", "answer": "C: candle"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, and open doors. \n5. Turn Lock is an incorrect option because the key is the part that opens the lock.\n6. Pocket is an incorrect option because although it is possible for the key to be placed in a pocket, the key typically needs to be inserted in a lock in order for it to open the door.\n7. Solution to problem and open doors is a viable option because the key plays a part in both operations of the lock and unlocking door.\n8. Therefore, the answer may be D: solution to problem or D: open doors.\nAnswer: D/E: open doors\n\nInput: He said that everyone has at least one natural gift and everyone is what, but some people are more gifted than others? Choices:  a: better off b: more likely c: richer d: better at e: talented\nRationales:\n1. The context indicates that we are reading a statement by someone who said that everyone has at list one natural gift and everyone who is more gifted than others. \n2. Out of the given options, we eliminate a: better off because in everyday conversations, people are often complimented if they are 'better off' than others. \n3. We also eliminate d: better at because 'at' is an inaccurate term used in daily conversations in common English. In this case, we should use 'than' to contrast 'has' and 'is' in the context.\n4. Lastly, we eliminate d: more likely because the context of the statement is that \"everyone is gifted\", so d: more likely does not make sense. \n5. So, the only option that still makes sense is Choice D: gifted.\n6. Therefore the answer is D: gifted. \nAnswer: D: gifted\n\nInput: A very large number of people attended the football game.  The stands were so full that what? Choices: a: there wasn't enough room b: everyone was seated c: everyone was standing d: they were jam-packed\nRationales: First, let's look at the context of the question, which tells us that a very large number of people who attended the football game would have been unable to accommodate themselves in the stands. This indicates a lack of space or a tightly packed crowd", "answer": "B: history studies"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to a problem and open doors.\n5. This indicates that a lock has to be turned to unlock the door, a pocket is where the key can be stored, and a \"solution to the problem\" is required for bike driving. \n6. Therefore, the option D: pocket is correct.\n7. Furthermore, D: pocket is the only option whose meaning is not ambiguous.\n8. So, the answer to option B: turn lock and C: solution to problem is false.\n9. And the answer is E: pocket.\nAnswer: E Pocket\n\nInput: A pony can't be considered a horse.  What is the difference between the ponies that are not horses and the horses? Choices:  I: height  J: diet  K: ears  L: hoof shape  M: age  N: shape  O: breed  P: color  Q: size  R: manes  S: temperament  T: tail  U: coloring  V: legs\nRationales:  1. The statement \"A pony can't become a horse\" is an easy way to understand the question.\n2. Because horses aren't ponies, so ponies are different from horses.\n3. The question then gives a list of ten traits. \n4. Of the many combinations of pairs of these traits in an unordered list, which two are they? \n5. Out of the many combinations, only three match the requirement of being different from ponies in at least one aspect, i.e., height (I), ears (L). \n6. Height is the only trait that isn't mentioned as related to ponies. \n7. The ponies that are not considered horses are therefore different from ponies due to height (I). \n8. The remaining options provide pairs with horses which have no difference in height, so they cannot be selected either. \n9. This eliminates pairs with horses that have no difference in legs (P). \n10. Pairings that have the same temperament or no difference in tail, shape or color, cannot account for this either. This eliminates the pairs with legs (Q), coloring (U) and hair (R). \n11. The pairs remaining are of age (M), muck (N), mane and tail", "answer": "E: procrastination"}
{"text": ", open the doors, and pocket the solution to the problem.\n5. Among these, the best option is pocket the solution as this is the one which most aptly refers to the key.\n6. Therefore there should be three doors on his bike, and we have been given the solution, so the option D: pocket is the best.\n7. However, D: pocket the solution is also the option that would lead to turn lock and open the doors, so D: pocket and E: open doors is both options.\n8. Therefore, if the first part of the question is the bike, then D: pocket and E open doors would give us both choices that would be suitable for the final part of the question, which is biking. This eliminates choice A: turn lock and leaves us with D: pocket and E, open doors.\n9. Therefore, the correct answers are D: pocket and E; open doors.\nAnswer: D\n\nInput: The student had to be motivated and was motivated when she was rewarded with what? Choices: A: honor B: respect C: praise D: money E: applause\nRationales: To understand the question, let's split it into two parts: 1) the first part was to decide whether the student was motivated, or not, 2) the second part explained that she was rewarded with something.\nSince the question mentions that she was motivated, therefore the options A: honor, B: respect and C: praise can be eliminated. D: money is also not the case.\nSince, she was rewarded so with'something' which may be called 'applause'.\nHence, D: money is not the answer.\nAnswer: E", "answer": "C: make love"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to a problem, and open doors.\n5. Turning a key to open a lock is an acceptable action to take and aligns with the context of the question, so choose option A: turn lock.\n6. The other three options: pocket, solution to a solution, and open doors are ambiguous as they do not specify a clear purpose or connection to the context of the question and provide more abstract meanings.\n7. Therefore the correct answer is A: turn lock. \nAnswer: A: turn lock\n\nInput: What do you think was the cause of his sadness? Choices: A: poor health B: no friends C: money problems D: problems E: family problem\nRationales: What do you think  was the cause of his  sadness? Choices  A:  poor  health  B:  no  friends C:  money  problems  D:  problems  E:  family  problem  -------------  What do you think was  the  cause of his  sad  ness?  C:  mon ey problems  -------------  What  do  you  think was  the  cau  se  of  his  sadness?  ---------------------------------------------------  C:  money  problem\n\nRationales:\n1. As the options are choices 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D' and 'E', it is evident that the choice which is not one of the given options (the correct answer) is the \"cause\" of the sadness.\n2. Out of the given options, only 'A' refers to problems related to health and 'C' is the money problem.\n3. Hence, the cause of his sad expression will be the money problem as only 'A' and 'C' align with the context of the description in the question.\n4. The final answer will be 'C: money problem.'\nAnswer: C: money problem\n\nInput: I don't have anything to draw with.  I can't complete the project unless I come up with a way to get what?

Choices:  A. bark B. groom C. play D. jump E. chase\nRationales: This question is asking us, what would cause the two dogs to be aggressive towards each other, or to attack each other.\n1. The dogs were given as pug, corgi and boxer, which tells us that they are all dogs and are likely to interact with each other.\n2. To attack, or be aggressive towards, someone, there must be a reason or motivation, and that reason or motivation is likely to be fear. \n3. The question asks us what the dogs would do if they met.  If they were to meet, they would do one of the other options given.\n4. For corgi and boxers, the question says 'chase', which means a corgi would chase a boxer around. \n5. For pug and boxers, the answer is 'groom'. This means pug would groom the boxer, which is a sign of friendship, and therefore, not fear. \n6. For pug and corgi, the answer is 'jump'. This means pug will jump at corgi, which is a sign or fear, and again, not friendship.\n7. Thus only the choices 'bark' and 'groom' have any relation to fear, and 'bark' is a very common and general response with the two dogs. \n8. We can eliminate 'play' to 'play' and 'jump' to 'jump' as they are not signs of fear, nor are they responses that the dogs would have due to being in a close place together. \n9. Therefore, 'groom' is the correct answer to this question.\nAnswer: B. groom\n\nInput: The cerebellum serves to coordinate ____-___ motor activity in the body.

Old buildings that are maintained and restored are a wonderful example of what? Choices A: architectural beauty B: historical meaning C: usefulness D: cultural heritage E: popular appeal\nRationales:1. This question is asking about Memphis as a city and its relationship with architectural beauty.\n2. According to the context, the city of Memphis has a history and is being kept as well as being restored.\n3. Therefore it is a wonderful example of historical meaning and preservation.\n4. The given options are: architectural beauty, usefulness, and cultural heritage.\n5. Among these, only cultural heritage focuses on history and preservation, which make it the relevant term.\n6. Therefore as an answer, the city of Mempisis is a wonderful example old historical preservation and restoration.\n7.The answer is C: cultural heritage\n\nAnswer: C.Cultural heritage", "answer": "B: museum"}

C: solution to problem involves finding and addressing a problem. \n7. E: open doors also doesn't make sense because after turning the lock, he would have already have reached out for his keys.\n8. Therefore, the best option is to take B: pocket because this is the most likely action he would have done before riding anyhow.\n9. Hence, answer should be B: pocket.\nAnswer: B. pocket\n\nInput: Your car broke down on the freeway.  You were able to make a phone call, so you called a what? Choices: mechanic gas station repair shop roadside service vehicle\nRationales: A: mechanic, B: gas station, C: repair shop, D: roadside service, E: vehicle We first consider eliminating D: roadside service as an option, since this is a service that a driver can call for when their car breaks down on the freeways. However, this option has already been provided as an answer, and its inclusion in the options is intended as a distraction, so it can be eliminated as a possibility.\nWe then eliminate vehicle as an answer option. The question is asking which car service was called. Thus, vehicle is an inappropriate response.\nWe proceed to rule out the other remaining options. A: mechanic - we can eliminate mechanic as an option because mechanic does not provide roadside assistance or support for automobiles on the freeway, but rather, it is a car repair service, so mechanic should not be considered as an appropriate response. This means that the correct answer is B: gas station.\nAnswer: B gas station\n\nInput: This is a what?

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, open doors, pocket.\n5. However, given the information about the state of his preparation, 'turn lock' cannot be the right choice as it indicates more preparatory action, while the given statement already tells us that he had completed all the preparation he needed.\n6. On the other hand, 'pocket' and'solution to problem' are both words or phrases that mean 'action to take', for it to make sense, the action should be taking place before leaving, since it is only after the action is taken that the bike can be unlocked and opened. \n7. Hence, given all this information, the choice that fits the correct answer is D: open doors. \n8. Therefore, the answer that best fits the question statement and the information given is D: open doors\nAnswer: D: open doors\n\nInput: A spray tan is how you naturally turn brown. When you have a tan, you have what? Choices: A: an extra B C D E: a skin condition\nRationales: The question is asking for 'the skin condition that results in the natural brown coloring of your skin'. All other options (i.e. an extra, C, D and E) are not directly related to skin tone or the coloration of skin. Furthermore, the given phrasing in the statement, 'turning brown', indicates that the coloring of the skin is a part of the skin's natural state and not a result of something being added on top of it.\n\nAnswer: A: an extra\n\nInput: The company was closed for the holidays, what did the people do next? Choices: A B C D: take time to rest E: take over the company\nRationales:1. The given statements tells us that the company was closed for the next few days. \n2. Thus, we can infer that the employees got time to relax. \n3. However, it also says that the people spent their holidays helping their families and friends.\n2. Hence, given the time period and information, the answer best suited for this question is C: take time to relax.\nAnswer: C' take time to relax\n\nInput: She was getting ready for her trip as soon as she can, before she is on the plane, what does she want to do?

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. To identify which of these choices are applicable, let's start by eliminating the ones that do not directly describe actions involving keys.\n6. Turning a key turns the lock for opening, therefore, it is unnecessary in this context. \n7. Solution to problem is referring to a different problem than the given, so this leaves with two options. Pocket and open doors are two possible actions of a key that opens a door.\n8. Since the answer is not likely to refer to a solution the neolithic boy has made for his hunger, we can eliminate open doors.\n9. Pockets are mentioned in the question as the boy's starting point, so pocket is the most likely answer. The option does not match the phrase, but as it refers directly to the boy's preparation for the biking home, it fits the given answer best.\n10. Therefore, an answer for this question is E: pocket.\nAnswer: E (pocket)\n\nInput: She ate, then she slept. So what did she do next? Choices: A: clean her dishes B: sing in the shower C: do her hair D: check news E: text her friend\nRationales: It seems plausible that what follows next is 'check news'. She ate, then slept, so she is probably awake and thus has to do something. Her most likely next action was to clean her dishes, but not everyone enjoys this, so we can eliminate that here. Singing in the shower is not likely to follow 'check news' either, since most people don't sing in their showers, and singing can sometimes be embarrassing, so this eliminating this choice as well. Do her hair is possible, but not for everyone, since they rarely would check their hair while they are awake. It seems like checking news was the next logical choice, and the sentence structure of the question supports the connection between what's been eaten and checked. Clean and eat are grammatically similar, while check and news are grammatically similar, so if it were to follow check she would say 'cook my food' instead, since they do not contain the same word together. Therefore, the answer would be C: check news.\nAnswer: C (Check news)\n\nInput: It was a", "answer": "A: hurry along"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, and open doors.\n5. Among these, turn lock, pocket, and open the door do nothing to relate to the question, while solution to problem is a too vague a response.\n\n6. 'pocket' does not necessarily indicate turning the lock, but could be a related action, as the given wording is not clear. \n\n7. However, we know from the sentence that he was ready to bicycle home and therefore that he had already prepared a bicycle. \n8. Pocket and pocket in this context could be interpreted as meaning 'keep' or'store'. Therefore, out of the given options, only the answer options B: pocket and D: pocket are relevant to the question.\n9. Both of these options directly relate to the given statement, and therefore are plausible options for the next action. If the choice were between B: pocket and D pocket, B-bicycle key- pocket - bicycled home could be a possible sequence of events. \n10. Therefore: an acceptable response to the given statement is 'bicycle key- bicycle home', while the correct response is 'bicycle home- pocket'.\n11.

The first thing we do is determine what it is that the question wants us to 'be amazed' at.\n2. So, the first step is to eliminate answers that don't fit:\n3. 'A: a solution to the difficulty' is not a plausible response because the wording 'be amazed' indicates amazement at the solution's efficiency, and not the solution's existence or creation.\n4. 'B: the answer' is unlikely because 'the answer' suggests the answer itself, and not the discovery or reception of what the answer is.\n5. 'C: the problem' is also not a valid plausible answer for the same reason, as the wording 'be astounded' means the person is most likely amazed at the problem'", "answer": "A: arena"}

Among these,  we can easily eliminate turn lock, pocket, and solution to problem as their descriptions do not directly match the idea of opening a lock with a key.\n6.

Therefore the answer is D: open doors.\nAnswer: D : open doors\n\nInput: We were eating lunch,  and there was nothing left.  Where does it end? Choices: 10: we were eating dinner A: dinner was over B: we didn't finish lunch C: dinner ended D: lunch ended E: we finished eating lunch\nRationales:1. The question states: \"we were eating lunch and there was nothing left\".\n2. This means dinner was over.\n3. We can discard \"nothing left\"  as it does not tell us anything about where lunch ends.\n4. In terms of the given options, a) dinner was over and b) lunch ended, both would describe the end of lunch.\n5. However, we know that dinner and lunch are separate meals, so it's not possible that both end at the same point in time.\n6. Also,  \"nothing left\",  is mentioned in the beginning of the sentence,  because it is connected to the action of being at lunch, so the option d) lunch ended should be preferred.\n7. Thus the answer is E: we finish eating lunch.\n8.

From the remaining choices, we can eliminate B: pocket and D: pocket as neither of these are likely to be an action related to opening a lock or unlocking a door. \n7. Thus, it is logical to predict that he will either turn the lock, open doors or unlock the door. \n8.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem and pocket. \n5. Turn lock can't be the answer, because it's in the past tense and has the wrong form. It should be \"turning the lock\", but it is not. Additionally, pocket is the container in which the key is kept in, so it is not necessarily the object of opening. \n6. As for solution to problem, there's no specific word such as \"the\" or \"a/an\", therefore, it couldn't be a solution to the problem. \n7. Finally, pocket is a container.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. When we eliminate the choices that don't use the verb 'open', we are left with turn lock, solution to problem and open doors.\n6. Among these, turn lock is the key action that would not make sense in the context, as a solution to a problem requires more preparation than just a quick turning of a lock. \n7. Solution to problem does not fit well, as we were told that he was ready to leave, implying that the problem already is solved in some way.\n8. Open doors could be suitable if he is not opening the doors to the actual locked location, but to something else.\n9. This makes it hard to narrow down the choice to Open doors, though even if it was referring to his bike home location, it is still inappropriate for it seems contradictory to just turn the lock of the bike home location before riding home. \n10. This leaves us with solution to problem.\n11. This means that he probably took out his keys and made sure that he had the solution to a problem before leaving.\n12. Therefore, the answer the question must be that he got out his key to make sure that he had the key to the solution to a problem.\n13. So, the answer, as specified, is D: pocked.\nAnswer: D. pocket\n\nInput: The baby is tired, she goes to bed.  What is she likely to do next? Choices: turn light out A: play B. sleep C. watch TV D. sing E. ask for water\nRationales:  1. The question talks about a baby and their action of turning off their light. \n2. They will go to bed next.\n3. To \"play\" and \"sing\" use a verb that does not necessarily imply bed, but may imply play.\n4. To \"ask for water\" uses a subjective pronoun that does not imply bed, as asking for more water after already asking for water wouldn't make sense. \n5. To \"watch TV\" uses a verb that might also imply bed, but if one is watching TV at an angle that can be considered sitting at the side of the bed. \n6. Then the only suitable and viable option is D. \"sing\".\n7. Therefore, she is likely to sing", "answer": "B: humor"}

Option D: pocket is not relevant because if he was ready to bikey home, he would already have had to take out his key. \n7. This leaves us with the options A: turn lock and E: open doors.\n8. However, we eliminate option E: open doors because it is not what the bike rider did with the key.\n9. The question did say he got out his key before beginning to bike home. \n10.

Choices: \nA: nothing can be done to make wounds better or worse\nB: wounds eventually go away completely\nC: don't worry too much about wounds, they'll heal soon\nD: nothing can be done about wounds\nAnalyze:\n1. The statement is describing wounds and the recovery from them, but it is not an explanation of how healing works.\n2. It is implied that we are talking about general wounds, not very serious or serious wound.\n3. As a result, Option B: wounds eventually go way completely makes the most sense as an implied part of the statement.\n4. Option A's statement is not consistent with the rest of the statement as it says nothing about wounds and is therefore irrelevant to the statement.\n5. Option C's statement is also not consistent with the rest because it does not talk about how recovery or healing works, but is very similar to option B in that its primary importance is its relation to option B's statement regarding wounds.\n6. Therefore the correct answer is : Option B: wounds go away completely.\n7. The statement is saying \"time heals\" all wounds, meaning wounds go away with time. Time is the key agent of how wounds heal and therefore the wounds go away completely with time and with no intervention on our part to make the wounds better or worse.\n8.

It tells us that the car is not starting, (it needs more engine power), and it's hot. Steam is typically from an overheated engine. This is most likely a problem with the engine or alternator.\nWhen you look again at the question, it tells us the car is hot when we know it hasn't started, there is a problem with the engine/alternator because it says in the last sentence (You spilled oil on the...), which would be fine if the engine isn't over-revved. The car doesn't need more engine power if it's running hot.\n\nIf you look at the answers (and eliminate things that aren't possible to do wrong with your car).\nYou didn't buy an insurance is a good choice until you put 1 & 7).\nYou didn' t buy or take a regular test", "answer": "D: become tired"}

This means reliable or dependable, which is what we are looking for.\n3. Among the options, we eliminate B: slack.\n4. The word slack is used to imply work that does not get done or gets done but does not meet expectations.\n5. Since this does not match the definition of a good man, we eliminate B:Slack.\n6. C: reliable does not directly describe the man.\n7. The description 'He works hard and puts in extra time to improve', is more generalized than the specific \"does not need to work long\".\n8. Therefore, we eliminate C: reliable\n9. D: reliable is the best option.\n10. So, the answer choice is, 1. A:reliable\n\n**Input:** The manager was in a fix.

Pocketing the key suggests taking the key with him, which is not a relevant action for the given statement.\n7. The solution to a particular problem could be anywhere he has it stored, but we know that he has the key with him, so solution to problem is a plausible response choice.\n8. 'Open the doors' is also a plausible response, so the other two choices do not have to be eliminated.\n9.

The color of the first wool is likely from a what? Choices: A: dye B: stain C: banner D: wool E: sheep\nRationales: The statement doesn't mention anything about the process of producing wool.\nWe can expect that the order of the processes is: to choose what color wools to use (Color choice), followed by the color choice being implemented before a wool is produced (Wool choice).\nChoosing color wool is not from a single source, but a variety of wool sources. \nThe process of choosing what color to use is not a single color choice, but several color choices.  \nGiven these explanations, option B (dye) is not an acceptable answer because a dye is specific to a single color, and not a multitude of colors.\n\nThere is no mention of an artist choosing what color to dye.  The question does not specify that the dye was done from an artist's hand. \nChoosing color is to determine what color to do.  The statement doesn't state that the color was the artist's decision alone. \nSince the word \"shows up\", the artist's color choice is likely to be reflected in a particular wool's color.", "answer": "C: musical"}

The last given option is open doors, which could refer to a door of a house or of a room within.  There are different types of locks on different doors, so this answer is not as feasible.\n7. The other remaining option is solution to problem.  Since the question clearly shows that he got the key for the specific purpose of opening a bike lock, it is highly probable that opening a bike lock is the solution to the problem, not some other problem.\n8.

We are told that he has no idea what is happening, also stated is that he wants to find a way out, which indicates that he is unsure or unfamiliar.\n2. Looking at the other individuals in front of him, they should also have no idea why they're there, as this implies uncertainty, just like the individual mentioned in the beginning.\n3.

Choices A: throw water B: call the fire department C: feel helpless D: jump on their roof E: feel happy\nRationales: First, we understand the situation of the given question.\nThe house in question was seen on fire, and the question states that the owners surprised about the situation.\nThen the question states that the house in question is on fire and asks us to find out what the owners do.\n1. The owners could be happy that the house was on fire.\nThis is not related to what the owners will do with the fire, and is a common reaction to house fires. \n2. They could throw water on the house to put it out. \nBut this is the only thing that they can do. The statement implies that the house was on a way to be destroyed, even if the fire department can put out the fire, the house is still going to be ruined. \n3. The house would be too hot to stay in.\nThis is another viable option as the house should not be able to be liveable given the temperature of the house. \n4. Then, we have two viable options from which to choose. \n5. These options are \"throw water\" and \"call the fire department\" respectively. \n6. Therefore, the answer should be the former as the latter takes more time to do as it requires more people, more logistics, more resources, and more work. \nAnswer: A: throw water\n\nInput: The cat's behavior gotten worse, he kept crying and jumping around, and", "answer": "C: deny"}

The given situation can be described as the partner doing something that is upsetting or causing annoyance to the other.\n- 2. Then the statement explains that the partner is not 'doing what' that partner is not supporting or providing assistance to the other.\n3. 'be supportive' can be considered as providing someone assistance in their time of need and is directly relevant to the situation.\n4. 'being supportive' can be interpreted as providing someone with a boost of morale and is directly relevant to giving advice in some cases.\n5.

Choices: \tA: look up at the sky B: feel bad C: take a bath D: say a blessing E: ask for help F: do nothing\nRationales: We understand that something happened that the author had a problem. The author then did not choose to feel bad or take a bath. The author could not do nothing because the author has to do something. The author did not say a blessing because it is not logical to say a blessing when the author did not suffer or have a loss. The author is not asking for help.  So what do you think the author did? The only remaining choice is B: Look up at the sky or C: Do nothing. Since C: do nothing could not be the author\u2019s answer, we cross it out and keep looking at B: Look up at sky. Since the author did not suffer, the author is too happy or excited to not be looking up at the sky. Therefore, the answer that the author did was that he or she looked up at the sky.

Physical inactivity5. Exposure to unhealthy food\nRationales: We read the question and see that a child's obesity is usually caused by unhealthy food, lack of sleep, or bad nutrition.\nNotice that obesity is a symptom and thus, it cannot be an answer without the presence of other \"causes\", such as TV and exposure to unhealthful foods.\nWe also see in the sentence \"Which of the following is NOT....\" that the options given do not include bad sleep and TV, so we cannot choose either of them.\nTherefore, the answer is that they are both NOT a cause of child obesity (TV is not a cause of child obese.  This is true for lack of sleep, as well.)\n1. TV \n2. Lack of Sleep \n3. Bad Nutrition \n4. Physical Inactivity \n5. Exposure To Unhealthy Food\nAnswer: 2.

Turn lock and open doors both include the action of turning a lock or opening a door in the statement. \n7. Turning a lock suggests the action of turning a key inside the lock. \n8. Turning a lock is not a common activity, so open doors is the more logical answer. \n9.

Choices:  B: dry clean the sheets from the night before C: put on a dress D: change into pajamas E: get dressed\nRationales: The girl is fully dressed, including having her underwear on. She is wearing nothing else and is not planning to change her clothes.\n1. She will wear pajamas if she is dressing at night. She will wear a dress if she is dressing after a shower. She will wear a different pair of underwear if she is changing her underwear from before bedtime. She will not wear a pair of underwear unless she has some underwear that she can change into; if she is wearing none to start, then she cannot put on the underwear.\n2. The girl has an extra pair of underwear from before; she could change into that pair and then put on a dress after.\n3. If she's not wearing anything else then she's wearing her underwear and something else. 4. \"Pajamas\" are also a kind of outer clothing that many people only wear at night, and therefore would not wear outside on a normal day. \"Dress\" is a specific kind of outerwear that many people would wear on a special or formal occasion, often on a daytime. 5.

Choices:  (A) when one needs to know whether it is okay to speak out. (B) when a boss reads the contract. (C) when one is reading a story. (D) when one is reading the dictionary. (E) when one is deciding which job to join.\nRationales: The given statements tell us that we \"need to use the literal and connotation meaning of each word.\"\n1. This tells us each word is being used in two different senses (literally, and figuratively): literal referring to the direct/exact use of the word, while \"connotation\" refers to a secondary meaning of the word. \n2. We don't need to know whether it is all right to speak out.\n3. It's also not likely that a boss reads a contract and then decides on how to act. \n4. And it is unlikely someone reads a story and then decides whether or not it is acceptable to speak out.\n5. Using the dictionary only tells us the meanings of the words in a dictionary, which are literal meanings. \n6. So, we eliminate the possible options: one is reading a dictionary, and another one is boss reading the contract. \n7. We read the text again and find something interesting: in the question, both, \"literal and connotation\" is used to describe two different words. \n8. Both definitions are referring to \"reading the story\" which implies a figurative use of the word. 9. According to dictionary.com, figurative means of, like, or resembling something else in meaning or form. \n10. So, figurative and literal meanings are being referred to. \n11. We can now conclude what is asked in the question: we need to know whether reading a", "answer": "E: children suffer"}

Only choice \"A\" can function properly as a verb to fill the blank.\n6. \" After the match, the soccer player sat on the bench, watching the team win.\"  After: adverb; soccer player: soccer player; bench-ing: verb; win: noun. \n7. Therefore, it only makes grammatical sense for the verb to be in response to the action of soccer players. \n8.

After identifying redundancies, the choice left is either 'turn lock' or 'open doors'. \n7. Opening a door does not suggest much about the context of the question, nor does it explain the key being pulled out. It is probable that the key's purpose is to open a lock, which is used to secure a door. \n8. Therefore, to secure a door with a key, one would have to turn the lock, which is a plausable answer to the question. \n9. The answer is C: turn lock.\nAnswer: C : turn lock\n\nInput: What would lead to high-quality food? Choices:  the best chefs A: high pay B: best produce C: bad plating D: no service E: no customers\nRationales: The wording of the question and given answers indicates that 'food' is either cooked or edible. \"High quality food\" presupposes a standard in the industry, and an understanding and expectation of that standard. In the hospitality industry, this standard is often found the best chefs. In the home environment, it would be good produce, but as this question refers to a food industry, we can disregard the best produce. No service or bad plating are not enough to suggest food quality.\nThe best conclusion we can make is that high-quality food has the best chefs.\nAnswer: A : high pay\n\nInput: She has been working as a waitress for many years.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, and open doors.\n5. The choices 'turn lock' and 'open doors' are most implausible, as the focus is on opening his lock.\n6. Therefore the options we are left with are: pocket and solution to problem. \n7. The latter implies the action of finding a way to open the lock without turning it.\n8. This is possible if he doesn't have the key, as he would then either need to borrow one from someone else, or he would need an alternative solution to finding the key.\n9. So, given the clues from the sentence, we conclude that he most likely needed to borrow a key, which meant that he needed to find the owner of the lock to do so.\n10. Therefore, the most appropriate response is D: pocket, which is the most direct response to the given statement.\nAnswer: D. pocket\n\nInput: She did not know if her son would take the blame for the crime.  In that case what might she do? Choices:  (A): throw up (B): call an ambulance (C): cry (D): yell (E): hit\nRationales: (1). First, we must determine if her son would take a blame for the crime, based on the question. \n(2). If her son would take the responsibility, then we have no further actions to determine, as he will likely say what is required.\n(3). We consider all remaining options (B, E, C, D). \n(4). As C: cry would be quite obvious emotion, we can quickly eliminate this option. \n(5). Next, we eliminate D: yell as this would also be highly obvious.\n(6). Therefore, (B) call an ambulance and (E) hit are remaining options.\n(7). If she hit her son, we could determine he would take a blame. \n(8). In case she decides to hit her son, it would be too obvious, and probably a criminal act. \n(9). That's why our final choice is (B) call and ambulance.\n(10).

Solution for problem could mean any possible action that could be used to resolve the current problem. However the use of a key as an option means that the solution is probably related to unlocking doors. \n7. The action of pocket is out of place in this context because the word \"pocket\" suggests to keep something in a pant pocket, which is not related.\n8. Open doors is a possible response but we do not need to open anything because he already got out a key. \n9. There is only one option left: the action of pocket to the key. \n10.

{"text": ", which is used for unlocking a door or a bike, pocket, which implies the action of placing the key away, solution to problem, which is unlikely since the question doesn't inform us of any problems, pocket, which again implies the action of placing away the key, and open doors, which is not related to unlocking a bike.\n5. Therefore the correct answer is either 'open doors' or 'turn lock'. The answer 'open doors' is specific but the choice 'turn lock' is more general, which is likely to suggest the action of turning a key lock. Since the key locks a bike, the most likely intention of turning the key lock is unlocking the bike. Therefore, we chose C: open doors over B: turn lock as the answer.\nAnswer: C open doors\n\nInput: It was easy when I met the right person to what?

This rules out A: to avoid the audience, B: to avoid their respective seats and C: to avoid people near them. People aren't typically moving to sides to avoid anything near us; they're usually moving to the side to see something different. In other words, they're moving to the side to avoid people from standing in the way. In a concert scenario, the most likely reason that people would need to move to the side to avoid someone is to avoid being blocked so that they can see the stage.

Choices:  A, careful B. cautious C. thoughtful D. considerate E. thorough\nRationales: The choice that is used the most in the following question are: careful, thoughtful and thorough. So, the best answer is D: thorough. It is considered a thorough person who does everything properly and thoughtfully. Careful denotes a person who is cautious and not necessarily thorough. So, the following choices would be: careful vs thorough, thoughtful and careful vs thorough, and thorough and careful vs thoughtful. The first one would use the word thorough in a negative way in order to say that the man is not thorough, since he is careful. In the second one, thorough would used in a positive way to say he is thorough; since he is thoughtful. So, the first answer choice that does not apply would be B. thoughtful in the third choice it comes back to the first way of saying that he is careful. In answer choice B, he is careful and not thoughtful, therefore, it cannot apply. Also, answer choice C, is similar to A, careful, so it can be ruled out in the same way. In conclusion, careful and thoughtful are the only two answers that can apply in the beginning and at the end. So we should compare answer choices B and D, since D is complete. We can then rule out answer choice B, in order to get the correct answer of D: careful and thorough: careful denotes a person who is vigilant and detailed in what they do, thoughtful denotes concern or attention for the others, and thorough means careful or detailed in what they do. \n\nAnswer: D: careful and thorough\n\n###### Hint\n\nAnswer should be careful and thorough\n\nInput: In my heart, I knew what was right, I tried to make the best of the situation.

The man and young heroine what? Choices: A: get married B: move in together C: fall in love D: work together E: fall in love\nRationales:1. The question asks us to give an ending to the film with respect to the young heroine and the mysterious man who is the last person to enter the scene.\n2. From the given options, a film with a terrible fate is not a comedy genre (that is, a genre of happy endings). \n3. Also, if we understand the phrase \"terrible fate\" as being the opposite of \"happy ending,\" then all the other choices can be excluded.\n4. Lastly, the ending with \"falling in love\" is the most general ending since any type of scenario such as getting married or moving in together can lead to falling in love.\n5.

The question tells us that He had to stay up \"all night to meet a dead line\", that is He had to work all night in order to meet a deadline and had no time for anything else or to rest.\n2.  He had no \"time\" for anything which means he couldn't do 'c'.\n3.  If he had no time for work then 'a' and 'e' are impossible, if he had no time for sleeping, 'd' couldn't be the right one either.\n4.

The given letters indicate the letters of a word that may refer to a person and song that is written by a male and female. Therefore, the answer that is the most likely is B: a song with the female singing. Answer: B: a song with female singing\n\nInput:  A: A.   B: a man.   C: C.   D: D.

Options III and IV are irrelevant as well, as they don't answer the question with either a means of applying a liquid or using water. So the question boils down to choosing between I and V. I: paper is only a medium to transport make-up or oil, so that cannot be our correct answer. This leaves us with V: wetness. If you think to use water to wipe off your face, wetness is the answer that fits.\nAnswer: V: Wetness\n\nInput: The pumpkin on the front porch was rotting.  What were they supposed to do? Choices:  They didn't want to eat it, what did they do? A: Put it away B: Take a photo C: Clean it D: Burn it E: Toss it\nRationales: Look at the question. If you don't want to eat the pumpkin and it's rotting, the only option left is to clean it and take a photo of it, not to actually clean it and take the photo.\nAnswer: A\n\nInput: What is an example of a way to describe a character or thing in the book? Choices: A: the way its described B: the way its spoken about by other characters\nRational", "answer": "B: research laboratory"}
{"text": ", open doors, pocket, D: Poke (this is not a correct choice), and solution to problem.\n5. Since the question part indicates that he is ready to go, it is unlikely that he would first turn the lock.\n6. Also, since the question part tells us that he has already done almost everything, it is unlikely that the item that he took out could be the solution to a problem.\n7. Then, we are left considering the two remaining options, Open doors (leave from) and Pocket (bring with).\n8. Considering that the bicycle is probably parked somewhere outside the building and he has to go through the doors to get to the bike.\n9. Hence, he is more likely to open the door than pocket anything. So, we conclude that he would be more likely to Open doors, so the answer is Open doors.\n10. Also, option E: 'open doors' could also mean opening the doors to other doors, which is a valid option.\nAnswer: Open doors\n\nInput: Why do fish live in water or on land?

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, open doors, and pocket again.\n5. Pocket is not the correct choice for this question.\n6. This means that he either opens the lock or has already solved the problem of opening the lock.\n7. Given that he only opens the lock once, and the action of opening a can be associated with his action of turning the key, he more likely turns the lock.  \n8. This leaves us with turning the lock, which is most likely a way to open the lock, and the only option we believe is relevant to the question.\nAnswer: A. turn lock", "answer": "E: newspaper"}
{"text": ", open doors, pocket, pocket solution to problem, and bike home.\n5. All the options are related to the action of retrieving the keys, except for turn lock whose option makes no sense.\n6. Since bike isn't an action, the other options should be combined.\n7. So, bike home+pocket solution to problem +pocket+open doors = bikedhome + pocket + bike home = bikedhome, which is a coherent sentence so choose D: pocket E: bike home.\n8. Therefore, the answer choice is D: pocket E: bikedhome.\nAnswer: D&E: bike home\n\nInput: He did not want to what? Choices A: get married B: be a good citizen C: take up space D: do the right thing E: create mischief\nRationales:\n1. The question asks us to find what the given statement \"He didn't want to do the right thing\" is referring to. \n2. We eliminate options A: get married and B: be a good citizens because \"do the right thing\" does not directly relate to marriage or citizenship.\n3. Options C: take up space, D: do the right, and E: create mischif are vague and don't directly relate to the action of \"not wanting to do something\".\n4. In the second part of the sentence, the action and its direct relation is established when someone wants to do the right thing (option E: create mischie). \n5. Therefore, the only plausible choice is option E: create mischievous behavior.\n6. So the answer is E: create mischievalous behavior.\nAnswer: A&E: create mischievos behavior\n\nInput: I can understand your point of view but we have what? Choices: A: different ideals B: different standards C: different ways of thinking D: different opinions E: different cultures\nRationales: First, we get the most important points from the question. The main idea here is that A: I can understand your ideals but we have different ways of thinking. \nSo after analyzing the choices, we can eliminate options A: diffrerent ideals which tells that I understand your point of view. This can't be true cause according to the given statement \"We", "answer": "E: rocks"}
{"text": ", pocket, pocket solution to problem, pocket open doors.\n5. These have the following meanings: Turn lock: Turning a key to open a lock, Pocket: Putting something in one's pocket, Pocket solution to problem: Solving problem by putting the solution in a pocket, Pocket open doors: Solving a problem by opening a door of a cabinet in a pocket.\n6. Therefore the action 'open doors' is the best fit for the question.\n7 Finally, the answer is E:\"open doors.\"\nAnswer: E: open doors\n\nInput: It is difficult to get rid of clutter.  Some people choose not to deal with it,  Some people hide it, what are 2 more things? Choices: 1: Throw away 2: Stack A: 1 B: 2 C: 2D: 1 E: 1\nRationales: It implies that two things can be done to get rid of clutters. \n1.  First, consider the choices:\nThrow away: This is an option for the question if \"Throw away\" is the only way to get rid of cluttters.  Then \"Throw away\" is probably the best choice. \nStack: It can give a visual impression to reduce the level of clutters.\nHide it: this means keeping the clutters out of sight as much as possible.\n2.  Second, consider the words in the original question: \"It is difficult to get rid\" (it says it is difficult to) \"of clutters\" (it says of). To get rid of them, it must get \"rid of (clutters).\nThese imply the difficulties in the question. We cannot get rid of cluttes directly.\nStack It: this means putting clutters one above the other.\nThrowing it away: it is one way to get rid of them by throwing \"it\"  away. \n3. Therefore, stacking clutters and throwing it away would not work for the question. \"Hide it\" just means to put clutters out of eyesight, there is no specific requirement to reduce level of clutters by the given choice.\n4. Two things can be done to reduce the level of the clutters, \"throw it away\" and \"reduce the size of clutters\".\n5. \"reduce the", "answer": "D: ground"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket and open doors.\n5. Out of these options, only turn lock can be ruled out because bike lock does not have anything to do with his problem.\n6. solution to problem is ambiguous as the word 'problem' does not describe the situation clearly.\n7. pocket can be ruled out because 'practically speaking, a bike lock, bike key.'\n8. Lastly, both 'open doors' and 'pocket' are possible choices because all they are doing at this point is just picking up the key.\n9. This implies that he cannot make a definitive choice between the 'open doors' and the 'pocket'.\n10. This means that any of these two is a possible solution to the problem.\n11. Therefore, based on the given situation, the problem is just picking up and opening the key lock (of the bike), which involves opening doors/doorknobs and pocketing the key.\n12. Hence, the answer choice that fits both of the actions performed and also does not involve doing something outside the immediate context is D: pocket. \nAnswer: D: pocket\n\nInput: The woman took a picture, and put a caption on it.  Which word is inaccurate in relation to the sentence? Choices:  a: caption B: person C: woman D: picture E: it\nRationales: The options are: A: caption, B: person, C: woman, D: picture and E: it.\n1. 'Caption' is a word used to describe the title of a work of art.\n2. 'Person' refers to an individual.\n3. 'Woman' and 'it' both refer to either a singular person, and a picture.\n4. 'Picture' is the work of art, the still life or the photograph.\n5. Therefore out of all the given options, the only word that cannot be used with the given image of a woman taking a picture is 'person'. \n6. According to the given question, a caption or personal tag is included in the picture. There are no pictures of people without a caption.\n7. So, the answer must be B: person.\nAnswer: B.

{"text": ", open doors, and pocket.\n5. 'Open doors' could possibly mean this, however it is not explicitly stated, only 'turn lock'.\n6. Out of'solution to problem' and 'pocket','solution to problem is the one that is most likely to describe what the person is about to do.\n7. \"Pocket\" is not the most comprehensive term to use here. If the person just got his key, surely he is not thinking about pocketing it, and if the person got out the key and decided not to pocket anything else, that would be just odd. So, if the person is getting ready to 'bike home' then he should already be ready, so what else could it still mean to get out the key? The options that are not the answer are therefore just a nonsense. \n8. Therefore, based on the context, it seems to be most logical to answer 'open doors' and eliminate the other options.\n9. The given choice of B: pocket is a wrong answer (as mentioned above)\n10. The given choice of C: turn lock is wrong also, as it only refers to 1 action that can be done after 'getting out your key' and it is not a synonym for 'getting ready to bike home'.\n11. The given choice of D: pocket is also incorrect for the same reason (see #6).\n12. The given choice of E: open doors is only partially correct because it doesn't refer to 'getting ready to bipe home' and it doesn't necessarily mean 'bike home'.\n13. Hence, the only correct choice is A: open door.\n14.

Choices: A: conversation B: introduction C: review D: relationship E: interview\nRationales: Here, it is important to identify what the man is asking us for and why.\n1. By looking at the context, it is obvious that we are giving a review about the barn and that we are talking to the owner about the barn.\n2. The terms \"review\" and \"introduction\" both refer to the exchange", "answer": "C: underwater"}
{"text": ", which suggests a separate action from opening a lock, pocket, which is a physical holding of a key, instead of turning it, solution to problem, which is a vague reference, and open doors, which is the opposite action of the question, which is to open a lock with the key.\n5. So, from the given options, the answer is D: open doors. \n6. There's still a possibility of an incorrect answer, so use your judgment to eliminate options that are not logical or specific. In this case, it doesn't make sense to turn a lock since he already has a key, which implies that he's ready to go. \n7. Therefore, based on the previous points, the only logical answer is D: open door.\nAnswer: D : open doors\n\nInput: We need to learn what caused the Great Depression. This will help us prevent what? Choices: A: second depression B: global crisis C: bank failures D: inflation E: financial crisis\nRationales:1. The question gives the goal of preventing the issues in the Great Depression so we can understand what caused them.\n2. There are two main causes of the Great Depression that we know of and it is these causes that led to several financial and humanitarian crises.\n3. This is not one of the options given, so eliminate the choice that doesn't fit.\n4. 'Caused' and 'caused them' indicate the first causes of the Great Depresion were financial issues between banks and consumers.\n5. 'Bank failures' is a logical option but can't be the first cause of the Great Depression if there are financial crises within banks.\n6. 'Inflation' is a logical choice, however inflation, in the context of the time, was also caused by the financial crises of the Great Depression.\n7. 'Financial crisis' is unlikely to be the first cause of depression because it is a result of the financial crises which depression was.\n8. Therefore we are left with 'Great Depression' and'second depression'.\n9. Although either of these two can be caused by the other, we are looking for the first cause and it is more likely that depression caused depression, not vice versa, hence choice D.\n10.

Pocket can be eliminated since he already has the keys. \n7. The solution to problem is also not a likely option since it does not involve the use of a key. \n8. Open doors is not possible either since the only lock he is holding the key for is the one on his front door.\n9. Therefore, out of all the choices, pocket is the only viable answer.\n10. He put his keys into his pocket. He might have done that before or after getting his key, but the question is asking for the action of putting keys into one\u2019s pocket.\n11.

Choices: A: a blanket B: a rug C: a table D: a chair E: a rug\nRationales: This question makes a strong statement that the police were searching the room, however, it does not state how many items were there.\n1. A blanket, rug, table and chair are 4 of many items that one could find in a room. We would need to use more information to determine which of the four options is more likely to be the murder weapon.\n2. Therefore, it is not possible to answer this question now. \n3. It can be useful to come back to this problem later and revisit the given information. \n\nInput: Mary was looking for evidence in the room, a rug seemed like a good place to start. When she got near to the rug, a strange noise happened. Which of the following is the most likely conclusion, since she was looking for evidence? Choices: A) A noise happened under the rug B) The floor was wet C) There wasn't any evidence under the rug D) Someone spoke\nRationales: The question states that \"when she was near the rug, a strange sound happened\", which is what is likely to lead her to the conclusion that she is not likely to find evidence at that place.\n\n\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question. \nInput: The teacher left his key in", "answer": "A: french government"}

{"text": ", open doors, pocket, bike and solution to problem. \n5. Out of the given options, it does not make any semantic sense to turn the lock, or to bike, or to open the doors so we can only ignore the options turn lock and bike.\n6. However, it does make sense that the person would have pocketed the key before beginning his bike ride.\n7. After pocketing the key we can then draw a logical conclusion that he also got out the key before he started biking.\n8. This can then mean that he started biking on account of him having already gotten out and pocketed the key. \n9. So, if you consider this, then we can eliminate options Bike and Solution to problem as he most likely already possesses the key he needs to bicycle. This then means that the choice between options open doors and pocket, since the person needs the key to open the door, can be reasonably considered to be the correct answer, since the person is not likely to open the doors (which are presumably locked) until he has the key.\n10. Hence, the answer to this question is E: Open doors.\nAnswer: E & #8230; open doors\n\nInput: I'm here to help,  what would best describe my type of person? Choices:  &#8230; A: carefree B: helpful C: hardworking D: supportive E: sympathetic\nRationales: Considering the given options, a 'carefree' person would not be someone willing or able to provide a service,'sympathetic' would not be a good choice as the focus is on identifying qualities that are a good match for a job description;'supportive' probably does not mean what the question is asking for, and the adjectives 'cold' and'shy' are not helpful. \n1. That leaves us with 'helpful' and 'hardworking'.\n2. 'Helpful' means willing to give service or help. \n3. 'Hardworking' relates to the ability - or lack thereof. \n4. As for the given options, D: supportive best captures the intended meaning.\nAnswer: D &#8233; supportive\n\nInput: What did the chef decide to make after looking through his fridge", "answer": "B: fort knox"}
{"text": ", pocket, solve problem, pocket, open doors. \n5. Pocket is the correct option as it is most applicable to his situation\n6. He needed to turn the lock to unlock the door before leaving, so it doesn't make sense to have a choice of turn lock.\n7. Also, he does not want to solve the problem of his lock as he has completed what he has to do.\n8. He doesn't need to open doors because he has to unlock them in the first place, so \"open doors\" doesn't solve the problem either.\n9. The remaining choice is pocket because he only needs to get his key out and unlock the door before biking home; and his key does belong in his pocket.\n10. Therefore, the answer has to be C: pocket.\nAnswer: C : pocket.\n\nInput: He's not much for the opera, but she loves to attend.  He's more what to watch movies and television because they make sense to him. Choices:  A. realistic B. comic C. dramatic D. surreal E. saddening\nRationales: The given statement tells you something about their preferences of entertainment genres.\n1. The sentence starts with he's not much for which tells us that he doesn't like the opera.\n2. He prefers movies and television to the opera because \"they make sense to him\". \n3. This most likely implies that they are more realistic to him than operas; \"realistic\" is a term used to describe entertainment that is realistic, which most audiences can understand and appreciate. \n4. He may also prefer realistic entertainment because it is easier to grasp ideas and concepts in movies and television than theater.\n5. The given choices are A: realistic, B: comic, C: dramatic, D: surreal, E: saddening. \n6. When comparing the two given options, it is obvious that \"realistic\" is the better option here.\n7. The choice A: realistic matches with the given statement because it includes the description of movies and television that most audiences can \"grasp ideas and concepts\" from.\n8. A: realistic is also the correct option because it best completes the sentence.\nAnswer: A.", "answer": "D: wires"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem and open doors.\n5. 'Open doors' is an unnecessary action that needs no key to unlock/open.\n6. 'Turn lock' is not in accordance with the sentence 'he got out his key'.\n7. Besides, solutions to problems, especially problems with locks, need a key or something to unlock the lock.\n8. Hence, the only two actions that make sense in accordance with the given sentence are: 'pocket' and 'open doors'.\n9. However, 'open doors' is not a specific action, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact action suggested by the sentence.\n10. Therefore, the correct option is C: pocket.\nAnswer: C, pocket\n\nInput: We should all get involved in community work.  The community is our home, our  what?

We must understand that from the input the community is his home,our _______,because we can understand from the given information that the input is related to community and community is related to home and our neighbor.\n2. Based on this understanding, the answer choice for 'our'should be E 'family'\n\n3. Since 'Our family' don't make sense in the sentence so the answer is E 'Family'\nAnswer: E.

The word \u201copen deck\u201d is not used in the paragraph and there is no contextual/conceptual reason to link it to \u201cpavilion\u201d.\n2. The word \u201cshelter\u201d is used in the paragraph but it refers to the \u201cgazebo\u201d not the \u201cpavilion\u201d", "answer": "A: cupboard"}
{"text": ", open doors, pocket, and pocket.\n5. Turning a lock and opening doors are very similar. Therefore, if he wants to bike home, his next action is likely to be the opening of a lock.\n6. His next action must directly relate to the action of bike riding, as per the context of homecoming.\n7. Therefore 'open door' is the most possible response. This can be logically concluded as the action of bike home is not an activity to start with something that does not necessarily relate to opening a door.\nAnswer: E : open doors\n\nInput: In addition to her, there were 7 people at the party, the average of all of them is how many people? Choices:  the party B: 273 C: 53 D: 29 E: 31\nRationales:1. The question asks about the average of all the people at the party.\n2. The statement tells us one additional party go-er - 8 people - making it 8 + 7 = 15 people.\n3. Let's calculate the average of 15 people. 15 (people) / 2 (the number of people who were not excluded) is 7.5.  This is a rounded value of 7.5.\n4. If we rounded downwards, the value would still be at the maximum (i.e. 7) when we go on with the given values.\n5. Looking through all the given options, C: 53 does not fit since 53 is not a real value as it is an odd number.\n6.

'turn lock' and 'open doors' do not make sense since we would expect him to open a lock, not turn it, before he could bike home.\n6. Therefore we can disregard A: turn lock B.\n7. We can also disregard 'pocket'. This type of action is usually associated with 'pocket', a place for coins and keys or a specific item placed inside the pant's pocket, not the opening of a lock.\n8. 'pocket' is most likely used in the question to represent the action of getting the key, hence 'pocket' is selected to be the correct option.\n9. It would also make sense if the key was stolen and he was looking to retrieve it.\n10. Therefore, if we take the choice of'solve problem' and 'open doors', it's clear that the answer is D: pocket.\nAnswer: D. pocket\n\nInput: What was their solution to his problem? Choices: A: hunt for food B: steal food C: use their hands D: solve problem E: feel humiliated\nRationales:1. First, we need to remember that this is a question regarding the neolithic people's solution to a problem.\n2. We understand that the problem was hunger, so we should be searching for the related solution. \n3. Here, we are given a clue that they used their hands as they did not have access to tools and were not skilled in hunting or farming, as these skills had not been invented yet.\n4. Then we eliminate B: steal food, which also fails to match with the description of a problem the neolithic man would have faced.\n5. Next, we eliminate D: solve problem, since solving the problem of hunger only by using a single solution would not really be suitable.\n6. Finally, we see that the remaining answers are A: hunt for, and C: use their hands, which have almost the same meaning, so if we compare the two, a close analysis of meaning shows that Hunt is more suitable for a Neolithic man, as it is implied that it is their natural skill and not a skill they have to be taught.\n7. So, the answer should be A", "answer": "D: kind"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, and open doors.\n5. We find the answer by comparing it with the given description, starting from the beginning of the problem.\n6. Solution to problem is an impossible answer because he didn't solve any problems. The question is in the past tense which implies that everything has already happened.\n7. Turn lock and open doors are not logical actions for biking home because they imply that he has entered a building or closed himself in a vehicle.\n8. Therefore, Pocket is a plausible choice. \n9. But, he's not holding a pocket in this context, he is holding a key. It should be C: pocket.\n10. Pocket is an abstract noun not a verb.\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C: open boxes"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, and open doors.\n5. Turn lock is the least appropriate choice because it does not imply unlocking and could even mean re-locking. He likely already has his key in his pocket, which is why he got out his key to unlock. The given options that are not relevant here are solution to a problem and open doors.\n6. Now consider D: pocket because from the information given and the structure of each given choice, we can make a generalization about it.\n7. This conclusion is based on the fact that the statements are short and straightforward - they are not vague in the sense that none of them provide a detailed solution, and they do not require any complex analysis to understand. \n8. In addition, the word 'key' in the text is an example of semantic cohesion.\n9. Based on all these indications, D: pocket is the likely answer because it can apply to any given key that needs unlocking.\n10. However, since D: pocket is the only choice that does not give a specific example of a key, it is likely that the author left this choice as an option for the reader.\n11. Therefore, the more appropriate answer is C: to what? It requires the reader to provide the correct answer themselves, which is in line with the spirit of question comprehension.\nAnswer: C. To what?\n\nInput: The book's title includes five words. What's wrong with them? Choices:  * A: three of them are adjectives B: the word, \"and\" is not a word C: they don't form a coherent phrase D: none of them are words\nRationales: The question asks us to identify what is wrong with the given titles. As the five words form a short phrase that suggests the title of the book, we begin to analyze the phrase as a whole, in order to determine what is wrong. \n1. Adjectives are words that describe or modify nouns:  'big','red', 'fast'.\n2. However, from the available options, only \"three of them [are] adjectives\", which indicates that it is A: three of them that are adjectives.\n3. \"And\" is a word that means \"as well as\".\n4. Therefore, it is not C: the word, \"And\" is not", "answer": "D: small talk"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. A 'turn lock' may refer to the process of using a key to turn the key to lock the bike.\n6. However, it could also refer to the action of turning a key in a particular order to open a lock.\n7. For that reason, we can eliminate A: turn lock because it is a vague instruction.\n8. Similarly, B: pocket can be eliminated because the meaning of 'using' can suggest any action.\n9. C: solution to problem could describe any process but it relates to the activity 'bike home'.\n10. This implies that the solution to the problem of biking home is simply a 'bike'.\n11. However, 'open doors' may or may not refer to the actual action of physically opening the door while leaving the house.\n12. So, since D: pocket can indicate an ambiguous action and E: open doors may relate to the process of opening the doors of the house, both options can be disregarded.\n13. So it left us with the possible answer D: pocket.\n14. He got his key out because he was going to bike home, and the key will go in his pocket during bike ride to a park or other public place.\n15. This implies that D: pocket, is the most appropriate choice.\n16.

It is quite clear from the context that the question intends to establish whether someone will tell a person how well they're doing. \n2. We can see from here that the person is describing that they want her to say that they are 'great'. \n3. Looking at the statements, we can see what he means clearly by not being 'that great'. \n4.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, and open doors. Let's start by considering the obvious action of opening a lock with a key.\n5. But notice that there is no specific mention of turning the lock or the key, only 'open' in the set of given choices.\n6. If we were to turn the key and open the lock, it would not lock the door again, so it would not be a problem again, as it is for the other choices given. \n7. This eliminates option A: turn lock, B: pocket is disproven by the context, because this is a situation before locking and pocketing are relevant.\n8. C: solution to problem can only be true for the locking problem, but that would not be applicable for the bike problem, so it is also a false option.\n9. D: open doors, this would only work if the next choice listed in the options is not \"what\".\n10. This leads us to consider option E: open doors.\n11. This choice would only work if the end result is to open the door.\n12. So, the answer to the question is E: open doors. \n\nAnswer: E: open doors\n\nInput: She could always trust me with her what? Choices: A: dog B: pink C: homework D: heart E: personal business\nRationales:1. The question talks about someone that is willing to trust \"with her what?\"\n2. The phrase \"with\" means that these items could be trusted in the same context.\n3. The context tells us that they are two items that can be trusted together.\n4. The given options are A: dog B: homework C: pink D: heart and E: personal business.\n5. We disregard A: dog B: homeswork. We know from the rest of the context that we shouldn't trust these items together. \n6. Considering the question and each option, we can eliminate C: pink because we know that it is something personal.\n7. This means that everything else could be trusted in this context. \n8. Therefore, the answer to the questions is D: heart.\n\nAnswer: D: heart\n\nInput: \"If you are lucky, you will get the job\" - the meaning of the sentence is that, if you", "answer": "E: may die"}

'Solution to problem' is a word of choice, which leaves us with 'Pocket' and 'open doors'.\n7. The choice A says 'turn lock', however; it refers to a lock of a bike, not a key to the door.\n8. The choice B says 'pocket', however; this is not something people keep on them when they are ready to go on a bike ride.\n9. Hence, the remaining two choices indicate that he was preparing to open his door, meaning that 'open doors' is the correct choice, so the answer is A: open doors.\nAnswer: A open doors\n\nInput: On Tuesday every week, I sit with a group that meets to discuss what? Choices: politics, war, current topics, events, global affairs\nRationales: First, let's look at the sentence: \"On Tuesday every week....\"\nThis signals a pattern of something that tends to repeat on a regular basis. \nThe next part of the sentence suggests a description of something, not a person.\nIt says \"...I sit with a group that (what) meets to discuss....\"\nNotice the plural subject and the plural verb, \"meets.\" \nThen the sentence indicates the topic that is discussed by this \"group.\"\nIt says that this \"group\" \"discusses...\" \n\"Politics,\" \"war,\" \"current topics,\" \"events,\" and \"global affairs\" are all possible choices for this.\nNow, let's determine which of those options is the best to use.\nTo do this, look back up at the words that signal the pattern.\nThere are two words that suggest that you should look for a phrase or word that can apply to any of these options.\nSince the sentence indicates the frequency of Tuesday, you should look for a pattern that can apply to \"every Tuesday.\"\nThese words are \"Tuesday\" and \"every.\"\nLook at the options for \"every\" and ask yourself if each one would be true no matter what day of the week you were actually referring to.\nIf it is true on a day of the week other than Tuesday it is probably not", "answer": "D: soup"}

This indicates that it could be a key that opens it, in which case, any of the given options can apply as a potential action. \n6. However, if the door lock was not opened using a key, then any of the actions will not be applicable.\n7. Therefore if it is a key that opened it, then the only plausible option is get out his key and begin to turn lock.\n8. If it is something else that is used to open the door, then the other actions apply.\n9. So, the answer could be any of the given options from the other actions apart from the one mentioned in the key action.\n10. Therefore, the answer in this scenario is: A: turn lock.\nAnswer: A. turn lock\n\nInput: How did Billie Jean King and all the young women of World TeamTennis help change the sport of tennis for women and men? Choices:  the 1970s A: change the game B: the USOC C: the International Tennis Federation D: change the women's game E: the WTA\nRationales: From the question, we establish that King was \"the most important women's tennis player who ever lived.\" As her story \"Broke the Sound Barrier for Women in Sports\", shows, she did so by changing a male-dominated, sexist game and \"paved the way for every other female athlete who has followed.\"\n\n1. The question includes two terms: Billie Jean King and TeamTennis.\n2. \"Billie Jean King and the young women in the team tournament [at the end of the '60s and early '70s] were pioneers in a host of ways,\" they established the U.S. TeamTennis and started its tour in the summer of 1974 as co-founders.\n3. During King's tenure, TeamTennis has allowed men and women to compete together for more than 1 million dollars in prize money and has grown to 2,000 teams.\n4. \"It began as a way to showcase what were considered the best players of its time.

Also, unlock is not mentioned, meaning that the choice of key is unlikely.\n6. This reduces the options to pocket and pocket.\n7. This conclusion leads us to assume the possibility of pocket. \n8. It's possible the person was holding something in his pocket.\n9. Last but not least, the given answer is still a plausible answer. It fits into the context of the given statement and is the only option left in the sentence. \n10.

Choices:   A: settle a territory B: set new laws C. promote peaceful relations D. divide two countries E: divide people into two groups \nRationales: The sentence states that 25,700 signatures had been collected from First Nations leaders across what is now Canada. Thus, the treaty is the one that is to be discussed in the question. \n\nWe can also eliminate B, as it doesn't clearly reference the treaty.\n\nWe can eliminate C as the wording does not match up to what the question is asking.\n\nWe can then eliminate E as 'group' is a vague term. The question is looking for an exact answer.\n\nThis leaves us with the only remaining option of A.\n\nThe option states that the treaty did more than this.

Choices: A: climax B: conflict C: plot D: resolution E: characterization\nRationales: Starting sentences 1 and 2, we know that the story has a strong climax and a good plot. That means the sentence refers to the entire story and not its climax. \n\nNext we can eliminate C as characterization does not relate to plot. \n\nNext, we can eliminate B as conflict is part of a story's plot.

{"text": "and pocket. Out of those two, turning a lock is more like the action of locking it, whereas pocket suggests that he was looking for the key. \n5.

He did everything he was told to do, and still the teacher gave him what? Choices: A: credit for wrong answer B: points C: zero D: help E: 0 points\nRationales: It is not given that everyone has completed his or her math assignment. The teacher is giving a 'grade', which represents the assessment of the work given. Incorrect answers earn 0 points. Thus, if the grade was zero, then the assignment had 'zero' points. \n\nInput: I can't get to work on time, what should I do? I'd better get up at least one hour early. \nChoices: A: wake up early B: don't wake up early C: wake up late D: wake up early\nRationales: \"I'd better get up...\" means that she is facing a problem, and now she is evaluating her options. Because she needs to resolve this problem, 'wake up early' is the only logical option.  A. wake up early\n\nInput: She was given the best job of her career.  Her company has high expectations for her abilities,  She's very qualified for what task?

{"text": ", pocket, solve a problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. Among those choices, 'turn lock' is the most appropriate because it is about action, not thinking and we have more options to choose from to describe that action. 'Solve a problem' and 'open doors' are also plausible choices, but they are more general, so we can further narrow the options to one.\n6. Finally, 'open doors' would not make sense because there is only one lock, therefore we rule this out as an option.\n7. The only option left is 'turn key', so the answer is B: turn lock.\nAnswer: B. turn lock\n\nInput: Everyone has something they wish they could forget.  The worst thing you could do is what?\nChoices: A. pretend your are stupid B. be happy C. forgive and forget D. move on E. tell everyone\nRationales: In this sentence, the first word 'everyone' is an exaggeration for a better understanding of the sentence \"Everyone wishes that there was a way to forget some things\". From there we can get an idea that this is probably a jokey or sarcastic sort of way to ask something. This leads us to the next thing after the first sentence of what is worse, which in this case is \"be happy\". Moving on through the choices, we see that what is worse than being happy is telling everyone. We then see that the worst option is what the sentence is asking us to guess. Hence we can put that as the answer: B. be happy\n\nInput: I'm not very good at memorizing things. It's a lot like what? Choices: A. cooking B. riding a bike C. riding a horse D. swimming E. typing\nRationales:\nThis sentence has exaggeration and negation in the sentence, in this case I am not \"very good\" at memorizing things. From there we know that it is not as easy as \"Riding a horse\" which is not at all relating to memorizing things. What's more, \"Swimming\" is very similar to riding a horse in that it is a similar motion, but in different media. Hence, A. cooking is the answer because cooking is a lot like riding a bike.\n\nInput: I wasn't sure what kind of gift", "answer": "D: fruit cocktail"}

We also eliminate D: pocket, as the bike home is not a problem that requires a pocketable solution.\n7. Finally, the phrase \"the bike home\" hints us that the key is not just any key, but the key to his bike, which makes C: solution to problem a plausible answer.\n8. Hence, the answer choice is C: solution to problem.\nAnswer: C; solution to problem\n\nInput: What quality has a candy bar?

Choices: 2: Your job might be based on it 3: It makes the article pleasant to read 4: It makes you look intelligent 5: So people don't have to guess or ask what you're talking about\nRationales:  1. The choice \"so people don't have the think\" doesn't apply here as it has the word \"to\" in the beginning and it's not in accordance to the words \"so people don'\n\n2. The choice \"It makes you look smart\" doesn't pertain to spelling. Instead it pertains to grammar and punctuation.\n\n3. \"It makes you look professional\" might be a reasonable choice, but in this context it is probably a little bit too vague.\n\n4.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, open doors, and pocket.\n5. \"Pocket\", as opposed to all of the other choices, is the only option that does not mention \"opening\" or \"unlock\".\n6. This makes sense due to previous context - the idea that he is already ready to bike home and has everything ready makes it unlikely that he would still be \"unlocking\" or \"opening\" \n7. In addition, because of this, it is also unlikely that he would be doing \"the solution to the problem\" or \"opening doors\". \n8. Lastly, \"turn lock\" may be suitable for opening a door and unlocking it, but the question clearly describes him going to open it, which is why the choice D: pocket is the most accurate.\n9.

The given statement talks about John having given a routine or perfunctorily examined the corpse.\n\n2. Examination of the corpse implies that John examined the corpse to understand the cause of the death. \n\n3. \"Prefunctiorily\" means only doing the work that is minimally required.\n\n4. Missing the real cause of death implies that if John had examined the corpse with more care and attentiveness, he would have found the real cause.\n\n5. \"Thorough\" refers to doing things properly so as to not miss out something. \n\n6. Therefore, if John examined the corpus thoroughly, he would have known the real cause of death as he would have done everything needed for a thorough examination and would not have misssed the real cause.

Therefore the answer is B: pocket.\nAnswer: B: pocket\n\nInput: The book club president's main task is to what? Choices A: talk B: decide C: listen D: give speech E: encourage meetings\nRationales:  1. At the start of this question, it informs us that the book club president's job is to lead the book club.\n2. Accordingly, leading a book club will require several different tasks. \n3. Among the given choices, 'talk', 'give speech', 'listen', and 'encourage meetings' are very specific to this situation.\n4. 'Decide' is too general as the book club leader should, ideally, seek to make decisions after careful and considerate deliberation with the book club members; as they are the ones making the decision (not the leader themselves).\n5. That leaves us with: 'talk' and 'give speech'.\n6. When we evaluate the given choices, we can tell that 'talk' is more general than 'give speech' as it is not specific to the action which is giving a speech in front of the book club members.\n7. Therefore answer A (talk)\nAnswer: A: talk\n\nInput: He wants a large car, but he should test what? Choices A \u2013 D: A: all of the above B: none of the above  C: steering wheel D: gear shifter E: gas pedal\nRationales:   1. The first sentence in the question is telling us that the man is looking to purchase a large car; the car needs to be large enough to suitably accommodate his family and his belongings.\n2. However, the man still needs to test-drive the car first, and needs to find out how easy the car is to manoeuvre and handle given that it's a large vehicle.\n3.

Choices: A: they will soon be collecting money B: they will meet her future mother-in-law C: they will see what marriage will really be like after the ceremony D: she'll see her new husband after all these years E: she'll meet her husband-to-be's parents \nRationales:  1. We can gather from the first two sentences that the bride is getting ready to collect the rings, which will symbolize the beginning life of her marriage.  \n2. The newly married wife is about to begin her transition into a new life.  \n3. The phrase, \"After being married for years...\" is not an appropriate way to finish the sentence because in today's society, it is unlikely for a couple to have been married for decades.  There are usually two options that can be used to complete this sentence: they get divorced or they remain married. 4. The phrase, \"she'll meet her husband's parents\" might sound like a conclusion for the situation but doesn't provide enough details. 5. Therefore, the final choice can be either \"getting together for the first time as a married couple\" or \"getting their marriage ceremony\".\n\nInput: Which of these foods is most likely to require refrigeration? Choices: 1. Apricots 2. Oranges 3. Bananas 4. Apples 5. Pineapples\nRationales: The question wants to know for which food is the most likely to require re-frigeration.  \n1. To answer this question, we need to consider 2 factors: the nature of the food and the environment in which it is grown.  \n2.

Of these, 'turn lock' doesn't directly relate to any action, 'pocket' is a general term for carrying things, like keys, which doesn't directly relate,'solution to problems' doesn't refer to the action of opening the lock, and 'open doors' would indicate opening a door other than a bike lock.\n6.

Pocket refers to the action of placing the key in your pocket, so let us analyse those that are left. \n7. Solution to problem and open doors each have a distinct meaning on their own. However, the context of the question does not align with these options.\n8. Therefore, we can conclude that he turned his key to lock his bike (A), as we are told that he is preparing to bike. \n9.

Choices:  left ear, top of head, chest, right ear, forehead, face, right ear, stomach, right shoulder, left ear, left shoulder, right eye, nose, right shoulder, right bicep, right shin, left leg, back, right bicep\nRationales: * At first, let us take note of how the given description of the person is worded:\n    1. If this person was being stared at, it would be by someone else, so the use case here is where the other person would be looking. \n    2. We are explicitly told \"at what point\". The use case in this situation should therefore be \"where\" the other person is looking, not \"why\" or \"when\"...\n    3.

At first glance, it may seem that the answers will mostly be face or eyes. \n    5. However, taking the above points into consideration, these options are only likely to be true if this person was to be stared at by someone. \n    6. In this situation, the only obvious answer that fits is left shoulder. \n    7.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to a problem, pocket, and open doors. As \"pocket\" twice, \n5. the given option \"pocket\" was eliminated from the choices.\n6. \"Solution to problem\" is vague and cannot be compared to \"pocket\". \n7. Since solution to problem does not indicate \"opening a lock\", it is not a correct option for the answer.\n8. The word \"open doors\" indicates a specific action and is not included in \"pocket\".\n9. This leaves us with two options that can both account for the action of using the key: \n10. \"turn lock\" and \"open doors\".\n11. Both of them can be easily applied to opening a door using a key.\n12. Out of the two choices, \"turn lock\" is the more specific and direct way to open up a lock, which fits the context and is more natural choice, than \"open doors\", which leaves room for possible misinterpretation.\n13. Therefore, the answer to this question is A: turn lock.\nAnswer: A Turing is an early type of computer, the name is derived from the surname of Alan Turing, who is famous for what? Choices: A: mathematical theories B: early computers C: artificial intelligence D: cryptography E: working at Bletchley Park\nRationales:\n1. The question provides us with some context, so we get a better understanding of the terms that are offered as choices.\n2. Since the question states that the 'answer' refers to the use of a famous name, this refers to the 'name', which is Turing, not the 'early type of computer', which is also Turing. \n3. The term name refers to the person, not the object or category, which rules it out as a possible answer option.\n4. So, the only options that remain as potential answers to the question are 'Alan Turing','mathematical theories', 'early computers', 'artificial intelligence' and 'cryptography'.\n5. 'Alan Turing' is the correct response with regard to the use of the name Turing, which is why 'cryptography' cannot be the answer, since 'A' is the correct response.\n6.

We can rule out choices A and D, since the question suggests he's ready to go and he's got his key, so he doesn't need to turn the lock or open the door.\n6.

Choices:  I - walk II - put leash on III - stay outside IV A: walk pet on leash B: keep on being happy C: continue your work D: go eat E: let it rest \nRationales:1. First, the dog has finished his exercise and the question asks what we do. \n2. Out of the given options, options A and C does nothing with the dog. B and D asks us to do something with the dog. This can also be interpreted as our action directly involving the dog. \n3. Option E simply requires doing nothing for the dog. Therefore, B, and D are better choices and can be eliminated. \n4. There are two pairs, but for each pair, we only pick one which doesn't have a direct implication with the dog. \n5. Thus, the correct answer is option B, the only remaining answer choice that involves the dog. \nAnswer: B Let it rest. \n\nInput: The man in the book shop was angry after making an order for what?

First, the man was angry because he made an order for something. \n2. We eliminate options I, III and IV from the choices. The man made an order, he could not have made a copy of the book or he would not have been angry. \n3. He also cannot have been angry with a long wait without making an order.

{"text": ", pocket, hold, open doors, remove keys.\n5. Of the options offered:\na. Holding only happens after the other options (including pocket, turn lock, open doors), which explains why he is now holding the key.\nb. Turn lock has a very similar meaning but is not quite as detailed enough and does not match with the sequence of events in the question. \nc. Open doors can also have two different meanings: to physically open or to ask permission to leave. This choice would only make sense if a permission to leave was required by someone.\nd. Remove keys is a bit vague; it does not clearly mention \"the key\" which is needed to open a door.\n6. Therefore 'open doors' has an incongruous connotation with the sequence of events and does not explain the action of the person. \n7. 'Turn lock' is an option for the key-related activity of the person, but it is not as precise as 'open doors'.\n8. As for 'pocket', this choice is used to express the action of hiding items, which does not explain the reason that the person has removed the key from his pocket.\n9. 'Keep' is not a real activity as the person has not performed any activities with the object (the key) itself.\n10. The only choice that makes sense is B: pocket, which is used to express the activity of placing an item in or carrying a pocket.\n11. The choice is supported by the fact that he was already ready to bike home and was simply performing the logical next step for the sequence of events.\n12.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem.\n5. Turn lock is what might happen if the key were not to have a solution to the problem with the lock. So, eliminating it leaves us with 4 solutions to the problem.\n6. Among these 4, we choose solution to problem because it is most likely that the solution he already has will work and is the preferred option to turn lock.\n7. Lastly, with the remaining choice: open doors, we eliminate option A: turn lock as it is similar to solution to problem. \n8. It is unlikely that a person who only has bike home will turn lock and open doors. \n9. This tells us that option B: pocket is the correct choice. \n10. However, the phrase can be slightly misleading, as the action \"to pocket\" does not necessarily mean that he is putting things in his pocket. \n11. Therefore, it is important to interpret the phrase as \"to place himself in a position to execute the action to open the door.\" \n12. With this clarity, we determine that B: pocket is the answer because it is the act of placing oneself in a position to do so in the future, rather than putting something in one's pocket.\nAnswer: B. pocket\n\nInput: You like to spend time in the garden.

Choices:  B: Eat more vegetables C: Do more yard work D: Take a walk E: Buy flowers\nRationales: The question asks for our answer on something that we can do to stay healthy.\n1. We eliminate the option A: Eat more vegetable, as this is a healthy habit regardless of whether one spends time in the garden or not.\n2. Also, from looking at other options, it might not be so helpful to spend even more time in the garden if we are too tired to do yard work.\n3. Thus, the options to consider are B, C, and D.\n4. B: Do more yard work is most helpful, because we may enjoy staying in the garden, but if our physical work there is minimal, it will not help to keep us healthy.\n5. B: Do more garden work is not specific, and may not help us so much.\n6. C: Take a walk is likely, but not necessarily specific, for staying", "answer": "A: come home"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. Among the choices, it's logical to eliminate 'turn lock' because this action is only done after unlocking the door.\n6. We also eliminate'solution to problem'. This is because this does not refer to a specific action or behavior that the person has done.\n7. Therefore it would lead us to rule out solution to problem.\n8. 'Pocket' refers to putting items in a pocket. So this choice is also eliminated.\n9. If we consider what's left, we can safely say that it is likely that he would have opened doors for his entrance home because he had 'out his key'.\n10. So, the answer to this is E: open doors.\nAnswer: E. open doors\n\nInput: She's a very energetic person, but she's also very talkative. She's just a very very what? Choices: B: lovable C: sweet D: intelligent E: charming\nRationales: As we know that the word'very very' indicates that we are going to name a quality by mentioning that the specific person is very very this quality.\n1. Start by eliminating what didn't make any sense. 'Lovable' is not used the same way as 'energetic' as 'lovable' gives a sense of affection and warmth, and 'energetic' does not necessarily give that.\n2. The statement 'She's a very energenic person, but she is also very talkative' implies energetic as a main quality. This is confirmed through the use of the adverb'very' in front of the second word.\n3. So the question part is asking us what her main quality is.\n4. Now, out of the given options, we have to determine the one that makes the most sense when compared to energetic.\n5. Among A: lovable, B: talkative, C: sweet, and D: intelligent, E: charming, we know they are used as adjectives.\n6. Talkativeness and sweetness sound the most appropriate of all the options given.\n7. However, we cannot use both of these to describe the main quality as they both refer to things that are pleasing.\n8. This only leaves us with either A: lov", "answer": "B: filing cabinet"}

The given choices do not refer to actions with respect to opening a lock or opening a door.\n7. Lastly, the person is getting out the key and is going to bike home, which means he has most likely already found a solution to his problem.\n8. Therefore, the action of opening a door or lock is more likely the action they would actually do.\n9. The only remaining answer that is a possible action with respect to opening a door is D: open doors, hence, the one that better fits.\n10. So, the answer for this question is D: open doors.\nAnswer: D; open doors\n\nInput: A:  I can make that! B: I do want! C: Oh that's wonderful! D: Can I eat? E: I would love that one\nRationales: The Question is asking for which choice will you eat after receiving the invitation to eat? 1. We understood from the Question as I am willing to cook & my friend can have if he likes it; 2. I would love that one (Choice e) is not appropriate as we already know he can make it so he is no more interested now, he is only interested in the taste. 3. Can I eat?

D: that she liked people to think highly of her 5. E: that she thought money was important\nRationales:\n1. Her mother always told her to save money.\n2. Generosity is the quality of kindness and gentleness. Generous comes from the Latin generosus which means \"noble and bountiful.\"\n3. Generosity is a form of prosocial behaviour characterised by an act of giving voluntarily given by one person to another without any obligation for something of value, performed with an intention to benefit the other person.\n4. To save money is a way to be generous because when someone gives something to another person or people without getting anything in return or expect something in return, this is an example of generosity. \n5. Therefore:\n\n        (1, 2) Generous (A)\n        (1,3) Good girl (B)\n        (1) There's nothing wrong with her (1)\n        (1)(2) That people would think highly of her (D)\n        (1), (2) That money is important (E)\nAnswer:\nE: that money is important\n\nInput: Which is the better place to keep a spare change?

Choices: A : flip over B : flip up C : flip down D : flip over E : flip back\nRationales:\n1. The question refers to a steak grilled on the flat surface on the top of the stove called a griddle.\n2. According to the given steps to grilling a steak over direct heat.\n3. A: \"1 inch under bone and 1 over top bone\" is a reference to the location of the bone after cooking.\n4. The top part of the bone has less meat, so cooking 1 over it would expose the grill to direct heat on the top surface 9 times out of 10.\n5. B: \"flipping over\" is the next step after the meat is separated from the bone.\n6. C: \"flipping down\" is not logical since there are not many other steps to grilling steak over direct heat, and flipping down doesn't make sense.\n7. D: \"flipping over.\" is not logical since steak is grilled without flipping it.\n8. E: \"flipping back\" is not logical since steaks are grilled without flips.\n9. Therefore the answer is B: flip over.\nAnswer: B : flip over\n\nInput: She ran out the door because her father called to make sure she was on her way. What was she was doing before?

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, and open doors. \n5. Turn lock and open doors are not the action of unlocking a door or opening a lock with a key, but rather are related to using keys for other purposes such as accessing a home or starting a car.\n6. Therefore the only remaining choice is \"pocket.\"\n7. This choice fits the best in the context of the question, as it is the most natural action to take with keys after preparing to leave one's home, since keys are most commonly stored in one's pocket.\n8. Thus the answer is A: turn lock\nAnswer: A: turn lock\n\nInput: What should be used to get the rope and the bucket into position? Choices:  ___A: The hook___, ___B: the line___, ___C: The knot___, ___D: The rope___, ___E: The bucket\nRationales: The question states that the rope and bucket must be in a position to be used.\nThe answers tell whether the tool should be used to get them in the right position.\nA: the rope is the only item in the question that has the function of getting things into a position.\nC: the knot has the function of connecting other parts by tying them together. We wouldn't want to connect the rope or the bucket by using a knot, but would want to lift them.\nD: the bucket also has the function of getting something into a position, so it is the only option other than the rope that can be used for any of the given items.\nE: the bucket has nothing to do with getting things into position. Instead, the container is more likely to carry items out of the position at which they are situated.\n\nAnswer: A: the rope.\n\nInput: He wanted to impress everybody in the room, so what could he do to ensure he did?

Choices: 13 A: 26 B: 30 C: 46 D: 60 E: 100\nRationales:  1. The first sentence says \"we need to know every one\" and the second sentence says that we can thank them later to emphasize that they didn't help in anyway and were actually there only to be thanked.\n2. Since there are only ten invitation cards available, each person that attends must be invited more than once to get the required cards to invite all the invited.\n3. The only way for the number of people invited to be more than the number of cards available is to have two or more people attend the wedding. \n4. Since ten invitation cards are available, and 46/5 = 9 people must be attending the wedding, the minimum number of people needed to attend the wedding must be 11.\n5. This answer choice is supported by the statement given that we need to know the number of people to invite in the event.\n6. All other choice are incorrect.  \n7. Therefore, there must be a minimum of 11 people attending the wedding.\n8. Answer: A (26)\nAnswer: 26\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1.

The only option that has 'pocket' and 'key' is \"turn lock\".\n9. The question part tells us that he was getting ready, which means he was getting stuff ready for the intended action.\n10. This means that he was getting the key ready, and that he has a key to lock the door with.\n11. This means that he needed to turn the key in the lock to lock the door if he was planning to bike home. \n12.

It depends on what is meant by the phrase 'the masont's castle'  C. May be  D. Not definitely  E. None of your business\nInput: A manson was constructigng a stone castle, is he a baker? Rationale: 1. The manson is not a baker.\n2. If you examine the entire question: \"A mason is constructing... is the manson... a...?\" If \"is a manson\" is compared to \" is not a baker\", it seems to say that \" a manson\" is in contrast with the \"baker\" and therefore, the second part of the question is \"is the manson not a baker?\"; this does not make sense and, therefore, the answer to this question is \"certainly not\".\n3. A baker is not a masons specialization, and masons did not construct castles.\n4. We have eliminated all answers that include \"may\", \"may be\", or \"maybe.\" \n5. \"None of your business\" is inappropriate for the format of the question.\n6.

This is why he is trying to improve both his arts and his crafts.\n4. This could encompass different levels of patience and understanding.\n5. This could include an increase in technique with his hands.\n6. Dusty is also looking to build more skills, which will all help him improve his artistic abilities.\n7. In this case, \"artistic abilities\" can include the quality of Dusty's artwork. \n8. However, skill is only one of several elements that define the artistic quality.\n9.

Turning a lock and opening doors are not actions related to biking home, and thus cannot be the correct answer.\n7. Pocketing a key relates to a lock, but there is no definitive link to a lock that can be a potential solution for opening the lock and this kind of action does not correlate with the context of the question or situation.\n8.

Therefore, walking up a hill made him a good athlete.\n4. Considering options B: track and D: tennis, he was now a good runner or good at tennis.\n5. The first two options are about his sports skills.\n6. This rules out options B: basketball and D: tennis.\n7. If he were a good player in basketball or tennis that means his sport would have been the first one among options.\n8.

Choices:  P: double P: twin P: double P: high P: heavy\nRationales: The word \"glass\" is generally used to refer to a container that is made of transparent material and may contain a liquid such as water, wine or beer.\nThe word \"water\" in the question refers to liquid water, the kind that you will find in a glass.\nIt is not used to refer to ice (the solid form of water).\n\n1. The question mentions that the price had been charged on how much.\n2. The choices given are: double, twin, double, high and heavy.\n3. This refers to the prices that are charged for goods including water.\n4. A: double and C: twin are both double quantities (pricing for double quantities).\n5.

Choices: A: puppy B: Rusty C: Lucky D: Sparky E: Fido\nRationales:1. The question asks us to identify the name given to the woman's second dog, which is the first one she has ever owned.\n2. Based on this information, we can eliminate options B: Rusty, C: Lucky, and D: Sparky, because they already refer to the dog as her first one.\n3. Option A: puppy is also a likely choice because \"puppy\" is an adjective that describes the physical aspect of the dog, which could also hint at the dog's age (i.e. it is a \"puppy\" meaning it is young) or its size (i.e. \"puppy\" meaning smaller and younger than other dogs).\n4. These considerations help us determine that the second dog was named \"Fido\", the answer to the question, although this is only half correct, as it should be an 'e' not an 'o' in the spelling, so the full answer is Fido.\nAnswer: Fido\n\nInput: In the movie, the child was left alone when the babysitter left.  What does the word: \"Alone\" mean? What kind of word is it? Choices: A. adjective B. Adverb C. Adverb D. Adjective E. Noun\nRationale:1. The question is talking about a movie.\n2. The word \"alone\" means that the child was separated from the person in charge of watching her (the babysitter).\n3.

Choice B: Pocket is incorrect because you do not get something out of your pocket with your key.\n9. Choice E: put in pocket is incorrect because you do that just as you pull the key out.\n10. Therefore, the answer must be either B: Pocket or C: Solution to problem.\n11. The word 'problem' is only mentioned in the original sentence once, and it does not relate to the action of turning or unlocking.\n12. Therefore, if we take the word 'problem' out of the sentence completely, it still makes sense. \n13. Thus, since the action of putting the key into a pocket is still appropriate, the correct choice must be C: Solution to problem, as putting the solution for the problem is most likely to be done in the pocket.\n14. The other choice B: Pocket is not correct because the action of 'putting key into a pocket' is a solution for a problem, but not the action in which the key is used for.\nAnswer: C:(Solution to the problem)\n\nInput: I feel we should not forget the fact that we, as a people, are all the products of both nature and what?

Therefore, they did what? Choices: A: made no contact B: avoided them C: killed them D: forced them to convert to their beliefs E: harassed them\nRationales: Here is a set of possible answers; one of them is correct. \n1. The neo-Nazi party was made up of people who believed in the ideology Hitler developed while he was head of the Nazi party during World War I, before he attempted to seize power.\n2. They believed everyone who was not of the same race, religion, gender, social status, or disability as them was inferior to them.\n3. They viewed people of color and Jewish people as being inferior to them because of their race.\n4. They viewed women as being inferior to men because of their gender.\n5. They viewed the low-income class as inferior because of their social status.\n6. They viewed the disabled as inferior to them because of any physical traits or illnesses that caused them to have a disability that limited their ability\n7. It is a given that people of this group would exclude people who were of different races, and exclude people who were of the opposite religion, so eliminating answer A and E is the best place to start.\n8. To ensure that people who weren't of the same religion weren't killed by their group, the Nazis created ghettos to hold all Jewish and Roma populations; they created those ghettos because they believed there was something very wrong with certain members of those specific religious groups. This is the only way they could avoid killing Jewish people because the only time they would ever kill people from these groups is during the \"cleansing\" that happened.\n9.

Open Doors suggests the action of bicycling, not the act of lock opening.\n8. Pocket can refer to putting the key in the front or back pocket, but not specifically inside the pocket, and solution to problem is not a concrete action.\n9. Therefore, C: pocket is the answer that makes the most sense out of the given choices.\n10.

The first statement makes use of contradictions, such as 'never' and 'ask for', which are not used in the usual literal way.\n2. 'Cute eyes' is a noun phrase that describes what the cat is doing with its eyes.\n3. 'Cat-astrophe' is also a grammatical error that has to do with the incorrect formation of a sentence using 'cat' and 'catastrophe'.\n4. None of these statements are puns, so answer is option D which is 'none of the above'.\n5. The correct answer is option B: The cat looked at the the mouse with its cutes eyes.\n6. The statement is a pun because 'cat's eyes' and 'cutes eyes' have the exact same word but with different meaning.\n7. Option D: The cat is always in-catastrophe and out-catastrophe are not examples of pun because they do not have contradictions.", "answer": "B: hotel"}

We eliminate turn lock and solution to problem because these action phrases do not refer to the actual physical action of the key, when all three action phrases are used in connection to a key, it is usually to remove the key from a lock.\n6. Open doors is also eliminated as it is too broad for the given context, if the given choices are related to the physical action of a key, then the answer should be that of a physical action too. \n7. Lastly, the phrase pocket does not make sense as he got out of the key; he would not then put it back in his pocket.\n8.

Choices: paint A paint B draw C sketch D drawings E drawings\nRationales: Look at the statement and answer options carefully.\n1. She doesn't know how to paint yet and wants to know how to paint.\n2. So, the question is asking for what?\na. The correct answer should indicate an action that will aid in learning more about the process she's not familiar with. This is why the choices to be eliminated should be things she would already be doing (B, D).\nb. 'Painting' is not the answer since it isn't an action.\n3.

The action of turning a lock does not fit since he already has his key out; opening doors is too vague (didn't he have to unlock his door first).\n6. Additionally, the action of solving a problem does not fit at all since there was no problem posed.\n7. Therefore it leaves us with A: turn lock and B: pocket. These are both about his reaction to the key he had found. \n8. However, we cannot entirely eliminate B: pocket, since it does not include his response to the key. \n9. When we rule out B: pocket, we are left with A: turn lock.\n10. Thus the answer is A: turn lock. \nInput: On the first run, the tape got stuck before he reached the end of the path, so he turned around and what? Choices: A: he jumped over B: kept pushing C: stopped and turned around D: stopped and removed it E: kept going\nRationales: Start by analyzing the first sentence of the question and look for possible clues.  \n1. The first sentence provides a hint that the question concerns actions the boy took while running the tape and their results.\n2. The next sentence also reveals that his initial action was to push the tape until he reached the end.\n3. This indicates that his first course of actions to fix the issue was to remove or solve the problem causing the tape to move.\n4. Therefore it follows that the correct answer should involve actions he took while running the tapes.\n5. This narrows down the scope to choices C, D or E. The three remaining choices don't reflect actions he took while running.\n6. Choice B doesn't appear plausible because the boy didn't jump over anything, he kept running and tried to push the tape forward, so he could run to the end to fix the tape.\n7. Choice E is also inappropriate because he stopped running, so he wouldn't be able to keep running. Also, the boy did not stop to turn around.\n8. The correct option among the remaining two is D: kept running.\nAnswer: D : kept running.\n\nInput: He had nothing to offer to her, so she said, \"I'm leaving\",  he what", "answer": "C: freezer"}

It is not safe to swim and he has nothing to help him across.  His best option then is to simply what? Choices: A: let the river take it B: wade across C: dive in D: wait for it to flow by E: create a boat \nRationales: The question talks about a man with a certain situation where he wants to reach the other side of the lake, which he cannot do due to the lack of bridge/bridge alternative.\n1. Then the man has to do something to get across the river.\n2. Now, consider the options given: To swim is not an option because of the risk of danger.\n3. Therefore, he needs something to help him across.\n4. \"Create a boat\" is the only logical choice from the rest of the given ones.\n5. Since he doesn't have anything and there is no bridge available, the only other choice left would be to \"wait for the river to flow by\", because it will eventually flow to the other side.\n6. Finally, 'create a boat' is one of the choices given, and 'wait for the river to pass' is a possible outcome/consequence.\n7. Therefore the answer would be A: create a boat.\nAnswer: A.

The question asks for the duration of a presidential election and provides that it is a \"presidential election\".\n2. The given options are: four years, months, years and decades.\n3. Four years is longer than a month, and it seems possible for a presidential election to occur in a shorter duration (4 years) than a month. Thus, it is reasonable to identify the option that requires the shortest duration as C: years.\n4. But decades is long-term, so C: years is not a plausible option. D: decades is also not a plausible answer as it still requires too long of a time.\n5. This leaves us with A: years, which is the most feasible answer. However, decades might still be considered as a plausible answer because as we know that a presidential election can occur every 4 years. \n6. To resolve this, we can identify the longest possible time with C: years which we know to be the shortest possible time. Then, we can determine that the correct answer is the smaller time between years, or B: years. \n7. As years is the most plausible answer, B: years is the correct option. 8.

Choices: A: to maintain an early finishing reputation B: increase productivity from their staff C: to get a higher payoff D: meet an employee's goals E: to maintain a low workload\nRationales: All of the following: 1. The manager has to decide if she would allow her team to work for an extra five minutes. This tells us that the team is expected to finish earlier.\n2. Extra work time only relates to 'productivity' or 'higher payoff'.\n3. 'To get a higher pay off' is more plausible than the others.\n4. We know that 'higher pay off' is relevant due to a previous statement in the question.\n5. So, we have to eliminate the other options; 'increase productivity' is possible, but a manager probably would not consider reducing workload.\n6. They are more likely to consider it in order to increase productivity, but we cannot confirm that from this given information.\n7. Similarly, we cannot confirm that they would increase productivity from their employees, because the context does not specify employees, and because 'employees' would probably be more relevant to increasing workload, not productivity.\n8.

She made a vow to herself not to cry anymore, no matter what.\n2. A: decisions = it is not as relevant as vow\n3. B: promises = it is not as strong as vow\n4. C: vows = it is the right answer because the context states that she vowed not to cry\n5. A: choice is not as strong as a vow. Moreover, the context states that she made a vow not to cry again despite her tears of sad. It may have been too obvious for the test maker to use choice \u201cchoice because choice does not require any commitment\n6. D: progress = it may be one of the options but it is not the right answer\n7. E: choices = the correct answer is D-vow because it is the strongest and most relevant. The vow is more appropriate than a vow because a vow is a stronger and more personal promise. Choice is too simple and too general.\nAnswer: D-vow", "answer": "D: farm yard"}
{"text": "- turn the key in the lock to unlock it, pocket - to insert it into a pocket, solution to problem - to find a solution to a problem, pocket - to put objects in a pocket, open doors - to open the door.\n5. In this instance, turn lock is an option, however, since the key is already out of the pocket, this would suggest he already opened the lock because to turn the lock with the key would only require it to be in the pocket. Pocket is another option, however, this does not make sense because he is then already using it, so it would make more sense to keep it in his pocket until he gets home. Solution to problem would make sense if the problem was not being able to bike home. However, being ready to bike does not suggest that he has a problem biking. Hence, this is also incorrect. Doors can be opened when the lock is turned, thus this option is also incorrect. So, the answer must be 'open doors'.\nAnswer: Answer:\n\nInput: My dog, Oscar, is a German Shepherd, what might he be if he were a person instead of a dog? Choices:  (A): a cop, (B): president, (C): doctor, (D): soldier, (E): janitor\nRationales:  1. The question states the characteristics of \"My dog Oscar\" - that he is a German shepherd.\n2. This indicates that our dog has a specific job or occupation, which is why the answer must describe a job, not a person.\n3. Out all the given choices, we decide to eliminate: a cop, a president, and a doctor.\n4. A cop or a president are jobs held by people, and a doctor is a healthcare position, which is most likely to be held by a person.\n5. Of the remaining three options, a soldier would best fit the description, because a soldier would be someone who is hired to assist protecting another person.\n6. Hence, the answer must be B: Soldier.\nAnswer: (C): Soldier\n\nInput:  Where do pigeons live? Choices:   (A): In your home.  (B): In a field.  (C): In a small building.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, open doors, and pocket.\n5. Turn lock is not applicable for the question. When you turn a lock, it means you unscrew it counterclockwise, which doesn't match the context of the question because the word 'turn' doesn't tell us which way it is turned.\n6. While 'pocket' also doesn't match the given context because 'pocket' means to put it in a pocket.\n7. In terms of solutions, there are many solutions to a problem that are not related to a key, for example, taking a cab or public transportation.\n8. When we come to the choices that use the words 'open' we can further clarify the context by understanding that he is going to his bike.\n9. The given choice 'open doors' can be considered because it directly talks about opening.\n10. However, looking at the other choices, among which'solution to problem' is a bit awkward because it doesn't sound natural.\n11. Therefore, the answer to this question is 'open doors', and 'open' is the correct answer.\nAnother way to get to the answer is to look at the last two words in the question, 'to his bike'.\nThis leaves us with three choices: turn key, pocket, and open bike.\nWe eliminate turn key because it doesn't match'ready', because he hasn't done anything else to prepare to bike home. \nSo, we have two choices left and both of which can be directly related to opening his bike.\nTherefore, either choice matches up with the given question.\n12. In this instance we don't need to look at all the given choices, we need to focus on the context for which we can find evidence to support an answer, which directly relates to opening his bike, so 'open door' is the correct answer as it is the more plausible one out of 'open doors' and 'open bike'.\nAnswer: A: open doors\n\nInput: Your heart has a pulse beat, a strong, steady, regular beat that shows that everything working correctly, a heartbeat is what?

{"text": ", pocket (solution to a problem), and open doors. The first one (turn lock) does not make sense in the context of the question as he has already taken his key out.\n5. The second one (pocket) suggests he was unable to find his lock. This is not plausible because after turning off the lights, he would not leave the house till everything was ready.\n6. The last choice (open doors), again, does not make sense in context of the question. Opening doors can never substitute opening a lock.\n7. Therefore the only suitable and relevant choice that fits the context is D: pocket.\n8. The answer is, therefore, D: pocket.\nAnswer: D pocket\n\nInput: The police found two bags with heroin, one of whom carried the heroin, which bag was it? Choices:  C: the purse E: the larger of the bags F: the smaller of the bags G: the backpack\nRationales: After reading the question, we can see one of two bags had heroin and the other one did not. What we need to do is figure out which one contained the heroin. \nFirst, consider the bags, one of which is larger. We can eliminate F: the smaller of two bags since smaller bags are more likely to be purses, which are not used for the transportation of hard substances like heroin. Also, it could be the larger bag that contains the heroin. So the question narrows to: which of a large or a small bag contains heroin, the answer is C.\n\nInput: My brother is a very kind-hearted person.

Choices:  E: I'm rich  F: He really likes me B: He's poor A: Yes, I think your brother is sick\nRationales: First, consider the question. If your brother is a kind-hearted person and is always giving his money to you, he must be very rich. Because A: Yes, is a very vague answer, we can eliminate it. Since he doesn't have any money, the only choice that makes sense is F: I am rich.\n\nInput: He put", "answer": "C: health"}

Choices: 1) Take a picture using you hand and the object.  2) Take a picture that will let you see what others see.  3) Take a picture that you look at it to know what will happen.  4) TAke a picture and then make copies of the photo.  5) TAke a mirrored picture of another object\nRationales:  1. To take a picture of yourself, you should simply use your hand to hold the object.\n2. The options to \"take a picture that will let me see what others see\" makes no sense as the camera cannot see what is in front of its lens.\n3. The option to \"take a picture so that you can look at it and see what will happen\" also has no logical sense as the camera cannot predict the future.\n4. The last option, to \"take a picture of another view object\" is the correct answer as the subject can be seen in the reflection of the camera.  \n5.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, open doors, pocket. \n5. 'Turn lock' is usually done to a lock that cannot be opened with a key, such as deadbolts.\n6. 'Pocket' is generally used to describe the action of keeping something in a pocket, which is not really in line with starting the process of opening a lock.\n7. 'Solution to problem' is not a common way of describing someone physically starting to open a lock.\n8. 'Open doors' is used to describe the action in general, which also does not describe one particular aspect that matches the context.\n9. Therefore, the best option to describe the action of he was ready to bikey home, he got out the key and began to what?, is 'Begin to unlock a lock': this option matches the context and specifically describes part of the overall process of opening the lock.\n10. Hence, the answer to the question 'He was ready to bike, he got out the lock...' is 'begin to unlock a lock'.\n\nInput: He hates to see people treated unfairly.  This is why he's always ready to help when someone needs  what? Choices: A: free handouts B: to learn C: sympathy E: friendship\nRationales: The question asks us to think critically and answer a question based on the details it has offered.\n1. The first part gives us info about him. The second part informs us what his intention is (he is always ready to help).\n2. Considering the clues given, in a situation where he sees someone being treated unfairly, the type of help is not free handouts.\n3. He is not the one being unfairly treated, he is offering a solution to someone who is being treated unfairly.\n4. Therefore, from the options provided, he is offering his friendship.\n5. The word 'friendship' is in the right context considering the word 'always ready to help... when someone needs his friendship'.\n6. He is willing to offer friendship as a solution to the problem he can see.\n7. Hence the answer will be friendship.\nAnswer: C.\n\nInput: She has a bad headache.  Her mom suggested taking what?

A: ignore it B: get away from the child who hit him C: complain D: ignore E: go tell something to another person\nRationales: The question asked us what a child would do if another child hit them.  Ignoring it and complaining seem too extreme to be likely actions.\nWe are asked to choose between five options: A, B, C, D and E.\n\n1. The actions complain and get away from the child are extreme. We would expect a child to be more likely to ignore and complain and less likely to ignore and get away from the other child who hit them.\n\n2. Ignore and ignore both seem extreme. We would expect an older child to complain, but it's also plausible that a child might do nothing.\n\n3. D, which allows us to ignore is an acceptable answer.\n\n4. We can ignore and complain and ignore and go tell another person.\nThis rules out E.\n\n5. Therefore, we know that the answer must be ignored, and the choice to ignore is B.\n\nAnswer:B: ignore\n\nInput: The boy wanted to know the purpose of the book. He asked the teacher.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open door.\n5. We eliminate the two choices that refer to doing the same action (turn lock and open door).\n6. We eliminate those choices that do not fit the context of the question (solution to problem and pocket).\n7. So we are left with two options: B: pocket or turn lock.\n8. Since the question refers to him doing an action that implies getting a key out, we can eliminate B: pocket since in this context, \"turn lock\" is a more likely option since \"pocket\" would only be used if the man intends to keep his key for another time.\n9. Therefore, the answer choice is D: turn lock.\nAnswer: D turn lock\n\nInput: All the food we grow and raise on the farm for us should be consumed or what? Choices:   A: given to dogs and hogs B: given to other farms C: fed to chickens D: donated to charity E: allowed to rot in the soil\nRationales:\n1. The given statement is referring to the food on the farm.\n2. The correct answer would be one that the given statement approves of and one that is plausible.\n3. Since the sentence is asking for what SHOULD be done, option B: \"given to other farms\" is not the best answer since it does not express approval.\n4. Option C: 'fed to chickens' is a viable choice considering that this would be the best way to utilize food that won't otherwise be consumed.\n5. However, option D: 'allowed to rot in the soil' does not express approval nor does it relate to what should be done since this is an outcome that one would not want to happen with the food they grow and raise on a farm.\n6. Therefore the answer is either C: 'fed chickens' or D: 'allowed to rotten in the soil'. (There isn't an \"E\" answer choice).\n7. The two answers that may seem plausible and applicable are B: given to other farm or C: fed to chicken.\n8. However, C is actually more plausible and applicable to the context of what the sentence is saying.\n9. Thus, the final answer should be C: fed to chicks.", "answer": "E: garden of eden"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, and open doors.\n5. Turning a key suggests that unlocking the bike is something he is already planning to do as the action of turning a key is usually done before you get to your bike.\n6. Popping the lock and opening the bike lock are not as common activities as getting out a key.\n7. Solving a problem implies that the problem must have already occurred, which doesn't seem to coincide with the first question as it was not told to us that there was an initial problem. \n8. Pocket most likely refers to the action of placing something in or with the key because that could be how you'd lock a lock by pocketing it. \n9. However, this does not imply that he will bike home.\n10. It could also indicate 'prepare to', 'think of', 'put in', or'store'.\n11. Opening a door is not implied as part of unlocking the bikey.\n12. Therefore, among the choices, the only option that refers to the lock is: 'turn lock', so, the correct answer is: A: turn lock.\nAnswer: A.

Choices A. head, B. stomach, c. foot, d. leg, e. back. Difficult level.\n1. Head = brain 2. The head and the brain are the same things. 3. If we have a headache or feel pain in the head then we say \"I am suffering from__________.\" We mean that we feel pain in the brain. If we have headache we actually feel pain around the whole head. So we say: \"He has headache...\" 4. (1) If I have a pain in the head (brain) then what I feel exactly is pain in the brain. 5. Ache = pain of the muscles (leg, foot, stomach, etc.) In the body.

{"text": ", bike, pocket, pocket, open door.\n5. Therefore options A: turn lock because it is the action of opening the lock.\n6. However, the lock is already open because the door is bike.\n7. For option B: bike I can't use this choice because we already have a more specific verb: bike.\n8. Similarly, option C: solution to problem doesn't fit because the sentence before said that he is ready to bike home so there are no problem to be solved first. \n9. Then option E: open doors doesn't fit either because we are looking for a verb: opened \n10.So we have to choose D: pocket because it is the least specific choice and it fits the best in terms of grammar and logical implications.\nAnswer: D\n\nInput: If I were rich, I wouldn't mind having a pet snake.

So they could probably guess 1930 because they have 1900 and 1920 covered. \n\"E\" is not a covered time period, so they would not be \"very\" confident that they can guess it.\nThe last two is less of a guess and so it would not make sense to try to convince you that they had covered those as well.\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C: pay bills"}

Choices:  [ ] A: in a restaurant near me [ ] B: where the snow is melting [ ] C: in a bar with the TV on\nRationales: Start by noting the given statement: \"Where can I buy an ice-cream cone?\".\nThis indicates that the question is asking for a specific place that could fit the request.\n3. The given options are: \"in a restaurant near me\", \"where the snow is melting\", and \"in a bar with the TV turned on.\"\n4. The first option is the most direct and simplest request.\n5. A'restaurant near me' indicates that a place that sells or prepares food is what is asked for.\n6. A'restaurants', as the plural, indicates that it refers to a group of establishments that sell or prepare food, and that these places exist in varying proximities from the location of the requester.\n7. Therefore answering the question with'restaurant near you' would be correct. \nAnswer: A : [ ] restaurant near you\n\n### Tips\nIt was a cool, snowy day.\n\nIt has been snowing for hours.\n\nThe snow is melting.\n\nThe snow has been melting for hours.\n\nI want to get to school with a snowball that I picked on the way from home, but where can I throw it.?

{"text": ", pocket, solution to a problem, open doors and pocket.\n5. Since bike lock is a commonly used term in the modern era and bike has a specific meaning, the given choices do not directly relate to the situation the question describes.\n6. So the answer must be a choice that can be done before opening a lock.\n7. Turning a lock is not possible without opening it.\n8. Solution is not directly related to a lock since it would typically be something that was done before bike.\n9. Opening the doors does not make sense, either, since the question asks for bike related option.\n10. So, we have to pick between pocket and pocket, we choose option C: pocket.\n11. Reasonably, it's possible to have a solution to a problem in the future but it's not possible to have solutions in the pocket. The pocket was there before hand. \n12.

Choices:  Choices:  A; learned B: saw C: found D: taught E: told F: knew\nRationales: The question is asking us about what he learned. The first part tells us that he learned what he needed to know. \nOption A: Learned - If he learned what he needed, it must be because he studied something, and studied is not an activity associated with first day.\nOption B: Saw - If he saw what he needed, it suggests he observed and studied, but he need not be a student to be able to study.\nOption C: Found - Found means he already knew something, which would suggest he had already learned what needed to know. If so, it would mean he would not need to learn at all for his first day.\nOption D: Taught - Taught suggests that he will use an authority/position to teach others. However, the question does not mention if he was appointed to be a teacher on his first day.\nOptions E: Told - This is the only option that indicates he received something from someone, which could be from other staff, his manager or his leader.\nTherefore, the best answer is option F: Knew.\nAnswer: F: knew\n\nInput: The young prince spent his whole life in the royal palace, until he left on what?

This is a tricky one. The correct answer lies in understanding the context of the question, and the wording of the options.\n1. The question tells you that he used his \"mind\" to solve the problem.\n2. However, it may be difficult to determine the exact cognitive skill he used because it is not specified. \n3. Thus, first, we need to eliminate options that do not fit with the context of the question: D: numbers and E: creativity. \nNumbers are quantitative, not qualitative skills; they only involve computation. \nCreativity is a non-quantitative skill that does not directly address the skill.\n4. So, the answer to the question can be derived from the remaining options, A: logic and B: math. \n5. The options do not directly suggest which of the two we should choose.\n6.

Likewise, he has no problem with the bike door lock; the question part mentions that he is ready to bike home and already has his key ready.\n7. He could do A or C at any time, afterward, and thus do not require attention. \n8. Option D: Open doors does not relate to the bike door as the bicycle is not doored. \n9. We are left with only option E: pocket, which indicates action that is done after the person is ready to get started.\n10. So, he was ready to bikey home so he began to get his bike. \n11. This can be accomplished by getting his bicycle out of his storage room which usually involves turning the door handle and opening the door. It makes sense that he would do this action after getting out his key, because the key unlocks the bicycle from the storage room.\n12. Hence, the answer to this question is E: pocket.\nAnswer: E pocket\n\nInput: Dressing well can help you what? Choices: A: create an image B: develop a habit C: increase self esteem D: enhance mood E: increase productivity\nRationales:  1. Dressing well can be interpreted as wearing clothing that is appropriate for the occasion, fitting and looks nice.  Many people see wearing nice clothes as essential for establishing an image,  which is an indirect contribution to increased self esteem.\n2. People with higher self-esteem tend to be more confident and outgoing, which are qualities of charisma and charter. \n3. These are all factors that increase the likelihood of being successful, \n4. as a result of the increased productivity that comes with success.\n5. Therefore dressing well,  can help you enhance mood which can help you increase productivity.\n6. And, lastly, increased productivity may increase self esteem which can help you increase mood.\n7. This chain reaction can also be interpreted as a feedback loop between dressing well and mood, self esteem and productivity.\n8. Thus", "answer": "A: school children"}

There is not any use for \"turn lock\" here - to get home, you need to open a locked door so this phrase cannot go in as a valid option to this problem.\n7. Option D, 'pocket' is something that is done before leaving.\n8. Pocket does not require doing more work before leaving.\n9. Option A, 'turn lock' and C, 'open doors', have the same meaning.\n10. Therefore, out of those, there is only one option left.\n11. The only options left are B and E - option B, 'pocket' may be doing something that is not enough because you need to open the lock to go to your room, therefore, you need to open the door to go into your room, and when you went into your room, you may continue your actions. There are several cases in which having a key in your pocket doesn't necessarily mean you're ready to go home.\n12. On the other hand, option E: \u201copen the door\u201d, this works perfectly.

Out of the given options, 'turn lock' does not directly relate to the question; 'pocket' could refer to either opening a lock or storing the key.'solution to problem' implies that the key holder is in search of a solution to a problem but it does not describe the action explicitly. \n6. Similarly, 'open doors' does not directly relate nor describe the action. \n7. Therefore, 'open doors' and 'pocket' could be disregarded as the other options.\n8. The only remaining possible answers are B: 'turn lock' and C: 'pocket'.\n9. We disregard 'turn lock' because it is already implied that the actions were done and it does not explicitly describe the action of opening a door lock.\n10. Considering these conditions, the answer for this particular question must be C: pocket. \n11. Remember that the most important takeaway from a question is the information that is directly relevant to the answer. \n12. This means that this option is the most relevant to the context of the question, therefore, the correct answer must be C: pocket to open a lock or store the key.\nAnswer: C. pocket\n\nInput: Lights are usually found near what?

For the same reason, we can eliminate 'pocket';'solution to problem' and 'open doors'.\n7. 'Pocket' suggests that his next action to bike home was to put his key in his pocket. \n8. However, it is unlikely that he will have his next action ready in his pocket, i.e. bike home, as he has already left to do that.\n9. The last possibility is 'turn lock'. \n10. Turning the key is the most likely answer as a key is held to open an object to which it fits. However, 'turn lock' doesn't fit the context. \n11.

Turn key in a lock would mean \"to turn a key, wound a piece of string or a key, or otherwise move a latch or handle in the direction of home in order to unlock it\" which does not completely make sense in the context. \n6. The word \"open\" is directly associated with doors so it is more apt than open doors which covers other things such as \"windows\" even though it is mentioned in the choice options.\n7. Therefore we can most likely reason that \"He got out his key and opened the door\".\n8. This makes it more likely that he already opened the door but the question does not specify that, so let's add the qualifier, \"opened a door\" to the question.\n9. It now reads, He got out his key and what? Hence, the answer to this would be E: opened a door. \n10. This is logically because he got out the key and he either opened the door or he did something else. So he either is most likely unlocking it or did not open it. \n11. So the answer is E: opened the door.\nAnswer: E. opened the door\n\nInput: There are many foods to eat at restaurants.  What type of food do you like the most?

Choices;  A: take care of your neighbor B: go for a walk C: rest D: eat some jello E: go see a movie\nRationales: From the questions it is learned that: We feel sick.\nSickness is an emotional experience of physical discomfort. As the body becomes less tolerant of certain kinds of stressors or external or internal conditions, it begins to demonstrate its unhealthy condition. It becomes more visible to us or others than when we feel healthy.\nThere are different kinds of stressors which cause health issues. Some of them are nutrition-related, including foods with too much fat, protein, or carbohydrates. Imbalance of nutrients in the right amounts in our bodies can also trigger physical discomfort. So when feeling sick, the best thing we can do for ourselves is to take rest of the stressors on our body.\n\n1. The first thing to cross out is B: go for a Walk, which does not relate to sickness or self-care.\n\n2. Then, D: Eat some Jello, which does not help to deal with the stressors affecting our body, which is indicated by the given sentence.\n3. Also, D: Eat Some Jello does not mention anything about when the person is feeling sick, whereas, E: go see a Movie does, which makes the question invalid for E.\n4.

B: food: The statement is talking about a face, and food cannot get to a face. \n3. A: Make-up: The statement is in the present tense that includes the phrase I can't believe. 'can't believe' is associated with thinking and remembering the past.\n4. C: Dirt is too general.\n5. D: dandrufs is too general and in general it makes you feel bad.\n6.

There are two answers to the original question: Yes and No.\n2. We will look for the phrases that can be used to express these answers.\n3. When we break down the statement into these groups of phrase, we can see that A: I don' t agree is the correct choice, since this word order already appears", "answer": "E: airport"}

Open the doors is an action of leaving the house, and it's the most direct translation of the given sentence, so, it can be safely eliminated. However, the other choices aren't very logical, like using bike to open the lock or finding a solution to problem. \n6. Thus, we could safely conclude that he leaves the house by walking or bike riding.\n7. So, the answer, or action, is D: pocket.\nAnswer: D pocket\n\nInput: The problem is not that they don't know what to do, it's that they can't stop thinking about what? Choices: A. A task or subject matter B. An event or situation C. Nothing at all D. Their responsibilities E. Their worries\nRationales:1. Starting with the sentence, \"The problem is not that they can't get on with their job/work,\" you should deduce that 'they' is a group of people who are having a problem.\n2. If you continue to read the sentence up to the end, you will realize that it is talking about how the group is very uncomfortable with the task given.\n3. Now it's time to look at each choice and eliminate the ones that wouldn't align with the given context.\n4. We eliminate A. A task or a subject area as it does not involve the problem of a group of people that is referred to in the sentence, which could be seen as a contradiction. \n5. C. An event or situation is also disregarded because it doesn't match the context, as it isn't directly correlating with the group's task. \n6. D. Their responsiblities and E. Their worries are not very plausible either, because'responsibilities' and 'worries' can refer to all kinds of problems, so they aren't specific to the particular context. \n7. Finally, you can deduce that the answer is B. An event or a situation.\nAnswer: B. An event or an situation\n\n### Key: 1. Answer: D: thorough. 2. Answer: A: create art. 3. Answer: A: medium. 4.

(5) D: leave windows open at night also seems to suggest that they keep windows closed until nighttime.  Finally, E: Keeping the doors closed, means it is a specific action which implies that they keep doors closed most of the time which is related to the original. \n7.

Also B: turn lock is not a correct choice because he already has his key out, this means that he is ready to open the door.\n7. D: pocket would be a correct choice except the given statement \"got out his key\" suggests that he is already holding a key.\n8. C: pocket is a good choice as it stands out from the remaining options and it also does not conflict with the given statement.\n9.

Choices: A: situation\nB: world\nC: work\nD: science\nE: business\nRationales: The question asks the writer to assume what the expert in the field of technology believes. Then they go on to describe his view of the \"situation\".  This indicates that the \"situation\" can be understood in terms of the expert's expertise.\n1. Choice A: \"situation\" is not an appropriate term, as it refers to a specific situation or circumstance that occurs or is experienced. \n2. \"Business\" and \"science\" are also not appropriate terms, as neither of them is specific to expertise in the field of technology. \n3. \"Work\" and \"world\" are vague terms that do not provide a clear description of the expert's view.\n4. Therefore, the only appropriate term is choice C: \"field\".\nAnswer: C. field\n\nInput: John wants a bigger house. John must sell his house to get a bigger what? Choices: B: garage A: lawn C: home D: car\nRationales: First, we must decide whether to accept the premise of the question, that is John wants to buy a bigger and better house. \n2. Next, we analyze the term used in the question, specifically the word what. \n3. This term could refer to a house, a building, or a property.\n4.

Therefore these are the three remaining choices.\n7. The other two choices do not refer to turning, as it's the key that turns the lock. To \"turn\", is to do an action to change position or direction.\n8. Thus, we're left with D: pocket, as the choice describes the idea of turning as opposed to an action.\n9. Therefore, the answer choice is D: pocket.\nAnswer: D. pocket\n\nInput: How did the person know she was happy? If the answer is not A, the reason why is given.  If there are no other reasons, what will happen? Choices:  a. A: Her voice was up.  B: His hair was down.  C: His voice was up. D: Her hair was down.  E: her voice was too loud.\nRationales:\n1. The question is presented in the form of an information gap.\n2. The information that is missing provides an indication about the happiness of a person through their physical appearance.\n3. Therefore, we can safely assume that the question will be asking for the reason for their happiness or the reason why they were happy, as the statement already provides relevant information about their physical appearance.\n4. The given options are: his voice was up, his voice was up, her voice was too loud, her hair was down, his hair was down.\n5. Her voice was too loud and her hair was down are incorrect as options because they are already stated in the missing information, so we know they are the correct answers.\n6. The reason stated for her happiness is her happy voice, which is mentioned in options B and D.\n7. Option B is eliminated because option C has the incorrect spelling and word choice. His voice wasn't just \"up\", it would have to be \"raised\". \n8. Option D indicates that she had a \"low hair style\", which could be either a pigtail or a cut that is uneven around the bangs. Option D makes more sense because if she had a high hair style and was happy, she would have raised her hair rather than lowered it.\n9. Because the answer of option D is correct, option E is", "answer": "D: computer network"}

Out of all the options, 'turn lock' refers to the use of a key to open a lock, so the most plausible action is to use the key to open a lock.\n6. 'pocket' is another action a person can take to keep an item safe, but the option refers to a pocket, rather than the item itself, so option B: pocket can be eliminated.\n7. The question refers to beginning to open the lock, rather than having already done so. Therefore, option A: turn lock is the correct answer choice.\n8.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, and open doors.\n5. Out of all these options, solutions to problems or problems themselves are not things that are solved with using a regular key. Also, pockets are also not what the original question refers to, for they would suggest a person carrying a key in case he gets into a situation in which he needs it.\n6. This leads to C: solution to problem being an irrelevant option, and D: pocket is referring to a person's ability to put a key in their pocket, rather than actually doing something with it.\n7. Therefore the answer has to be B: turn lock.\nAnswer: B. turn lock\n\nInput: This man was ___ and ___ but he would not admit that. Choices:  A. a coward, kind B. a good man, modest C. a bragger, honest D. a criminal, guilty E. a scruffy man, greedy\nRationales: Start by finding the words which are being asked for. First try and understand what the phrases that follow say. \n2. Next pick an option(s) which fit in both the categories. \n3. If you can't come up with something, eliminate each of the options one by one on the following lines.  \n4. The Question has: a _(man)_ who was ___ and ___. The man can only be one of the choices given, and we can eliminate each one of them individually by the rules of Logical Reasoning. \n5. Try it on your own, using the same technique. \n6. The phrase: he was, suggests we are looking for a verb. \n7. 'kind' is an adjective, so we must look for a phrase suggesting a verb to show the man was like that. \n8. 'good' is an adjective as well, but we already knew that, so let's focus on'man' to continue as it is the keyword we are looking for. \n9. 'criminal' is also an adjective but it is not used well, we need a verb that suggests 'criminal'.\n10. The rest of the given options (including 'guilty' and'scruffy man') are all adjectives, not describing any verbs. \n11. The only thing that makes 'coward', '", "answer": "C: saturated with water"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, open doors, and pocket.\n5. \"Open doors\" does not directly answer the question of what he did next.\n6. So 'turn lock' is removed.\n7. \"Pocket\" does not directly answer what he did after turning the key unless it refers to his next action, which in this sentence is 'begin to open the door'. Also, given that \"began to\" is present for the action of opening the door, it cannot also be an action of 'turn'.\n8. \"Pocket\" is removed.\n9. Now, we are left only with the action of 'opening the door' and the phrase'solution to problem'.\n10. Solution to problem is the phrase that makes logical sense to use as his solution to the problem of what to do next.\nSo, the solution to the problem is the action of \"opening the door.\"\n11. There is no option 'open doors', since the sentence does not contain a second door.\n12. Since solving his problem was what he did afterwards and \"solution to\" and \"doors\" are synonymous, 'doors' cannot be removed.\n13. So, the answer we are left is 'Solution to problem'.\nAnswer: A: solution to problem\n\nInput: What is the value of a penniless man's word in a court of law, when the man's credibility is under question? Choices:  C: low  D: high E: irrelevant\nRationales: After noticing the context we get from the given statements, we can determine that the context is in a court of law and the question asks about the credibility of a man.  This man may not have money, so his credibility is under question.\n1. We remove options: B: negligible and A: nonexistent, these options do not have to do with credibility in this specific context.\n2. We keep options: D: high and E: irrelevant.\n3. There is no reason D: high would not be true, since it is not related to the man's financial status, and we keep option E: irrelevant.\n4. The options left are: D: high, and E: irrelevant. \n5. We notice that \"irrelevant\" and \"high\" do not make any logical sense together, as the", "answer": "E: government"}

{"text": ", pocket, and open doors.\n5. When we look at these actions, they involve a set of actions that begin with turning the key and ending with the resulting sound which is heard when the door is unlocked. Therefore the action of unlocking is the key action here.\n6. Moreover, the given options only suggest opening a lock, not the action of locking, unlocking, or turning the key.\n7. Hence the answer is A: turn lock.\nAnswer: A. turn lock\n\nInput: She told her husband how he could get into his new office. She said he should write and ask her to open his own mail box for a couple of hours. How could this help him to get in? Choices:  write A: in a letter B: email C: online D: on the phone E: online and by phone\nRationales: The first word of the question gives us the reason for his visit. \"He could get in his new office.\"\nThe sentence after that gives us the instructions which are not to go to the office until the specified time.\nNow consider the given choices. It could be possible that the husband got his own office, but could not open it. Then write an email explaining him how to open his office and send it to her so that she could open the office for him is the possible solution.\n1. Answer: B. It is more possible that he wrote an email explaining him how he could unlock and use the new office because it gives enough information to unlock the office for someone else. We are told that she will open his office because of a couple of hours. So, it is not a good choice to select it.\n2. Answer: A. The only thing mentioned in the question is how to get into his new office, and how the wife will open the office for a couple of hours after writing this letter for the husband. We know that the wife will write a letter for him, so it seems the right answer.\nAnswer: A - write a letter\n\nInput: Where does Snake Island get its name?

Choices:  A) making things B) getting stuff C) finding the thing D) opening things E) unveiling things\nRationales:  1. The question is \"When it comes to what,... some find it easier than...\" \n2. The word \"it\" refers to the preceding phrase, \"making things\". \n3. Thus \"finding the thing\" can be eliminated as a choice option, as it is more specific than \"making things\" \n4. However, the \"making things\" indicates that it is not something one has to be explicitly taught as it \"comes naturally\" to some people. \n5. This can then be linked to the \"opening things\" which suggests that some may be better than others (those that are naturally opening things).\n6. Therefore, \"opening\" can be used as an alternative choice for \"making\". \n7. Hence, answer D: opening things is correct.", "answer": "A: advisory"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. Turn lock is a common use of a key and does not necessarily involve opening a lock.\n6. Solution to problem is a vague notion that only indicates that a problem is involved because the person is carrying a key.\n7. Pocket is commonly used to store objects and does not necessarily involve performing any action.\n8. The remaining choice which most directly relates to opening a lock is D: open doors. \n9. So, the sentence could be read as \"He got out his key and started to open doors.\n10. However, this interpretation makes the sentence redundant because \"he got out his key\" implies that he opened the doors at that point in order to get into his house. \n11. Therefore, if a person is ready to bike home and gets out a key, he is expected to bike home and open the doors as soon as possible because he is ready to bike to home.\n12. This means that the sentence could be read more simply as: He got out his key and wanted to bike home and start to open his doors, instead of getting out his key and started opening doors.\n13. Since \"wanted\" implies that his action of getting out his key was done with intention, and then the next action of wanting to open the doors is implied to be taken as he begins those actions.\n14. Therefore, the person is opening doors. \n15. So, the answer choice is D: open doors, because he is doing what is most expected.\nAnswer: B. He gets out his key and wanted/started to open his doors\n\nInput: Your grandmother has been a widow all her life. She has a lot of what does not come from a husband?

Humans are the biggest source of demand for meat products, though some cows are over two years old. Dogs don\u2019t eat meat at all, unless they\u2019re forcefed. Cats don\u2019t eat as much, and generally only eat meat, but not as much as other animals. Cows don\u2019t eat humans. The answer is C, adults.\n\n### Input: Who should eat the least meat?

'Solve his problem' does not help him open the door, it simply refers to solving the general problem he was having.\n7. 'Open doors' is too broad a term that can be applied to opening any door.\n8. In addition, since he is already home ready to bike home we know we can deduce it is not for the door of the school.\n9. So, the choice that best describes the action he is performing is 'open his key'.\n10. So, the answer could be taken as one of A or B.\n11. However, since he is in front of the house locked and he is leaving home, the answer, by rule, must begin with A: turning the lock.\n\nAnswer: A: turn lock\n\nNext time you have to answer a multiple choice question, remember that you should do the following:\n\n- First, examine the question and understand what task you need to complete for that question.\n- Next, examine what is mentioned in the sentence and consider the possible options that may answer the given question.\n- Examine all the option, then eliminate those that are not relevant and leave the answer that is plausible and relevant.\n- Finally, ensure that the answer fits the context of the question and the context of the text to determine the meaning correctly.\n\n### How did John solve the problem?

It is clear that the image is that of a WWII B234 in a bad condition.\n2. It was crashed during a training mission to Shanghai and China from the Hawaii Islands, during a thunderstorm.\n3. Therefore, we know that the crash occurred on the 22nd of September 1944 - that is the original WWII plane crashed on the 22 September 1943.\n4. The given options of A, B, C, D and E are: Shanghai, China, San Francisco, California and Hong Kong, China respectively.\n5. However Hong Kong is close to Shanghai (in mainland China) and California is clearly not a location in China.\n6. We know from the date of the crash that 'Shanghai, China' can be disregarded. \n7. Since the given options are all in China, the question can be interpreted as 'what location other than China is described in the image?'\n8. Since the image is that of an aircraft in a bad condition from a thunderstorm which has crashed somewhere, we can eliminate 'San Francisco, California - San Fransisco cannot be the location, as it describes the condition of the aircraft as 'bad' and therefore it is unrelated to the description of a place where an aircraft crashed.\n9.

Choices: A: your name B: where you're from C: how long it's been D: their age E: what they do\nRationales:  1. The given statement says that there is a great way to make friends while traveling. A way is a means, and therefore, an action is taken and implemented.\n2. Looking at the question part, it asks what is a great way to do this. In order to choose the best answer, the phrase needs to be broken into what the \"action of asking\" is asking.\n3. Among the given options, asking for your name, where you're from, and how long it's being are all ways to get acquainted with a person, by learning specific and personal information.\n4. However, \"asking their age\" doesn't give any information about a person, rather, it limits the age of the person you meet and can seem rude, or even invasive.\n5. The most plausible way of getting acquainted is asking them what they do. A person is often proud of their career and job, and by asking what they do, you are engaging in an informal conversation with this person.\n6. This is why the correct choice is E. Asking what they do.\nAnswer: E. Asking what you do\n\nInput: The man with the slingshot was tired.

However, pocket does not work as an option as lock keys aren't usually stored in a person's pockets. \n7. Likewise, opened doors are inconsistent with a person's preparation to bike home; rather, they would only suggest that the person had already successfully arrived home.\n8. There is only one choice, which means the person 'began to'.\n9.

The question describes a cynical woman who believes that the world is conspiring to do something.\n2. This indicates a perception that the world works against her.\n3. 'conspiring to ruin her life' is an example of how the entire world can work against a cynical woman.\n4. Therefore, the cynical woman has the belief that the whole world is conspiring to ruin her. \n5. The given options imply that the cynical woman could be tricked, get something to drink, and have her life ruined, but no other options suggest that the world is conspirning to ruin her.\n6.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. Turn lock is not an option, as the action of opening the lock is implied.\n6. Solution to problem is not an option either, as it is not implied by getting out the key.\n7.

However, in the context of the question, it is clear that he was getting out his key for the purpose of using it to unlock something. \n9. Therefore, this is not a valid option, indicating that he is likely to open doors with his key.\n10. Now, consider the choices left and pick E: open doors as the most plausible and logical option. \n11. Out of his options, pocket makes the least amount of sense as he would have no reason to do so in relation to unlocking a door, and the action of opening doors can also be easily implied by the getting out of the key.\n12.

Choices: A: plucking strings B: singing C: plucking D: picking E: strumming\nRationales: We can analyze this question in two stages. \nFirst, look for the terms that need to be identified as the most important (here: \"create\"). Then, look for the terms related to these. The two terms I found: \"what\" and \"music.\"\n1. First, note \"by what.\" This is the most important term as it is the predicate. If we put \"by\" into the predicate and start filling in the blank, we have: An x creates music by [whatever].\n2. We can eliminate terms here that are irrelevant (sorry Singers!). So we have left \"plucking,\" \"picking,\" \"strumming,\" and \"pating.\"\n3. \"plucking\" and \"picking\" both indicate the motion of causing something to move in two places (i.e. both words are verbs), whereas strumming and pating (patting?!) do not. So, \"plucking\" & \"picking\" are out.\n4. But what about strumming", "answer": "C: fun"}

However, a bike lock cannot work without a key.\n7. So, both those options are discarded as the answer. \n8. Option D, which says 'pocket' can be eliminated as a duplicate answer.\n9. Therefore, the final and correct answer is E: open doors.\nAnswer: E-open doors\n\nInput: She likes a big party.  What term describes her? Choices:  big-hearted B: noisy C: out-spoken D: boisterous E: energetic\nRationales:1. 'She likes a big party' represents the idea that she enjoys the big party.\n2. It is the first part of the statement where the question is asking for an answer to describe this concept.\n3. Out the of the given choices, out of the given options, one which describes an action of being 'energetic', rather than that of enjoying.\n4.

Choices:  A. save it B. put it in bank C. buy something D. lose it E. spend it\nRationales: The given statement gives us the insight that someone gave her money today.\nFrom the given choices, we understand that the options that mean saving or putting her money into a bank are not what she does.\n1. Because she receives the money today.\n2. Hence, she most likely uses up the money soon.\n3. Thus, the options that suggest her to spend her money or lose her money are also not logical.\n4. Thereby, this leaves us with only D and E that are the remaining options.\n5. The option E means spend it.\n6. However, it is not enough to solve our problem completely. \n7. Hence, option D becomes the best answer.\n\nAnswer: D- Do something with it. She just received the money.\n\nInput: She was out of breath.  Why? Choices:  air B:", "answer": "D: rose garden"}

However, none of the choices are associated with the action of opening any given doors.\n7. Only the last choice is correct: open doors; because, at the end, he began to open doors.\n8. The purpose of a lock is to keep something inside contained, while a key is used to open something, this is true most of the time.\n9. So, opening doors or some type container is the correct choice in the given options.\nAnswer: E; open doors\n\nInput: The girl lost her way in the cave, what did she need to do to find her way out? Choices:  (A: make a fire)B: ask for help (C: get help D: get lost (E: find her way back\nRationales: Question: The girl lost her ways in the cave; therefore, she needs assistance in order to find her way out of the cave.\nB. Ask for help: Help can be gotten by asking for help, but she does not need help in order to find her ways back.\nE. Find her way back: We can infer that the girl lost her ways in a way that she would not be able to find her way back.\nA. Make a fire: Making a fire requires the gathering of wood, or the building of a fire in order to light a fire. This would help her to find her way back as she would know the direction from which and to which way the shadows would be cast. \nD. Get lost: Getting lost requires her to be disorientated, she is not disoriented as she was following her way and therefore she could not have gotten lost.\nC. Get help: This helps in getting assistance in finding your way out of the cave, which is not what the girl needs.\nAnswer: B; Ask for help\n\nInput: Billy told his wife to \"fix dinner\".

Therefore 'pocket' is not suitable for the question.\n7' pocket' however, can refer to the action of collecting something in your pocket. \n8. Pocket can refer to a place or a thing. \n9. So, out of the remaining options, only 'begin to' holds a logical connection to his opening a lock.\n10. It is the act of beginning to do something.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to a problem, opening doors, and pocket. \n5. Turning lock makes the least sense as it is the first phrase of the question and it does not seem to be the intended action. \n6. As for solution to a problem, this is unlikely to be the intended action as it would only relate to biking home; not opening the lock.\n7. Opening doors is a similar choice and is also unlikely to be the intended answer as it would only apply to an entrance.\n8. This leaves us with two choices: pocket and pocket, which seem to be two different versions of the same verb. \n9. We can also eliminate pocket as a choice, as it is the only choice that suggests the action of storing, which does not directly result in opening the lock.\n10. So, from the context, it is most likely that the person was holding or in possession of his or her key. \n11. Therefore, we choose C: possession.\nAnswer: C. possession\n\nInput: Is it possible for an object to be less than equal to five? Choices:  All except: A,C and D. E is the best answer\nRationales: First, we look at the given statement.\n1. The person is asking if it is possible for an object to have a value below 5.\n2. The given statement does not contain any value numbers, so this means that values of 5 or more are out of the question and it is more likely an object could be less than any number value.\n3. In fact, the given options of A to C seem to exclude all numbers above 1.\n4. These options do not make sense as they cannot be true since the possible value can't be 0 or negative because 0 and negative do not have the same value which the given sentence states that an object must be equal or less than five.\n5. Next, we look at the remaining choices.\n6. However, it does not seem to make sense for an answer to be 'No' or 'Yes' because it is an either-or statement. We have been specifically told that we must exclude all values above 5.\n7. There is no way that an object can only be equal or less than 5. There are in fact many values that are not equal to 5.\n8. This means that E is the best answer", "answer": "A: depressed"}

A: 'It's alright' is generally used to denote the state of acceptance or agreement of something or someone.\n2. B: 'I am hungry' is not a statement but an instruction. It is an imperative sentence and would not be used as a response to a phrase or statement.\n3. C: 'There are more options for luch' is more of a statement that would need to be followed by additional details or information. It could be a statement that would be used to express options but it would require some additional information like a particular restaurant, food item, location etc.\n4.

Then looking closer at option C: solution to problem, this refers to finding a solution to a problem, which is not directly involved with keys.\n7. So, out of the given options, what remains is A: turn lock.\n8. The person must then turn the lock in order to open the door, which will allow them to leave the building.\n9.

The other choice with key is pocket. There's no difference of the purpose between one's choice to turn lock and the other to pocket.\n7. This leaves with: solution to problem and open doors.\n8. However, a solution to a problem requires a key and the question tells us that he already had his key. Therefore, a solution to a question doesn't require a key. Hence, one can conclude that he wasn't ready to bike home because he didn't have his key or that he did have to key.\n9. This leaves with pocket.\n10. Since it requires no key, it could be a correct response to the task.\n11.

It also implies that dress styles are influenced by nationality to an extent.\n3. Out the four given options provided, \"like you\" would suggest a person being a part of the same country and adopting the same style, whereas \"like everyone\" suggests uniformity of style. \n4. \"in our place\" is also used to suggest uniformity of style, but because of the use of \"our\", it is specific to that nation.\n5. \"In other places\" would imply that they have uniformity of fashion; not because of cultural influence, but because of being the same nationality. \n6. Out of the four given options, these would make sense to people who are within that respective nation.\n7. Therefore an option between \"in our place\" and \"like everyone\" is the most plausible, and the answer is A: \"like everyone\"", "answer": "D: garden"}

Pocketing his key could be his goal if he is looking for a place to keep it. \n7. However, this is not a certainty and does not make sense in light of the rest of the statement.\n8. Opening the door is a similar possibility, but again, this does not necessarily contribute to his goal. \n9. Therefore, pocketing the key most likely means that his goal is to lock his bike in a secure spot - which makes the answer A: turn lock.\nAnswer: A\n\nInput: The dog was running a race, what was it doing when he passed by the first person? Choices:  * A: biting * B: looking around * C: smiling * D: staring * E: yelling\nRationales: The question part states that the dog was running a race when he passed by the person.\nThe given options are A: biting, B: looking around, C: smiling, D: staring and E: yelling.\n\nA: biting suggests that it was a ferocious bark that made the person stop. \n\nB: looking around suggests that the dog was sniffing around for a specific object/person.\n\nC: smiling suggests that the dog was friendly while showing its teeth. However, such an action cannot affect the person from stopping. Since \"run\" implies that both parties are moving in the same direction, then the person cannot be scared, and such an action cannot stop the dog from continuing to run.\n\nD: staring suggests that the dog was focusing its attention on a specific object or person. While this could frighten a person, it does not necessarily make them stop. The question and the given options do not give any indications to the context, and the given options can range greatly. As such, staring is not necessarily the correct action.\n\nE: yelling implies that the dog shouted or talked in a way that could frighten the person. But this would not necessarily result from passing by the person. The action could occur if the dog had been staring, as the person would then be frightened of it.

In this case, the person is the mechanic, whom the car owner is entrusting to clean it.\n\n1. According to the given statement, the mechanic will leave the car somewhere and will also take away some laundry.\n2. From the options, there are two choices related to the washing of clothes, and one each to the cutting of hair and hair care (barber and hair salon respectively).\n3. 'Barber' or 'hair salon' are related to cutting or washing hair, which is not necessary for cleaning a car. \n4. For the dry cleaners and clothing store, the given description of 'what the mechanic would take' excludes this,  as cleaning a car would not qualify as either (they are related to dry cleaning and storing clothes respectively).\n5. Therefore, out of the options and considering the relationship between the given description and the options, there is only one option not mentioned in the given statement, which is \"dry cleaners\".\n6. As an explanation to the mechanic leaving a car and some laundry with the dry cleaner, it seems logical that the mechanic would leave a car that he had been maintaining for someone else and leave clean clothes made by the said person.\n7.

The other option is 'open doors'.\n9. However 'open doors' is vague. In case of a house, he can open multiple doors without a key, and can lock again before he leaves.\n10. In addition, if he was riding a bike, the doors weren't even options for opening and closing. \n11. Thus, the action of opening a door isn't an appropriate representation of the use of the key, for it to be a key.\n12. So, we can eliminate B: pocket as well.\n13.

Choices: \tA: he is trustworthy B: he is cautious C: he is accurate D: he is a perfectionist E: he is a careful thinker\nRationales: A careful thinker who has good judgment would likely be precise and thorough.\nIt would be in Aaron's best interest to do a good job so as to avoid criticism and embarrassment.\nA careful thinker who has the patience and fortitude to do something in detail is likely to be a perfectionist.\nAaron did a good job since he did it in a way that is best for him.\nAaron has integrity so he should be trustworthy.\nA careful think would probably be attentive to detail and be trustworthy. A perfectionist is one of the most trustworthy people because they strive to be the best.\nCareful thinking is always trustworthy because it considers consequences.\nHe takes the time to do a good job, which shows he is a careful think, a perfectionist, and a trustworthy person.\nAnswer: E.

The statements begin by telling us that somebody would call my mom \"crazy\". Craziness is a broad term that can mean a lot of different things. 2. The question part of the statement asks us to choose the word that most closely describes what the other person thinks. 3. The only four options given are cat, shirt, dog, and rabbit. So, all of the other animals must have been discarded because they cannot be considered options. 4. Cat would be an appropriate choice if the person thought my mom was crazy because she was obsessed with cats. 5. Shirt seems like an odd choice. If the person thought my mom were crazy, they must have thought that my mom was obsessing over shirts in an unhealthy way. 6. Dog, like cat, would be a correct choice if the person thought she was crazy because she is excessively obsessed with dogs. 7. Rabbit is probably an inappropriate choice because it is an even more obscure object than a shirt. 8. \"Crazy\" implies a wide range of potential reasons and a diverse array of different objects can represent things that are crazy. 9.

Which one? Choices:  red, yellow, green, blue, pink, orange, white, magenta\nRationales:\n\n1. First, we read the entire list of given colors to determine what does and does not belong in an interior decorating.\n2. This leaves us with colors that could potentially be used in an interior decorating with the exception of magenta, as magenta is more often a color associated with clothing.\n3. Yellow and green are colors typical of sunshine.\n4. White and pink can be used if a neutral look is desired.\n5. Lastly red and orange are used to draw attention to a room.\n6. Red and orange could be used, but most likely not in any room that is looking to use neutral tones, and neither of these colors would be used in a book that is trying to draw attention to the room. \n7. There is only one possible answer - the answer is yellow.\n8. Answer: The answer is _______. (Yellow - 1st Answer)\nInput: It is easy to take advantage of people. Which is the easiest? Choices:  a: to cheat people in a game of poker B: to get away with robbing a grocery store C: to hire a person and take advantage of him D: to buy some stock but hide its real value E: to promise something you do not intend to fulfill\nRationales: In consideration of the statement of the question, which includes the term \"to take advantage\", the general answer is in fact 'C: to hire a man and take advantage of him'.\nThe correct answer, however, is 'B: to get away with robbery'. This follows from logical reasoning: 'Hiring a man that one can take advantage of' and 'promising", "answer": "B: have fun"}
{"text": ", solution to problem, pocket, opening doors, and pocket.\n5. Turning a lock is not specific to opening a door.\n6. Likewise, a solution to a problem does not necessarily involve getting a key out. \n7. Therefore, among the five given options, it is likely that he only got out his key to open the door.\n8. However, the options 'pocket' and 'opening doors' can coincide with it, making them two viable options as well.\n9. Of the options that directly relate to the opening of a door using a key, the one that is most plausible fits the context of the given statement perfectly.\n10. Therefore, the option the most logical choice is D: pocket, meaning 'to get out of (to produce by, from, or with something).\n11. The question then refers to what he did once he got his key.\n12. When you get out a key, your solution to the problem of getting a door unlocked and open is already on you.\n13. So, what he does immediately after is to open the door.

'Pocket' is simply a container, while'solution to problem' could be applicable to the given context, although the given words 'turn lock' and 'pocket' do not match together. \n7. 'Open doors' seems like the best possible answer as it is the only one that directly relates the given action ('getting out his key and beginning') to the answer ('bike-riding') by implying that the key was used to open the door of his bike.\n8.

Choices: A:  talking B: giving a present C: laughing D: sharing a meal E: sharing a snack\nRationales: In this input, notice that the question and answer options can be reworded in the following ways: \"What did the man start doing after he shared his snack with the girl?\" and \"After he shared his snack, what did he start doing with the girl?\"\n1. The man is sitting in a park, which means that the act of sitting down could have been the first action that the man did in this situation.\n2. Next, we know he had his sandwich, and that a girl approached him.\n3. When he had his sandwich (that is, he was eating it), suddenly, the girl approached him,\n4. and to whom he started... (sharing it? talking? laughing? giving a present? - the exact answer is included in the sentence).\n5. Taking away the extra words does not significantly change the meaning of the sentence, and as a result, the best answer should fit the same word count.\n6.

Choices:  a: it gives them a way to discriminate b: it gives them an opportunity to make friends c: it gives a thorough background check d: it gives them confidence e: it gives them a reason to meet\nRationales: The given options describe the police's actions towards potential officers. The question asks why the police would do this in the first place, so we should look at the given options from a different angle.\n\n1. The option A: gives them a way to what?\n\n   Gives them - a passive way to do something (e.g. Give someone something they want).\n  them - a 3rd person way of saying they.\nwhy - is a subject and predicate - It answers the question \"why\" does one part of the sentence relate to another.\n\n2. The option could be interpreted as giving a passive hint of discrimination, which would not be desirable in this context.\n\n3. The option B: gives them an opportunity to what?\n\nGives them - a passiv e way to do something (example given above).\n\nthem - a third person way of saying they\n\na lot of - how much information is being requested from applicants.\n\nanswer - an action performed by the police, referring to the choice of asking applicants many questions.\n\n4. We could say a lot of questions is a lot, however this is subjective and could be considered an unfair way of assessing someone (since someone could easily be asked two questions and the other could be asked fifty). This makes the answer option C: give them a thorough background check.\n\n5. Option D: it gives them confidence can be ruled out, because this would refer to the police being confident in their ability to recruit the best of the applicants.\n\n6.

Since the statement does not provide much information, it is most likely related to the action of opening a door, which in this case refers to key in an automobile/car lock. \n6. So he got out his key to open his vehicle's door.\n7. This means that we should reject options B: pocket, E: open doors, as they do not directly relate to the action of bike home.\n8. Out of the remaining three choices, A: turn lock is unnecessary as he has gotten out his key already, while option C: solution to problem is vague and does not directly address his action of opening the automobile's door.\n9. Therefore, the answer must be option, D: open doors.\nAnswer: D open doors\n\nInput: Who would need this product?  It has a simple design, which means that this product is probably designed for? Choices:  I: people who can't afford to shop somewhere else  II: people who have trouble seeing  III: a niche market  IV: people looking for a bargain  V: no one\nRationales:  1. First, the product has a simple design which would indicate that it is more basic or lower tier than the higher end products targeting premium markets.\n2. Next, the people using the product need not necessarily be able to afford to shop elsewhere, but the design of the product will be something that they can purchase easily and quickly, which brings up the idea of looking for a bargaining purchase.\n3. Since this product comes with a simple design and its purpose is to be affordable to customers looking for bargains in stores, it can be safely assumed that this product would probably be selling in a market aimed toward households with lower incomes or those looking to purchase an affordable product within their budget.\n4. Thus, we can conclude that answer would be B: a niche market. \n5. Eliminate C: people with trouble seeing as they would not need a basic product with a simple design to solve a vision problem.\n6. Also eliminate D: no one since this would be a contradiction to the fact that there is a problem this simple product is trying to address.  \nAnswer: B. a niche market", "answer": "A: cook dinner"}

Then we can eliminate pocket, as it is more specific and unlikely to occur in the given context.\n7. We also eliminate open doors as it's not the action of getting out of the house.\n8. Out of the remaining two choices, A: turn key B: pocket, there is a higher probability to answer A: turn key because the statement talks about him beginning to do an action, which is usually after he takes the key out.\n9.

D. megacity 5. E. city state\nRationales:1. The statement indicates that the city has four million people.\n2. If we use the fact that cities are commonly known as \"Metro\", then \"city with four million people\" is an abbreviation of the word \"Metropolitan\", which can be interpreted as the actual city.\n3. Metropolitan is a specific type of city, it's not a category.\n4. Megalopolis may have similar characteristics and a large number of people to Metropolitan, but it does not imply the idea of a big city.\n5. This leaves us with Megacity and City state, but Megacity doesn't necessarily indicate people's numbers. \n6. The question is directly asking for what you call a city with a certain number of people.\n7. City State is a small country, with or without people, which makes it inapplicable.\n8. Also, Megacity does not mean a city with a specific number of people, as it is an unrelated word to the question.\n9. Thus, the answer most likely is C: metropolitan which means large, important or populous.\nAnswer: C metropolitan\n\nInput: He is an honest fellow,  When he is told about the crime he commits, he always says  that the victim did the same to him at some other time.

Choices: \tA: drain B: annoy C: disturb D: excite E: stimulate\nRationales:  1. The question asks about the meaning of the word 'thrive' as found in the phrase 'Lives in a big metro do not thrive on me'.\n2. The given words are arranged as 'Living in a great metro does not thieve on me', with a misspelling of 'thrive'.\n3. To understand the phrase's meaning we should examine the definitions of the word 'thieve' along with its synonyms before making an informed choice from the following answers and choices.\n4. The word 'thrive' originates from two words, 'thrive' and 'live' and in the sentence, '...big metro...', we see the use of the word 'live' which means, do not live, be done with, give up, and quit.\n5. In addition, 'big metro' can also refer to a very chaotic and busy place, which gives us a hint of where the misused word comes from.\n6. 'Thrive' means 'to do well in existence, thrive, succeed, prosper, do well, do good, and advance'.\n7. So, according to this definition of 'thrive', the phrase 'Living large does not thrive on one' does not make sense.\n8. Therefore, the word 'thrive', as used in the sentence 'Living large does thrive on me', takes on the meaning of 'to succeed, prosper, and do well.' and refers to the phrase", "answer": "E: feelings"}
{"text": ", pocket, open doors, and pocket.\n5. Out of all the options given, 'turn lock' most likely refers to a lock, whereas 'pocket' generally means storing an object or placing it in another container such as another pocket or bag.\n6. 'Pocket' can also refer to someone's speech, but given the context, this is less likely.\n7. Finally, the term 'open doors' can imply opening a door, but we can also interpret this as referring to something unrelated like an open door for opportunity, so eliminate this option.\n8. With that in mind, 'open doors' is not the most appropriate choice, as we can conclude that the question is asking for a synonym of 'open' (meaning to unlock the door).\n9. Therefore, if he had a key, he would most likely unlock his door or 'open doors' with a key.\n10. So, the answer and the most logical choice is B: turn lock. The choice D: pocket is incorrect since pocket does not directly relate to opening or unlocking any doors.\nAnswer: B : turn lock\n\nInput: Mary is trying to keep her kids quiet while they wait to see Santa at the mall.

C: a short loud sound 4. D: be silent 5. E: make a fuss\nRationales: Start by considering the question. \"What does the word'shout' mean in this sentence?\"  \n1. Shout is used in a child-centered context, so we might expect them to do something like screaming or shouting loudly. However, the other choices don't seem accurate.\n\n2. Shout is typically used to tell somebody something. However, in this context, it doesn't seem accurate and 'tell somebody' only requires shout if it's used as a verbal order to someone. \n\n3.. There is a similar choice, scream, which also requires shout, but isn't commonly used as such. \n\n4.

The third option is not something he can do when he is already ready: he will have to ride his bike.\n7. The fourth option refers to not pocketing something, which is not possible after opening the door, thus eliminating 'pocket'.\n8. The correct option in this context is the last one: 'pocket solution to problem'. If the bike were lost, the solution would be to find it rather than to pocket it immediately. \n9. Therefore, if he were ready to bike home and got his key, it implies that he has a solution to a problem and may pocket it.\n10.

Choices: A: buying a bill board B: buying a credit card C: buying a check D: purchasing a magazine E: purchase a voucher\nRationales:1. The given statement: \"in the future, a person may pay for a car by purchasing a voucher\" provides us with a broad description of a new payment method that could involve vouchers.\n2. Therefore, we can exclude buying a check on the basis that it is a paper document used as an official receipt for payment.\n3. Also, purchasing a magazine isn't mentioned anywhere in the statement, so it is logically incorrect to consider it as an option.\n4. Buying a bill board is not the same as buying a voucher, so it can be excluded as an option.\n5. Purchasing a credit card is already considered a common form of payment and buying a vouchers may be an alternative method to a credit card, though the statement itself doesn't explicitly describe it as an alternative.\n6. Hence, out of all the options given, purchasing a vouchers appears to be the most logical choice for future car payment as the statement indicates.\n\nAnswer: E: purchase a vaucher\n\nInput: He's the master of his own home, what is he called?

Choices:  what A: bravery B: compassion C: inspiration D: empathy E: intelligence\nRationales: The first part of the question states that his grandfather is telling stories to inspire children, then it asks us to determine which of the given qualities is the most important quality of a good leader.\n\n1. Bravery: this is the first quality the question suggests, but it does not match the given task because the task asks us to find the quality of a good leader and grandfather's stories may provide inspiration, but they do not necessarily offer leadership skills.\n2. Compassion: a good leader is compassionate and has empathy for their followers, but again, these qualities do not appear in great detail in the given sentence, and they are not the only qualities.\n3. Inspiration: it is difficult to infer the meaning of this word and compare it to the given ones, so it is best to omit it from the options.\n4.

In addition, the choice of bike is vague so it is not possible to determine what he was planning to do.\n8.

For every choice in the choices list, ask this: does it have a'man-made' part to it?\n\nE: gold doesn't have a'man-maid' part to it.\n\nB: wood, even though it is a man-made material, it does not exist in the scope of the original question, which seeks all man-made materials that exist in the present.  Therefore, we should eliminate B: wood.\n\nChoice D: clay has a'man-made', but the word clay has been added to it.  'Clay' is man-made, but it is a specific material within the scope of the original scope.  Also, there doesn't seem to be any reference to any man-made process in clay, so elimination is best.\n\nChoice D is now removed and we are left with 3 choices, E: steel that isn't relevant and B: wood.\nTherefore, according to the context and nature of this question, our best logical choice is E: steel.\n\nAnswer:  E: steel\n\nInput: The word 'in' means inside,  but what does the word 'on' mean?

Finally, the last option (B: pocket) is somewhat ambiguous in that it doesn't specify the use of the pocket.\n8. This leaves us with the best option (C: solution to problem).\n9. As the sentence states, the key implies the action of opening a door, thus the solution to the problem is most likely to open the door. \n10. Thus, answer C: the solution to the problem.\nAnswer: C Soluition to problem\n\n### Instructions:Create a multi-part problem set similar to the one you just answered.\n\n### Answers\nAnswer:  \n\n### Demystification:\n1. The question is quite straightforward. The first part is asking to select an option from the set of choices. Hence, choose option A, and the second part is asking to answer a question about the given statement. Therefore, choose option E.\n2. This question is very similar to the first one. All the questions require a simple selection and answering of questions.\n\n### Notes:\n1. This question has a simple set of choices, you just need to select one. You should be able to choose any one to satisfy the requirements.\n2. The given statement (A: careful B: thoughtfull C: complete D: thoughtful) basically says \u00a8John examined the corpse with care\u00a8 since all the options mention thoroughness rather than care.\n3. This question requires you to understand what the given statement says before selecting the option that is the most suitable to the question.\n4. Pay attention to the context and select the most sensible option.\n5. Be careful when reading questions related to creativity. It\u00b4s easy to interpret it and get stuck with ideas that might not be in synergy with the question.\n6. This question is quite easy if you understand what the options are about. Choice A: create art is about creative works of art that go beyond the common. So if we use this word to describe creativity, the answer", "answer": "A: cause death"}

Pocket and open doors both refer to the action of opening a door, however, we can conclude that turn lock and bike home do not mention any activity associated with opening a door. \n6. Solution to problem and bike home refer to solving/completing his goal (bike home).\n7. Therefore, we can deduce that the correct option is the one that completes the action of getting the key out, which is B: turn lock.\nAnswer: B turn lock\n\nInput: Her job requires her to understand the needs of clients.  She is very hard- working and she is very good at her job.  What would her coworkers say about her? Choices:  I. She is a good person II. She has a strong work ethic III. She is ambitious IV. She gets along well with the people she works with V. She is a friend to everyone VI. She is compassionate\nRationales:1. The question refers to the person's coworkers.\n2. Her coworkers would describe her as if she has done something she has to do, and also she has a strong work ethics.\n3. According to one of the given options, \"she gets along well with her coworker\", that is because this person is a friend to everyone.  She is generous and compassionate.\n\n### Difficult Question\n\nInput: Which of the following statements is not correct? Choices:  Some children find drawing a challenge.  They would prefer to play a video game as drawing can be hard.  Some might feel discouraged when they see the drawings of more advanced artists. An art class requires some basic skill and lots of practice.  There are many good art books and videos that can help children improve\nRationales1. The question mentions several statements that are either not true or not correct.\n2. We don't need to worry about whether all the statements are true or false because they will mention this as an option.\n3. The correct statement is: \"Art class requires some basic skill\" because the class already starts with some basic skill and it requires students to have lots of practice. Other statements are also true like the others.\n4. Other statements can be understood well.\n5. But there is", "answer": "D: grief"}

Choices:  O A: wire C: magnet B: string D: sponge E: handle\nRationales:\n1. Asking which object would one need to clean the inside of blender.\n2. If one uses a wire, blender can come to a grinding halt when one tries to operate it.\n3. Magnets may be helpful but not required.\n4. String may be useful to extract stray parts, but is not strictly necessary.\n5. Some models are self-clean, while others are dishwasher safe. \n6. Sponge is not what one would use to clean on the inside of the blender, as it would likely stain and damage.\n7. Some models of blenders have hard plastic or metal surfaces, in which case, handle would be used to wipe off the residue.\n8. The answer is D: handle. \nAnswer: D handle\n\nInput: He ate a fruit salad yesterday,  now he has a upset stomach.  What is the cause? Choices:  C: eating fruit A: the upset stomach B: bacteria C: sugar D: too much food\nRationales: He felt sick after eating, so what is the cause? \n1. The answer must be something he ingested as the upset stomacg was caused after he ate a salad yesterday.\n2. He felt sick, so there must be something to eat that caused it.\n3. The stomacch cannot cause this, because if he felt sick, it means he ate something yesterday before he got this upset stomach\n4. So what we have left are the options: Eating fruit, the bacteria, sugar, too much food.\n5. Option C: eating fruit. The fruit salad he ate yesterday could have been too much food in general.\n6. The fruit salad of yesterday can have upset", "answer": "B: fun"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. Out of this list, only pocket and open doors contain the word 'pocket' or 'pocketing'.\n6. Turn lock and solution to problem do not actually contain relevant or applicable information to the given scenario. \n7. Open doors can be used if the intention was to unlock a location without necessarily turning the key or keying the lock. \n8. So, the option containing the word 'pocketing' or 'pocket' are B: pocket and E: open doors.\n9. If we eliminate any options that do not refer to a physical action or process, it boils down to a choice between 'pocket' and 'open doors'.\n10. As 'Open doors' does not refer to an actual process of physically opening a door, and 'pocket' can refer to the process of putting an object into a pocket, 'pocket' is the best fit for the context.\n11. Therefore, the correct answer is E: open doors, and the correct phrase is \"open doors\", not \"open a door\".\nAnswer: E: open doors\n\nInput: A barking dog is making an alarming noise, what can be made of the sounds it is what? Choices: A: mute B: drown C: interrupt D: change E: silence\nRationales:  1. The question is based on a dog barking.\n2. There are a variety of sounds a dog can make that can be defined by their intensity and pitch.\n3. A dog's howling can range from a low-intensity monotone to a high-intensity warble. \n4. In the same vein, a dog's bark can be quiet, loud, shrill, or high-pitched. \n5. The dog making this noise is barking and it is making an altercation noise.\n6. Therefore the dog's howling and barking will most likely be what can be described as a 'high-intensity warbling howl'.\n7. Out of all the sounds, the one that refers to a high-intesity warbling howl is D: change.\n8. This matches with the statement as barking is known to be a high-intensitity sound.\n9.

We cannot rule out choice A: 'turn lock' because it may fit the context if he has forgotten to lock the door already, however, he got out his 'key' earlier in the sentence.\n6. Now we can rule out choices B: 'pocket' and D: 'open doors'.\n7. He has already got his key and is not yet outside of the house.\n8. He has already got out the key and has already turned the 'lock', so choice E:'solution to problem' is likely the right answer.\n9. The solution to the problem of getting locked out is typically to search for a key.\nAnswer: E. solution to problem\n\nInput: The student is looking a job. He applied at several places, but the result was what? Choices: A: a no-go B: a disaster C: a success D: a break E: a lucky strike\nRationales: The given statement says that the student applied at several places for a job.  A job application is an action taken by students when they wish to apply for a job.\nTherefore, the question becomes, what did the student experience after sending all the applications?\nAmong the options given, we can disregard A: a no- go because sending out job applications isn't usually considered a \"no go\".\nWe can also disregard B: a disaster because it doesn't seem right to use a negative term such as \"disaster\" for what is likely a positive experience.\nD: a break is a little too vague here as while it could refer to a positive thing, we cannot say for sure unless given further clues on which to base our answer.\nAnd similarly E: a lucky  strike is also vague here as it doesn't suggest an outcome one way or the other, it could be about the luck of it, or more likely could be about the job offer.\nThe only other option left is the right answer C: a success which could be about the student finding a very good position or just about finding something suitable.\nAnswer: C. a success", "answer": "B: woods"}

Now looking at the plausibility of the given choices, it seems the case that he can't turn the lock as he is unlocking the bike to ride it.\n6. Therefore the most plausible options would be open doors or start riding. \n7. Opening a door by unlocking the lock, and then starting to ride the bike can be plausibly understood as one action in this context, so the answer should be B: open doors.\nAnswer: B. open doors.\n\nInput: What did Jasmine learn from the lesson? Choices:  S1: She knew some more facts about science S2: This class helped her understand science S3: Some scientific facts S4: She was interested more in science S5: She didn't find science difficult\nRationales: Choices 1-5 are possible correct answers. The answer would depend on the specific lesson learned by Jasmine. \nAnswer: Choice 1, S1: She knew more facts about science, and Choice 4, S5: She didn\u2019t find science difficult \nAnswer: S1: She knew the facts about science \nS2: This class helped Jasmine find science easier\nAnswer: S1 and S2: She learned more about science and found science easier\n\nNote:\n\nIt's important to note that for Part 1, you need to have the correct grammatical placement of the words. For example, if the questions says \"Basketball was a boy's game.\", you need to put the answer \"Basketball was a {boy's} game.\", note in your reasoning that you have to follow grammatical rules for the answer choices.\n\n### Part 2 Awaress & Understanding\n\nThe aim of part 2 is to make you recognize the correct words needed for the sentence. You need to be flexible with word choice. For example, the question may ask for \"A\" or \u201can\u201d, but the answer would be the exact same. \u201cA\u201d is the indefinite article, \u201cAn\u201d is the definite article. Both need to be placed in the sentence by the correct position. \n\n### Instructions:Answer the following two multiple", "answer": "C: play tag"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem and open doors.\n5. But among them, the verb 'turn the lock' is not what he would have done after unlocking it.\n6. This means we should exclude the choice A: turn lock.\n7. Similarly, option E: open doors is a misdescription of what a person would do after unlocking the door.\n8. Option C: solution to problem doesn't relate strongly to the action of bicycling home.\n9. It most likely means solving a problem, which does not match up with the context; however, the idea behind getting out your key and beginning to do something could have been to access a solution to that problem. \n10. Therefore, after excluding the previous options, D is the only option left. It means 'lock your bike' which shows that he got it ready to bike home by locking the bike.\n11. The answer then is D: lock your bike.\nAnswer: D. lock your bike. \n\nInput: They took their chips and put them into what? Choices: A: their wallets B: the plates C: their mouths D: the game E: their bags\nRationales:    1. There are options A: their wallets and B: their mouths. \n2. But we have to eliminate these two options for two simple reasons: they are not logical. \n3. Option A: their wallets is not logical because it is not reasonable for people to put chips in their wallets when they eat food.\n4. Option B, their mouths, is not logical because they would not put chips into their mouths when they are eating something. \n5. There are four logical options left: C, their game; and D, their bags. \n6. There are two main reasons why option C: their game should be eliminated.\n7. Firstly, option C: their game is not logical because when the chips are put into the game, it would be hard to get the chips out again. Therefore, the answer should be option D: their bags.\n8. Option D: their bags is the last remaining option. So the answer should be D: their bags", "answer": "D: toy store"}
{"text": ", open doors, solution to problem, pocket, and pocket.\n5. It is most logical to conclude that after he got his key, he was ready to open a lock and bike home.\n6. Then, 'turn lock' and 'open doors' are not logical options as they would need him to unlock or go inside first instead of going home.\n7. Lastly,'solution to problem' is the only remaining choice as an action done after unlocking.\n8. This is because the question does not suggest that he has unlocked his bike yet and has not yet gone home.\n9. 'Pocket' and 'pocket' simply mean 'to put something into the pocket' and there is no logical reason to put a key into the pocket.\n10. Therefore, the logical answer is E: solution to problem.\nAnswer: E : solution to problem", "answer": "B: classroom"}
{"text": ", open doors, pocket, and solution to problem.\n5. Of these, only the first two refer to the action of turning a lock and opening a door.\n6. The key has yet to be used, which leaves the choice between turn lock or open doors.\n7. Both imply the same action, which is the manipulation of a key in order to unlock or open a door.\n8. Therefore, the answer to the question is A: turn lock.\nAnswer: A - Turn lock\n\nInput: The man was trying to buy a new tire.  When the new tire was finished, what did he do? Choices: 1. A: He put on the new tire. B: He placed the tire under his car. C: He looked at the new tire. D: He tried to get the tire on his car. E: Looked at the old tire\nRationales: The question reads as follows: \"The man was trying to buy ____. When the new tire __, the man _____\" \n1. When we read the question, we can find that the sentence contains the subject, and thus, there are 2 blanks left in the sentence. In the first, we find a verb(which could be a noun), and the second is a noun. We can easily deduce that the verb must first describe the action of putting the tire on, and the noun that follows is the result; the tire is 'put' on the car, and it 'works'.  \n2. The choice that best illustrates the plausible action of putting the new tire on the car is A: he put on the new tires.\n3. A: Looked at the new tires is inappropriate because the option contains the sentence: the new tire was ______. The new tire has not been used yet, thus it is ______. \n4. B: He placed his new tire under his car does not specify which tire he placed under the car, thus it would not fulfill the requirement of the sentence. \n5. C: He looked on the new tire does not describe the action of putting it on, thus it would not fit. \n6. D: He tried on the new tire again would not fulfill the sentence's requirement, \"When the new tire", "answer": "B: house"}

The given statement clearly states \"There's more to life.....\".  \n2. This suggests that there are more things that a person can, should, or needs to focus on in their daily lives to reach ultimate satisfaction and contentment.  \n3. Among the list of given answers, only A, B, C, and E can be taken as part of the statement.  \n4. A, being \u201cspend time with friends and family\u201d, and B, being \u201cfocus on what\u2019s really important,\u201d are both included in the given list of possible answers.  \n5. However, these are not the best answers that a person who is looking for more of what their life should be can go for.  \n6. C and E can be considered as potential answers.  \n7. While both of these are more than likely part of each individual\u2019s needs, they are not clearly expressed as such.  \n8. C, being \u201cwork on one\u2019s passions\u201d, can still be included in the given list. However, it sounds too abstract and not very defined than any of the other answers.  \n9. That leaves E, \u201cexercise and health\u201d, as the possible answer given that also sounds like it does cover what a person needs to focus on in addition to what they already know.  \n10.

Choice A: turn lock has nothing to do with the process of opening a lock or a key, \n7. therefore it is possible that he started to open his lock with his key.\n8. We don\u2019t know if he got the key out of his pocket before or after picking up his bike. \n9. Therefore, of the remaining 3 plausible choices, B: pocket and D: pocket E: pocket are viable options, which means that he started this process before starting to bike home. \n10. However, we can eliminate E: pocket D: pocket as it is not only specific for the choice C: pocket, but can be equally as possible for the choice E: pocket.\n11. This leaves us with C: pocket from the given choices.\n12. Therefore, the answer must be C: pocket.\nAnswer: C.\n\nInput: All of our options are possible because they follow certain patterns,  these patterns are called  what? Choices: A: rules B: rules and patterns C: rules and laws D: models E: laws\nRationales: The question asks which of the given options are possible because they all follow certain patterns that act as guidelines to our behaviour.  We eliminate B: rules and patterns and D: rules and laws as they do not offer enough explanation, which means that our options are more likely to be rules and patterns as well as models.  A: rules, B: rules and patterns, C: rules and laws and E: laws all follow certain patterns, which makes all options possible.\nAnswer: (A, B, C, E, F, G)\n\nInput: There is no right or wrong answer to the question I just asked  What is the correct answer to the question I asked just now?

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket and open doors.\n5. 'Solution to problem' and 'open doors' seem vague in terms of completing the task of unlocking a lock. \n6. However, both of the choices also include the word 'pocket'. \n7. Since we found pocket in both the solution and the actual action, the action seems likely to also include the use of pockets. \n8. This is supported by the given context which states that he got out his key. \n9. The question therefore asks for what the next possible step after getting out your key would be. \n10. Therefore, we can conclude that the key was probably put in a pocket before it was ready to be used to open a lock or door. \n11. This means that \"he got out his key and popped his key in a pocket\" would most likely be the next step. \n12. Therefore, the answer would be either A: turn lock or E: open doors. \n13. E: open doors is also a legitimate option, but \"open door\" does not imply pockets. \"Pocket\" and \"turn lock\" do. \n14. Therefore, the correct answer is A: turn lock.\nAnswer: A\n\nInput: He had an indefinite amount of time until the next stop.  He could spend some of it preparing more thoroughly.

This statement tells us that a 4WD has something that has a system.\n2. Out of the given options, the correct answer must be one that answers this question.\n3. This eliminates B: suspensions, C: tyres, and E: safety as the systems of all of these options do not have anything to do with steering.\n4. Consider the given options and think about the following questions to eliminate any incorrect possibilities. \n\n4.1.

Out of the given options, we eliminate A: turn lock because it isn't an option to perform this action. \n6. We also cannot exclude B: pocket because it could mean either leaving the key in the lock or taking the key out to put it in his pocket before riding home.\n7.

So that leaves us with punching someone. And all that that leaves us here is that he punched somebody, which would explain why he regretted it right away. \nSo the best answer here is that he pants punched someone. \nAnswer: D; Punched someone\nInput: He told his daughter to go buy fruit,  the next thing he called her from across the kitchen, what did the daughter do?

Among the remaining options, open doors suggests opening the door to his building, but we don't know where his building is.\n7. Therefore we can eliminate open doors.\n8. Similarly, pocket contains no mention of opening a lock, and does not actually tell us what the person is going to do. As we do not know where exactly he is going, we can eliminate it as well.\n9. This leaves us with solution to problem and begin to. This could mean that he is looking for the solution to his problem.\n11. But this is again irrelevant as we do not know what his problem is.\n12. This leaves us with begin to, meaning that he got out his key with the intention of opening a lock.\n13.

Therefore: He was ready to leave; he got out his key; he was preparing to open the lock.\nAnswer: A, C, D: key, what, lock\n\nInput: 12 months and a year later, they decided to celebrate with what? Choices: A: a party and fireworks B: a party C: fireworks D: nothing\nRationales: This question asks about the celebration after twelve months of waiting. There are two options: fireworks and a party.\n1. The first choice is what they decided to do one year later.\n2. A party and fireworks is an incorrect choice because the party came after fireworks.\n3. \"Nothing\" also cannot be correct, because if the choice were not fireworks and a party, it would be \"nothing.\"\n4. Therefore, fireworks is correct.\nAnswer: B, C, D: fireworks\n\nInput: There are four different types of what? Choices A: dogs B: cats C: mammals D: tigers E: all animals\nRationales: The question asked about four types of animals. There are three choices: cats, mammals and tigers.\n1. The correct choice is cats because the question asked about different types.\n2. Since the question is about cats, \"There are four different types of dog\" would be incorrect.\n3. \"There are four different bones of cats\" would also be incorrect, because the question's key point is identifying that four types of animals exist.\n4. \"There are four types of tigers\" is incorrect because there are only three choices.\n5. \"There are four animals that have tigers\" is also incorrect because only three choices are given, and of these, cats is the key idea.\n6. \"There are four kinds of animals\" is also incorrect, but for the same reason as the choice above.\n\nAnswer: C, D, E: cats, mamals,", "answer": "A: infect"}

We can say that a few of them can potentially be the action of getting out his key, such as turn lock, and open doors. \n6. Among all of the choices, we can eliminate turn lock because that doesn't make sense when the person wants to get out his key as he already has his key in his hand.\n7. Then it's between either pocket or open doors. Pocket sounds a bit more natural since it's the action of putting the key somewhere.

Choices: A: take out the trash B: clean my room C: do laundry D: pay bills E: make the bed\nRationales: The given question is \"Every week I make it a [insert verb here]\" \nThe question part tells us that this is a regular occurrence.  This means that the daily activity is something that this character tends to do every week.\n\nThe option part asks us to find an appropriate synonym. \n\nBased on the options given, we can conclude that the activity is an event that takes place on a weekly basis. \n\nWe can eliminate A: take out the [insert verb here] because we know that this word refers to trash, not the process of doing this task. \n\nAlso, we can eliminate B: clean my room because the word \"my\" makes it less obvious that the character is referring to a routine activity that happens every week.\n\nC: do laundry doesn't make sense here because a person is not supposed to do laundry weekly. \n\nD: pay bills makes sense because paying bills is an activity that needs to be done on a regular basis.\n\nE: make the bed will work well because in western cultures, people are accustomed to making the bed after getting out of it in the morning. \n\nThus, in conclusion, D: pay bills and E: make the bed are the best choices available.\n\nHence, the answer is D: pay bills.\n\nAnswer: D: pay bills\n\nInput: In baseball, where does the batter need to stand?

Since we know he's ready to bike home and this building is probably either his home or the place he will reside after arriving home by bike.\n8.

Choices:  A:$ 213 B:$x-500 C $ 835 D: $ x C $234 D:$406 D$.376 A:$.146\nRationales: For both of the given choices, there is an error with the way they were written. For choice A, the number $213 has extra zeros at the end, so it does not correctly represent the original number $2.13. \nFor choice B, the number $x-500 has an extra minus sign, so it doesn't represent the difference between $1.0 x and $1.0 and instead represents something else. \nOption A will likely cause confusion, as, in all honesty, the original equation is: x - 34 = $2.13, where $2.13 is the cost/price of the book.\nHowever, Option C's equation x - 500 = $1.0, where $1.0 is the cost/price. This equation makes sense, but will likely confuse her friend that they met the original equation of $2.13 from earlier.\nOption D is the most straightforward, as it represents the correct equation; $x - $34 = $2\nOption D is also the best value to represent the price of the book, since she wishes to spend the minimum to spend $506 on the book and $0, instead.\nOption A is in the worst position, because its equation is not an equation, and its $0 does not mean $0", "answer": "D: cruel"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem,  and open doors.\n5. 'Turn lock' is a specific instruction to turning a key and opening the lock. However, as the key is already out in his hand, he would not necessarily turn his key a second time in the process of biking home.\n6. 'Pocket' is a general activity that may or may not have anything to do with preparing to bike home. Additionally, this could mean carrying a variety of different items in his pocket.\n7. 'Solution to problem' is a general description of an action taken to address an issue. \n8. Opening doors is not likely for the given context.\n9. The context seems to be about biking home, not about opening doors to a house.\n10. Therefore, the best activity is 'begin to'. 'Begin to' is a common action expression that refers to the first step of a process or action. \n11. Now, consider the options: 'turn lock', 'open doors'? If 'begin' refers to the action of turning the key, it wouldn't make sense to use 'turn lock' unless something prevents me from turning the key.\n12. For 'open doors', we cannot necessarily assume this will be a process the person will need to perform - they may have a code on their key that opens the door.\n13. So, the best choice is B: turn lock.\nAnswer: B. He began to turn lock\n\nInput: What is something that is common but not quite the same as anything else?  Choices:  A. common B. unique C. different\nRationales:1. What do we know from the question? The question states that something is common, but not quite the same.\n2. Options which clearly indicate'something common' are A, C.\n3. These can be eliminated because they both say that the thing is common. The reason this is incorrect is because common implies sameness across several things. It does not imply anything special.\n4. Therefore, D and E should be eliminated as incorrect options.\n5. When we look at B and E, we can see that option B explicitly states that the thing is common but not quite like anything else. E does not say the thing is common - it only states that the object has one thing that makes it different. If we do not know that \"", "answer": "A: sun himself"}

Popping out the key suggests the action of opening doors - pocket, pocket, and pocket - do not suggest the action of opening doors. \n6. Therefore, the correct answer is C: pocket.\n7. The given option is open doors. However, this does not tell us if you have to take out the key first. We cannot know that for sure from the question. \n8. Therefore, the answer can be C: pocket.\n9. The given options are turn lock and pocket. These can both mean opening the door. This is why the answer can be any other choice of the question. \n10. Therefore, the answer could be D: pocket.\n11.

Choices: A: meaning B: purpose C: contentment D: balance E: a place\nRationales: The question presents us with the concept of'meaning'. The given options present us with a variety of definitions of'meaning' which refer to a deeper and more holistic view of life; not just a mere existence or a life dedicated to work, but a life that has a purpose and is filled with positive experiences that affect one's life. \n1. Therefore, we can infer that the option 'a place' is definitely not what is meant by'meaning' in this context.  \n2. The term 'contentment' also doesn't seem to be what's meant by the term'meaning' which refers to something deeper than happiness. \n3. Therefore, we can eliminate the options contentment and balance.  \n4. Pocket describes a place. Therefore, we can determine that pocket is not meant to be what is referred to by'meaning' either.  \n5. Purpose and meaning can both be used to refer to something that one works towards. Therefore, purpose may also not be what is meant by 'what'.  \n6. Therefore, we are left with option A: meaning - the one which fits as a positive, overall idea for one's life.  \n7.

'pocket bike key' and 'key lock' could imply that he is ready to take his bike out of his pocket, but nothing about this would reveal that he is attempting to do it, only implying that he is ready to do this. \n6. Lastly, there are several logical outcomes from the action of getting out the key. The statement could easily be describing the action of a cyclist looking for the solution to which door or lock he'll need to lock in order to be able to bike home. \n7. The obvious description in this case is the word 'begin'. The question asks about the man's actions immediately after getting the key out, and 'begin' describes the man's action while simultaneously revealing the reason for him having to unlock the door.\n8. The answer is D: open doors.\nAnswer: D.open doors\n\nInput: He wanted to look his best, so what did he do to change his appearance? Choices:  D: shower B: comb hair C: put on underwear D: shave face E: none of these\nRationales:\n1.  The original statement \"He wanted to look his best\" indicates a level of ambition or effort from him, so logically he has already done some things to accomplish this action;\n2. Out of the given options, we eliminate choices A: shower and E: none of these. Showering is not really an action of changing appearance, so it doesn't make sense to have it as an option, and since the choice is of 'none of these', it wouldn't make sense to select anything other than 'none of these' as the only acceptable choice in this case. \n3. B: comb hair and C: put on underpants are possible answers, but they are too general and don't fit the specificity of the statement. \n4. He might also shave his face, but because other options seem like they might be potential answers if he wanted to change his appearance as requested in the question, and he is clearly trying to make his face look clean or smooth, the obvious action is D: shave face. \n5.

From the options given, which is the best choice. Choices:  A. symbiosis B. competitors C. parasites D. food-webs E. commensalism\nRationales: The question, which asks for a term that can define the scientific theory states that No organism exists independently, they exist only in the relationship to other organism, it does not ask for a definition, and therefore the answer must be a term that defines the scientific theory.\n\nSymbiosis: Organisms cooperating for mutual benefit to both organisms. For example: birds and insects help each other out.\nCompetitors: two or more individuals of the same species having an antagonistic relationship with one another in competition with respect to territoriality, food, and reproduction (i.e., in competition for the same limiting resource.) \"Competitive advantage\" is not a definition by definition.

Choices:   A: an offense B: the most goals C: the most goals per turn D: a defensive strategy E: the most penalties\nRationales: First, read the question carefully. It mentions that the two teams are able to score the same number of points, indicating that there was a tie with the game.\n2. This suggests that at least one of the teams played a good defense.\n3. However the correct choice that best describes a good defense would be 'defensive strategy'.\n4. A defense strategy is a method of playing in defense used in sports to prevent the other team from scoring goals.\n5. Therefore the correct answer is E: the most penalities.

The medical team puts him in a what? Choices: A: medicine, bed B: medicine, room C: bed, operation D: medicine, medicine B: bed, operation\nRationales:\n\n1. We read the first part of the statement, \"Your brother is in the hospital\", and understand that he is a patient in a hospital.\n2. We know that the medical team provides treatment for the injuries/conditions of the patient, and they often do so through medication.\n3. Based on this, we can infer that the medical team is likely to put the patient into a hospital bed, or they provide medication to the patient.\n4. This means that A: medicine and B: medicine are incorrect, since neither is a proper description of the patient being put into a hospital bed by medical staff.\n5. The given options are \"bed\" and \"operation\", we can conclude that the medical staff must treat the patient with some kind of surgery or procedure. So, from the provided options, we can eliminate C: bed. This leaves us with D: operation.\n6. Finally, we read the part \"he gets a very small part\" after deciding to eliminate choices A, B, and C.\n7. This implies that the patient may have to undergo a medical procedure/operation that involves some recovery period afterwards if everything goes according to plan, but it will be brief or not severe.\n8. The given options are bed, operation, and medicine. So, based on these options, we can conclude that the small part is the medicine the patient takes throughout the recovery period.\n9. This also means that the medical team likely puts the patient in the hospital bed as they receive the medicine.\n10. Thus, the answer choice is D: operation.\nAnswer: D operation\n\nInput: What is the most reliable way to get water? Choices: \tA: bottled B: tap C", "answer": "C: listen to music"}

The first person who can (solve the problem) must speak very cunning (ly). \n2. The next person to go (home) must give a reason to be (late).\n3. When we combine these statements, we arrive at:\n3.1. The first person to go home must provide a reason for being late, and the second person must answer the problem presented on the table with cunning.\n4.

Then, we can eliminate C: pocket, because it doesn't directly relate to the action of opening a locked door. \n8. Finally, we can eliminate D and E as options since they do not immediately follow on from getting the key out and, by the same token, getting a key out does not immediately follow on from turning the lock or opening doors.\n9.

Likewise, open doors doesn't mention the process of opening a door, so it can also be disregarded.\n7. The remaining options are: pocket and solution to problem.\n8. Pocket means to put something in your pocket, which suggests that you're about to do something. The other option,'solution to problem', is also a logical option as this implies that the person was about to do something and has found the solution to a problem.\n9.

The question states: \"the baker was excited to ____ her newest creation before ____ it was even finished.\"\n2. This is followed by the options 'before it was baked', 'in middle of baking', 'after it was baked', and 'finished' or 'after it was sold'\n3. Out of these, the only option that is logically incorrect is 'before it was baking'.\n4. This is because before baking, a cake is a dough and cannot be properly called a cake. \n5. We also eliminate the option 'in middle of baling' because the sentence says 'it was excited to show...' as opposed to 'it is excited to show...'. \n6. Therefore, the only correct options are 'after it was baken' or 'finished'. \n7. 'After it was baked' is more likely to occur, as the statement is about a newest creation, which may be unfinished.\n8. Therefore, the answer to the question is 'after it was bake'.\nAnswer: D : after it was baked.\n\nInput: Which of the following is NOT a type of business?", "answer": "A: toy store"}

Choices:  What I would expect\nRationales: The answer to the \"What would you expect?\" question part of the statement is, 'Well, that's just what I would expect from\nyou', indicating that the expectation was met. When we substitute the answers to the question part, the answers make the statement make sense.\nIf we substitute 'bad performance' or 'poor quality control', they don't make any sense.\n\nOutput: Well, that is just what I would expect.\n\nInput: What did you mean by \"This is really great\"?  \"Why, thank you.  I am glad you think it is great.  It is the best what I ever thought of.\" Choices:  A. project B. effort C. production D. poem\nRationales: Among the given options, B: effort, C: production and D: poem are out because they are not what the writer intended to convey in the statement.\nThere is an implication that the writer thinks the project is great, which is why 'effort' is not a suitable option. D: poem also cannot be chosen as it indicates that the poem is great, not the author.\nHence, the answer is A. project.\n\nAnswer: C.

A solution to a problem is something you invent to solve a problem, so it is not a straightforward action like open a lock, and it is not part of an ordinary routine, so he can't do it in the last moment, so then we can eliminate solution to problem.\n7. If the door is opened at the end of every trip by default, then there is nothing to open, so we can eliminate open doors.\n8. \"Pocket\" usually refers to something that is placed into a pocket, so he was not opening a pocket, he was putting his key into a pocket, so we can eliminate pocket.\n9. From A to E, turning a lock takes longer than inserting your key in a pocket, so insert your key into a pocket is a faster action than turning a lock out of all given options, so the answer is C: pocket. \nAnswer: C: pocket\n\nInput: The most impressive thing about Lara the artist is how she what?

Choices: \tA: you'll get up and leave the couch  B. you're going to do something else with the book. C. you'll find another book  D. you'll go on to another hobby. E you'll get a snack\nRationales: The given information includes a statement that sitting on the couch reading the the book is a relaxing activity. By analysing this statement, we can infer the following:\n1. First, the fact that the statement refers to reading the book as a relaxing activity\n2. This implies the individual enjoys reading the book.\n3. Additionally, the statement does not refer to any specific actions after the activity is completed.\n4. Therefore, the options given do not refer to specific activities that come after reading the book as these are more specific than the general statements in the question.\n5. Among the given statements, 'you\u2019ll find another book' refers to choosing another book to read as part of the same activity and is therefore incorrect.\n6. On the other hand, 'you\u2019ll sit on the couch reading another book' would also be incorrect as the statement refers to sitting on the couch to read the book rather than another book.\n7. Therefore:\nAnswer:\nWe have to conclude that 'you'll go on to other hobbies' is the correct statement as it refers to different hobbies, whereas 'you'll get a snacjk' refers to a specific activity that occurs after reading the book instead of relating to any other activity.\nAnswer:\n\n# Conclusion", "answer": "D: back and"}

Of the two, option D: open doors, seems more reasonable because bikers have a need to open doors, like at the entrance gate of the road they are going to cycle on.\n7. However we eliminate option D: open doors because the statement already mentions the action of turning lock. \n8. So the answer is A: turn lock. \n9.

A:  take it to one of these places  B:  put it in the driveway   C:  turn it off   D:  park it    E:  put it in neutral\nRationales:.1  The question asks for the logical next step in the process of taking a car for a service at the mechanic. \n.2  Turning off takes place either before putting the car in neutral or when it is in neutral. \n.3  Parking is placing the car somewhere safe and away from people moving around. \n.4  Putting something in the driveway is transferring it from one location to another. \n.5  Putting a car into neutral or park is only relevant after it has been turned off in the previous step. \n.6  Out of the options, only two are plausible - take it to one of those places and put it in neutral. \n.7  Both of those steps could happen after one has turned off the car. \n.8  Thus, the answer is A1: take it to one of", "answer": "E: backpack"}

Solution to problem could also mean to take one's key and get out a lock, but again, it isn't specified to what key specifically.\n8. Therefore, we are left with two options: pocket(s) and open doors.\n9. Out of these two choices, open doors doesn't fit well because it is mentioned that he was ready to go home on his bike so there is no reason to stop and open the doors.\n10. Pocket fits best because the word 'pocket' only refers to one action so in that case it should be considered the correct answer option.\n11.

The remaining options turn lock and open doors would only be feasible if the lock on the door were turned first.\n8. Thus, the answer would likely be turn lock.\n9. This is further supported by the given context, as we can infer that it would be logical for the person to begin working on turning the lock before attempting to open it.\nAnswer: A\n\nInput: Tesla's power output was a lot less per unit time,  Which was the main reason? Choices:  None of these A:  It came out too often B:  Its size was bigger C:  Its speed was shorter D:  It used up too much space\nRationales:  1. The question tells is that Tesla's output was a lot less power compared to traditional turbines.\n2. This suggests that there was something limiting the power output. \n3. We can eliminate A: It came out too often, this is the only option that would mean that there wasn't enough power and it would be incorrect for the reason why.\n4. We can also eliminate D: It used up too much volume since the turbine would obviously have to use up enough volume to turn as well as generate power. \n5. This leaves us with options B and C. \n6. Option B: It uses bigger size means that the device would be larger and using more space, which would limit its power output. \n7. For this reason, we can eliminate this option. \n8. Option C: Its speed was shorter means faster movement. A shorter speed could explain how this can limit the power output of a turbine. \n9. Faster rotation creates more torque, thus power, so slower more power. \n10. Since faster movement of the turbine would likely limit the power output, option C: It's speed was shorter is our answer.\nAnswer: None of these. C: Its speed was short\n\nInput: When you were little,  what was the last day of school like for you?

Pocket is an option that is possible in terms of timing, but is not the appropriate action to take at this point. For similar reasons, solution to problem is not appropriate either. \n7. So leaving only open doors and pocket, we can rule out both because neither are appropriate in terms of timing. \n8.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, open doors, and pocket.\n5. However, as we already know that he is ready to bike, we can eliminate the choices that do not necessarily lead to this action. One of those options is 'pocket' since'ready to bike' usually implies that one is geared up and prepared to go.\n6. Another option that can be ruled out is 'open doors' since it does not address turning a lock, which is already indicated in the sentence.\n7. So, the options that remain are 'turn lock', 'pocket solution to problem', and 'pocket'. All these options involve inserting something into one's pocket but only 'pocket solution to the problem' shows consistency with the original sentence.\n8. Therefore, the answer must be 'pocket solution to a problem'.\nAnswer: B: pocket solution to problem (this answer contains no spelling errors and no grammatical errors)\n\nInput: He is being careful and cautious. He has an attitude of extreme prudence.  How does this relate to the fact that he is being very what? Choices:   A: cautious B: careful C: thorough D: attentive E: prudential\nRationales: The answer can be derived by focusing on the question itself.\n1. The statement: \"He is being careful and caitous\" tells us about an action happening and that one is careful and caitous.\n2. Both the words 'cauious' and 'caucious' have similar spellings, however, only 'caucious' holds the right diction which is a style of writing, speaking or pronunciation used for formal or academic purposes. \n3. The correct answer, therefore, is C as it best fits into the context of the word 'prudent'. \nAnswer: C: 'prudent'.", "answer": "D: seed crops"}

Among these options, 'turn lock' and 'open doors' are irrelevant to the question as we are given that he has already done these actions. As a result, the remaining choices are pocket and solution to problem. \n5. So, he most likely takes his key and looks for possible solutions to the problem, where 'pocket' is a reasonable assumption if he has not already done so.\n6. Thus the answer is C: solution to problem.\nAnswer: C. solution to problem\n\nInput: All her classmates were there. The classroom was a mess. What should Mary do? Choices:  C: leave E: clean the tables B: get to work D: clean the board A: wright the assignment\nRationales: First, the question states that all her classmates were present and that the classroom was a mess, with no specific details of exactly what was wrong. As the question does not specify a particular problem, the classroom could be in a variety of states. It could be extremely messy, but not dirty. So \"clean the tables\" may not necessarily be the appropriate action. \n\n\"Clean the board\" is possible, since the board could potentially be dirty, but the question does not make use of the term \"dirty' with regard to the board.\n\n\"Wright the assignment\" is unlikely, since a teacher would be there to do so, and the point of focus is \"Mary\".\n\nAll given choices are applicable. The first three are in the same category: 'clean'.\n\nAs a result, Mary's job should most likely be to 'clean the board', for all the given reasons we have listed above.\nAnswer: E. clean the board.\n\n### Evaluation:\nCheck the answers as described.", "answer": "D: pool hall"}

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, and open doors. \n5. Turning a lock means a lock is still closed.  If the bike was ready to leave when the question asks if he was ready, the bike would have already been unlocked. \n6. Solving a problem does not involve taking action, it refers to coming up with a solution. \n7. Therefore, we can eliminate A: turn lock, C: solution to problem, and E: open doors as we already know that the bike is ready.\n8. B: pocket refers to putting something in the pocket.  A bike lock does not fit in a pocket.\n9. D: pocket refers to taking something out of a pocket.  The key is not something that needs to be taken from somewhere in between 'getting out his key' and 'beginning to bike home'.\n10. Therefore, the only plausible choice between B: pocket and C: solution to problem is C: solution to problem.\n11. The key is the solution.  If the solution is found by the person who got the key out of their pocket, then the solution to the 'getting bike locked' problem includes 'biking'.\n12.

The phrase \"and began to\" indicates a process of doing.\n8. He wasn't pocketing his key, he was beginning the process of unlocking his bike.\n9. Therefore, the answer must be A: turn lock.\nAnswer: A turnlock\n\nInput: The police are investigating the incident, which caused so much damage.  They're checking for what? Choices: A: any traces B: any suspects C: any witnesses D: evidence E: suspects\nRationales: The question part indicates that the police are investigating an incident that caused a lot of damage. It also states that they are checking for something. \n1. The given options have to be things that the police should look for as a part of an investigation.\n2. Any traces refers to footprints, fingerprints or other traces that might have left during the incident. However, these might not be directly related to the incident. \n3. Any suspects refers to people they suspect might have done the incident. Though, since the police are asking for evidence, we can conclude that they do not have any suspects. \n4. Any witnesses refers to witnesses who might be able to provide valuable information about the incident. However, we have not been told the type of crime, so witnesses might not be applicable.\n5. This leaves us with evidence which refers to something that shows what happened or might have happened.\n6.

So, we can only narrow it down to solutions to problem and pocket.\n6. Solution to problem is unlikely, as it is not an action of opening a door or a lock. \n7. Thus, based on the context, the most plausible option is pocket (opening a lock is a type of action).\n8. The action of opening a lock and putting it in one's pocket is what the given statement explicitly implies in the context.\n9.

Lastly, 'open doors' does not relate to opening a lock as people use a key to unlock a specific type of door.\n8. When considering all of the given options and options out of context, the answer that fits this context is B: pocket.\n9. He got out his key and was ready to bike a home, so he must have pockets or a place to store the keys before he bike home. So, the answer choice is B: pocket\nAnswer: B: pocket\n\n### Conclusion:The following statement, \"A: careless, B: careful, C: complete, D: thoughtful, E: thorough, F: inexcusable, G: perfunctory, H: complete in thought, I: considerate, J: thorough, K: intricate, L: thoughtfully, M: thoroughgoing\", gives the following statements, \"Everybody has some form of creativity, it\u2019s the best way to express yourself, He expects high quality for the money has spent, Falling apart is normally to the method of production, A microphone boom needs to be covering a stock, A fertilizer makes a flower grow, Billy wants to understand people, The neolithica person was hungry, He was ready to bi byke, The person was ready to bike byk, He was ready to bio byk, His key was about to open the door, The neolilithic person was hungey\".\nTherefore, all the statements are correct.\n\n### References:\nhttps://www.studyguidezone.com/mcat/multiple-choice-questions/\nhttps://www.ets.org/mcat/", "answer": "E: formal garden"}

A: There's not enough space.  B: There are not enough kids.  C: There are no hiding places.  D: There are no spots to find.  E: There are not enough people.\nRationales:1. Since the premise is that the kids cannot play hide-and- seek in a gym locket room due to lack of space, the key problem is the same.\n2. 'There is not enough space' presents more information about the problem of lack of space.\n3. Out all the other options, 'There are no hiding places,' 'There are no spots to know,' and, 'There are not enough people' are unlikely to contribute to solving the problem of space limitation.\n4. 'There are not enough kids' does not solve the problem of space limitation, so the answer is 'There is not enough room'.\nAnswer: A: There's no enough space.\n\nInput: If there were one day off a week from work, what would you do?

Choices: A: blow a trumpet B: play violin C: finger pick D: play piano E: draw F: tap\nRationales: First, we must realize that the question tells us that we need only use one finger to do one of the given actions.\n1. Among all the given choices, the only action that requires only one finger is tapping.\n2. Trumpet, violin, piano and drawing all require several fingers to be played.\n3. Piano requires two fingers to be played, violin requires three fingers, and drawing or trumpet require multiple fingers to be used.\n4. This means that the correct answer is A: blow a trumper; \n5. or B: tap.\nAnswer: B tap\n\nInput: I hate to what? Choices A: wait B: listen C: talk D: sleep E: write F: drive\nRationales: The question is asking for a verb that answers to the action of hate in the question.\n1. Wait and listen are active verbs that imply doing something.\n2. Sleep, drive and talk do not imply any action.\n3. Wait and listen are both the best options because of their actions, but also because they do not have a direct connotation to hate. \n4. Therefore, the correct answer is: C: listen;  or B: wait.\nAnswer: B wait\n\nInput: There are a few species of animals native to the American west.

Choices:  T: he had his car fixed A: he tried a bad mechanic B: he realized he could do it himself C: he started to fix the car D: he could not fix the car\nRationales: Firstly, the question gives us some information about the man at hand in a specific situation, that is: \"The man\", referring to him in a specific sense as indicated by \"himself\". \"The man\" is trying to fix a car himself when \"he did not know how to do it\". For simplicity's sake, he tried a mechanic which he would have no idea if it was good or bad. It also states that it was a bad idea because \"It backfired\". This means that the mechanic did a poor job or that he would be more upset than he would be if the mechanic had done a good job. \"Himself\" indicates that he will be responsible for fixing the car to some extent, however the question does not focus specifically on what is broken, so the most apparent solution is to have the mechanic try to fix it. \"Himself\", in other words, could mean that he is able to fix the car, but the problem is that he was not sure how to.\n\nRubric: First, we start by analyzing the statement, \"The man who did not know\" as well as \"The mechanic tried\" to discern the key players of the situation: \"The man\" did not.

Choices: A: more money B: an apple C: the best food D: a diamond E: a ring\nRationales:1. The question says: \"He walked to her\".\n2. This implies he gave her something since otherwise why would he walk towards her. \n3. Out of all the given options, only \"a ring\" seems plausible.\n4. Among the four given options, there appears to be inconsistencies. \n5. Option E: a ring could refer to engagement to a marriage proposal.\n6. Option B: an apple or C: the best food could refer to a dating proposal.\n7. We can ignore these two options on the basis of their lack of plausibility.\n8.

As there is more than one possible outcome, it is up to the reader to decide which is more likely.\n7. The final question is whether or not he has everything he needs.\n8. 'Open doors' is a broader phrase which refers to the possibility of him simply unlocking the door for when he gets home.\n9.

Choices:  - A: disrespectful B: friendly C: humorous D: scary E: unhappy\nRationales: The given statement tells us the following: \"when you use a dumfounded face at work, it looks like this...\nThe given choices are: disrespectful, friendly, humorous, scary, and unhappy. Based on the given statement, we can infer that the person looks like what the given statement showed.\nNow, let's eliminate the \"humorous\" and the \"unhappy\" as these two do not match the given statement. Thus, we are left with: disrespectful or scary.\nNow, \"disrespectful\" is a trait that people do not like to see. Thus, using the idea that the person who looks this way is disrespectful, we can conclude that people will feel \"disrespect\" towards them.\nAnswer: D-disrespect\n\nInput: Ancient Romans were very successful in agriculture.  They believed in hard work and what? Choices: A: equality B: luck C: religion D: science E: wealth\nRationales: First, we read that ancient Romans were successful in agriculture.\nNow, we read that they believed in hard work and we read that they were successful in agriculture, we can deduce that they believed in hardwork as they were successful in agricultural work.\nOut of the given choices, only B: luck and D: science do not directly imply that they believe in hard work.\nTherefore, C: religion and E: wealth do not fit in the context of the overall statement.\nSo, the answer is B-luck.\nAnswer: B\n\nInput: As a child, Alex really loved to draw.

He already locked his bike earlier and he needs to unlock the bike from the lock to get it ready to ride home.\n5. The phrasing of the question also indicates that he is ready to go. Solving a problem would not be an action performed to prepare to go. This is because problems usually require some time to be solved and he has already done everything to get ready for his commute.\n6. So pocket is ruled out because a problem would need to be solved before the bike could be biked home.\n7. The remaining three options do not make sense either. He does not need to open doors if doors are not needed for him to get his bike ready to go home. Moreover, if he already opened the door at the beginning of the process then he would not need to open the door again to go home.\n8. Therefore, the answer must be E: open the door to go home.\nAnswer: E : open the door to go\n\nInput: When you are learning a new craft,  what is the most useful thing you can do besides reading,  to learn it?  Choices:  A; get a job in that industry B; read a lot of books C; learn by watching other people D; practice E: ask your supervisor\nRationales: The key phrase in the question is \"besides reading\".

If you don't wnat to do something, you probably tend to _\"put off things as long as you can_\" because you don't want to do the work or you can find another way to do it.\n2. It's better to _\"get everything done perfectly\"_ rather than _\"hesitate before acting_\".\n3. The other choices are wrong because they don't support the question's meaning.\n4. _WANT TO DO IT BUT NOT HAVE TIME_ means you do have time to do something but you don't want it.\n5. _\"HESITATE BEFORE ACTING_\" means you always hesitate to do something.\nAnswer: C. get every thing done perfectly\n\nInput: Dentists are supposed to treat patients, not try to solve what?

D cannot be the answer either because we are only told to turn the lock, not turn it and then pocket.\n8.

Although the forensic team had already given their reports and conclusions on the case, John was thorough in his study of the body. He was on the lookout for a way out of the room. After some time spent examining the corpse, he saw a small hole in the wall which caused a crack in the concrete floor. The crack is where the body landed when the balcony railing broke.\n\n#### Rationales\n\n1. There were some conclusions given already on the case. In the given instruction, it says John was thorough in study of the body. \n2. This means John did everything that was required or expected of him, but not everything that he could do, or could be asked to do.\n3. The question part asks us to analyze which characteristic he could have had so that he wouldn't miss this out.\n4. We see here that he still had to search for something in the room. \n5. After some time spent, he actually found what the real cause of death was.\n6. The question part asks which characteristic he had from the beginning, and which one he could have had as well, if he was more thorough.\n7.

The first choice, turn lock, is not compatible because we don't know where the lock is and he hasn't already done it before the question asked about him beginning to turn the lock.\n6. The second choice, pocket, is eliminated because the question did not tell us that he was also looking for his key, there was simply the action of him getting out his key from his pocket\n7. Third option, solution to problem, can be a possible solution but does not directly answer the question so this is not a correct answer either.\n8. Out of the remaining choices though, E: open doors most likely correlates with the action of the first statement which mentioned biking home and having a key in his possession.\n9.

Choices:  Cool  Lively D: Healthy  Happy  Juicy  Loud A: Fuzzy  Damp  Silly  Small B: Soft  Shiny  Smart  Smooth C: Tangy  Tiny  Wild  Wacky D: Yucky E: Zany\nRationales:\n 1. Notice the repetition of these words in choices A and C: fuzzy, damp and zany. These words tend to be more common in young children's writing, or jokes and riddles.\n 2. Looking more closely at the choices, 'cool' is not a suitable descriptive word, as it is more of an adjective.\n 3. 'Small' is not a descriptive word either, it is too general and would be found in all fruits. 'Small' also is different from option A which describes the texture.\n 4. This leaves us with option E: zany. \n 5. \"Zany\" is a type of cartoon and \"zany\" itself is an informal adjective used for describing things as being out of the ordinary or silly.\n 6.

There is an obvious inference to be made: when he got out his key he began to turn it, however, when he opened the doors, his key was pocketed, which clearly means that he did something other than turn a lock after obtaining his key.\n7. Therefore the answer is A: turn lock.\nAnswer: A\n\nInput: If you see a fire, what happens to a flammable liquid in the flame?

We then eliminate options B: pocket because it is also a generic task and C: solution to problem because it does not directly relate to the stated goal.\n7. Which leaves us with option E: to open doors or D: open doors.\n8. E: to open doors may be used as a verb while 'open doors' only exists as a written sentence, so the latter one is more likely to occur.\n9. Furthermore, the fact that the man was ready to bike furthermore implies that he will do this action right after opening the doors. \n10.

Since the key cannot be turned without first opening the door or a lock, and since locking the bike was presumably the main purpose of getting the key (which he did), the answer is C: pocket.\n6. A solution to problem is something that helps someone solve a problem but biking home is not considered a problem.\n7. Opening doors could be a way of getting home faster, but the question specifically states that he is ready to go home and no special reason to go home fast or go there is mentioned. \n8. Also, this statement hints that he simply is ready to go, with no time constraint or need for a fast response. \n9. In that case, only the answers that could be directly related to biking can be considered. \n10. Pocket is one of the answers that could be done directly before biking, and it includes the key, or other items that could be useful for biking. \n11.

From the given options, we eliminate choice A: get an immediate response as this was not the stated goal and choice E: cause him to how as this contradicts the stated goal.\n2. All other options refer to the goal of getting an emotional response.\n3.

The options listed may not appear relevant to a burrito.\n2. However, from the way the question is phrased, we can infer that the answer is likely to be the type of food commonly served with a burritow, not the name of the burrito itself.\n3. This implies that we probably can eliminate answer options (tomatoes, onions, and tortilla).\n4. The options left to choose from are (sour cream, cheese).\n5.

Hence, the correct answer to the question is 'C: begin'.\nAnswer: C: begin\n\nInput: The carpenter uses many different tools to make a table.  This is an example of what? Choices :  A: compassion B: teamwork C: collaboration D: sharing E: cooperation\nRationales: Firstly, we understand from the given options that the carpenter is making a table, while using different tools. \n2. These different tools require teamwork and cooperation by the carpenter.\n3. Therefore, it shows examples of teamwork as well as cooperation.\n4. So, we can eliminate options A: compassion. \n5. Also, option D: sharing, is not a term which matches with teamwork, so this can also be eliminated.\n6. Therefore we are left with options B: teamwork and C: collaboration.\n7. 'Teamwork' refers to a working group that cooperates in some work while 'collaboration' refers to a working relationship in which two or more people work together on a task.\n8. So if we had to eliminate one of the options, we would be more likely to go with 'collaborate', as it is not as commonly used in the context of the scenario.\n9. Hence, the correct choices would be B: teamwork and D: collaboration. \n10. So, the answer to the question would be B: team work.\nAnswer: B : team work\n\nInput: My parents were angry when I broke a vase when I was eight.  Now I'm older, I know how to do better.

The options are excluded from the given choices because they would not directly relate to the problem of opening a lock.\n6. Pocket and solution to problem do not imply the action of using a key for opening a lock.\n7. Open doors is not likely since getting home on a bike involves turning the key for lock, not the door.\n8. This leaves us with turning lock and pocket.\n9. When we compare the actions of turning key and pocketing a key with the given question, we note that the action of turning key correlates better with opening a lock.\n10. So, the answer to this question is A: turn a key.\nAnswer: A turn a key\n\nInput: How would you like people to feel when they see or hear you? Choices:  C: happy E: interested F: happy and interested G: bored but interested\nRationales:\n1. 'How would you like people to respond to you when they hear or see you?' is the question part of the question.\n2. The options that follow the given text all indicate a state of a person's interest or feelings after having seen or heard the subject.\n3. This implies that the people in question will feel a particular way after hearing or seeing the person described within the question.\n4. A is happy, E, F and G are not mentioned in the text, and D is bored.\n5. Since A, E, and F all express a response of happiness when people see or hear someone, we eliminate D as we can exclude the options that do not match the given response.\n6. Further, we also eliminate F, as it is not a choice but a response.\n7. Therefore the answer has to be either E or G.\n8. Since, feeling bored is not a good way to make people see or hear you, the answer has to be G. So, the answer must be G.\nAnswer: G: bored but interesting", "answer": "C: count"}

{"text": ", pocket, open doors, pocket, solution to problem. \n5. The first choice (turn lock) does not match the context of the question, as the person has already gotten the key and is ready to bike home -- thus, the key is unlikely to be used to turn a lock.\n6. The last choice (solution to problem) is too vague as it does not specify what the problem is or how that is intended to be solved.\n7. Out of the remaining choices, A: turn lock, B: pocket and C: solution to problem have the same meaning. \n8. This eliminates B: pocket and C choice: solution to problem. This leaves us with A and C: turn lock and solution to problem.  Considering these two options, A: turn lock is more likely to indicate what the person was ready to do since it has a more direct verbal correlation to the action of opening a door.\n9. Therefore, the answer must be the direct verb 'turn lock' rather than the abstracted phrase'solution to problem'. \n10.Answer: A: turn lock\nAnswer: A: turn key\n\nInput: The young man said nothing.  This is an example of what common feature about human speech? Choices:  C: talking B: expressive D: vocal E: vocalizing communication\nRationales: The word \"feature\" in the context of this question describes a characteristic, habit or tendency. \n1. First, look at the given options and eliminate any of the choices that make no sense in the context of the question or do not make sense as a feature based on the definition. \n2. In this case 'vocal communication' and 'vocalizing communication' both indicate ways of expressing speech through sound - they do not indicate that this trait is unique to humans but rather are the way speech is expressed among all animals.\n3. Therefore, the trait of \"human speech\" could be described in relation to the ability for humans to produce sounds using a mouth to communicate thoughts.\n4. Now compare the remaining choice, \"expressing speech expression\". This does not directly relate to the question, as no question was posed about the man's expression.\n5. We next consider communication with one's mouth, which is the process of speaking and pronouncing words. \n6. Out of the remaining options, D: vocal communication would eliminate", "answer": "C: take center stage"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, and open doors.\n5. 'Turn lock' can also mean 'turn key in lock', hence this phrase could be used for both 'open' and 'opening' the lock, so eliminate 'lock/open lock'.\n6. 'Solution to problem' is quite vague and is less likely to refer to opening the lock.\n7. 'Pocket' is also not very specific.\n8. 'Open doors' cannot possibly be used to describe the action of unlocking the bicycle's lock.\n9. Then we must assume that the action described by the question can only happen after doing everything else required to leave.\n10. In such a scenario, we should pick the only action which directly precedes opening a lock: 'to begin the action of opening a bicycle's front door'. \n11. Now, 'opening a door' is most likely described by the phrase 'to begin opening a door'.\n12. Putting these two pieces together, the action of 'to begin the action opening a bicycle front door' can only mean to 'open a door'.\n13. By using this logic, we know that the correct answer is E: open doors.\n\nAnswer: E: open doors", "answer": "C: car trunk"}

This option also does not correspond to the context of locking a door, so turn lock cannot be the answer.\n6. This means that other options which also cannot logically be applied here are solution to problem and open doors.\n7. We can eliminate solution to problem as it does not correspond with locking the door. \n8. Similarly, we can eliminate open doors as this option is also too vague.\n9. After analyzing the option A: turn lock against the context of the question, it makes the most sense to apply it as the answer.\nAnswer: A C: turn lock\n\nInput: A new study suggests that people who spend three hours online each day increase their risk of developing which? Choices:  D: cancer  G: diabetes H: dementia  I: heart attacks  N: stress\nRationales: There are two parts to the question. First part: A new study suggests people who spend three hours (3h) online each day increase their what?  This part of the question could be a continuation of the previous sentence, or simply a separate thought, leading to the next question part.  Second part: \"increase their risk of developing which\". It is important to clarify that the options do not have to be logical continuations of the options in the first part as they are all options for the second part of the question.  It is critical to rule out logical matches before applying any of the options as a correct answer.  The second part of the question contains all lowercase letters. Letters in capital form only need to be a logically matched combination with the whole sentence.  The only letter with a capital form in the second part of the sentence is D.  For a logical match, the only matching pair that could be considered is d or r.  Since we are considering the option D as an answer, it must be a logical match with r to a lowercase letter.  The uppercase letters are not part of a logical pair with the second part of the options as we have discarded the lowercase letters already. Thus, N, the only remaining option with an uppercase letter after discounting the logical pairs of lowercase and capital letters, cannot be the answer since options such as H, I, G, and D are possible matches for it", "answer": "D: complete sentences"}

It is possible that \"turn\" and \"open doors\" can apply to locks, but it is more plausible that \"open doors\" is related to a door outside of a building.\n6. Given that the sentence also suggests that he got out his key to begin the action of opening the lock, and that the question also states that he was ready to go home, it is more likely that he got out his lock, opened the lock, and began to leave home.\n7. This leaves us with: he got out his key which suggests opening the lock, therefore, the answer is A (turn lock).\n8.

Choices: A: afraid B: distracted C: shocked D: blind E: deaf\nRationales: This question uses the same sentence structure as one we encountered earlier in the question text: \"he got out his key...\" This helps us figure out one way to deal with this question - using the same structure as the previous question.\n1. The given options use the phrasing of \"at\" which may indicate an implication to the past.\n2. A is \"fear\", B is \"shocked\", C is \"deaf\", and E is \"blind\".\n3. Option B, option C and Option D are all unlikely as they don't make sense to use in phrasing of the question.\n4. Furthermore, using the first and last words of the prompt as part of our answer (i.e. \"At first it seems\")... option A: \"at first they were all too afraid\" fits with the grammar of the prompt and is an option that is appropriate to what the text is asking.\n5.

He felt very embarrassed so what? Choices: A: apologised B: angry C: late D: relaxed E: rude\nRationales:  1. It is stated in the question that everyone had to wait a little bit longer. This implies that everyone was waiting for someone, and it is the answer that had to be delayed. \n2. When we look at the only viable solutions that are still left at this point, we understand that the manager felt very embarrassed.\n3. This solution is not a possible option, because he apologized earlier before everyone waited.\n4. So, the only remaining solution is that he felt embarrassed.\n5. Then we ask the question:'so, what?'\n6. From the given answer choices:\n-'anxious' - we feel it does not relate correctly to the previous statement.\n- 'late' - although he may have felt late, the question refers to his emotional response at this point in the situation.\n-'rud\n7.

B: pocket is not plausible either as it is not the next action on his checklist for being ready to bike home - instead, getting the key is the first and most basic thing he needs to do.\n8. C: solution to problem is not relevant to the actions he needs to do before he can bike home, as he is ready and at the starting point.\n9. D: pocket is unlikely as it is not specified why he needs to pocket his key, as he is just about to bike home instead of preparing to travel.\n10.

However, we can be sure only one explanation refers to 'old man whom she liked'.\n4. The correct explanation indicates that the old man (person) was someone whom the character liked.\n5. The given options are: I. He was a man whom she liked, 'he' = the old man whom she liked; A: wanted to talk with old man whom she liked, incorrect option; B: had a problem, incorrect option; C: was an old man of hers, incorrect option; D: liked her, incorrect option; and E: had nothing left on live for, incorrect option.\n6.

We also eliminate D since the statement of being ready doesn't suggest that there was a challenge.\n7. So C: pocket would make the most sense.\n8. The next sentence tells us that he was preparing to open the doors, implying that he was attempting to open the back doors he locked on arrival, he pocketed his key.\n9. So, he was simply preparing to open the lock. The solution to the problem was already complete.\n10. Therefore, the rational conclusion is D: prepare to open doors.\nAnswer: D, prepare to open doors\n\nInput: He is a good friend.  He is very what when he tells a lie, does he get caught? Choices:  C: worried B: guilty A: angry D: ashamed\nRationales: First, we understand from option A that he is a good friend.\n2. Option C says that he is very worried when he tells a lie.\n3. This would make sense as it indicates that he is nervous when he lies, which would cause him to be less confident, and thus, make it easier to catch him if he is trying to lie.\n4. Therefore, the answer would be C: worried.\n5. Then we look at options B and D together as both options say that he is what when he tells a truth?\n6. B: guilty means that he doesn't lie and he is feeling guilty for telling the truth while the opposite is meant for D: ashamed. \n7. However, this is incorrect as the question only gives the answer option for lying and not telling the truth.\n8. So A: angry is eliminated.\n9. As per option B, we know that the character is afraid of getting caught telling a lie, so the other options cannot be correct as the character does not have the opposite emotion.\n10. Option D, is what when he tells the truth. So the character only gets angry when he lies and not when he tells the truth, and he is not ashamed when he tells the truth either.\n11.

However, this does leave the other options incorrect.\n8. The reason behind this is because the option D: pocket is a specific action that is incorrect based on the implied context; the action must be used to unlock the door he is trying to go into, so, A: turn lock is the incorrect option because bicycles have wheels, the question does not suggest that the bicycle is locked in any way. B: pocket is the incorrect option because the implication is that he is about to go into his house after bringing his bicycle inside; the implication of his action is contrary to the statement. \n9. D: open doors is the incorrect option because this option does not relate to the context; he has already opened the doors to go into his house and is not entering anything new. \n10. Finally, C: solution to problem is the incorrect option because there is no problem for the bicycle, it does not need any solutions or fixing.\n11.

But, to find the correct option, it is necessary to consider if this is still a problem.\n2. The options are not specifically related to making a promise to oneself.\n3.

Therefore, our answer should relate to the opening of a lock, so we choose the option that is most specific.\n10. The answer is that he was popping the key in the lock, ready to ride.\n11. B: pocket does not quite cut it, as it implies that he was just holding the key in a pocket.\n12. Also, he may open several doors on his way home, and D: open doors is not necessary the next action to take.\n13.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, opening doors.\n5. Turn lock, pocket, and opening doors are not specific, but they can be eliminated.\n6. Solution to a problem, while it can refer to the action of turning the key as well, is not the best fit, as it suggests that there is a problem that needs to be solved, not simply a lock that needs to be unlocked.\n7. This leaves us with two choices: turn lock and pocket, the correct choice being B: pocket.\n8. 'Pocket' can be interpreted as the action of placing the key in a pocket, which would make sense in the context of him wanting to bike home. It could also be understood as 'to take out of the pocket,' which would make sense.\n9. The idea that he was ready to go home, implies that he had done everything needed, including bringing his key with him on the bike ride.\n10. Another plausible reason to pocket the key is that of security.  The person may have chosen to pocket it since he/she wanted to lock away the key after locking and unlocking the door. This would mean that the individual did not want to bring the key, and so pocketed it. \n11. 'Open doors', on the other hand, is a possibility. The sentence implies that he got out his key before unlocking his door. Since 'bike home' indicates that he would have to unlock a door to go home, it is plausible that he would have used his key to open his door. However, it could also just as well mean that he could have simply taken out his key without opening any doors. As such, the ambiguity regarding the door makes 'open doors' a doubtful choice. \n12.

Choices:  A : bowl B : plate C : cereal D : meal E : breakfast\nRationales: Here, the question mentions that Mary ate her breakfast, then got to work.\n1. This implies that the activity of eating, which comprises more than one bite, would have been done first, followed by the activity of going to work. In other words, after eating her breakfast, Mary went to work.\n2. Out of the given possible options, 'breakfast','meal', 'plate', and 'bowl' make sense.\n3. Meal is a broader word, but in the context of this paragraph, it would generally refer to a more formal occasion rather than everyday activity.\n4. Plate and bowl both refer to specific items that Mary would put food on, or eat food out of.\n5. Breakfast is a meal that one eats in the morning, and in English, the word 'breakfast' is generally restricted to morning eatings, rather than the broader term of'meal'. \n6.

Therefore, the answer we are left with is A: turn lock.\nAnswer: A\n\nInput: \"I told her about the problem, But she is not taking it seriously.\" is the sentence below. What is the problem or problem area for the person? Choices:  Gives problematic feedback B Is difficult or impossible to change or control C Requires a high degree of precision D Refuses to give feedback E Has not been able to make changes\nRationales: The statement says, \"I told her about a problem, but she is not taking it serously.\" This means that she is not taking the problem seriously and does not seem to try to fix it.\n1. 'Difficult or Impossible to change or control' - She refuses to give feedback, the person is not taking the problem seriouly and does not seem to give any effort to improve it.\n2. 'Requires a high degree precision' - she refuses to give feedback.\n3. 'Problematic Feedback' - She does not seem to give much feedback, the person is more inclined to tell her the problem, and she does not seem to give as much effort, so it is difficult to tell if she is taking the problem serioly or not.\n4. 'Gives Problematic Feedback' She tells the person about a problem, but doesn't seem to take it serioly herself, the person is more likely to tell her then she is to tell the person the solution or change, the person doesn't care/try as much to tell her the problem and it's difficult to tell from what she does tell her if she takes it serioly or not, she doesn't seem to", "answer": "E: plantation"}
{"text": ", pocket, pocket, open doors, and pocket. \n5. Turn lock suggests opening a padlock, which most bikes don't have.\n6. Pocket can signify the action of keeping an object in a pocket, but this is too general and doesn't have a strong correlation with the given statement- the key that the statement refers to could refer to anything, not just pockets.\n7. Open doors could refer to the same padlocks bikes don't usually have.\n8. Therefore, the other options exclude the right answer, Pocket.\n9. However, the final answer is a direct correlation of the given statement.\n10. Open a lock can signify to get out a key and unlock a lock.\n11. Therefore the answer is 'C: pocket', he unlocked his bike.\nAnswer: C>\n\nInput: He always thought of himself as a big city boy.  He liked walking down the streets all the time, but what is he really doing? Choices:  no: hitchhiking (on the corner) A: walking B: wandering C: looking for a ride D: meeting people E: standing\nRationales: The question asks for information about what the man is doing when he thinks he's walking in the streets. We notice that he likes walking in the streets, as he thinks of himself as a city boy. To help figure out what he's really doing, think about what the word 'walking' means. It implies walking forward, so what he really wants is to go forward, or in other words: he's walking to go somewhere. From there, we are ready to find what kind of transportation the man is doing in order to go forward. He's not doing something like a taxi, since a taxi actually goes all around, so we're looking for something that goes forward or backward and not around. We can eliminate hitchhiking on the corner, walking, wandering and looking for a ride, as they are not transportation that takes you somewhere. He's not really doing any of these things but meeting people, which indicates that he is going to another place. Therefore, the correct choice is E: standing.\nAnswer: E>\n\nInput: I can only say that she's a lovely girl.  I haven't seen a smiling face like", "answer": "E: cellar"}
{"text": ", solution to problem, pocket and open doors.\n5. The first thing that we should analyze in any question is the action that the key represents.\n6. Here, the statement that says \"begin to\" implies that he was using the key to turn the lock of the door. \n7. This action is in the present tense.\n8. This action is described as starting, which suggests the commencing of an ongoing action, or an action that will be carried out repeatedly, such as turning the lock.\n9. Since this action involves starting an ongoing process, the answer must be of the same kind. \n10. Thus, we choose B: turn lock as the correct answer.\nAnswer: B turn lock", "answer": "C: three feet"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, and open doors. Pocket is a plausible choice if the key was to be carried and not to be used at once.\n5. He might have a solution to a problem, but that does not necessarily mean he is ready to use it.\n6. Open doors would suggest that he tried his key multiple times and there are a lot of doors to unlock.\n7. Moreover, a person needs to unlock his or her own door.\n8. Solving a problem is not a single action.\n9. Thus, there would only be a possibility of solving a problem - this does not indicate that one solution has been successfully applied.\n10. Turn lock is a possibility, but it would require multiple tries as one or a lot of locks might have to be tried. Hence, the answer would be best if it was B: pocket, which most probably describes the action of putting his key in his pocket.\n11. Pocket is a viable choice and holds the most correlation with the context of the question, making it the best option.\n12. Hence the answer is C: pocket.\nAnswer: C. pocket\n\nInput: The woman started to wash her hands with soap and water before having to what? Choices :  A: make salad B: eat lunch C: go to work D: ride bus E: change planes\nRationales: The question states that the woman started to wash with water before going to do what? (A, B, C, D, or E).\n1. The question is about 'before', so we should look at what came afterwards, 'doing lunch, going to work, riding bus, or changing planes' (as answers B, C, and D mentioned in the statement).\n2. The word 'change' cannot be part of the solution because it implies that what came after was already planned before.\n3. 'Lunch', 'going to work', and 'riding bus' are actions we can think of, but they don't necessarily require us to wash our hands first.\n4. When you go to work, for example, you can choose whether or not to wash because you're already dressed and ready to go. Similarly, you can choose to not wash your hands when riding a bus.\n5. 'Change planes' doesn't have", "answer": "C: care for children"}
{"text": ", pocket, and open doors.\n5. If any of these are the actions indicated, then the given actions must occur in some order or the other. \n6. Since the action of turning a key is generally done in order to lock or open something, it does not fit the action that is about to take place. \n7. Moreover, we see that option E: pocket is the one where the other action is about to take place i.e. he starts to go home.\n8. Therefore, 'get out his keys and start bike home' must mean begin to bike home. \n9. Hence, he begins to bike home, that is, start biking.\n10. So, Option B: Turn lock is incorrect, C: pocket is appropriate, D: open doors does not fit appropriately within the sentence, and so is E: pocket because it does not make sense to open doors if one has already begun the process of going home.\n11. Finally, the answer should be C: pocket.\nAnswer: C; Pocket\n\nInput: As the wind blew through the trees,  she heard a rustling and saw something moving.  What type of animal was it? Choices:  I: rodent J: bat K: hawk L: crow\nRationales: The first step is to identify that this question refers to a sentence in a text. The correct option was D: As the wind bleW through the trees, she heard a rustling, and saw something moving.\n1. A bat lives in trees and is a flying nocturnal animal;  if one were trying to differentiate bats and birds,  one would generally think of bird versus not-bird or flying versus not-flying.\n2. A crow is a bird and is associated with trees, so the options will consist mainly of not birds and non-flying options such as L: crow.\n\n3. One would not identify a hawk as a bird from a list of non-birds because it lives on a tree.\n\n4. Therefore, among the non-bird options, the most logical answer will be the one that is non-flying.\n\n5. Among flying options, the most logical option will be an option that will be the opposite of hawk.\n\n6. Thus, A: rodent is the most logical choice because it", "answer": "C: wrong house"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors. \n5. All of them describe some kind of action except for open doors - which should always happen after the process of locking/unlocking a door rather than before.\n6. The only reasonable choice out of the options is B: pocket so the action was to put the key in his pocket.\n7. Thus the answer is B: pocket.\nAnswer: B : pocket\n\nInput: The old lady told us she did not see Mr. Jones in his office today.  Is he on vacation, sick, or what? Choices: A: sickness B: vacation leave C: illness D: absent E: absence\nRationales: the question states that the lady told us that Mr. Jones was not in his office today.\nThis implies that the old lady is a reliable witness to Mr. Jones' absence. \nThen we analyse options: A tells us that Mr. Jones is definitely on vacation. \nThe lady's claim that Mr. Jones is not at work makes the vacation on or before his date inappropriate. \nSo, we eliminate A. \nB tells us that maybe Mr. Jones is sick. \nIt specifies that he could be on vacation leave if he is sick or on medical leave. \nHere too, the question specifies that Mr. Jones is absent to mean he is not at work. \nHence, B doesn't fit the given context. \nC and D tell us that maybe Mr. is ill or absent respectively. \nThese options are justified by the question since they provide reasonable options for Mr. Jones' absence or are neutral with respect to the evidence and assumptions we made. \nE tells us that maybe Mr, Jones is just absent without explanation. \nSince the context is Mr. Jones' absence and this answer does not provide a reasonable explanation but just negates the other four conclusions with a question mark, it cannot be a correct answer. \nTherefore, the options are C and D.\nAnswer: C and D\n\nInput: A man's father was unavailable and the boy called the family.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors. \n5. However, if he has already taken out his key and began the action of unlocking or opening the lock, then the other actions cannot be performed, so that eliminates A: turn lock and E: open doors. \n6. Then we eliminate B: pocket, because the key is usually associated with the action of unlocks or opening a lock, if the key were being pocketed, then the action of turning a lock or opening a door was still incomplete and the key is not necessary. \n7. Therefore, from left, we have: solution to problem, which is also not correct, and finally, D: pocket. \n8. From D: pocket, we eliminate C: solution to problem as this option does not logically follow from the action taken so far, i.e. picking the key (this action cannot be completed without taking the key and picking it, and this action cannot be completed without having a solution, i.e. pocket).\n9. The question states what needs to be done (the logical answer) and how the action occurred. \n10. Therefore the answer is option D: pocket.\nAnswer: D.pocket\n\nInput: Where do you find a honeycomb? Choices:  a. underwater b. an egg C. a wall d. hive e. a hole in a stump\nRationales: The answer is, of course, honey! Here's how you figure out which of the five choices in the question contains honey:\n\n1. Underwater: This could be a fish tank, or could be the Pacific ocean, as in the movie Finding Nemo.\n2. An egg: This does not contain honey (though it may be sweet).\n3. A wall: There are no combs on or in or near the Wall.\n4. Hive: This may indeed contain honey, but not in the shape of a familiar honeycomb, for a hive is an opening in a tree trunk that bees use as their residence. A bee nest, if you follow the thread back a little further. You don't find honey in a comb.\n5. A hole in a stump: Same problem as the answer to the last question.\n\nAnswer:\n\n**Honey**\n\nInput: He found", "answer": "A: few people"}
{"text": ", pocket, open doors, and solution to problem.\n5. The last one (the solution to the problem) is eliminated because it is too vague, turning the key is not suggested, and opening the doors would be too much of a nuisance to mention when he is already ready to bike home before he goes back inside. \n6. The remaining choices all involve keys.\n7. If one goes back to the question, we see that he got out his key to what? The option \"beginning to bike home\" suggests he planned or intended to bike home. Key-holders must unlock their bike lock. This could possibly be a solution to the problem. This is the best we have at this point, so the answer is most likely C: pocket.\nAnswer: C. pocket\n\nInput: What is the last thing I think of when I'm hungry? Choices:  Coffee B: bread sandwich C: apple pie D: eggs E: chocolate cake\nRationales: We think of what?\n1. Choices: A, B, C, D, E-These all have to do with food\n2. Chocolate Cake - Chocolate cake suggests that a person who prefers chocolate cake has not eaten before (hence it is last thing)\n3. \"The Last Thing I Think Of\" The last thing one thinks of is that which comes first in one's mind and so cannot be followed by another. Hence it is \"Chocolate Cake\"\n4. In addition, we have to remember that when the question asks \"Think\", it means deep contemplation or thought, not just the surface-level idea. Eaten before is not considered deep contemplation of the food.\n5. Therefore the answer is E: chocolate Cake\nAnswer: C: chocolate Cakes\n\nInput: When will it be the right time for me to visit that person?

The question states the two options have an equal possible outcomes. (Either he would succeed, or, he would...). \n2. The options given are: success, lose, fail.\n3. It is possible to argue that the two options are equivalent and that one option is a synonym of the other (success - winning, lose - not winning/fail). But the given statements contradict this notion. For example, we know 'win' can be applied to a task where the outcome is positive and 'fail' when the outcome is negative. Therefore, according to the options, success and 'fail' are not synonymous.\n4. Outside of these logical terms we can eliminate lose and fail(lose) because they are not a clear outcome to the action of 'trying to do something'. \n5.

Hence, choice (A) is a good choice, as this will make the cat look happy. The question part here asks whether the cat's action was a correct one.\n7. Cat's choice is to lick the kitten which seems to be of some benefit to the kitten.\n8. Licking the kitten seems to be a good choice as the cat may have done that with good intentions. \n9. However, the cat may be lacking proper knowledge of doing the right thing by licking the kitten. This is unlikely with a kitten, though, since it is expected to be lesser in knowledge.\n10. The question part here is asking whether the choice is a correct one.\n11. By the statement alone, it", "answer": "A: tennessee"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, and open doors. \n5. 'Turn lock' does not help solve a problem, rather, 'turn lock' is the solution to the previous problem of locking oneself and one's belongings into a place, such as a house or car. \n6. Also, 'pocket' cannot be considered the solution to the problem, as it does not describe the actual act of opening a lock.\n7. Lastly, we analyze 'open doors' and'solution to problem' together because both words have connotations of a problem being resolved. \"solution to problem\" can be considered synonymous. \n8. 'Open doors' is ambiguous and could mean opening a garage door, an apartment door, a home door, or a locked office door. Likewise, \"solution to problem\": it could be a generic solution to any problem or a more specific solution. \n9. Since none of the choices can be narrowed down to a specific example of problem-solving, we can dismiss both of them from the remaining potential answers as being too vague and ambiguous.\n10. If we ignore this point, we can also dismiss E: open doors because it directly contradicts A: turn lock.  Instead, we choose to eliminate B: pocket, D: pocket, and E: open doors together since they are all too specific for the context of the question and are unnecessary to answer the question adequately.\n11. That leaves C: solution to problem and A: turn lock.\n12. The reason C is not the answer is because the question doesn't provide enough information for C to be viable. We don't know exactly what the solution to the problem is, so C could not be the answer.\n13. A: turn lock is the best answer for several reasons: Turn the key, opens the lock. This is a statement of cause. Turning the key opens (the lock). Turning the key is the cause of opening (the lock). There is no other choice that is a statement of cause, so this is the best choice. \n14. Therefore, the answer can be narrowed down and the answer is A: turn lock.

Choices:  E: no change A: nickels B: dimes C: pennies D: twenty-cent pieces\nRationales: The question implies that what we are predicting is a person who is very stingy, tight-fisted, avaricious, greedy, grasping, calculating, cheap, misers, stingy.\n1. We know that the cashier is expecting that he will pay her and then receive change back.\n2. But if he would be described with the given descriptive adjectives, he would be the sort of person to not take change.\n3. We know that no one would give him change to the change that the cashier would give him.\n4. He should be returning to the cashier the money that he was given to begin with.\n5. So, the cashier would say no change to what he gives her, so the answer is E: no change.\nAnswer: E. no change\n\nInput:  I'd say that he has made the decision to stay, I'd say that the dog was on the run, What's been going on here, she cried. Choices: A: the sun is out B: I'm fine C: I've been sick D: I've been lost\nRationales: \"I'd say that he had made the decision to stay\" indicates that she is looking for the specific reason he is staying.\n1. The sentence \"that he has made the decision\" refers to what the dog was doing.\n2. The dog had made the decision to run, the dog was on the \"run\" which is not something someone can make a decision to do.\n3. The question asks \"What's been going on?\"\n4. So it is likely that he has been lost at some point.\n5. There is no indication of any other activity that the dog was", "answer": "D: say you're welcome"}
{"text": ", pocket, pocket, solution to problem, open doors. 'Turn lock' doesn't necessarily involve 'getting out his key', and neither does 'pocket'. 'Solution to problem' is also vague.\n5. While 'open doors' indicates 'getting out his key' - this also suggests that he's home and would not need to open any doors. \n6. Therefore, the only plausible answer is A: turn lock. \n7. Another consideration is that he would need to leave his bike somewhere while he turned the lock. \n8. If he has already done that, he will simply be able to ride it home.\n9. Therefore, the most logical answer is A: turn key.\n10. The correct answer is A: turn bike lock.\nAnswer: A. Turn Bike Lock\n\nInput: If I was an insect I would rather eat sugar than have no food for a week, the phrase'sugar' in the sentence refers to a kind of what? Choices A: candy, B. liquid C. substance E. food\nRationales: Sugar is often used to refer to sweet food or liquid, and substance refers to an essential or necessary something. Both choices seem likely possibilities to describe the phrase, but it is helpful to break up the word according to its parts as an aid in figuring out what type of sugar it refers to. Eating sugar over starvation is like eating over other things because starvation can sometimes result in eating the wrong things.\n1. To make the distinction stronger, it should be mentioned that eating candy and other sugar food is better than starvation-causing habits- because people often crave and look for sugary foods in stressful situations.\n2.

{"text": ", open doors, solution to problem, pocket and pocket.\n5. We eliminate turn lock and pocket because he is already taking his key out to open a lock and he already got his key; therefore, both options are unnecessary.\n6. He did not get out his key to find a solution to his problem, so we eliminate solution to problem.\n7. Although, it is possible that he got his key so that he can find the solution to his problem, however, this is unlikely because all the other choices are more descriptive.\n8. Hence, the most logical conclusion is that he got out his key to open the lock.\nAnswer:  B: turning lock\n\nInput: Everyone in the orchestra is a what? Choices: A: musician B: director C: performer D: audience member E: music critic\nRationales:\n 1. The given question states that there are musicians, directors, performers and audience members.\n 2. However, among the given options, the one that refers to all of them is \"musician\". Hence, an orchestra generally includes all these people.\n 3. The director and the audience member work on the production of the performance.  On the other hand, the performer is involved with the music's performance on stage.\n 4. The answer is B: director.\n 5. Director is a general term which refers to both director of music performance, and director of theater production; therefore, musicians, performers and audience can be all music-directors.\n 6.

He went to the store and got some food for dinner.   C. He got a plane ticket and flew to the top. D. He went home to think about it. E. He started to climb the mountain.\nRationales: The problem is the artist needs to get to the top. The artist knows the mountain is far away so he has to think about it. Now he thinks of many ways to get to the top but the best way is climbing. Climbing is a thing he does to get to the top so the correct answer is E. He started to  clim", "answer": "B: night sky"}

The options of turning the lock and solving the problem are too general, so they are eliminated.\n6. \"Pocket\" could refer to both his key and his bike lock, though the latter option doesn't follow the context of the question and also doesn't fit with the answer choices. Only A and B remain. A is eliminated because if he is ready to bike home and has his key, he should probably also know how to open the lock.\n7. Therefore B: turn lock is correct.\nAnswer: B : Turn lock\n\nInput: A lens can be added to a camera to help it what? CHOICES:  A: zoom in B: zoom out C: be thinner D: capture more light E: capture less light\nRationales: A zoom lens refers to a lens with a variable focal length. This allows the user to adjust the field of view to a certain degree, making it easier or more accessible to capture close-ups or long-range shots.\nThe answer can be narrowed down further based on plausibility. D: Capture more light and E: Capture less light would make the camera easier to view and use, but it doesn' need to concern the user how the captured light is altered.\nB: Zoom out - means the lens is capable of capturing more light and is not something that the camera can do all by itself (e.g. a lens cannot unzoom itself).\nC: Be thinner- This would only effect the look of the camera, without benefiting the camera in any way.\n\nAnswer: A: zoom in  \n\nAnswer: B : zoom out\n\nInput: The word 'dreadnought' is used to describe what kind of ship?

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket and open doors.\n5. Out of these choices, we can cross out turn lock, solution to problem and pocket because these actions are more likely to occur after you already have the key in your hand.\n6. Similarly, we eliminate open doors, as it is irrelevant to the question; however, it is also likely to be done at the same time as turning a key.\n7. This means that he may have turned the key (action preceding pocketing), but he isn't going to solve the problem with the key.\n8. Therefore, the most likely action that comes out of getting the key is pocketing the key, however, since we have already used this option for one of the other options, we eliminate it for being redundant.\n9. Finally, we can conclude that the remaining choices are turn lock and the action preceding turn lock.\n10. By comparing the remaining choices, we see that the last option mentions the key opening a door - this is the action that occurred after turning the lock.\n11. Therefore, based on the question, we can conclude that most likely, he had turned the key before pocketing the key, then proceeded to open a door.\n12. So, the answer to this question is D: turn lock.\nAnswer: D, turn lock.\n\nInput: A farmer plows his land in a rectangular pattern to allow for easy access to the resources.\nChoices:  A: circular pattern B: rectangular pattern C: diagonal pattern D: square pattern\nRationales:\n1. The given context makes a farmer's pattern logical and relevant.\n2. The option B: rectangular pattern can clearly and logically fit into the context of the given question.\n3. Among all the listed options (Circular pattern, diagonal pattern and square pattern), a rectangular pattern is definitely the most logical among them.\n4. So, a rectangular pattern is the most plausible for farmed fertile land.\nAnswer: B, rectangular pattern.\n\nInput: This is the only way for you to know for sure, you will really love it,  if you give it some time.\nChoices:\nA: The end of the summer\nB: It's only 600 miles from New York City\nC: An hour and a half of walking\nD: A half hour of running", "answer": "C: do work"}

Likewise, D: open doors is done after getting out the key, thus it too can be eliminated. \n7. Pocket can also be avoided since a pocket is not the type of thing that holds a key (if you're holding the key, what are you holding it in?)\n8. Last, getting a key out of a pocket is not necessarily the only thing one would do when getting ready to use the key. \n9. Therefore, the only remaining choice is E: open doors.\n10.

Choices: \nA: What Liz Johnson learned from her aunt B: What Liz learned from her aunt C: How Liz came to appreciate her heritage D: The meaning of a summer day in August E: How heritage can be more than words\nRationales:\n1. The question asks us to identify the main idea, so there is no need to interpret or understand the text.\n2. The central point or main idea usually provides the answer to the question \"So what?\"\n3. The first sentence states: \"Each summer, I visited my aunt in the tiny town of Pryor, Oklahoma.\"\n4. This statement could mean many different things, but the question asks what the main idea is, which does not mean what the central idea is, but it is a little abstract.\n5. We eliminate A: What Liz Johnson Learned from Her Aunt because the article does not offer any information.\n6. B: What Liz Johnson Wrote from Her Aunt: The second sentence tells us that after talking and playing games, she would visit her aunt in the kitchen.\n7. C: How Liz Came to Appreciate Her Heritage: It implies that heritage means more than the words we have been given.\n8. D: The Meaning of a Summer Day in August: The last sentence states: \"It took being away to understand, but I came to look on summer in a new way.\"\n9.

Choices: 1: a: animals b: seeds c: soil d: water e: rain\nRationales: There are several issues that need to be solved: there is no food, so people didn't grow; if people didn't grow, there is no soil to plant seeds, so there was no plant to grow food and people didn't help plants grow because they had to grow themselves\nInput: What's the best way in which people could prepare to go?

Choices A: have a good social situation B: manage a workshop C D: fix a computer E: fix a relationship\nRationales:1. The question indicates a book about how to do something.\n2. The answer choices are given by different book titles - how to have a good social situation, manage a workshop, or fix a relationship.\n3. Among these, 'fix a relationship\" can be categorized as how to \"manage\" a relationship- but the author, according to the question, is not trying to teach someone how to manage a relationship. They are trying to teach someone how how to fix a relationship.\n4. Another plausible solution is 'fix a computer'. Although the question doesn't mention a computer, the author may refer to a relationship as a computer or a system that needs to be fixed.\n5. However, 'fix a computer' doesn't match the context of the question, so it is eliminated.\n6. Finally looking at the remaining options, 'how to have a good social relationship' is a very broad term that could refer to anything. 'Manage a Workshop' is a somewhat specific term but doesn't specifically refer to a relationship in the same sense as 'Fix a relationship', so it can be eliminated.\n7. Coming down to the last two options, they're both relatively vague terms that can easily apply to a relationship or anything else. They both could represent how to 'fix a problem' or how to'manage a problem' which is very similar to each other. Additionally, both are too broad in content to make a definite conclusion. \n8. Therefore, the answer to the question is C: fix a relationship.\nAnswer: C :fix a relationship\n\nInput: You didn't think about the money when you spent it.

Choices:  Choices:  A:: it could get ruined B: it could get wet C: it might get stolen D: water could damage it\nRationales: The answer is C: it might get stuck.\n1. \"John knows\" is an indication of someone who already knows not to use a cell phone in a bathtub.\n2. There is no need to ask John if he already knows. The way this question is phrased indicates that he knows.\n3. \"in the bathroom\" would be a correct answer if John was someone who recently got the cell phone instead of somebody who already knows it.\n4. Outside of the context of the question, \"in the bathtub\" is most likely referring to water being in the bathroom rather than someone using their bathtub frequently.\n5. \"your cell phone\" is an incorrect answer as it does not address that John is aware of bathrooms in general, not their own.\n6. It could also be assumed that John's question is actually not referring to the use of the cell phone in a batroom as it wouldn't make sense to ask \"if it is okay to use it in a bathroom.\"\n7. Out of the given answers, D: \"water could damage it\" could work as an explanation but does not directly address why the person \"should never\" use their cell phone in water.\n8.

Actions B: Pocket, C: Solution to problem, and E: Open doors are in fact actions that are consistent to being set to bike home; however they imply an action that would only result in the problem getting smaller, not in the action of opening a bike lock for the door in which the lock is secured. \n8. Thus, the best action could be considered D: Open doors, as it indicates in fact a direct action that one would take to open the door after getting the bike locked.\n9.

G: will you let me take on a task outside of my job description?\nRationales: a: The phrase \u201ca tough question\u201d could be interpreted as both positive and negative. Since we have a lack of context for this question, it could be interpreted as the question was already made, or it could be the question the boss asks. If it is already made we want to pick the question that seems the most difficult in the context of the job the boss is asking it in. We know the question must relate to the boss, and since he is in a position of power, the questions that seem the most difficult in that context are probably the best. c: This question seems the most difficult because it forces the boss to think of a weakness to explain. Other options such as G: will you let\u2026, F: are you in\u2026, and D: What are we\u2026 are all questions that allow questions to be answered easily. e: While this question is difficult for the boss to answer because it makes him think, it isn\u2019t the hardest from the workplace perspective. G does not allow for a clear answer and F allows for a yes or no type answer, not letting the boss explain further. d: E is the most difficult to answer for the boss.

Choices:  a: she felt abandoned B: she felt cheated C: she felt mislead D: she felt lied to E: she felt rejected\nRationales:1. The question describes a situation, but it does not tell us how the person felt.\n2. The statement, \"She didn't hear his confection, then she felt terrible,\" shows that there is a feeling associated with the outcome of not hearing his confection.\n3. To find the answer, we must find the correct feeling that the previous confection caused.\n4. Out the options given, the one that best matches the given information is 'felt terrible'.\n5. Rejection does not have to imply a negative feeling and is therefore unlikely to describe the person's feeling given the confection.\n6. The other options given, abandonment, mislead, lied to, and cheated, describe a specific event, therefore; these feel similar to how the person would say they felt after not hearing her confection.\n7.'mislead' or 'lied to' may be the right option if the confection contained a lie, however; as the question does not have to do with whether or not the confection contained a false statement, these are not the correct answer.\n8. 'feeled cheated' may also be incorrect if this was meant literally or if the confection contained something to gain her trust.\n9. Therefore, the answer to the question can be concluded to be: she felt terrible.\nAnswer: A : she felt terrible \n\nInput: What can a person use?

C: solution to problem does not provide necessary information to explain why the person decided to return their key to their pocket.\n8. Next, we eliminate D: pocket because it is too vague.\n9. We narrow it down to E: open doors since it includes the action of opening a door.\n10. This is the best solution to the problem of \"what was he ready to do?\", which was to bike home. \n11.

Choices: A: I have always been very strong B: I had lots of rest C: I was not worried D: My father was also a boxer E: I was excited\nRationales: From studying all the given answer choices, we can infer that the question refers to 'how a person got a big punch.' One of the first choices can be eliminated because being strong does not necessarily refer to boxing. The other can be eliminated because sleeping is not a 'punch.' The fourth option is confusingly worded. 'Lots of rest' can simply be reading a novel or watching your favorite TV shows. It is difficult to infer how that would help build strength. The fifth is a possible answer. Boxing is a sport that requires lots of training, and a father who also was a boxer may have influenced the answer choice as well. The last has a plausible explanation. If someone is really excited about something, he/she may be able to 'punch' things harder than normal. We can conclude that the answer is B. \nAnswer: D: My father was a boxer\n\nInput: You are a good boxer, so you punched the bag and it sounded like what?Choices: A: boom B: dirt C: glass D: wood E: noise\nRationales: The last choice clearly indicates that the answer describes the noise made when a strong punch lands on a hard surface.\nThe other options all refer to the action of punch", "answer": "E: house"}

The term \"pocket\" could be used, however, if he hasn't already gotten out his key yet in order to use it to turn a lock. \n7. Also, the choice of \"solution to problem\" could represent 'opening doors'. \n8. The choice of 'open doors' does not specifically address the problem of opening a lock, it simply describes the action of opening doors.\n9. It does not make sense to get his key before needing it. \n10. The given option of turning a lock would best describe the action of getting the key out, as the key allows opening a lock and unlocking something. \n11.

The person is waiting for a taxi and the street is dangerous, indicating that it is late in the day and/or evening and the danger is after dark. It is also mentioned that a person is waiting and not driving.\n2. \"The street is dangerous after dark\" is the statement that is important to note. This indicates that the danger is after dark which leads to the need for a choice, IV..\n3. The most logical choice would be IV. As the statement that is important in the question is \"the street is dangerous at night\", that would not apply to the choices I, II or III.\n4. Furthermore, the need to take a taxi to the destination is noted in the question. That means, for this, the person driving would not be him/herself, but rather the taxi driver.\n5.

Choices: A: concert B: bar C: concert hall D: music hall E: coffee shop\nRationales: The question tells us that the friend needs to be picked up. We can assume the friend will appreciate if something is done for them, so we know the friend needs to be rescued. Therefore, the friend will need to meet up with a rescuer that can take them somewhere.\nThe question tells us that he is a friend in need that needs to be rescueded.  The question tells us that they need to meet up.  Therefore, the answer is C.\nAnswer: C. concert hall\n\nInput: The man is planning to go to a city in what country? Choices: A. Britain B. Canada C.

What else needed t be done? Choices: 1.  A: sealing cracks B: finishing walls C: installing a ceiling D: finishing the ceiling E: sanding floors\nRationales:1. The question describes a carpenter finishing the laying of the floor in a room, which suggests that they have done an important part of the work of building a room.\n2. The floor is the base of the room and the other parts are attached to it. This suggests that the work is not done at this point.\n3. The choices A, B & C give us a clear idea about the carpenter's jobs. \nA: sealing cracks: Sealing cracks does not directly relate to finishing the laying of floor in a room, unless we can presume that floor laying is likely to produce cracks since it is not perfectly flat and thus is not sealed by any material.\nB : finishing walls: If walls were finished, then the remaining part of the work is sealing cracks.\nC :installing a ceiling: Installing a ceiling is done after laying of the floor finished.\nD :finishing the ceiling: Finishing ceiling is not done after laying of floor finished as floor is the base of laying of room. \nE: sanding floors: Sanding floors would be done after finishing of ceiling, not floor.\nHence, the best choices for the given answer options are A & B.\nAnswer: A & B.\n\nInput: The boy had a problem with a bicycle.

This means that if he is able to open a lock using the key, the other two options do not fit well.\n7. Therefore among the remaining options, 'bike home' was not mentioned as an action. \n8. As his action of using the key is to 'open doors', answer option D: pocket is the only one that can be eliminated.\n9. So, if he is able to use his key to turn the lock, then he will likely open the doors.\n10. This means that the most logical choice is answer option: 'use key to open the lock'.\nAnswer: D: use key to open the lock\n\nInput: An overweight boy was getting bullied at school for being fat.  But he had a very important mission, he was on a crash diet what did he want to do about it? Choices: 1A: change schools 2A: take action 3A: tell on the bully 4B: call his doctor 5B: leave the situation 6C: stop being fat 7C: make a plan\nRationales: Here we have a set of four choices, which will help us answer the question about what the boy wants to do; he can either change schools or he can take action. He can either tell the bully off or he can call on the doctor for help. He can leave the situation or he can stop being fat. He can even make a plan. So the correct answer is B: call his doctor/make a plan. A) Change schools was eliminated from the question directly as he is overweight so will have more bullies.\n2.  Answer B 3.  C 6.  C 7.) C 8.

Out of the remaining choices, the one that is closest to what he would likely do next is pocket - to store his key. Other choices such as solution to problem & open doors are too vague or irrelevant for this context.\n8. Therefore, the answer should be \"C: pocket\".\nAnswer: C: pocket\n\nInput: What is the opposite of having the patience to wait for a train?

It means to hold calmly and endure pain, suffering, or annoyance. (2: Having the Patience): This answer is wrong because it is not an explanation but a combination of verbs (of +ing/base form).

This is because 'open doors' is used to describe a situation where someone has to open multiple doors without any lock. \n6. From the context of the text, we can deduce that since he got out his key then the door is probably locked, and so he needs to open the door in order to bike home. \n7. Thus, B: open doors is the correct answer.\nAnswer: B - Bike home", "answer": "B: california"}
{"text": ", pocket, pocket, solution to problem and open doors. \n5. We eliminate turn lock and solution to problem because those do not seem to be applicable in the given situation.\n6. Pocket is the place where we usually keep a key, so we leave it for now.  The only action left is open door.\n7. The given choice also includes open doors, however, this only suggests opening a door of a building and does not specifically refer to what the key was used for.\n8. The only option that fits the description is'start to bike'. We already know that he was ready to begin the journey.\n9. The given statement says that he 'got out his key and began' to something which means that the question is actually: \"How did he start biking?\", whereas \"begin to bike\" would be a correct answer choice.\n10. \"To bike home\" doesn't directly describe how he started, \"start to bike\" is a more specific phrasing that answers the question. Therefore the answer is D: open doors.\nAnswer: D; open doors\n\nInput: The only reason that he wouldn't ask him out was if she was what? Choices: A. Cranky B. Unsympathetic C. Angry D. Picky E. Flexible\nRationales: First, this question asks which reason would prevent the man from asking a woman out on a date. It is clear that the woman did not end up going with the man on a date because the question is asking what happened.\n2. The given options are A. Cranky, B. Unsympathetically, C. Angry, D. Picky, and E. Flexible.\n3. The three options we remove are the two options of A. and B.. because they are not relevant in the context of the question, and E. is irrelevant because it is not mentioned elsewhere in the question.\n4. As for the remaining two options that are relevant, we begin by considering the man's side of the problem; when we look at the word choices, we immediately notice that A. and B. describe a woman while D. and E. describe a man. This gives us an extra piece of information to use when attempting to solve the problem.\n5. D. is a description of a man who is either shy or who hasn't made the", "answer": "D: popularity"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. 'Turning the lock' and 'opening the door' are not part of the action of unlocking the home. \n6. Option 'Solution for problem' is too vague and broad as it refers to the process of finding a means to overcome obstacles.\n7. 'Pocket', 'opening doors' and 'pocket' all describe actions which can be taken after keys are taken out or unlocked.\n8. This leaves just two choices which are relevant: 'turn lock' and 'open door'. \n9. 'Turning the Lock' describes the actual act of opening a door once a key is unlocked. \n10. Therefore, the solution to 'find the answer' is option A: 'turn lock'.\nAnswer: A: turn lock\n\nInput: An employee who is a workaholic is unlikely to be rewarded what? Choices: A: time off B: salary C: recognition D: promotion E: incentives\nRationales: The question asks about an employee who is a \"workaholic\" in relation to the concept of \"reward\". \n1. A workaholic is a person who has an unhealthy addiction to work, which means that they do not have time to focus on their personal life. \n2. A workaholics obsession with work can adversely affect their performance in a workplace, as they do not have time for health and recreation. \n3. This has no effect on how their employer perceives them, which is why they are unlikely to be rewarded with \"time off\", \"salary\", \"recognition\", or \"promotion\". \n4. An incentive is a reward for doing a certain task and being a workaholic has no impact on performance. \n5. Hence, the employee is unlikely to be reward with incentives. \n6. Thus, option \"E\" is the correct answer - the workaholic is 'unlikely' to get 'promotion'.\nAnswer: E: Incentives", "answer": "D: feel happy"}

None of these choices could match the action of opening the bike lock with the key.\n6. 'Open doors' is ambiguous, could mean the general action or action with a specific object (the key). The choice can't be eliminated.\n7. Therefore the only choice that can be assumed to be the action he was performing after getting his key could be the one that most closely matches the given options - 'open doors'.\n8. Therefore, the answer to the question is E: open doors. \nAnswer: E: open doors\n\nInput: The team had no right to complain.  They lost the game because they had too much trouble. What did they have most of all? Choices:  - A: luck B: lucky breaks C: time D: talent E: ability\nRationales: As the team lost the game, this means they failed to win it. The question then says they lost it because they had too much 'trouble', which could mean difficulty or difficulty caused through outside factors, such as other teams playing well or an unfortunate event.\n6. When we compare the difficulty presented by the other teams' performance against their own talents, we come up with the conclusion: they don't have the talent to overcome the challenges. This is supported by the fact that the game was 'won by team B'.\n7. The choices can be narrowed down to the following: A: luck, B: lucky breaks, C: time, D: talent, and E: ability.\nHowever, we can eliminate C: time immediately: it is impossible for a team to 'run out of time' when the game is over as they already played it.\n8. Next, we eliminate D: talent. This is because it has a different meaning from the given context, as winning the game does not depend on a single specific talent. The talent possessed by a group is a combination of skills that come together as a whole rather than a specific talent that has helped them in the past.\n9. Lastly, we rule out E: ability.

So the answer must be either A: turn lock or B: pocket.\n7. When we analyze the context, we know that he has locked his bicycle before the action in which he is ready to bike home and get his keys out.\n8. Therefore, it makes sense that he is turning lock since it is unlikely that he would get his bike out to bike home when the lock was still on without opening it.\n9. He must have previously opened the lock, meaning the action of turning lock might be confusing, however, according to the answer choice, the answer must be B: pocket.\n10. So the correct answer is B: pocket.\nAnswer: B. pocket.\n\nInput: Where would you expect to find a microphone used in a recording studio? Choices:  microphone stand A: tv B: radio C: mic holder D: microphone boom E: mic stand\nRationales: First we see that the question asks us where we might expect to find a microphlone found in a recording studio, which means we only have to look for it in the recording studio.\nSecondly, it asks us to examine the given choices and see whether we can eliminate any of the answers based on what is stated in the question.\nHere we are able to eliminate choices A, B, C and D because none of them make any sense in relation to a recording studio.\nFinally, the given answer is E: mic stand, this is correct, since the others would not make any sense in a recording studio.\nAnswer: E, mic stand.\n\nInput: The lasting impact of the battle at Gettysburg can be summarized with what?

Thus, we conclude D: pocket to be the correct answer as the answer states directly what he will do to begin leaving to go home.\n6. The given answer choice D is the only one that directly states what he can do to leave. So, B: pocket is the logical choice.\nAnswer: B. pocket\n\nInput: She got to the top of the hill, but she couldn't find her pearl necklace there.  Where else could she look? Choices:  (A) under the rocks (B) under the bushes (C) under the stumps (D) under the trees (E) under the roots\nRationales: The first logical statement: She got to the TOP of the hill, so she cannot be searching under things on the top of the hill. \nThe key part of the question: But she couldn\u2019t FIND her pearl neckace there, which she probably did not LOST but DID NOT FIND. Hence, she did not find her pearl on the TOP of the HILL. \nThe question was about where she can look for it after not finding it on the top of the HILL.\nHence, The answer would be (C) under the STUMPS.\nIf she couldn\u2019t find the pearl on TOP of the hill then, she can\u2019t find it there.\n\nThus, as B is the top of the hill & the pearl is a rock.

Lastly we can eliminate 'open doors' because it doesn't make logical sense. \n6. The only remaining option left is 'open door' which is the key action that someone would do when they are ready to leave their residence. So, the answer would be 'open door'. \n7. Therefore the answer is A: open door.\nAnswer: A open door\n\nInput: People often describe someone who is lazy as being lacking what? Choices: B: incentive C: motivation D: enthusiasm\nRationales: The question informs us that people often describe someone who is 'lazy' as being 'lacking something'.\nWe eliminate choice 1 as it is unnecessary since the wording of the question already provides the required 'lacking of something'.\n3. Now consider choices 2 and 3. 'Incentive' and'motivation' mean basically the same thing with a slightly different connotation. Therefore, they can be replaced with each other.\n4. Next, eliminate choices 4 and 5. Both 'enthusiasm' and 'joy' are inaccurate in the given context. As we see from the context, no enthusiasm or joy is required to be 'lazy'.\n5. Lastly eliminate 'zeal' as well.\n6. Therefore the only possible choice is 'incentive'.\n7. Hence the answer is D: enthusiasm.\nAnswer: D Incentive", "answer": "E: harmful"}

He could not have just pocketed his key and walked away without unlocking the door. This would only result in him being locked in and unable to bike home. \n7. Thus, we can eliminate turn lock and pocket. \n8. Although the other choice may appear to indicate bike, it simply denotes the action of entering a vehicle.\n9. The right answer is most plausibly 'open doors', as it refers to unlocking and opening the door of a house.\n10. Hence, answer B: opening doors.\nAnswer: D open doors\n\nInput: The carpenter thought the cabinet they built in the basement was for what? Choices: B C D\nRationales: The statement describes a cabinet that was built by a carpenter in the basement. This means it was probably for personal use.

This leaves us with two options: C: opening a lock, and D: opening doors.\n8. While the sentence doesn't tell us which lock he opened, if the person opened his keys and began to open doors, he is most likely referring to the front door in which case it makes more sense that he would have opened a lock first, rather than being confused over several locks.\n9.

Therefore, the most plausible options are A: turn lock and B: open doors.\n7. Out of the two, 'turn lock' is the action that fits in the context the best, as 'turn' usually refers to a specific type of physical action. \n8. Option B: open doors fits here too, indicating that when he was ready to bikeys home, he opened the door to his home.\n9. But when there is a conflict between two plausible options, it is usually better to choose the more specific one, and that is why A: turn lock is the answer.\nAnswer: A Turn Key\n\nInput: They hired me for a job without discussing wages, is that what will happen next? Choices A: I will accept  B: I will reject  C: I will not say  D: It will be decided  E: I expect them to hire\nRationales:\n1. They hired me for the job, without discussing any wages suggests that the job offer was made without negotiating the salary.\n2. Now the question asks what will happen next.\n3. Whenever you get a job without negotiating the salaries, there will be one of possible outcomes.\n4. They either give you the offer and your have a job or you reject it and are unemployed.\n5. This leaves us with only two options, C: I will not state or D: Wages will be decided.\n6.

Choices: A: stuck on a rock B: broke C: too late D: stuck in mud E: in the water\nRationales:  1. First, let's note that the question states he ran to the school.\n2. Rushing to a destination is usually accompanied by one of two things: stress in trying to finish an ongoing task, or haste and urgency due to the need to reach a desired destination. \n3. This implies that he ran to the school due to some reason.\n4. Among the given choices, something being'stuck on a rock' or'stuck in mud' is most likely associated with running to a destination.\n5. The problem is not so significant, but something being'stuck in water' or 'broke' is not likely associated with running to school.\n6. Finally, something 'being too late' is not likely accompanied by running to a destination either, especially a school. \n7.

Out of these options, only 'pocket' and 'open doors' are nonsensical as they do not refer to anything he could do after getting out his key.\n6. Therefore the answer options are likely to be either 'pocket' or 'open doors'. \n7. 'pocket' is the most applicable as this would refer to either pockets where his key currently resides or putting something in his pocket in order to have something to do next. \n8. 'open doors' is not the best option as this would mean that he has not locked the door, creating an opening for unwanted entry or theft.\n9.

This process uses mineral water and what else to support the plants? Choices:  a: air B: fertilizer C: electricity D: pesticide E: sunlight\nRationales: The first part of this question states the problem of hunger and how it could be solved. It mentions that it is a possible solution to grow vegetables in a hydro-pant system, however as we go to part \"B\" it is now a question of \"This process uses mineral water.\"\n1. So, part \"B\" asks us to identify that mineral water is one of the three other things needed to support the plants for hydro-ponics.\n2. Out of the five answers given: A: air, B: fertilizer, C: electricity, D: pesticide, and E: sunlight, only the last three are possible supports for vegetation in a hydroponic system. \n3. Pesticides are toxic chemicals. They are usually not used in hydroponics as these vegetables are eaten raw. \n4. 'Sunlight' refers to visible light which cannot normally be controlled, only filtered. \n5. So, we now have D: pesticide and E: sunlight as the only possible supports that are not listed by the other three answer options. \n6. Out of these options there is only one that has not been eliminated and the one that has not been ruled out is 'E: sunlight'. \n7", "answer": "C: mass hysteria"}

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors. \n5. There are three mentions of pocket and key. \n6. We can eliminate A: turn lock as \"turn\" is a very specific physical action, and its only purpose is to turn a lock. A lock can be turned both in its locking as well as unlocking processes. If we assume that lock was unlocked, it's logical to exclude A. \n7. The given options also contains E: open doors, which could be a result of turning a lock.  However, this also makes it unsuitable as the best answer choice, since it gives away the meaning of the other choices.\n8. Similarly, B: pocket, does not make much sense since turning a lock is not necessarily the pre-requisite of placing things in a pocket. This can be concluded by eliminating option B. \n9. D: pocket also gives away much the same information as the other choices, it's logical and safe to eliminate this choice.\n10. Only two options remain - C: solution to problem and E: open doors. \n11. If we assume that the lock had been turned, it can be concluded that the rest of the task was to reach the door. \n12. Since we already know that the only way to get to the door is to open it, the best option is E: open doors.\nAnswer: E. open doors \n\nInput: The boy with a balloon got out of the blueberry bushes.

A boy did get out of the blueberry, indicating that he had just cut a balloon out of the bushes. As we eliminate the options that don't fit the context, the options that we're left with are \"thrown\" and \"inflated\". While A: release is possible, it's not a plausible thing to do to a broken balloon, therefore eliminating it. From now on, all we care about is what's reasonable to do to a broken, inflated balloon.

Which one would you rather be? Choices:  * 1. A: work B: school\n* 2. A: home C: vacation\n* 3. A: work D: playtime\n4. A: college E: bed\n 5. A: boredom F: sleep\n6. A: work G: vacation\nRationales:  1. The question asks us to choose between the options which one of the two kinds of people in this world we'd rather be.\n2. \"There are two kinds of people\": the first person is at work by default, and the opposite person is never at work.\n3. This eliminates option 2 A: home because this person is at work by their nature.\n4. Looking over the remaining options, the opposite person would be at vacation, as this is what they are not at by default.\n5. Thus, if we were to choose between the two kinds of people, we would prefer to be the opposite person, the one who is never at work, to be a vacationer by default.\n6. Therefore we can eliminate the options: A: work, A: home, and A: vacation.\n7. Lastly, we find that the opposite of work is playtime. This explains why the person would prefer to be the one who is never (playtime) at work.\n8. The other given option is G: vacation.

Pocket and bike home are actions that are only applicable after the lock has been opened, not while getting the key out or before. \n7. A: open door and B: pocket do not completely answer the question.\n8. Out of the remaining, A: turn locks makes the most sense because while turning the key is an action that the person can do while getting it out, it is unlikely to come before bike home.\n9. Therefore, the solution to the problem is most likely A: turn lock.\nAnswer: A. turn lock\n\nInput: The kitten meowed and scampered over to the toy box.  He climbed on top of what, hoping for something fun to play with?  Choices:  A. toy B. bed C. paw D. table E. blanket\nRationales: The answer choice is:\nA. toy B. paw D. blanket E. table\nThe kitten is referring to something that he can actually touch rather than a place he can sit at. The bed is not a toy; it's part of the furniture and a place to sit. The paw is part of the kitten. The blanket is not a toy, it's a nice cover for the bed or a place where the kitten can lie or sit. The table is a physical object that the kitten can climb on, grab, or sit on.\nAnd finally, the toy box is where stuffed animals and other toys can be tossed out at random or kept for special events. The toy box is the only thing the kitten can actually climb on or play with in the room.\n\nAnswer: The correct answer is:\nB. paw\n\nInput: She was so happy that she won a car.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. Although A: turn lock, C: solution to problem and D: open doors could suggest unlocking a lock, they cannot possibly suggest that the key is out.\n6. Turning the key, for example, would just be opening the lock once in the first place, and the key would be back in the pocket.\n7. Similarly, any solution to a problem might involve using the key to open a lock, but it's unlikely that'solving a problem' would necessitate getting the key out and then putting it back in the pocket afterwards.\n8. So, all other choices except for E: open doors must also indicate being'ready to bike home', including the action of opening the lock.\n9. Since E: open doors only hints at preparing to leave in the sense that the lock has been open, it is not considered to be a plausible choice.\n10. That leaves us with answers B: pocket, C: solution to the problem, and E: open doors, which all indicate what the key was being used for - the action of 'opening a lock'.\n11. So, the answer must be either of the choices A: pocket or B: pocket, as a key is usually placed back in the pocket afterwards and not'solving a problem'.\n12. Furthermore, if solution C is selected, there must be an option which excludes it as well.\n13. The only options that seem plausible are E: open doors and B: pocket, as any choice involving a problem must exclude 'pocket'.\n14. Therefore, the most plausible answer would be B: pocket, because it indicates both'ready to bike', the main intention, and 'opening a lock' which is the intended action of the key.\n15. So, the answer would be B: open doors.\nAnswer: B. open doors\n\nInput: The kids were playing with dolls in their house.

Therefore the riddle is either B or D, the key might have a bunch of different tools on it to open the door lock and solve the problem, so he can turn and open lock and pocket. The riddle doesn't specify, but the key is a lock, so probably both turn and open lock as well as the keyhole in combination with the lock to open the door.\nAnswer: D, it could be a keyring with all the different tools on it.\n\nInput: There are multiple reasons why the wolf howls,  it might be the moon, it might be hunger, it might be to signal what type of what? Choices A: animal B: person C: human D: group E: animal friend\nRationales:    1. The question tells that the wolf howls to signal the different things he/she encounters.\n2. Among the given options, the moon, hunger, group, and human are all things that the wolf could encounter and may be related to his/her actions.\n3. Option A: animal friend is a vague option which does not directly reflect the given information.\n4. Therefore, it reduces to only 2 options left: D: group and E: animal friend.\n5. Out of these two options, E: animal friend does not directly relate to the wolf howling, so it can be eliminated since the question itself says that the wolf might be signalling something.\n6. Hence, the answer will likely be D: group.\nAnswer: D group\n\nInput: A person can only be a person if they possess what?

The options that have \"pocket\" in it are (b) finding his key in his pocket and (c) finding his keys in pocket.\n7. This is too specific, so it's not a realistic option. The same logic can be applied to the first choice that has \"turn lock\" in it.\n8. So, only the last choice is left: \"finding his key\".\n9. The choice is likely to be \"finding his key\", as it is the only action that is not a specific action (such as a person putting their keys in their pocket, or using their key to open a lock).\n10.

This leaves options 'A: turn lock ', 'B: pocket'and'C: open doors'.\n7. As we can conclude from the given choices and the context of the question that opening the lock is only one action toward going home, we can remove the option 'A: turn lock '. \n8.

In this case, the phrase 'pocket' can refer to either an object or a container.\n7. The term pocket is a common term for any small container.\n8.

Out of the remaining choices, 'turn lock' does not make sense as he is leaving.\n7. 'Pocket' can simply refer to him putting his key away. \n8. 'Pocket' only makes sense if we assume that he is going home, in which case, he would most likely open a door instead of pocketing. \n9. This leaves us with 'biking home' and 'open doors'.\n10. Now, 'biking home\" means that it is time for \"him to ride his bike\". \n11. This does not imply that he would stop his bike short, take out his key and open a lock.\n12. Lastly, 'open doors' is the only other answer that makes sense. It may or may not be referring to his key, which is why we cannot exclude it from the answer.\n13. Also, although \"open doors\" is a phrasal verb, it is also logical as he may have gotten out his key in order to open a door to go back home.\n14. So, the answer of \"biking home\" does not make sense. The only other plausible answer is 'open doors' that make sense\n15. therefore, the answer is E 'biking home and opening doors'.\nAnswer: E: biking home and opening doors\n\nInput: What does a pony express mean?

If the baby is not drinking her bottle,  she is what? Choices: A: thirsty B: overfed C: satisfied D: nauseous E: healthy\nRationales: Consider the options D, E, A, B, and C.  Think about the order in which they describe the things that happen to babies when they refuse to drink their bottles of water. \n1. D is the mother putting water in the bottle, E is the bottle itself, A is the formula, B is the baby's need of water and nutrients, and C is the baby refusing to drink. \n2. A, B, E, and D are all \"givens\", meaning they happen automatically. \n3. Only C is incorrect, because it should read \"When they refuse to drink formula or breast milk, the baby is actually asking for water\", or \"When they refuse to eat solid food, the baby is actually hunger for water\". \n4. Therefore, C doesn't hold as much validity. \n5. From here, what you should do is look at the remaining options to see which ones are inconsistent with what you have already learned.

There are three given choices that would support the idea of logic: \"logic\", \"fact\", and \"experience\".\n4. Out of these options, the most logical choice to support the idea of logic is the latter, \"experience\". \n5. We can reasonably conclude that if there are \"things in this world everyone takes away from [their] experiences\" then these experiences are logical.\n6. Thus we can conclude that experience is a good way to add credibility to an argument, as it includes logic and facts from the experiences of the other person. \n7.

We know that 'to turn lock' requires a key,  and the question mentions the biker 'got out' his key.\n7. Therefore we eliminate turn lock.\n8. The remaining options can be eliminated for three reasons: \n    a. Solution to a problem is not a physical action so doesn't apply. We know he got his key out, there is nothing else he needs to do except open the lock, so the logical conclusion is that he is going to open it.\n    b. Open doors is also not a physical action and doesn't appear to be needed before he can open the lock. It is also unlikely that he opens his door at the biking station and begins biking.\n    c. Similarly to the previous option, we know he is not going to biking station, so this option doesn't make sense either.\n9. The phrase 'he began' indicates an action, therefore it is more likely he does one of 'pocket' or 'open'. \n10. Pocket and Open are direct physical actions, and can both be applied to open a lock.\n11. The action of pocketing does not seem plausible considering the key would have to be put in the pocket while biking. \n12. Since it is physically impossible to put a key in the pocket and open a lock at the same time while biking, thus it is most likely he is applying open to the action of opening the lock.\n13. Therefore, the answer here is more plausible to be 'open' than 'pocket', and the question can be reformulated accordingly to 'open' the lock.\nAnswer: C Answer: A\n\nInput: She bought some nice looking potatoes, but they all had what?

'Pocket' is also a possible action that he can take, however, it is inappropriate for the context.\n7.

The option A: a person that is cooking an omelet means that he or she is cooking an omen on a stove and not boil. Thus, the person is not in the given case.\n3. The option B: a chef that a good cook means that the person is a chef that is a gokd cook. However, the question talks about the person being cook that is good on boiling eggs.

This type of collective imagination is referred to as \"false memory syndrome\", where a certain set of beliefs are collectively implanted in a person's mind.\n3.

This was often the case for myths and folktales, where a story or legend would be believed by certain groups.\n4. If they were to be believed, these stories would pass down generations as myths. This is similar to the way beliefs about God, angels, and other supernatural beings are passed down through religious practice within a group.\n\n## See Also\n\n### Common Article:\n[Grammar Test 201](GrammarTest201.md) [Prev](GrammarTest199.md) [Next](GrammarTest-201a.md)", "answer": "A: smell smoke"}

The first two are out of the question, which leaves turn lock and open doors as potential solutions for the question.\n6. Opening a lock is only a possible solution if the key you use to do so is actually a lock picking key, which in this case is unlikely.\n7. A lock is opened with a key, not picking. So, the answer must be B: turn lock.\nAnswer: B. Turn lock\n\nInput: A young woman wearing a red jacket is running towards the park's baseball field to meet her grandparents.  She's from where? Choices: 1. A: new york 2. B: california 3. C: kansas 4. D: georgia E: pennsylvania 5. F: bangladesh\nRationales: Start by identifying the given statement: a young woman wears red jacket and runs towards the base ball field to meet her grand parents.\n2. The given statement can be interpreted as: the young lady has already gone to the park and the baseball field is probably not far from where she stands. Therefore, all the options but F, Bangladesh, would fit (given).\n3. After understanding the given statement, identify the options: A, New York, B, California, C, Kansas, D, Georgia, E, Pennsylvania, and F, Bangladesh.\n4. Note down that the options excluding \"New York\" and \"Bangladesh\" do not mention any person\u2019s \"running\".\n5. Also note down that the young lady is running towards the baseball field but does not need to meet her grand parents if she already has them with her and is going with her. A, B and C are not possible to answer.\n6. To choose an option among D, E and F, notice that they also do not mention any person running.\n7. Therefore D is eliminated. Since Pennsylvania is one of the four eastern states whose capitals are Philadelphia, Boston, Richmond and Charlottesville. Therefore, it needs to be considered as an option. However E is also eliminated from the list since it does not mention \"grandparents\".\n8. Therefore the answer is F: Bangladesh.\nAnswer: F: Bangladesh", "answer": "E: wet"}
{"text": ", pocket, and open doors.\n5. The action of pocketing or turning a lock is not specific to unlocking the door. \n6. The given option \"to open the door\" is also vague since it does not specify to which door. This rules out D: pocket and E: open doors.\n7. Only option B: turn lock directly relates to the situation since a key, by itself, does not imply that it is being turned to turn a lock.\n8. Therefore, the answer to the question is A: turn lock.\nAnswer: A turn lock\n\nInput: He is happy because he knows he will receive the money soon, so what should he do with the money he has before it is taken away? Choices: \nA: put it in savings  B: keep it in savings C: spend it  D: invest it E: save it\nRationales:\n1. The given statement indicates happiness, which is usually an emotional response.\n2. Emotional response is often associated with the outcome of past events and expectations of future events. Which explains why the man in the statement is happy because he knows that he will receive the money sooner.\n3. Now, the choices given are: put it in savinings, keep it in savings, spend it, invest it, save it.\n4. Out the given choices keep it in saving is the most specific to putting it in a savings.\n5. There are two options which can be generalized to saving: A saving and saving it.\n6. Spending it is the easiest to avoid since it is against the rules of the question since his money will soon be taken away and he is not to spend it.\n7. Investing it is an action performed by a person to make a profit with the use of money. In this case, if his money will be taken away, he will no longer be able to invest it.\n8. He can keep putting his money in saving in hopes that his money will grow more later, which is option A: put it in savins.\n9. Or, he can keep it in savings until his money is being taken away because there is only a certain amount given to him. Which brings to an end to the possible of the choices: keep it in savins, put it in savins, save it.\n\n10. This leaves us with only option", "answer": "B: new mexico"}

{"text": ", pocket, pocket, pocket, and pockets.\n5. A literal analysis of turn lock, which would involve the action of turning a key, does not match the stated action of 'opening a lock'.\n6. The word 'opening' does not have any logical meaning for pocket, thus, this option is eliminated.\n7. This leads us to the conclusion that the chosen option must be turn lock.\n8. Since we already know that the man had to turn his key to unlock his bike, we can substitute this detail (his key) with the literal term in the question, that is, 'turn lock'.\n9. Thus, the answer turns out to be E: turn lock.\nAnswer: E. open locks\n\nInput: At a music festival, what would a concert-goer appreciate? Choices:  [None of these] A: noise-canceling headphones B: a chair C: earplugs D: shades E: a pillow\nRationales: First, we analyze the question that is asking about a music festival.\nIf the concertgoer attends a music festival, then it is a logical conclusion to say that they will appreciate the music that is played at the event.\nTherefore, the appropriate response should include the word \"music\" in the answer. Choices A, B & D are not options since they do not include the term Music.\nChoice a) None of these options does not include the term music.\nChoice C) Earplugs is the only option with Noise in the word, but this is not related directly to music. Hence, earplugs do not satisfy our hypothesis and are, therefore, eliminated.\nOnly Option B) chairs does mention music. Therefore, chairs should be our best response to this task.\nAnswer: C B.

{"text": ", pocket (can mean different things), solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. Since the question states that the person got out his key, and the options A, B, C only allude to actions related to opening something, we can eliminate A, B, C.\n6. If the question stated he was ready to bi-cycle home, \"bi-cycle\" could be written as \"bike as you two cycles\". \n7. In this case, we can eliminate D as it is not possible to do anything. 'Bike as you two cycles' might mean as you go on a cycle journey, however, this is not relevant to 'biking home'. \n8. From this, we can conclude that the answer is E: open doors (using the key).\nAnswer: E: open doors\n\nInput: The baby kitten was very small and so adorable when she came home. She was cuddled and what? Choices: A: cared about all day long B: loved intensely C: pampered D: fed E: disciplined\nRationales:1. There is only one correct answer in this question.\n2. First, identify what the adjective 'adorable' modifies \u2013 the baby kitten - and determine what the correct answer should be.\n3. Next, we use the correct answer to see if any of the other possible choices (the alternatives) fit the description.\n4. The given options could all describe the baby kitten.\n5. Therefore we cross out options such as: C pampered, D fed, and E disciplined because they do not match the description of adorable.\n6. We rule out option B: loved intensely because it doesn't provide much detail. Love can exist between people without being overbearingly intense.\n7. The answer choice that conforms most closely to the description of adorableness is A: cuddled and loved. \n8. Therefore, the correct answer is A: cudddled and loved.\nAnswer: A : cuddled and LOVED\n\nInput: One of the problems with the city is the huge volume of  traffic in certain parts.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors. \n5. 'Turn lock' and 'pocket' are the same action and is most likely not the answer. \n6. The only possible actions are'solution to problem' and 'open doors'.\n7. However, 'open doors' doesn't seem likely because the doors he plans to open are probably his own, and the question doesn't provide any detail about the door he will open.\n8. Therefore, the remaining choice, since it is the only other possibility, is'solution to problem'. \n9. He is only interested in his solution to his problem before bike, and not any of the others. \n10. Thus, he is most likely looking for his key because he has his key with him so he can lock it up later. So, the answer must be'solution to problem', which is most likely not a problematic choice.\n11. For the question,'solution to problem'' matches the context perfectly to the only question in which the only answer is'solution to problems'. The answer is C: solution to problem.\nAnswer: C; solution to problem", "answer": "C: natural habitat"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, and open doors.\n5. Among these, only pocket and open doors refer to actions that involve a key, and only pocket does not require a lock.\n6. As turn lock and pocket both refers to key open a lock, it eliminates both of them. \n7. Thus, out of pocket, solution to problem and open doors, only solution to problem does not require a lock, and solution to problem is not mentioned to begin, end or be part of the process of biking home.\n8. Pocket is just a place to store something and open doors is just taking the key and unlocking doors that are directly relevant to leaving or going home.\n9. Only solution to problem refers to opening the lock and biking home, and it does not even mention turning the lock. This supports the given statement that the action included getting out his key (of which solution to problem is likely). \n10. Therefore, the answer must be D: solve problem.\nAnswer: D. solve problem\n\nInput: I made my best guess based on incomplete information.   All I knew is that if he was able to get into college it would have been a big deal, and that was the only thing I was certain of. I had to guess. Choices:  A) It was unlikely Choice: A) It was unlikely\n\nRationales:\n1. The statement says I made my best guess.\n2. 'Best guess' usually means making the correct guess the first time without any more information, so this means I made my first guess without any further information.\n3. I only knew that if he was able got into college is a big deal, and this indicates that I did not have any further information.\n4. Thus, the given statement is a description of what was done.\n5. This question tells us we should answer 'yes' because the answer would have been 'likely', if I had had more information.\n6. The fact that we must use the answers which would be given in the \"If you had more information\" condition shows that we need to have information or the answer will be \"Unknown\".\n7. Therefore, we answer \"Yes\"\n\nAnswer: Yes\n\nInput: The dog ate the baby. The baby cried. The mother was angry. The man was upset.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. Solutions to problems are not commonly used to lock things up.\n6. \"Open doors\" is not plausible in this context as a solution to his problem.\n7. \"Pocket\" would not have been necessary unless he forgot something, so the other choices are disregarded.\n8. The only remaining choice is B: turn lock, which indicates that the action of opening a locker was being undertaken.\n9. Therefore, the answer to this question is B: turn lock.\nAnswer: B. turn lock\n\nInput: He didn't take the advice seriously because he was very good at what? Choices: B: swimming C: talking D: thinking E: skiing F: reading\nRationales:1. The question first tells us that the person did not take the advice seriously.\n2. Taking advice for serious means that there is something important or critical about the advice, not just general encouragement.\n3. The question then tells us that he was good at swimming, a physical activity. That would make him good at water sports, such as swimming, or perhaps even surfing or sailing.\n4. \"Thinking\" is not a useful skill when it comes to water activities such as swimming, and \"skiing\" and \"reading\" don't seem like relevant skills either.\n5. Out of the remaining choices, B: swimming seems like the most logical choice. Taking advice seriously about a water sport doesn't seem likely if you're not very good at it.\n6. Thus the answer is C: swimming because 3.\nAnswer: C. swimming\n\nInput: Which of the following is the capital city of Georgia?

'Solution to problem' indicates that an issue is present which the key or an action of key usage would solve, however, this does not seem to relate to the context of the question or answer.\n9. 'Open doors' does not directly relate to the action that the given key will be used to complete.\n10. The choice that best fits the given context, and the words used, is E: open doors.\n11.

{"text": ", open doors, pocket, solution to problem, and pocket. \n5. 'Turn lock' is not necessary unless it is a combination, but even then, it is not specific to just his bike. 'Open doors' are also common actions that do not relate to the context. \n6. As for 'pocket', it could mean the pocket of his bag or jacket, but it seems out of place that he would have to take out his key in order to get into those pockets. \n7. The only remaining logical choice is 'pocket' as in 'pocket the key', which is the action of storing it from view. \n8. Therefore, the answer must be D: pocket, in this case storing his key while he prepares to bike home. \n9. However, this means his pockets are the reason he is not yet ready to bike home because he has his key but can\u2019t find the lock that it belongs to. \n10. Therefore, if he cannot find his lock, he remains unready to bike home. So, the answer would have been, D: pocket, except that he is not unready to bike because of his pockets. Therefore, the answer to the riddle is E: solution to problem.\nAnswer: E. He is unready to bike/ solve the problem of not having a lock anymore.\n\nInput: A hunter is looking for a squirrel.  His best chance for success is what? Choices: A: waiting for sunset B: hiding in a tree C: using a net D: shooting the squirrel dead E: taking a day off\nRationales: Out of the given possible answers,'shooting the squirrel dead' does not seem to be the most ideal answer to the question. \n1. Firstly, in the question, it is stated that the hunting method is the hunter's best chance at success. \n2. Additionally, the choice describes the action of killing the squirrel while other methods leave the prey alive.\n3. Although'shooting the prey dead' would be effective, it would also be a waste of effort, as the squirrel could have been caught in other ways leaving it alive for rehabilitation or consumption.\n4. Furthermore, the choice violates the given context, in this case hunting, as", "answer": "E: getting tired"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. Among them, the only reasonable solution to unlocking his door is pocket.\n6. He would not turn his key and begin to turn lock, as it is not a common way to unlock a door.\n7. He also wouldn't just pocket as there is no information about whether or not he has a key.\n8. Lastly, the action of opening doors could simply be the action of holding the key in his hand, in anticipation of opening the door upon reaching it.\n9. So it doesn't directly refer to unlocking a door.\n10. There is only one reasonable solution to opening a door, as it is a commonly used method to unlock a house in this context, and that is to simply enter pockets. \n11. Therefore, 'pockets' is the answer to the question part.\nAnswer: B and C: turn lock, pocket\n\nInput: He had seen the bear before. What was it? Choices: 1. S.O.P. 2. F.L.S. 3. G.B.O. 4. D.R.G. 5.

F.O.S. is the most accurate acronym.\n\nIII. F.O.O. is also an acronym. F.O. is the same as F.O.S., as the second letter is S.\nAlso, the first letters of F.O.O are F.O.O., with a O in the middle.\nThe second letters of both F.O. and F.O.S are O. So, 2.

B: bike home indicates that he has finished preparing to go home, and E: open doors indicates that he is attempting to open the door.\n7. Therefore out of B: bike home & E: open doors, it is logical to interpret open doors as an action performed at the very end, and bike home as the conclusion that implies he is finished doing everything he needed to do.\n8. We also note that B: bike home can also be interpreted as the solution to the problem of getting ready to bike home at the beginning. \n9. Hence, the answer of choice E: open door would still make sense since he is attempting to open a door at the end.\n10. Therefore, the answer to the question is E: open doors.\nAnswer: E. open doors.\n\nInput: You may get 100 for your homework and 90 on the test, that makes you a what?

The first and last option do not make any logically consistent sense. \n\n   Option D: C-\n    A. C- indicates a passing grade, however, since you are getting 100 on your homework and only 80 on the test, the resulting grade should not be a passing grade. \n    B.

'Pocket' and'solution to problem' are more general terms.\n8. 'Pocket' suggests that the key was meant for a specific pocket, meaning the person was not planning on using it elsewhere; on the other hand,'solution to problem', like turn lock, is a general term. \n9. The use of a key, which is usually meant to open something, is most likely not used for these purposes. \n10. From this information, 'open doors' is the most suitable response to the question.\n11.

'pocket' means storing something in a bag or pouch which the question does not necessarily suggest he is doing.\n7. Since the question refers to the action of opening the door, the next best answer would be open doors.\n8.'solution' could simply mean a plan when the question only refers to preparing for departure.\n9. Next, we consider the only sentence that has both 'open' and 'key' in it and eliminate options pocket and open doors. \n10. 'pocket' and 'open' are both action verbs, and 'open doors' is a complete sentence. Thus, the only one that makes sense would be open doors or open the door.\n11. Opening the door using the key is more likely than putting the key in the pocket to be used later because the 'opening' phrase is right in the question, whereas 'pocket' would not be.\n12. Given these conclusions, the best answer is E: open the door.\nAnswer: E.open the door\n\nInput: A large group had organized an excursion, the plan worked out to be unreasonable.  Something was missing from the plan, what was it? Choices: 1. B: food 2. C: transportation 3. D: information 4. E: entertainment\nRationales: The question asks for the missing piece of a plan. The statement implies that the plan had failed because it was \"unreasonable\".\n1. First, we eliminate any option that contradicts the reason given in the first part of the question.\n2. Since food is a common \"piece of a plan\", for example, meal plans, it is highly unlikely that it was missing.\n3. Therefore, A: Food cannot be the answer. Next, we eliminate anything that does not provide basic information.\n4. In the question given, transportation is already provided in the statement, 'unreasonable plan', implying that it is not missing in the plan.\n5. Similarly, information is highly specific to plans, and it is unlikely that the large group failed to provide information to its members due to inadequate planning.", "answer": "D: beach"}
{"text": ", open door, pocket, and solution to problem.\n5. From these choices, the term pocket can be disregarded because it does not directly concern the action of using a key to open a lock.\n6. In the same manner, we can also disregard opening door. \n7. Since the question specifies a key, which opens locks, thus the answer cannot be a door.\n8. Furthermore,'solution to problem' does not relate to key and lock. \n9. Therefore, to solve the problem of the key and lock, he must use it to open a lock and not a door. Hence, option B: turn key is logically correct.\n10. The given choice of A: turn lock is incorrect because of two reasons: first, they don't use the term 'pocket' to distinguish turning the lock from using it. Second, they don't mention key in the question, the only mention of key is in the answer of choice B.\n11. Option C: pocket is not correct as it does not relate to opening a lock and is a general term.\n12. Finally, option D: open door is irrelevant because keys are normally used to open locks, and they are never used to open doors.\n13. The given option E: open doors is also incorrect for the same reasons given for option D.\n14. Therefore the correct answer is B: turn it.\nAnswer: B. turn it\nInput: If you're looking for a good book to pass the time during your vacation,  what is the best thing to do?

'Solution to problem' is a very broad general term without being specific to entry into a building.\n8. The only term that logically fits as the action the person did next is 'open a lock', as that is what someone gets out a key to do, and the choice A: turn lock is the best option.\n9.

The mummy is an Egyptian individual with traces of a mummification process and preserved remains, including internal organs, found in a grave.\n3. The question specifies the gender of the mummy is a \"woman\", which typically refers to females.\n4. The given options could refer to any kind of disease, however there are far more types related to the brain, respiratory system, and skeletal system.\n5. For example, there are far fewer types of heart and skin diseases.\n6. Among the given options, the word describing a disease with most variation is 'disease' in relation to all types of diseases.\n7. We can narrow the answer options by finding ones that do not match the definition because 'heart' and 'lung' describe medical issues within the organs named.\n8. Therefore, the answer must be one of the other three.\n9. 'Disease' is a generalized term, therefore the options cannot be narrowed to include or exclude it.\n10.

Choices:  Yes: A: yes it is B: probably C: of course D: no it is E: no\nRationales:1. The question asks if it is easy to ride a bikeyes closed.\n2. If it were easy, we would see people do it more often.\n3. As mentioned in the given statement, it is very difficult to ride a bike without looking.\n4. The phrase \"yes it is\" is an informal way of talking that suggests a casual expression of agreement rather than a formal, serious, or thoughtful way of agreeing.\n5. It implies that the given answer is 'probably' or 'of course'\n6. This is because we can see why someone might ride a bike with their eyes closed and the result of this seems likely to be trouble.\n7. Therefore as the phrase 'of course' is a simple way of agreeing and also suggests that it is likely something most people would do, the answer is B. The given statement also implies that most people would have trouble riding a bike with their closed.\n8. Conversely B seems to also apply to the question D.\n9. The phrase \"no it is\" seems to be most closely related to D. D also implies that the answer would be 'no' to the question of whether it's easy to ride a bikeit closed. \n10.

Choices:  D: bury them A: eat the food B: take care of his mom C: ask for help E: find more food\nRationales:  1. The question is trying to figure out what the person's answer was to the baby being hungry and crying. \n2. We can assume the baby would start talking to the mother, and this option is not given.\n3. Next, we can eliminate 'bury them' because this is incorrect. \n4. 'Ask for help' is out because it's a plausible response to the dilemma described in the question. \n5.'Take care of his mom' and 'find more food' are logical choices, but are not specifically described in the scenario.\n6.'Eat the food' is a likely answer but is not specifically mentioned, therefore, we can eliminate this answer and choose B: talk to the mom.\nAnswer: B; D: eat the food\n\nInput: A: How did the little boy know he had eaten a magic mushroom?

Run Towards You: This doesn't make sense as the dog has already eaten and has no more appetite for more food. 2. Run Next To You: Run next to me is not a coherent question and doesn't make sense in context as it needs clarification for the meaning of me. 3. Run After You: Run after you isn't correct as dogs should always run towards you and can't be asked to do otherwise. 4. Run in Circles: Run in circles doesn't make sense because dogs can run only in a straight line unless it's intentionally running in circles. 5.

'Open doors' does not make logical sense because it's impossible to open doors with just a key. Therefore, it cannot be the right answer.\n7. 'Pocket' and'solution to problem' do not directly suggest unlocking things either. They suggest storing or using the key for various activities. \n8. 'Turn lock' is a viable choice because the person is turning a lock.\n9. However, 'turn lock' does not refer to when the key is used to unlock an object. It could also mean that the key is turned to open something, like a drawer.\n10. Out of all the given options, 'turn lock' has a closer relationship to the actions that the key is involved in. \n11. Therefore, 'turn lock' is the most logical answer. \nAnswer: B: turn lock\n\nInput: There are two kinds of people in the world: those that make things happen and those that ___? Choices: \nA: let them happen B: have things happen C: happen to them\n1. the given statement tells us that there are two types of people in the world, those that make things happen (the first two) and those that HAVE things happen to them (the last two).\n2. 'Let them happen' and 'happen to them' could be two different things: 'let them happen' suggests that the people are 'letting' (in the sense of approving) whatever happens. Whereas 'happen to them', suggests that the people are unknowingly/unknowingly experiencing it, they don't let it happen, it happens to them.\n3. Out the remaining choices, A: let them happen, doesn't make logical sense to fit the situation because we were given the information that the people were those who HAVE things happen TO them.\n4.

Choices:  C: person A only E: person A only F: person B only G: both people are equally generous H: neither of them are generous\nRationales: The question asks us to compare two scenarios to determine which is more generous. \n1. It suggests that we compare two people: Person A gives away little, in other words, they do not give out much or very little in their entire lifetime.\n2. While person B gives away something important in their lifetimes, what this term implies is dependent on the context. It could mean that person B gives something of high-value importance or sentimental value.\n3. Therefore, two comparisons may be drawn from this premise.\n4. First, we may ask if person A is more generous than person B. \n5. If the high-context inference above is correct, this would suggest that person B is more generous because they have given away something important in their lifetime.\n6. Alternatively, we may ask if they are equally generous. In this case, person A would be considered more generous because they give away small amounts while person B gives away something meaningful during their lifetime.", "answer": "B: mall"}

Choices: A: clean oven B: prepare pastry C: grease pans D: bake bread E: heat up oven\nRationales: First, let us read about what it means to be a baker in the question. \nThe question tells us that the first thing the baker must do is to clean the oven. \nIt also mentions that a baker must be good at greasing pans, baking bread, and heating the oven.  This leads us to the conclusion that a baker must use oil or fat to grease pans.\nBaking bread involves using the oven to bake bread and heating the ovens involve using the oven. This tells us that the oven has to be clean before a baker can use it for heating, greasing, and baking bread.  In most cases, ovens become greasy and need to be heated and cleaned at the start or end of every baking project.\nSo, cleaning the oven is the first thing a baker should probably do. This can be substantiated by choosing options B and D.\n\nAnswer: B: Clean Oven\nInput: People in the Southwest have a unique way of naming baby girls.

Another option is \"low tax\". However, this tax could be imposed on any type of individual regardless of their income.\n5. There may be an exception for those with low incomes, but it's not stated in the question.

However, by saying \"it's very hot\" despite being restless she might be referring to the temperature in the room.\n2. If her symptoms are only heat and she wants to be cooled down but not cold, then she might be referring to \"hot temperature\" from a stomach ulcer - \"stomach ulcers can also cause feelings of hunger and nausea, and symptoms of vomiting, stomach pain, and frequent bowel movements.\" - Mayo Clinic\n3.

He would likely try to salvager the food by what?\".\n\nThe given statement talks about the person's actions. It is certain that the individual is incompetent and would not be able to salvage something that can't be salvaged, because salvaging is what they would do if it can be salvaged.\n\nThe only real action that the person can take that has a 50:50 chance of salvaging is 'Adjusting the ingredients'. They would change it into ingredients that is suitable for what they want to cook, but this would still have chances of making it bad, because they can't make everything into food since they have to use different ingredients than they have. Therefore, the answer that fits better is 'adjusting ingredients'.\n6. Lastly, answer A is incorrect because the author would have stated this earlier before answering the question (throwing it away would make it obvious the person didn't even know how to cook). The option B is wrong since there is mention of ingredients, not everything about the cooking process\n\n7. Option D would suggest that the person tried to cook regardless of the fact that the recipe is inedible, and the final option is wrong because it doesn't take into consideration of how ingredients are used for cooking and would likely throw away inedible food waste for the process.\n8.

She thought she looked great, but what did her mother think  of her? Choices: \nA: cute B: gorgeous C: pretty D: stunning E: dainty\nRationales:  1. We first understand from the given statement that the woman met her girlfriend's parents after getting her hair and makeup professionally done.\n2. The woman looked great in her opinion, but her mother thought she looked...  This implies that there is a difference of the opinions between her mother and she.\n3. Looking at the options provided, we can eliminate A: cute.  A cute woman is one who is innocent, which does not describe the woman's situation.\n4. We can also eliminate B: gorgeous. The word \"gorgeous\" is used to refer especially to a woman, therefore the woman's mother thought she was gorgeous, not the woman herself. \n5. Next, we can eliminate C: pretty. The word \"pretty\" refers to something that is almost attractive but not quite fully there. The woman was satisfied with his hair and make-up, which does not contradict with pretty.\n6. We can next eliminate D: stunning. The term \"stunning\" is usually used to refer specifically to a woman, whereas the statement does not.\n7. Lastly, we can eliminate E: dainty, as dainty does not describe someone who is extremely attractive. \n8. Therefore, only one option remains, and that is...E: dainty\n\n\n\n### Input", "answer": "B: feel pressure"}
{"text": ", pocket solution to problem, pocket, and open doors. \n5. 'turn lock' only refers to the use of a key to turn a lock, and is not necessarily the same as 'opening the lock' with a key.\n6. There is only one option which mentions 'opening the lock': 'open doors'. This choice also includes 'biking home', so this implies that the action 'to begin to open the door' and 'to bike home' might happen together.\n7. Another option is 'pocket', however, it is not mentioned with 'open the door' or 'biking home' and does not relate to the word 'lock'.\n8.

Choices: 100C/212F 40.9C/105.6F 41C/105F 40.1C/104F 39.5C/103F\nRationales: In this situation, let's assume that a \"normal\" body temperature is 37\u00b0C. When a person has a fever of what temperature is the body above normal?\n1. When a person's body temperature is over 37\u00b0C, the person has a fever.\n2. We can see this from the given choices.\n3. However \"40.9C\" and \"44.1C\" are the lowest the body is allowed to register.\n5. This would mean the person has only a mild fever, but has a body temperature higher than normal.\n6. Therefore the answer: \"fevers\" refers to elevated body temperatures, notably over 37\u00b0.\n7. Hence to have a fever means you have a temperature over 37\u00b0 (which is \u2033fevers\") which is above the body's normal (37\u00b0) which is the temperature it maintains when not ill.\n8. Therefore \"fever\" means to have a temperature over \u203337\u00b0\"\"or 100.4F 100.1F 99.0F 105.8F.\nAnswer: A", "answer": "D: lap"}
{"text": ", open doors, pocket, solution to problem, and pocket. \n5. We know from the context that 'turn lock' does not fit into the situation, as it mentions the action of getting his key, which is not about turning a lock.\n6. Thus we know that 'pocket' has to do with either 'opening doors', 'pocket', or'solution to problem'.\n7. However, 'opening doors' cannot apply since this person is already leaving his house.\n8. Also, 'pocket' refers to a general sense of carrying a set of keys or a bike lock. This still doesn't make sense in the given context.\n9. Therefore, the only option left is'solution to problem', which refers to using a bike lock lock. Therefore, the answer must be D: pocket/solution to problem.\n10. Alternatively, \"Solution to problem\" is the entire statement, not an option that should be added to D: solution to problem.  \n(See the following comments for why I think this is true)\n\n  * 1.

It may be just an action the person takes at the start of operating a bike or motorcycle. \n6. Pockets and open doors do not necessarily suggest any connection with unlocking a lock. They may just imply that the person has things to do once they get where they are going.\n7. Therefore we eliminate A: turn lock, C: Pocket, E: open doors and D: solution to problem.\n8. However, B: pocket fits in well with the context of the question, so we arrive at B: pocket.\n9.

Choices:  a. the types of animals a project is related to b. the type of animals available for study or protection c. the type of animal that will benefit from the project the most d. the conditions animals are subjected to e. the type of animals in an area\nRationales: First, analyze the question. \"When working on a project involving (animals), it is necessary to set clear goals. People will know what to work on better if these goals are clear.\" You know what the project is about, and the goal is more likely to be to protect the animals. This might be more of a scientific project, with different researchers working on sub-sections of the project with clear goals. The project may also focus on education related to animals, which is likely to include researchers from many different fields and students.

Choices: A: waits B: goes home E: asks another student C: gets a pen D: gets up E: thinks better\nRationales:1. The question asks about a student who already knows what her professor is likely to answer.\n2. This also means what her professor is going is unlikely to change her mind about the answer.\n3. Therefore, the student is unlikely to be bothered with any questions about the assignment, or, in other words, the student is likely to have confidence in her answers.\n4. Out the given choices, we can eliminate E: waits, D: goes home, E: gets up which are unlikely to affect the student's confidence in her answers, and C: thinks better because it is not a common practice.\n5. The only choice that can be used is, B: get a pen and which is more consistent with the given information.\n6. This way, the student is more likely to go get a pen to take down notes of her professor's answer.\n7.

E: This story uses very long words.\nRationales: Consider the question as it is phrased and the given choices A to E: \"In what way is this the maximum or largest number of...\" 1. The story in this example has multiple words in it, therefore, the author, in this scenario, uses the most amount of words in the story that they wrote. 2. The author only used certain kinds of words to write, although the words were all used and a part of the story, a maximum quantity of them were used. 3. The author did not use any long words or very long words in his story. 4. All the long words that the author used were used at least once to tell part of the story. 5.

What differentiated this car from other cars on the road?  Choices:  A cars B license C make D look E drive\nRationales: The question is asking about the characteristics that made this car distinguishable from other cars.\n1. The most obvious characteristic is the license plate that is mentioned in the previous sentence.\n2. The sentence \"The car was shaped like\" shows that the car had a general shape that would fit in any garage or parking lot. This means the car was not \"shaped like\" a car of a specific make. \n3. Therefore, out of the given choice, only \"license plate\" stands out as a characteristic that separated this car from the others on the road. \n4. Hence, the most plausible answer to the question is D: look, as it refers to the distinguishing characteristics of any object.\nAnswer: D, look\n\nInput: What makes the house special?

Too few: This does not make the house special. There could be some things which are too few, but if those things make the house special, there are more things which could make the house specific. Also, the sentence \"The house was special\" indicates that there are other special things about the house, so too few is not a choice.\n2. Too much: This does not make a house special as well. If too little things made the house special, it does not mean that having too many would make it too special. There must be something special in a house for it to be made special.

As we can deduce from the statement that he is ready to bike home and he has already gotten out his key, it isn't likely that he would be looking for the right door, nor does it make sense to say he would be searching for the key to open the door.\n6. 'Turn lock' and 'find the key to the right direction' do not fit into the given conditions. The use of 'lock' in the sentence can be assumed to refer to a lock on the bike, which suggests 'turn' or 'lock' do not match the given conditions. Also, he is unlikely to be searching for the key of the desired destination once he has already gotten his key out.\n7. As 'find the key' is related to the search for the key to the right destination, it does not work either.\n8. 'Open the door' does not fit well, as the question talks about opening a lock with a key instead of trying to open a door. This implies the key is actually needed for the action of opening a door.\n9. 'Pocket' fits best into the question, because the key most likely fits into this action. \n10.

This is an unfeasible situation because it would violate any sense of morality and ethics. \n3. Choice 2 can be eliminated because it does not make sense for there to be no change when the key is the unlocking mechanism.\n4. Therefore, the answer must be either 2.

It is unlikely that his key would be used to turn a lock, as the action of turning a lock requires manipulating the key, but this is unlikely to be done when getting ready to bike home unless you are locked in the room.\n6. Pocketing suggests that the action following the movement is to place the item in a pocket.\n7. So, it must be used in conjunction with another action to explain that the item would be used.\n8. Open doors is similar and would require him to open the door with the key.\n9. So, if he is only getting his keys out, he either opens the door manually, or else he walks out of the room, locks the door behind him, and enters the key in the lock after. \n10. Solving the problem is also unlikely to be the next action, as this action could occur earlier, at any time, or be related to an unrelated issue.\n11. This leaves us with turn lock and pocket. \n12. So, we can eliminate turn lock, which indicates that the action following him getting his key out of his pocket must take place in the room. \n13. Pocketing his key simply means that he is holding the key in his pocket, which suggests that he is either walking, running, standing still, or some other similar action. Hence, the only answer that explains this logical sequence is pocket.\n14.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. 'Turn lock' is not a complete action.  'Pocket' is only a place to keep the key, and is not specific to his bike lock. 'Solution to problem' is vaguely defined. 'Pocket' is also a place in which to keep a key, but here it is more specific.\n6. Therefore the most relevant option is E: pocket, which indicates that he was going to try and open the door to his house.\n7. So, the answer choices are A: turn lock D: pocket.\n8. Eliminate A: turn lock because it doesn't contain as much information.\n9. Eliminate D: pocket because it is not specific for bike lock or house door.\n10. So, the answer must be C: pocket. \n11. Hence the answer is C: pocket.\nAnswer: C. pocket\n\nInput: He had a passion, for it was important in his career.  It was something he had always had and wanted to know what? Choices: A: good at B: well versed C: knowledge of D: strong sense E: talent\nRationales:  1. There are two basic meanings for the word 'passion' when used in the context of a career: \n2. (a) passion is the state of mind one gets in when one is \"strongly enthusiastic about something\" or (b) passion is a strong sense.  \n3. So, the given choices are: (a) good at, (b) well versed, (c) knowledge of, (d) strong sense, (e) talent\n4. So, \"strong sense\" can refer to the way in which an individual feels about a skill or job, and it can also mean that an individual has a greater understanding of or insight into something.\n5. Therefore the most relevant among all the terms to be used is (c) knowledge of. so the answer is (c) knowledge.\n6. So the answer is C: knowledge of.\nAnswer: C) knowledge of.\n\nInput: What does this tell us?  It tells us that even young people think that some things are better than other things.

Out of these, the specific task is to open up the lock of the door he is exiting or leaving. \n6. Choice D: pocket refers to gathering something needed for the purpose and leaving. It doesn't tell us what this action relates to or whether it is completed.\n7. From choices E and B, B tells us that he is done with the key, so he opened the lock and is ready to leave. Choice E gives us a vague action, so it is not a reliable choice.\n8. Therefore, the answer should be B: He opened the lock and began to leave.\nAnswer: B. He opened the lock and begun to leave\n\nInput: Which option could have the opposite effect than what the person intends? Choices:  (1)A: turn everything around B: do the exact opposite C: use an expression that is the opposite D: do the exact same E: do nothing\nRationales: First, we recognize the question is asking which option could have the opposite intended effect.\n2. Out of the choices: (1)A: Turn everything around, (2)B: Do the exact opposite, (3)C: Use an expression that is the exact opposite, and (4)D: Do the very same thing, only (4) is the choice that can have the opposite effect from the intention.\n3. For example, if you say \"Do the opposite of what I tell you\" with reference to an action, and the person says the opposite of what you say, they would be doing what you wanted originally. (4) D: Do the exact same thing can have the opposite effect to the original action.\n4. There is none that applies to (1) A: Turn everything around.\n5. So, the correct answer is D.\nAnswer: D.

{"text": "B: open lock, pocket C: open pocket, open doors D: open door and E: open doors. \n5. However, these solutions are unclear and specific to only a partial lock.\n6. Turning and opening a lock would require several complex actions that does not fit with the generality of the context.\n7. Also, opening a pocket is not logical as it's a solution to a lack of keys.\n8. Therefore, out of the remaining three choices, \"open doors\" answers this question most logically. \n9. So, the answer to the question is E: open doors.\nAnswer: E. open doors\n\nInput: What does \"one thing after another\" mean? Choices:  What?  A: things happened all at once B: a whole bunch of things C: one after another D: together forever E: once and then again\nRationales: The choice of question phrasing and wording presents itself as a riddle.\n1. At first sight, the question seems to pose an inquiry about what is the meaning of \"one thing after another\", but an additional analysis will reveal the question to be rhetorical.\n2. In fact, the question seeks to challenge your understanding of riddles.\n3. It's trying to imply that the question should not be taken literally, meaning that it's asking about figurative meaning of 'one thing after another.'\n4. To answer this question, we need to interpret what the riddle wants us to understand. \n5. We can take the literal meaning of 'one after another' and apply it to the rest of the sentence.\n6. We can then interpret this as meaning a series of events.\n7. Thus: \"One things after another\" means a series of events.  \n8. So, the answer the riddle seeks is A: things happened all together.\nAnswer: A. they happened all together.", "answer": "E: wasted time"}

Moreover, since he is already out with his key, he has already tried it. \n7. 'Open doors' is out of context as he's bike home. \n8. Therefore, out of the given choices, the option that fits the context is 'pocket', meaning that he put his key in his pocket with a solution to open the lock.\n9. Thus, the answer to the question is E: pocket.\nAnswer: E - pocket\n\nInput: The man was sad.  As he walked down the street, what did he do? Choices:  B1: cried  - Correct! B2: yelled A: screamed C: wandered D: sneered E: smiled\nRationales:1. The man was sad so he decided to walk down the street to try to cheer himself up.\n2. Walking down the street is an action that someone would do to try to cheer himself/herself up.\n3. Walking down the streets is a general action.\n4. As a consequence, yelling and screaming are both general actions that someone could do when they're walking down the street. \n5. However, crying happens when a person is depressed or scared and this is not the case for the man in the sample.\n6. Sneering and smiling describe behaviors that are typically reserved for interaction with people, not actions that are normally taken by a depressed or scared man while walking down the streets. \n7. Therefore, we can conclude that the man was not crying, sneering, or smiling but yelling or screaming.\n\n### Reread the questions above and check their answers.\n### Instruction and Demonstration (1) Above, we provide the instruction for the task \"Claim Reason\" in its entirety. Next, \nwe demonstrate an example that can be considered correct for this task.\n\nInput: You want your room to be cozy.  That means what to you?

There is also no need to put in a solution to a problem as he is now ready to bike home and doesn't need to solve any kind of puzzle before leaving.\n7. There is no need for opening doors either as he is on his way home.\n8. Therefore, it would make no sense to put in a solution when the need for one has not been met. \n9. Out of those given, there is only option D: pocket, which fits into the context.\n10. Option D: pocket is the only option left that fits the question.\n11. Option D: pocket would make the most sense because before leaving, he would need to put things in his pocket like maybe his phone and his keys or some change or the like. This would be the obvious choice to select.\n12. There is no other correct response for this question.\nAnswer: D. Pocket\n\nInput: John wanted to watch a movie.

Choices:  (A) having a fun conversation; (B) being distracted; (C) being relaxed and comfortable; (D) eating popcorn; (E) sharing snacks with John; (F) being hungry; (G) sleeping; (H) enjoying the movie\nRationales:1. The question asks what the friend is doing in the movie theatre.\n2. The answer to part (A) is a fun conversation. Although, being distracted is not exclusive to part (B), being relaxed is not exclusive to neither part (B) or part (C).\n3. A fun conversation is not specifically what a friend is doing. Even though the answer to part (A).\n4. The answer to part C) is being relaxed. The person reading the task can be relaxed or not.\n5. The movie theatre is not a specific place.

Pocket may be included as the action of opening a door. Since it is the only choice that can match the description, we will assume that it refers to unlocking and opening the door.\n8.

Opening doors is a more appropriate option, since he is most likely trying to open the door to his house and he has his key.\n8. 'Pocket' can have multiple meanings, and it cannot refer to a pocket bike since that type of bike is not commonly used nowadays.\n9. Therefore, the most logical option is D: opening doors.

The given statements says that the last time he saw a shark was \"20 miles away from a beach\".\n2. From this statement, we are able to infer the following information:\n  1. Sharks are most often found in oceans, not beaches.\n  2. The shark has not been swimming in shallow water.\n3. Out the given options, only B: the surface is about the surface of the water.\n4. The remaining options deal with land, so \"here\" is not a land option.\n5. Similarly, D: a city does not deal with the surface of the water, so it is not relevant.\n6. \"Here\" also means \"that place\" so the question is asking where the shark was found, not where the questioner is standing now.\n7. E: a park is also a land based location, so it does not fit the context.\n8. Therefore, the logical choice that fits all of the given statements is B: the surface.\nAnswer: B. The surface\n\nInput: You can do a lot with an ear of corn, make it in to what? Choices A. A bowl B. A soup C. A cake D. A salad E. A stew\nRationales:   1.

This eliminates A: turn lock unless we consider it a general term for unlocking a door.\n7. E: open doors is not suitable either, as it does not provide any insight towards the character's plan. \n8. Finally, we are left with C: solution to problem because the action of getting the key and opening the lock seems to be an action that is taken to accomplish a future goal.\n9. So, the best explanation for what the character was going to do next is take out the key to unlock his bike. \n10.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, and open doors.\n5. The given choices suggest actions that are unrelated to a key or lock.\n6. So we can deduce that he wants to cycle home which means that he is not going to stay.\n7. Only getting out his key and opening a lock makes sense in that context and, out of all the choices, the only one that does that is 'open the door'. \n8. Therefore, the answer must be E: open door.\nAnswer: E opening door\n\nInput: What is the best way for a city to grow?  A: increase population B: decrease C: slow growth D: decrease pollution E: protect jobs\nRationales: The question tells us that a city is growing, and it asks for best practice. So, we can safely assume that there is some sort of growth that has to be handled in a good, responsible way. \n1. When we consider the given choices, only B, C, D, and E make sense within this context, as other choices have no relation to growth. \n2. By definition, 'growing at a steady rate' is to 'increase slowly' which is in line with B, slow growth.\n3. Increasing pollution is generally not a good thing. So, it doesn't make sense to increase pollution by growing. \n4. Similarly, we can eliminate C, decrease pollution, as well as D, decrease pollution. \n5. In the end, the only answer that would allow a city to grow without a negative impact on the environment is B, slow growth. \n6. The best way a city can grow is by doing B, slow growth. This is only possible when there is decreased population. \n7. By decreasing the number of people, you decrease the number of jobs as there are fewer people to fill them.  Thus, if the city has to grow, it needs to protect jobs. \n8. Therefore the answer must be A: Increase employment rate while decreasing population growth. \nAnswer: A: Increase the employment rate while decreased population growth \nAnswer: A increase employment rate while decreases population growth \n\nInput: A lot of people hate broccoli because of how it tastes.

It could be seen to be typing but this doesn't follow through with the other parts of the question \n3. The dog was doing what, out of the following choices, would most likely be fitting for the context given in the question. \n4. From the given options, B, C, D, and E are the most logical options out of them all. \n5. We can easily eliminate C, G, E since they are out of context with the question. \n6. That leaves us with B, D, and E since the context doesn't give much information about how the dog felt. \n7.

The action of pocketing can be implied by the phrase 'He got out his key and then began to...'\n7. The phrase 'he opened doors' may conflict with his purpose of biking as he would prefer to have the doors open for him as he gets off the bike as opposed to opening the doors before he leaves.\n8. Therefore, it seems more likely that the bike home refers to biking at home, so he was getting ready to bike home as he was preparing to put his key in his pocket.\n9. The answer of choice E: open doors does not imply the specific action of pocketing, nor does it describe the process of biking home.\n10. So, the answer to this question is B: pocket.\nAnswer: B. pocket\n\nInput: A scientist can use all of the following methods to collect data EXCEPT: Choices:  A. Interviews B. Surveys C.

A scientist can use a variety of methods to collect data such as interviews, surveys, observations, measurements, physical experiments and mathematical models.\n2. Interviews, surveys, interpretations and hypotheses are different ways of collecting data.\n3. Observations are about collecting data from what are being observed. \n4. Therefore, the given options are all data collection methods.\n5. Outside of them, procedures are not specifically about collecting data, but rather are about performing experiments to test a hypothesis.\n6. So option E: procedures is logically incorrect because the question only asks about data collection and procedures cannot be used to collect data directly.\n7. Hence the choice B: surveys is incorrect. \n8. All survey data must be interpreted to draw valuable conclusions as an understanding of survey questions, wording, and choices must be considered to avoid misinterpretation. \n9.

It doesn't quite seem to fit, as the answer is \"open doors\" as he needed to open doors to bike home. \n6. Next, \"open doors\" doesn't seem to fit either, because then he would just open a door and get his bike, and there is no reference to a key here. So in conclusion, he would have just needed to start his bike and ride it home - this would be the \"open doors\" option if it was the \"start\" option.\n7. Finally, \"begin to what\" can't quite work either, as \"turn\" and \"open\" are more of the options for that what (bike, doors).

'Pocket' is used as a general term which could indicate that he's preparing to take along the key, or it could mean simply 'to put something in a pocket'.\n8. The verb 'to put' is also used as a general term for various tasks and can refer to a multitude of activities.\n9. While there may be many instances in which the word 'to put' refers to the action of 'to put' something 'in a pocket' these descriptions may also not be a specific representation of the action 'to put'.\n10. In this context, we can see that he's trying to unlock his bike and 'open', or unlock a lock.\n11. Therefore, we can conclude that the closest match of the given choices to his action is 'open'.\n12. We can also conclude that the key he took out of his pocket was given to him by a friend, the'solution to problem', or to bike home, his final goal.\n\nOutput:\nIdea:\n- We must assume we know the best answer and ignore the other options\n- Write the options in the order that makes the least sense, as if the other options weren't there\n- If there is a choice that makes no sense, but one choice that does, choose the one that makes sense over the one that doesn't\n\nInput: I made up an excuse that I would have to pay $1000 of my own money to get this job.

Choices: A: someone B: a car C: foods D: a church E: a caterer\nRationales: What would be needed for the Church to have a successful food service? \n1. As the caterer is delivering the food to the church, he would likely need a car to transport the food.\n2. Since he is taking food to the church, for the food to be acceptable, the church will be needed.\n3. If the church is not needed, there is no point in providing food.\n4.

{"text": "B: solution to problem C: pocket D: open doors E: bike.\n5. Among the five options, A: turn lock does not require the user to open the lock with a key, and B: solution to problem does not require a key at all, C: pocket is an action performed after getting the key, not the key itself, D: open doors only requires an open door, and E: bike is about leaving, not about where he plans to go.\n6. Therefore 'open doors' and 'turn lock' cannot be correct answers as they are not related to the idea of getting his key. \n7. So, we can eliminate A: turn lock and B: solution to the problem, leaving us with C: pocket and D: open doors.\n8. 'Pocket' refers to keeping objects such as keys and bikes, so it cannot provide anything to the door. \n9. 'Open doors' is what can be done using a key, and it is directly related to the idea of 'get his key'. \n10. So, the likely way he began to use his key is D: open doors. \n11. Therefore, the answer to this question is E: open doors.\nAnswer: E Open doors\n\nInput: My friend thought it was odd that some people want to have a career in nursing. Why would that person want to do something like that if they weren't good at science? Choices: 1st: that would not make your friend happy with the choice 2st: you would feel a little like this too 3th: that person does not think they have to do science to do well in nursing 4th: nursing is not science 5th: science is not in the school 6th: a science related skill for nursing could be done for free during other programs\nRationales: There are six words that are wrong in this puzzle and two of them are misleading.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. All of these options except the key action make sense in this context, except 'open doors'.\n6. We know that the question implies that he got out the key, which means he had it in his hand, pocket, or somewhere close to where he has his hands.\n7. Thus only choices 'turn lock' and 'open doors' are available.\n8. 'turn lock' is also the only one of these options that can have relevance to the key action.\n9. As a result, the chosen option can be A: turn lock or B: pocket.\n10. 'turn lock' refers to the physical act of manipulating a lock in some way.\n11. 'pocket' suggests the action of putting something away, which makes perfect sense considering that he got out the lock.\n12. So, the correct and correct answer is B: pocket.\nAnswer: B; pocket\n\nInput: A scientist researching birds might be interested in identifying what? Choices: A: their habitat B: the food chain C: their characteristics D: their nest E: their population\nRationales: This question wants the scientist to analyze certain aspects related to birds. Based on the information available, we note that the scientist is interested in identifying the characteristics associated with the birds. \nWe can further eliminate the other choices using the knowledge about the scientific process of research. A: the habitat refers to the overall environment of the bird, which may have nothing to do with the characteristics or attributes of the bird. B: the food chain refers to the organisms that a bird eats and the food chain within their natural habitat. C: their characteristics refer to the qualities of the bird, which is what is being inferred. D: their nest is a shelter that birds use for roosting and nesting, which may or may not be related to the characteristics of the bird. E: the population refers to the overall number of the species but may not be a characterizing quality of the bird. \nHence, the answer is C, their characteristics. \nAnswer: C: their characteristics\n\nInput: A group of 11 students gathered to discuss a film they saw, and the discussion evolved into the what?

As a part of the sentence \" The last thing Jack wanted,\" there is nowhere for the \"key\" to be placed in this sentence. It cannot be placed before \"was\" or after\"used, \" as there is no room to insert it. It also cannot be placed after \"his\" due to the plural tense of \"things\". Also, there is no logical reason to use \"bicycle\" or \"bike\". The only possible word to fit in the middle of the sentence is the word \"key\". \n\n### Inst: Explanation - Given the sentence, a key is the only word needed to complete it. Therefore the word 'key' is the correct replacement.\n\n\n### Task 6: Question:\n\n### Inst.:\n\nThe answer to every question in the reading test is found in the questions.\n\nHow is it possible to locate the answer in the reading test?\n\n### Dem.:\n\nIf we look at the multiple choices that follow each question, the questions often ask about a character's actions or state of mind.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, open doors and pocket. \n5. But what he really wants to do is turn the lock, so turning lock must be the correct one among these choices.  \n6. Out of the given options, the phrase 'open doors' has been made obsolete by locks and keyless entry systems since it is now rare to not be able to open a door by just turning a key.   \n7. Therefore, he should start from 'turn key' and eliminate the redundant options. The given choices are B, C, D, and E.\n8. 'Turn Key' seems to stand out as the correct one due to logic.\n9. We can now deduce that the answer is B: turn lock. \nAnswer: B: turn key\n\nInput: I had a lot of friends and was feeling a little guilty, so who did I call? Choices:  S: my mother B: my father C: my brother D: my sister E: my sister-in-law\nRationales: First, we understand from our reading that a person has a lot of friends, and that the person feels guilty, but is not sure exactly how they feel about the situation.\n2. The person goes on to call someone to relieve their guilt. \n3. As the person does not know how they feel exactly, and has a lot of people to choose from, we can conclude that they would call someone of equal significance. This usually means a close family member.\n4. Out the given options, the only option that satisfies our previous conclusion is C: my brother, as my brother is a family member and is usually treated with high significance within a family.\n5. Option A: my mother is a family member, but is not usually treated with high significance in comparison with other family members.\n6. Option B: my father is a family member, and he is usually treated with high  significance in comparison with other other family members.\n7. Option D: my Sister is a family member, though she is not usually treated with nearly as much significance as most family members.\n8. Options E: my sister-In-law and S: anyone, do not count as logical options as they were not given in the question.\n9. The answer is C: my brother.\nAnswer: C D: my brother\n\nInput: I was bored a few days ago, so I", "answer": "E: business meeting"}

We also eliminate Pocket because it doesn't directly relate to opening a lock or a door.\n7. So, there is only option that mentions biking and opening a lock: E: open doors. \n8. This means that he was ready and got out his key in order to open the door to home and leave for biking.\n9. Hence, the answer to the question is E: open doors.\nAnswer: E!: open doors\n\nInput: His mother thought she was the best at everything.  She didn't understand what the point was to life when she felt she did everything perfect;  it wasn't important to her what anyone what? Choices: A: thought B: believed C: felt D: expected E: experienced\nRationales: The question can be divided into two parts, the first being, what did his mother think and what was important to her.\n1. The first part talks about his mother thinking she was the best at absolutely everything. This suggests that her ego was too high and she thought of herself as superior than everyone.\n2. The second part of the question discusses about what his mother believed was the point of life.\n3. This implies that his mother wasn't satisfied with her own existence, but looked outside herself for satisfaction.\n4. She did not believe it was necessary to be satisfied with herself and her achievements, rather, she found her existence to be useless and unimportant without the approval of other people.\n5. Lastly we can identify her problem by looking at the options given, which include feeling, believing, and expecting.\n6. Feeling is the emotion felt, but it is not what she thought about.\n7. Believing does not necessarily mean approval from other people, so this option also does not apply.\n8. Also, expecting can be defined as hoping, but this is not the case either since she clearly states that other people's approval is necessary for her to achieve satisfaction.\n9. The correct answer to this question is therefore, D, she felt as important as other people thought.\n10. The answer is therefore D: feel as important as other people think.\nAnswer: D!:", "answer": "A: netherlands"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, and open doors.\n5. Solutions to problems and opening doors are plausible choices, given this context. However, turn lock is more specific than these two, as it specifically indicates opening a lock.\n6. Additionally, out of all the choices, the one that most directly reflects the meaning of the given statement is 'turn lock', indicating that the key in the question was used to unlock something like a bicycle or a lock.\n7. So, turning lock is the most logical option, it answers the question directly and the choice most closely reflects the information given.\n8. Hence, the answer to the question is A: turn lock.\nAnswer: A : turn lock\n\nInput: Mary ate a peach pie.  Her parents went to the store.  She got her what? Choices: A : fork B : spoon C D : fork and spoon E: peach pie\nRationales:1. The question offers a summary of a situation.\n2. The information we can conclude is that Mary ate a peche pie, her parents went to the store and she got a fork.\n3. A fork is used to eat food, so it serves as the best tool to obtain peach pie.\n4. Hence the answer is A : fork.\nAnswer: A> fork\n\nInput: John is a great leader. He is hard working, determined and honest. How many of John's strengths does it take to become a leader? Choices: A: few B: many C: one D: none\nRationales: Start by reading the question carefully. It describes John's character. Then it asks for a mathematical quantity. \n1. The given qualities indicate hard working, determined, honest and strong are the qualities John possesses, and we can conclude that he is a good person. Because he is a good person, he gains the trust of people and people are most likely to follow leaders.\n2. The conclusion from one is a natural leader. \n3. This means  John is a natural leader who possesses a lot of strengths.\n4. Out the given options, only one: \"many\", can accurately reflect John's situation.\n5.

{"text": ", bike home, pocket, hold a solution to a problem, and open doors.\n5. Pocket, turn lock, and open doors all do not relate well to the question, as they have to do with doing something once at home, and not partaking in an activity before.\n6. Bike home suggests him riding his bicycle but does not directly imply biking in. \n7. This means that the only choice that relates to what he is doing is B: get out his key and begin to\u2026\n8. Therefore, the action that he will or has to take is pocked the key and begins to open the door.\n9. So, the answer to the question is D: pocket the key and begin to open the door. \n10. A wordy way to say this is that he retrieved his key and began to open a door.\n11. D: pocket the key does not have to be followed by the word what, it is optional. \n12. Also, D: pocket the key is what he was doing, D: pocket the \u2026.. was what he began to do.\nAnswer: D-Pocket the key\n\nInput: If a 10-story building were to crash into a 2-story building, which story would collapse first?

Choices:  A-africa B-america C-egypt D-china E-italy\nRationales: Africa doesn't have any buildings taller than the Burj Khalifa in Dubai so we can remove choice (A.)  America, Egypt, and Italy have skyscrapers.  But, only one of them has the tallest building (or is it, the building with the most floors?) -- China.  This is because the choices are given to us in an order that leads us to China.  In reality, the answer is D. \nRationales: - the list of countries is ordered so that D>c>a>b>e\n\t- they all have tall buildings\n\t- they all could be taller than what? the Burj Kalifa?\n\t- Burj Kalifa is in Dubai (in Arabia) so we eliminate A because there are no other tall buildings, according to the context.\n\t- America, Egypt, and China all have skyscrapes(?)\n\nInput: Some people like how a _______ works because it can be worn or strapped on, as needed. Choices:  A - pocket sized laptop B - cell phone C - pen D - portable flashlight\nRationales: The question asks to choose a word that works with the text above it.\n(The text says that if it was a cell phone or a pen that 'needs to be strapped on' it would be a problem; but a device that can be'strapped on' like a watch or pocket flashlight is not a problem.)\nTherefore, the keyword that will help us solve this question is ______________.\n\"strapped on\" works well for B, C, and D.\nThere is no place to ______ a ______ so an _____ for it is a problem.\nBecause there is no place to strap on a phone, as given, an answer with 'phone'", "answer": "A: mail orders"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors, pocket being repeated twice. The word \"pocket\" is not the most natural choice among these options, and out of the remaining 4 options, the only one that matches the action of reaching for a key is \"open doors\".\n5. Out of this answer, \"open doors\" fits best in context with the rest of the question. So, the answer to this question is A: turn lock.\nAnswer: A; turn lock\n\nInput: He has a very expensive home that needs attention, what is he probably going to do? Choices: 1. A: get rid of the home Choices: 1: get rid of thehome Choices: 1 A: get rid of home Choices: 3. A: sell it. B: move away. C: fix it. D: put it on the market. E: get a mortgage.\nRationales: The question tells us that \"He has a very expensive home\". \n2. The phrase \"needs attention\" implies that something has gone wrong such that the maintenance of the area needs to be addressed. \n3. In context, the most appropriate option is B: move away.\n4. This is because the question hints at something being unsalvageable, such that the home should no longer be owned. \n5. Therefore, the appropriate answer is B: move away\n\nInput: When you try to make someone do something they don't want to do, they will usually argue.  Some people can argue rationally, like a lawyer.  Some people can't argue rationally and get what is called a what? Choices: A: debate B: fight C: case D: trial E: point F: decision\nRationales: Start by understanding the question. \nIt says \"when you try to make someone\" and \"they will\", so we will know that one person is making an attempt to make another person do something that they do not want to do.\n2. It also says that the person arguing back will be unable to respond rationally, otherwise they would not be arguing back\n3. Therefore, the correct choice is A: fight. \nAnswer: A: fight\n\nInput: How do you know which college or university will be best for you? Choices: \nA: 1. Look at the", "answer": "A: tennis elbow"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, and open doors.\n5. 'Turn lock' does not fit with the given context because he already had a key.\n6. We are unlikely to find a'solution to the problem' in his pocket, given that he was ready to leave. \n7. 'Pocket' will not work as the key is already in his pocket. \n8. 'Open doors' would mean he would have unlocked the lock while biking home.\n9. This leaves us with only two options: 'pocket' and 'pocket'.\n10. If he was looking for something in his pocket, the only option that makes sense is 'pocket' and the answer is C: pocket.\nAnswer: C. Pocket\n\nInput: After the rain, the car is dry.  It has a layer of what on it inside? Choices:  the car  dry, the rain the rain A: water B: dust C: rust D: dust and water\nRationales: The question mentions that it rained and that the car became 'dry,' so we know that at least some water was absorbed into the car.\n\n1. 'Dust' is unlikely to be on the car under any circumstance.\n2. 'Rust' would be an undesirable condition as it may cause damage to the car's surfaces.\n3. Therefore, the car became 'damp.'\n4. There are two options that we can eliminate. \n5. 'Moisture' is a reasonable description for what the car would be after some water was absorbed.\n6. We can further eliminate the option'moisture' because'moisture' would be a more general term that includes the more specific answer 'dampness.'\n7. Therefore, we are left with the option A: dry and the option D: dust and water.\n8. We will choose the option A: dry because it is more specific and can relate more closely to the given options.\n\nAnswer: A: dry\n\nInput: I can count to seventy-five, but I can't count to any higher.

{"text": ", pocket, pocket, open doors.\n5. We know he is going to bike home, so his lock probably needs to be unlocked for him to get on the bicycle.\n6. This means that he is more likely to 'turn the lock' than 'open the doors'.\n7. Therefore, it is a more correct option of he 'turned the lock'.\n8. Out of the remaining options, we have'solution to problem', which would be unlikely. \n9. We can eliminate choice D because it does not seem to follow the previous actions of getting the key and turning the lock, nor does it contribute towards opening a lock.\n10. Choice E is unlikely as it contradicts the previous clue that he is leaving for home and doesn't contribute towards the goal of bike riding.\n11. This leaves us with options B: pocket, which is a plausable action if the key is needed for biking home and was not carried on the bike, or C: pocket, which is less plausible but is possible because keys are sometimes misplaced and people will then use another key to access the locked item.\n12. However, B: pocket and C: pocket can't be the correct answer because when we apply the 'law of the evidence', we know that we must use evidence from the context to support the choice we make.\n13. In this case, there is no evidence to support the use of choice B: pocket and C.\n14. So, we can only eliminate remaining choices and are left with A: turn lock and D: pocket.\n15. Choice A: turn lock is now more likely.\n16. Now, let us consider what options remain in this choice, we don't observe choices like E: open doors and B: pocket, which would not make logical sense for our context. \n17. This removes all but choice A: turn lock from being a potential answer.\n18. So, the answer will probably be A: turn lock.\n19. Let us prove this by choosing the only other plausible option, which is choice D: pocket, and see if we can find evidence for it. \n20. We cannot find any specific clue whatsoever to support the use of D: pocket because all other evidence points us towards choice A: turn lock only. \n2", "answer": "B: expend energy"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. Pocket is redundant and refers to the same action as turning lock, Solution to problem is vague.\n6. This is why we have A: turn lock and E: open doors which are both possible solutions.\n7. Since they are equally possible, we eliminate the options which are either equally possible as well E: open doors, leaving A: turn lock.\n8. Therefore, the answer would be A: turn lock.  \nAnswer: A: turn lock\n\nInput: They must be careful not to damage the floor.  It could give anyone who walks on it a bad what? Choices: A: feeling B: impression C: opinion D: reaction E: surprise\nRationales: Start by analyzing the meaning of \"give\" in the last sentence of the statement. The word \"give\" does not refer to conveying information, but to transferring something to someone. \n2. Let's break down the question by working through the options. A: feeling, B: impression, C: opinion, D: reaction, and E: surprise are among the answers. 3. After thinking about the given options one at a time, consider the possibility of bad feeling instead of bad surprise. Feeling is something that people are personally affected by, therefore no one else knows how that person feels. Impression and reaction, on the other hand, are more objective. Impressions and reactions can be perceived by other people, so they may not be entirely influenced by the quality of the flooring. \n4. Opinion also has qualities that a person may be affected by, but is more subjective. You can hold an opinion about a topic, but do not know exactly how you subjectively feel about the topic. \n5. Concluding all this, the best answer is E: surprise.\nAnswer: E. Surprise\n\nInput: She wanted to finish her project fast,  She began by doing what?

Thus, turn lock, open doors and pocket are all eliminated.\n6. Similarly, the option'solution to a problem' seems too general to be a correct answer so we eliminate it.\n7. From the remaining options, we can immediately rule out pocket as this would imply the action of putting the key inside the pocket, rather than the key itself. \n8. Next, we can also reject solution to a problem as it seems irrelevant to the situation at hand.\n9. The final remaining options are turn lock and pocket. The latter could fit the context as a pocket is a small space that is used to keep things. An opening of some type would therefore be appropriate.\n10. It is also possible to get locked and stuck in a bike lock if you lock your keys in the bike, which would require some unlocking to be achieved.\n11. However, we cannot directly conclude that he is about to key in to unlock his bike, so pocket it is.\n12. Consequently, the answer is D: pocket.\nAnswer: D. pocket\n\nInput:  There were many different ways to die in that country,  the majority of them had a great deal of what?

We will look at all the possible meanings of majority and then we will analyze each phrase individually to find which one fits best.\n2. Most of them had a great of pain is an unlikely answer since majority of them have to mean greater than a quarter. \n3. Therefore, we will exclude this answer.\n4. Most of them had lot of love is most likely true, since it is usually associated with great joy but it doesn't have any logical connection with country.\n5. Most of them had good fear is a plausible as well since it is an important tool for survival.\n6. So we will keep these two.\n7.

Choices:  rain clouds A: sunny  and warm B: damp and windy C: cloudy and cold D: rainy E: hot all day\nRationales: The question asks for the type of weather conditions ideal for outdoor fun.\n\n1. Rain clouds is not the right answer choice because the statement that the weather is ideal for outdoor fun can't be correct if there are cloudy and rainy conditions.\n2. Damp and windy weather is also not ideal for outdoor fun because there will be discomfort from the wind and it may be hard to relax if it is wet and windy outside.\n3. Hot all day weather is also not ideal, as it can be uncomfortable, and the sun might cause sunburn and dehydration.\n4. So, the answer will be B - damp and windy, and it is the best fit for the question.\n\nInput: She has very little confidence in herself, in her opinion she was very unprofessional.

If she thinks she is not qualified to be promoted, she may not believe she will do so well at this job.\n2. Employee choice B: employee seems like the next best choice to make, but the statement also tells that she is unprofessional, and so employees who are unprofessional can not be good candidates for a promotion.

The term 'turn lock' could refer to the act of turning a lock with a key, in which case option B would be a plausible choice, or it could refer to the act turning a key in a lock, in which case the choice is A: turn lock.\n8. Hence, based on the context of the given statement and the options available, the word turn 'lock' should be interpreted as turning a key in the lock which is implied in option A: turn lock. It seems likely that he turned the key in the lock.\n9. Therefore, the answer to the question is A: turn lock, as the context of the question implies that the key is used to unlock the door.\nAnswer: A. Turn lock\n\nInput: This is an open-source application designed to work across operating systems. A Windows user can simply what? Choices: A: click the Start Menu icon, or type into the search bar, or drag and drop B: type the name into the search bar C: drag and drop to the desktop icon D: copy the website link E: simply enter 'Run this file' as an instruction\nRationales: The first sentence of the input states that this is an open-source 'application' designed to work across operating system. A question is prompted, asking the user to 'Simply'.\n\n1. The operating system is the software that controls the interaction of a computer with the user to facilitate the operation of applications. Windows, macOS, ChromeOS, etc. are different operating systems.\n2. The context of the sentence implies that the application can be used on computers with different operating systems, hence cross-platform.\n3. The question then asks a person to 'Simply' something, implying that the user should be able to do so without much difficulty. \n4. From a technical perspective, the user can 'Simply' drag and drop, copy the website link, or type the name of the application in the search", "answer": "B: birth"}

Choices: 1. nausea 2. diarrhea B: headache 3. vomiting 4. fever E: all of them\nRationales: The question is asking us which of the given responses most frequently appear as a symptom of food poison. The choices are either \"nausea\", \"diarrhea\", \"headache\", or \"vomiting\", and \"fever\". 1. \"Diarrhea\" is a common symptom; it could be any type of food poisoning. \"Nausea\" could also be a symptom in some cases. Therefore, the first two are good options.\n2. \"Headache\" can be a side effect of any kind of food poison, and it is also an individual symptom. However, it won't be the only symptom. If someone has \"headache\", then it is most likely accompanied with other symptoms.\n3. \"Vomiting\" is a common symptoms of food poisoning as well. It could be along with other symptoms. 4. \"Fever\" is not a common symptom, and also not the symptom of food poison alone, although it can be associated with it.\n5. Among all those given options, only \"diarrhea\" can be a symptom in most cases, and it's also an individual symptom that is not connected with other symptoms.

Choices: 1. A: take care of himself 2. B: go to work 3. C: go to another school year 4. D: take advantage of the smaller boy 5. E: solve the problem\nRationales: The problem is that the younger one is not able to afford lunch without his money. \n1. Taking care of oneself means taking care of the younger boy's problem as well, which means taking care of the situation and finding a solution. \n2. Going to work can be disregarded because it is not common in such a situation.\n3. Going to another school year is not a plausible option either because the question doesn't mention a change in school year.\n4. It is most likely that the bigger one took advantage of the situation and took his money.\n5. This doesn't provide a clear solution, so it is excluded as incorrect options.\n6. The remaining options are A, B and C.\n7. Out of the given options, A is the only correct option. It mentions the act of solving the problem.\n8.

Next, consider options B: pocket and D: pocket, which contain the exact same phrase- \"the pocket\"\n7. In cases like this, the word \"the\" is usually omitted. 8. Since B: pocket and D are both referring to the same concept, and they don't both relate to the purpose of the question, eliminate choice B: pocket.\n9.

The goal of distinguishing between these options is to determine the correct meaning of the given options. We start out by eliminating Option -A: A name denotes a \"sign that shows status.\" This is not a correct meaning of a person's name because there is no specific \"sign\" or \"status\" that can be universally assigned to all names. For example, the name \"Cindy\" could denote a \"status\" of cheerfulness, while \"John\" could denote an \"announcement of identity\" as well as a \"sign of birth.\" (since \"J\"s are used in the first and fourth names of American babies respectively, according to the USDA) Option -B: A name denotes", "answer": "B: gorge"}

Out of these options, 'turn lock' and 'open doors' don't match the context very well (the former is already done, so it can't be the next action, while the latter action refers to a location other than home), so they can be disregarded.\n6.

The remaining choice between the two, 'pocket' and 'open doors', is based on the idea of his preparation of the bike ride and his goal.\n10. In other words, all of our choices are used to illustrate his planning of the bike ride. \n11. 'Open doors' sounds like a very specific task and not necessary planning. \n12. Pocket's goal is to store something that he would need during the bike ride, so he could put it where he would like to keep it in the end, which could be his home or a store that he will pass by.\n13.

Therefore, the actions of pocket and opening doors are too vague.\n8. Looking at A: turn lock, and B: pocket, we can see that 'turn lock' is a specific option - it states that the key unlocks the door.\n9. On the other hand, 'pocket' is not a specific action, as we do not know if the key is in the pocket, or if he does something else after getting the key out of his pocket.\n10. Therefore, the answer for this question is A: turn lock.\nAnswer: A. Turn lock\n\nInput: I don't want it to take all night.  I want what is it that it needs to be done?

This suggests that whatever is getting done is a task that they want to be quick.\n3. Among the given options, 'time' is specific in terms of a task that should be completed promptly.\n4. Of the remaining choices,'money' is ambiguous because it can be a form of work or an investment in a project.\n5. Similarly, efforts can also be something tangible or abstract.\n6.

The sentence itself is vague and does not clearly indicate the time or place where he turns the key when referring to turn lock.\n8. The sentence does not mention a bike or that the key opens a door, which are elements of a bike lock.\n9. So, we can eliminate choices A and E.\n10. We can also eliminate choice B as it says turn the lock, an action which we have already eliminated.

The only available option is Turn Lock and it is not feasible as it would take way too much time to turn a key considering that he had to reach home quickly.\n6. Moreover, there's no clue regarding why it should take him much time.\n7. Considering the above, only the choice Open Door makes much sense.\n8. Therefore, the answer must be C: Open Door.\nAnswer: C. Open Door.\n\nInput: My mother has told me, you can never know, what Gods will do,  He'll surprise you what He's going to do! Choices:  A. what Gods will do B. surprises C. surprise D. what is best\nRationales: The given statement is a poem. The speaker is talking to someone who is a friend of her, probably someone she knows since childhood.\n1. The speaker is saying that she doesn't know what Gods will do.\n2. So the listener doesn't know either. \n3. But the speaker goes on to say that she knows that there will be surprises. \n4. 'Surprise' itself is a verb, which the poem says will happen 'He'll surprise you'. Therefore, the listener will only be surprised.\n5. Gods can't be surprised, only people can. \n6. So the poem suggests using the noun 'Surprise' in sentence 1 could be wrong.\n7. So the listener should use the adjective'surprises', as the poem suggests.\n8. The question gives several noun options. \n9. None of them seem to fit with the sentence. \n10. There is no'surprise' action in 'what Gods will do'.\n11. So, the person will not be surprised by what Gods will do and the noun'surprises' doesn't make sense.\n12. Therefore, the noun should be'surprise' since this is what the speaker says will happen to the listener. \n13. Finally, the listener's action is mentioned at the end of sentence 1. \n14. The whole sentence suggests that the speaker is telling or talking to someone. \n15. So the whole sentence should be rewritten as \"G", "answer": "E: tall"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, and open doors.\n5. Among the given options (B, C, E and D), only option E (open doors) relates to the action of turning a lock, while option C (solution to problem) relates to a general solution rather than an action.\n6. Therefore the answer is E: open doors.\nAnswer: E. open doors\n\nInput: Her first task in her new position is to what? Choices A: create a new team B: prepare for a tour C: make a presentation D: host a training seminar E: meet senior management.\nRationale: 1. When she is first assigned to a new position, she immediately needs to conduct a series of tasks, \n2. The first of these tasks is to \"create a new team.\" \n3. Team building is a task that would likely accompany the first job assignment to new department. \n4. Therefore, the correct answer is D: host a training.\nAnswer: D. Host a training seminar.\n\nInput: I am interested in your point of view.  What I'm really interested in, though, is what? Choices A. Your opinion B. Your advice C. Your thoughts D. Your comments E. Your analysis\nRationale: 3. The given statement reveals that the person wants to learn someone else's point of view.\n4. This phrase is an indirect way of asking for someone's opinion.\n5. The first option 'Your opinion' refers to a particular point of view, while the remaining options do not have this quality.\n6. Therefore 'YOUR OPINION' is the correct answer.\nAnswer: A. Your opinion\n\nInput: The man went on a diet to achieve what? Choices A) A new body B) A strong health C) A healthy weight D) A fit body E) A lean muscle\nRationale: 2. The given statement informs us that the man went on a dieting process to get something which is of high demand, and more specifically, a slim or trim body.\n3. The options A-B-C-D-E are directly linked to a dieting process that aims to transform or alter a body into a slim or trim one.\n4. Options A-B-D are directly linked to the term 'body' while options C", "answer": "C: winter storm"}

Therefore, it is likely that he put his key in his pocket, in anticipation of opening the door. His action to start bike rides home as soon as he found his key, indicates he was ready to biop.\n8. The answer is C: pocket.\nAnswer: C, pocket \n\nInput: It was a very wet year, the river went right through the middle of Daryl's house. He decided to build it higher so that what? Choices: A: could stand up to the flow B: dried quickly C: will not get flooded D: got warmer E: stay cool\nRationales 1. The question focuses on a situation in which the river flooded the middle of Dary's house.\n2. Since the flooding is due to weather, and because the house has wet conditions, it is logical to predict that this weather event will occur again.\n3. However not all weather events cause flooding, only high flow events. Flooding is only a possibility when the flow of the river is too much. \n4. Based on the fact that the river went through Daryl's home, this suggests that the river was high in flow, which points to B: dried quickly.\n5. D: will not get flood and D: get warmed can be eliminated, because they do not directly address the high rise of the house.\n6. Therefore the answer is B: dried quickly as a way to avoid any repetition of past events.\nAnswer: B) Dried quickly\n\nInput: Where did Paul buy the fish he sold in his shop? Choices: 1. A: ocean 2. B: pond 3. C: river 4. D: stream 5. E: lake\nRationales: First, we should notice that we are looking for Paul's fish shop \nThe question doesn't provide more detail on this information.\n2. Based on that, the options provide context of the kind of locations a fish store would have.\n3. Since 'fish' could also indicate 'fish' specifically not 'any kind of water life', we should make sure that the", "answer": "E: happen anywhere"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. All except one of these options are not suitable to describe the situation. Turn lock and solution to problem don't make sense as the key would not have been used for either.\n6. So we must choose between pocket and open doors.\n7. We can eliminate pocket because the key was already being held.\n8. Therefore, opening doors is the most appropriate answer, as it describes the actions that occur next.\nAnswer: E; open doors\n\nInput: In the 1920s, women had more freedom, which was due to what? Choices A: their husbands dying in WW1, B: their husbands getting a raise, C: their husbands voting for less laws, D: their bosses telling them what to do, E: women voting in large numbers\nRationales:1. It is important to note that the correct answer to this question should be based on the statement \"In the 192O's Women had more freedom, which is due to what?\"\n2. A: Their husbands getting a pay raise: There is no evidence that this is the answer.\n3. B: Their Bosses telling them what do: There is no evidence this is the answer\n4. C: Their Bosses voting for less laws: There is no evidence to support this as the answer.\n5. D: More women voting: There is no evidence in the statement to suggest this is the answer. \n6. E: Women having more Freedom: This information is contained in the statement.\n7. Women voting in large numbers may account for the freedom they gained.  The question asks, \"In this period, women had more freedom. This was due to what?\" Women voting in large numbers is the correct answer.  However, if given no clarification of this kind of question, one should assume that the \"freedom\" gained means an increase of choice.  The question should be re worded as, \"Women's choice was increased in the 192Os more than in other eras. Women had more choice before this period when? A: The women won the right to vote B: Men's salaries decreased C: Men refused to change laws limiting women D: Women asked their boss for permission to leave E: In a war\".\n8.", "answer": "B: whorehouse"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket and open doors.\n5. Pocket is used as a verb as well as a noun, as in 'put it in your pocket', however, the options we are looking at are specific to a verbal form of the noun - 'pocket'.\n6. The other given choices are specific actions that can be performed with a key - turning a lock, finding an open door, and fixing a problem.\n7. Therefore pocket is the most logical choice to answer the question.\n8. Answer: E: pocket.\nAnswer: A-B\n\nInput: He started to what? Choices A: write B: run C: read D: run E: bend\nRationales:\n1. The question starts by telling you about two characters. The first one is reading and the second one is starting to write.\n2. Now you have to answer what the second character is starting to do.\n3. Starting to write refers to starting to write a letter, sentence or other form of text.\n4. Starting to run refers to starting to run a race.\n5. Starting to read refers to starting to read a book or document.\n6. Starting to bend refers to starting to bend down or start doing something involving bending.\n7.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. As such, the correct answer is B: pocket because 'turn lock' and'solution to problem' are irrelevant since he already began the action of opening a door, and 'open doors' is too vague.\n6. The statement tells us that he got out his key to begin something.\n7. From here, we can infer that 'to open a lock' is the most likely option that is suitable for the action described.\n8. Therefore, the answer to the question is B: pocket.\nAnswer: B. pocket\n\nInput: What was Mr. Robinson trying to do? Choices:  C: make a deal with Mr. Foster  D: give a gift  E: ask for a raise\nRationales: It mentions that Mr. Robinson, an executive of the company, tries to get a deal for his company.  First consider the options, the only one that does not have a direct relevance to his task is option E: ask for a pay raise.\n\nAnswer:  A: make a deal with\nAnswer: A: make a deal \n\nInput: On that day, a little girl wore a what? Choices: A: t-shirt B: shorts C: dress\nRationales: The given statement describes a little girl wearing a what. Now read the options and eliminate the ones which do not fit in the context.\n\nAnswer: A: t- shirt  \n\n### Explanation of Response\nAs can be seen, all of the options are different from the given description, in terms of gender and attire.\nOnly two of the answers can be ruled out due to incorrect context.\nFirst, the t-shirt and shorts description applies to a boy.\nSecond, the dress description doesn't apply to the given text.\nThis leaves us with what appears to be two viable options: the boy option and the girl option.\nHowever, further examination of the question is necessary to determine which answer makes the most sense.\nWhen we analyze how \"she\" is used, we see that it is referring to a girl.\nThis fact is further supported when we note that the description we are analyzing doesn't use any pronouns to refer to the gender of the \"boy\" and therefore, the choice of boy or girl is equally valid.\nTherefore", "answer": "C: disparagement"}
{"text": ", pocket and solution to problem.\n5. Pocket is not an action and the solution to a problem does not require opening a lock.\n6. Therefore the most likely action he took is turning the key to open a lock.\n7.

A: 50% B: 25% C: 75% D: 5% E: none\nRationales:  1. The person in question can not remember where he (or she) left his (or her) car.\n2. Given all the choices, the only remaining alternative seems to be movies.\n3. So, the probability that the questioned person can remember the movie's name is 75 percent.\nAnswer: D : 5%\n\nInput: Which of these types of plants has no flower parts? Choices:  P: leaves B: flowers C: petioles D: seed Cases\nRationales:\n1. The question asks which of the types of plants has no flowers.\n\n2. The choices are flowers, seed cases, petioles, and leaves.\n3. A flower is the part of all plants we know as a flower and usually contains petals, stems, buds, and roots. The term petiole is used to describe a thin, leafless stem that attaches the leaves to the stem of a plant. Leaves have petioles, and petioles have flowers. Thus, flower is inaccurate in the question. \n4. A seed case is a capsule or pod that houses seeds, the plant reproduction process. However, the question refers to the flowering plants, not the plants in general. Therefore, the seed case is not the answer.\n5. Similarly, the petiole is not the answer because petioles are part of leaves and the question refers to plants that do not have flowers.\n6. Therefore leaves have petioles and petioles have stem and leaves. \n7. The stem, which has leaves and other parts of flowers, is the only answer that does not have flowers. \n8. Therefore, the stem in the question refers to the", "answer": "B: cash in"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, and open doors.\n5. The answer is definitely not A: turn lock or D: open doors.\n6. These are actions done before the key is out, when all the preparation is still being done. \n7. The choices B: pocket and E: pocket are too simple, as they both mean to take out the key but don't necessarily imply the key is used later to something.\n8. Then, when we consider the other options, they all refer to preparatory actions to leave. Solution to problem can be related to finding an alternative way of getting home. Pocket could also be related to finding an alternate way of coming home.\n9. Hence, what we are looking for is action which involves key after the main idea is completed, that is: \"ready to bikes home\"\n\nRather than A: turn lock or B: pocket or D: pocket or E: open doors, we could choose C: begin to what? In short, we should choose B: begin to what because it includes the use of a key, which requires unlocking a lock.\nAnswer: C begin to what", "answer": "E: let blood"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. Out of all the given choices \"turn lock\" does not make sense as it does not explain what is about to occur to the key and that is to open a lock.\n6. The rest of the choices are also eliminated for the same reason.\n7. Lastly, we are left with the choice of \"open doors\", which makes logical sense.\n8. Since the key is now in the subject's hand, the subject can begin to use it to unlock the door.\n9. Therefore, the answer here clearly is D: Open Doors.\nAnswer: D Open Doors\n\nInput: There was a time when the only thing they had to look up was a street. Nowadays, people look up what on the internet? Choices:  Street A: the dictionary B: any information C: a restaurant D: anything E: any place\nRationales: Firstly, the \"they\" refers to everyone. Secondly, the only thing they had access to in the past to look up was a \"street\". Thirdly, the given terms \"look up\", \"information\" and \"anything\" all refer to looking for information.\n\nA-B-C-D-E are all grammatically correct. We can see from the text, that it is not referring to \"looking up\" a street, since street is the only thing that they had to look up in the past.\n\nFurthermore, although E-D-A-B-C are grammatically correct, E - \"anything\", means that they could look up any information, but nothing in particular.\nThe answer is therefore D - anything.\n\nAnswer: D- anything.\n\nInput: Many people in the world like to eat fish.

It was an environment that was conducive for a lot of what?  Choices:  A. Quiet B. Success C. Fun D. Noise E. Learning\nRationales:  1. The word \"noticing\" is used in the sentence. \n2. This means the teacher is observing.\n3. So, the best option that goes with something seen is \"noticing\". \n4. 'Quiet' suggests a calm environment. \n5. But since the teacher is observing, she knows if the students are calm since they are being observed.\n6. So the teacher can conclude if the students are relaxed, calm or focused.\n7. Since'success' is the opposite of 'focus', this can be eliminated. \n8. Hence,'success' can be eliminated.\n9. Similarly, 'Fun' can also be eliminated since that's not what she is looking for.\n10. So we have two options left. \n11. 'Notice' is the opposite of notice, as such, 'Noise' is the correct answer.\nAnswer: E.

{"text": ", pocket, open doors, solution to problem and pocket.\n5. Pocket is an inappropriate option as there will be no key to get out of a pocket.\n6. 'Turn lock' and 'open doors' can be skipped as they could mean either turning a lock or opening a door. \n7. 'Solution to problem' is out of place because its meaning is something that is used to prevent a problem, not a means to solve it. \n8. 'Pocket' does not mean anything specific in relation to the problem posed, but getting out the key implies that he has the key in his pocket, and that there is a lock that requires the key to be taken out of the pocket in order to open the lock.\n9. Hence, the person took out the key from his pocket in order to turn the lock, so the answer is D: pocket.\nAnswer: D. pocket\n\nInput: Mary's new friend was very rude and Mary was really hurt by her actions, but why? Choices:  Rationales:  A: Mary was mad B: Mary was shy C: Mary felt left out D: Mary thought it was funny, she laughed. E: Mary was insecure\nRationales:\n1. Mary was hurt by her new friend's actions (the choice of D: Mary thought it funny, and it was really funny).\n2. The choice of D: Mary was insecure can be skipped, as Mary may have been hurt by her friend's actions, but she wouldn't have been as hurt by them if she hadn't been insecure and felt embarrassed by her inability to respond. \n3. The question makes sense if Mary was hurt more if she was insecure, but it's unlikely that the insecure Mary would have thought her new friend's behavior was funny (choice of D: Mary thought this behavior was really funny). \n4. The question requires choices which are equally unlikely.\n5. Therefore if the person is insecure, they will not feel funny (D: Mary thought it funy, and it was funny) but hurt.\n6. Therefore the choices that seem most likely given the question is C: Mary felt left ou.\nAnswer: C. Mary felt left out.\n\nInput: When he bought a house, Sam was too tired to paint", "answer": "A: in cinema"}

We also rule out turn lock, pocket, and open doors because they all involve unlocking something.\n7. The only one that remains is, solution to problem.\n8. However, 'bike home' is not a problem and does not warrant a solution.\n9. Therefore, as he is ready to bike home and the given action is to find a solution to a problem, none of the choices can be considered as the correct action. \n10. Hence, the correct answer is D: pocket.\nAnswer: D; Pocket \n\nInput: When she turned 50 years old, she wanted a promotion she never had, so what did she need to do? Which of these would help her?

E) Be less demanding\nRationales: The question tells us what she needs to do. The options presented tells us which of these options will help her accomplish what she wants. \n\nExplanation: 1. She wanted a promotion.\n2. But she never got any promotions.\n3. Thus, she needs a promotion. Right?\n4. A) Have the rights qualifications will not help her get a promotion.\n5.

While options A, B and E are very vague, D:'solution to the problem' is incorrect because the question does not ask about a problem that he has encountered. \n7. 'Pocket' can be eliminated since he is specifically looking for his key and the given option A: turn lock does not make logical sense as he already had his key in hand. \n8. Option D: 'pocket' is rejected because again, the given information does not imply any type of problem, but rather that the task now is to open locks using the key.\n9.

Among the choices, the only one that has both options of opening a lock (using a key) AND then doing a further action is option C: solve problem, and option E: open door, which is a further action. \n6. Therefore, he needed to use his key to open a lock to solve a problem, therefore, option C: solve problem is the correct answer.\n7.

Choices: A: rewarded C: punished D: praised E: rewarding\nRationales: I: The given statement is a sentence that shows the writer's gratitude to those who support others without thinking about being rewarded.\n2. B: The given statement doesn't show the writer's disbelief of being rewarded, making B as the right option.\n3. C: The words \"being rewarded\" here do not imply that the writer will not be rewarded. Rather, the question focuses on how the writer feels about being rewarded. Thus, there is no mention of feeling that the writer should be rewarded, and the option D is disregarded.\n4. D: The given statement is not saying, \"I cannot be rewarded\" or something that shows the writer needs to be rewarded. Instead, it shows the writer's gratefulness toward those who support others without even considering being rewarded. Therefore, the option is disregarded. \n5. E: The given statement does not show the writer not being \"rewarding.\" That phrase is not included in the given statement. Thus, the option choice E is disregarded. An option that shows the lack of rewards should be A or C. However, the given statement shows how the person feels about being supported by others, so D doesn't work.  Therefore, D is disregarded and A is the best option. \nAnswer: A: rewarded\n\nInput: I'm in pain.

'Open doors' is not related to the action of opening the lock, also,'solution to problem' is a general term and can mean different things for different people, therefore it would not be as appropriate as the other choices.\n6. Out of the remaining choices, the ones that most relate to the prompt of 'turning the lock' as the action would be done with a key, are B: pocket and D: pocket.\n7. 'Turn lock' requires a specific action be done with a key. Pocketing something and carrying around a key would be necessary to unlock the door.\n8. 'Pocket' involves the action of bringing a key into one's pocket which indicates that is what the key-holders is planning to do next with his key.\n9. Therefore, D: pocket is the answer.\nAnswer: D.

The question is telling us that there is a way, and it's the best one, to improve a garden in the fall. To improve something, it has to be done correctly, so it should improve quickly for a gardener to say it is the best way. \n2. From the list of options given, we eliminate A: water and E: add fertilizer because they are not specific to the best way to improve the garden.\n3. We also eliminate D: add fertilizers because it is not about pruning.\n4. So, left are B: prune and C: prune, which both require trimming or cutting the plants to keep them looking neat and tidy.\n5. C: prune uses the verb \"prune\" which is a verb. B: Prune is a person's first name. It is not a choice. \n6. For this reason, the answer is correct choice C: Pruning.\n\nInput: Daryl knew that something was wrong, he looked all around the room for what?

Eliminate option D: pocket as it is a place and not what he was doing.\n7. So we have E: pocket.\n8. The option that provides the meaning that best makes sense is E: pocket, which refers to the action of putting the key in the pocket. \n9.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, and open doors respectively.\n5. These choices are not consistent with the information suggested in the question.\n6. Among the given options, turning the key would mean to use his key to open the lock, while pockets and opening doors do not directly relate to turning the key.\n7. We cannot assume that he forgot a key or a house key, because he is ready to bike home which means to leave.\n8. Therefore, out of the given choices, pocket is the best option as this generally relates to taking an item.\n9. Since there are two pockets given in the options, picking D: pocket makes the most sense because the answer can be the actions of either pocket.\n10. The answer is D: pocket.\nAnswer: D=pocket\n\nInput: He couldn't quite get through high school,  he left and did what? Choices: A: became an accountant B: got a job C: joined the military D: dropped out E: became a writer\nRationales: I.  First, we understand from this question that the man left school and didn't finish.\n2. We then understand that he did not become an accountant,  he did not get a job,  he did not join the military, and he did not drop out.\n3. This narrows the given options down to these three plausible answers: \nB: got a job,  C: dropped out, and D: became a writer. \n4. Among these three, it is unlikely that the man dropped out of high school and became a writer, as that is a relatively unrealistic scenario. \n5. B: got a job and C: dropped out are both plausible answers as leaving school does not necessarily mean that a person does not finish high school.\n6. However, we rule out the two options as being the answer to the question because we assume that the man left school only due to some unfortunate circumstances beyond his control,  not that he simply did not like school.\n7. As the man could not finish high school, it is unlikely that he dropped out of school because he could have chosen to leave school for other reasons such as a career pursuit.\n8. This means that he either got a job or became a writer.  We are not told which one, so the answer can be", "answer": "E: produce"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, and open doors.\n5. Pocket is an incorrect choice because 'turn lock' and 'opens doors' both refer to opening in the same way as 'pocket'. \n6. Solution to problem can be used to suggest finding a way to bike to home.\n7. Turn lock and open doors, however, both refer to actions that involve opening a lock.\n8. 'turn lock' is therefore a more appropriate choice as it is a specific action while 'open doors' is more general and can also refer to opening doors to the house.\n9. Therefore, the answer must be A: turn lock as it is specific and unique.\nAnswer: A : turn lock\n\nInput: A man on a boat is in peril, if he does not what, he will become dizzy? Choices:  C: change the course of the boat B: eat something first E: throw up D: close his eyes A: sneeze\nRationales: It tells us that a man is on a boat in peril, and he may become dizzy if he does not take some action.\n6. Now let us analyze the options given in the question:\n7. A: a man's body may sneeze in any time.  This may occur as a result of inhaling dust. Sneezing cannot contribute to the occurrence of dizziness.\n8. This eliminates the option 'A: sneeze'\n9. B: the man must first take food into his body to prevent dizziness.  However; if a man is already dizzy, he may try to eat something as a way to recover.\n10. This eliminates the options E: 'eat something first'.   \n11. D: closing the eyes may cause a man to become dizzy. Although this may cause dizziness, this is a short-term solution to the problem as it may get the man dizzy again when he opens his eyes. This eliminates the choice 'D: close his eyes'.\n12. C: 'change the direction of the boat' may possibly reduce dizziness. Changing the direction of the boat may reduce dizziness, but this is not a clear conclusion. Moreover the possibility of dizziness may still remain. So, eliminating these options.\n13. This leaves", "answer": "B: orchestra"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket and open doors.\n5. Turn lock - if his key was going to unlock the door for him, then he wouldn't need to turn the lock himself. Therefore, this is an invalid option.\n6. Also, if his key is the solution to the problem of opening the door, then he wouldn's need to open them and would take it with him.\n7. So A: turn lock is eliminated.\n8. Pocket - he wouldn't need a solution to a problem if he already had a working key. The options also doesn't tell us if he already had the key, only that he went to get it. \n9. He might have not even had a previous solution if the problem was one he encountered for the first time - eliminated.\n10. Solution to problem and open doors - these options assume that the key needs to be opened by another solution given that the door is not yet open. This is assuming the problem isn't the problem of not having the key, which is answered by getting the key first and then opening. This eliminates B: solution to problem and D: open doors.\n11. This leaves us with C: pocket which refers to the option of holding the key, indicating that the person then went to open the door with his key.\n12.

{"text": ", pocket, pocket solution to problem (it's unclear what this means exactly), and open doors.\n5. 'Turn lock' does not match the context of the question and 'pocket solution to problem' is ambiguous.\n6. Out of the rest, we eliminate A: turn lock since he was ready to bikey home and didn't need to turn the lock, and Option D: 'open doors' as they seem rather unlikely options.\n7. Hence only C: pocket is left as a plausible choice out of the three alternatives and therefore it is the correct answer.\nAnswer: C. pocket\n\nInput: He got out of the car; he was ready to meet someone. He locked the doors and what? Choices: A: get out the key B: turn the phone C: he was ready to meet D: pocket the solution to the problem E: pocket his belongings\nRationales: First we understand from the question the context of the situation. He got out of the vehicle so he was ready to meet the person he was coming to meet. Then he locked the door and locked the doors, indicating that he locked the doors because he was coming face-to-face with someone.\n\nOut of the given choices, C: He was ready to meet has been mentioned, so this eliminates that option.\n\nThen we see he locked the doors and pocket option to solution of the problem is something he would do after he locked the doors, so this eliminates this option.\n\nNow we have 3 options between A: get out the keys, B: turn on the phone, E: pocket his belong.\n\nWe are left to consider 2 options now: A & B\n\nIf he has locked the door to his vehicle, how can he leave it unlocked, that is get out the keys?\nIt is the phone that is being locked, so it has to be B: turn the phone.\n\nAnswer: B: turn the phone\n\nInput: When people go a lot of places, they become what?

So, with the given information, the answer is B : pocket.\nAnswer: B : pocket\n\nInput: She would have asked, \"Where's the fire?\" if she believed there was something a man hadn't done.  She knew exactly what a man had to do when a woman said what? Choices: A: it's on\nB: you don't have to go\nC: i've waited too long\nE: to hell with it\nRationales:  1. She would have asked, 'Where's the fire?' if she believed there was a fire, i.e. if she believed that something hadn't been done.\n2. She knew exactly what a \"man\" had to do when a \"woman\" said 'it's [she] on'.\n3. She knew what a \"man\" needed to do when a \" woman\" had said 'it's on [him]'.\n4. 'to hell with it' is not a plausible phrase as the given narrative mentions a conversation between two people.\n5. The only options that match the given context are A: 'Where's the Fire' and B: 'You don't have to gob'. \n6. The answer is Option A: 'Where'sa t he Fire.\nAnswer: A : Where'sa t he Fire", "answer": "A: middle east"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open door.\n5. If he turns the lock, it will reveal if his key fits. \n6. Pocketing his things just means he's removing them from the surface to put them in his pockets.\n7. Solution to problem refers to a temporary solution which just leads to another problem. \n8. Opening the door just means he's opening a door.\n9. So there are only two options that make sense for what he does next: turn lock and open door.\n10. But the given option is to open door, which also makes sense. \n11. Therefore, the answer to the question is C: open door.\nAnswer: C. open door\n\nInput: He walked away from his new job.  What action did the boss expect him to take? Choices: 1. call him back 2. say bye to everyone 3. quit on the spot 4. say he's leaving 5. walk out 6. walk back inside\nRationales: The job is not the one of the given choices.  The option is just an example. So we must find the corresponding choice of his job. \n1. Choice 1: call him back is the opposite of what he actually did. \n2. Choice 2: say bye is not the opposite of what he did, and what he actually did is similar to this choice. \n3. Choice 3: quit is not the opposite of leaving, but similar to it. \n4. Choice 4: say he's leaving is not exactly what happened but not exactly different. \n5. Choice 5: walk out is the opposite of leaving. \n6. Choice 6: walk back inside is a different action than leaving. \nThen we must think how many things they are different, and match one choice with the new action.  The only thing that is different is that he quit, and the action is similar to saying bye. Therefore, the correct choice is choice 6. It's: walk back inside.\nAnswer: B. walkbackintoise\n\nInput: The pigeons began to descend from the ledge when the human went into the building.  They were probably what?

{"text": ", pocket, open doors, pocket, and solution to problem.\n5. The term 'open doors', while similar to 'open lock', is not specific enough and is more generic.\n6. The term 'pocket', while similar to 'pocket', is not specific enough. \n7. Therefore, 'turn lock' is the best answer choice.\n8. It fits well with his readiness to bike home, his getting out his key, as he would have likely to turn his lock.\n9. An action to turn lock might occur without opening a lock, so turn lock is not implied.\n10. Therefore, it's logical to conclude that the answer is B: turn lock.\nAnswer: B. turn lock\n\nInput: There were no fruits around for the lone traveler. Then what did she grab from out of nowhere? Choices: A. A piece of bread B. A banana C. A plum D. A lemon E. A raisin\nRationales:\n1. The sentence states that the lone traveler had no fruit around.\n2. Traveling through desolate wilderness, one may not have the option of going to the grocery store to get food.\n3. The lone traveler must have what is generally considered non-food. \n4. Among the given choices: A: bread, B: banana, C: plum, D: lemon, and E: raisin, only A: bread is non-food.\n5. Therefore the correct answer is A: bread.\nAnswer: A. bread\n\nInput: The only way to make a good impression is to be what?

He \"hopes to have a nice walk\" with a person who he is walking with to the grocery store. However, he doesn't specifically say who he is walking with. So it can be assumed that he is talking about a woman.\n3. We can guess from the last word \"Germany\" that we are on the right track and we don't need to check the rest of the options.\n4.

This implies that 'begin to open door' cannot be used directly as an option, so, we have to find a way to make it plausible in this context.\n7. From the given choices, 'turn lock' and 'open door' are the best option because they are in the same sequence as described, one leads to the other.\n8. 'Turn lock' is less likely to infer that he got his key and began to turn the lock, but with 'open door', it can refer indirectly to 'get the key out' and 'begin to turn the lock'.  \n9.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, and open doors.\n5. We can eliminate D: pocket because although it is possible to keep his key in his pocket, it tells us more about the meaning of the choice rather than answering the question. \n6. Similarly, the answer B: turn lock also implies that he is using a set of keys to unlock the lock.  We also eliminate D: open doors because it is an action that isn't necessarily related to opening a lock.  It can also refer to opening a door in a house or business.\n7. So, we can deduce that his key is necessary for unlocking his lock.\n8. Therefore, we conclude that the correct answer is C: key. \n9. We can eliminate the others because they imply more about a key rather than answering the question directly and being the best answer.\n10. So, the answer will be C: key.\nAnswer: C \u2013 key\n    \nInput: You have a flat tire in a car.  The vehicle uses what for power? Choices:  Tire A:  mechanical B: electronics C: air D: tire\nRationales: Let's look and try to figure out what the question is asking us:\n1. You have a flat tires in a car.\n2. This sentence is describing a car which has an issue with its tire.\n3. This is because the tire that was in the car had lost air and therefore did not have pressure to support the other tires' weight.\n4. This sentence can also be rephrased as, \u201cthe tire that was in your car is flat, which means it no longer has enough air (pressure) to fulfill it's duty as a tire (which is to properly support the entire weight of the car).\n5. So, the correct choice may be A: mechanical because the car (which contains a flat tire) uses a mechanical engine to move (or propel). This shows us that without the proper support of air or tire pressure in a tire (as provided from the flat tire), the car is having a mechanical problem.\n6. So if we look at the choices, D (tire) and B (electronics) are definitely out because there is no evidence that the car\u2019s engine is using either one of those and we know how the engine works via A", "answer": "E: eat plants"}

These statements give us the following: \n    * She was asked if she had completed a given assignment.\n    * She was given the options: \"true\", \"true\", \"false\", \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", or \"e\"\n4. Option \"e\" does not fit into the context because it is not a statement that can be used as a response.\n5. Another way to look at this is, in reality, people do not speak or respond with the word \"e\" when they are asked if they have completed some thing.\n6. So the answer is e: False.\nAnswer: E.

What does \"eoytu\" stand for? Choices:  a. the best time for theatergoing. b. a good time for theatergoing c. a bad time for theatergoing d. the perfect time for theatergoing e. the worst time for theatergoing\nRationales:\n1. The question asks us to what does \"eoyt\" stand for in \"the best time for theater going. The word eoytu is a five-letter word that has a vowel and two consonants, and is pronounced \u201cyou-tu\u201d.\n2. The question tells us the first letter is \"e\". The vowel \"a\" is most likely the second letter, giving us \"ea\". There are two remaining consonant letters in the word: \"you\" and \"tu\" in the sentence \"the best time for theatregoing\" so it is very likely that the answer choices are either \"best\" or \"theatre\".\n3. Looking at the given choices, \"best\" is not the correct answer because it is too far removed and does not appear in the sentence.\n4. Then we look at \"theatre\" and if we replace every vowel with an \"i\" and every consonant with an \"u\", the word spelled out is \"theatregoing\". This is similar in pronunciation to eotu, so eoytu stands for theatregoing.\n5. Therefore the answer is d. the perfect time is for theatergoing.\nAnswer: D. the perfect time for theatregoing.\n\nInput: The movie had the most outrageous cast ever assembled, with some superb, some", "answer": "D: petting zoo"}

(For instance, if both words that you choose are the same as some of the given words, then you cannot choose your two answers. You can only choose one.)\n4. Among the given choices, there are three phrases: \"Good 2014 Stock Market\", \"Happy Customers Always\" and \"Innovation\".\n5. The third phrase, \"Innovation\", is the phrase that fits best to the context of the question and has the shortest phrase length and the most specific details as \"Innovation\" has fewer words and more details.\n6. The choice is thus C: Innovation\nAnswer: C: Innovation.\n\nInput: She had no time for anything else because she was busy with what? Choices: her family  her job  her housework  her children  her car\nRationales: This is a problem solving type question. The statement says she had no time for anything because she was busy, which may suggest something unpleasant.\n1. The answers should eliminate any of the given choices that are positive, such as 'children', 'family' and 'housework' and 'car'.\n2. Then choose something negative to replace any of the eliminated answers.\n3. 'Children' and 'family' are positive answers.\n4. 'Housework' is considered positive when done voluntarily, but this case does not suggest voluntarism. If it is not voluntary, it can be considered negative.\n5. 'Car' implies something more specific than 'busy", "answer": "A: pass water"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, and open doors.\n5. Pocket makes no sense as it is not logical to turn a key in one's pocket.\n6. Solution to problem is a verb that does not describe a specific action.\n7. Turn key in a lock and open lock are synonyms, making the choice A: turn lock a good choice.\n8. Therefore, the answer turns out to be A: turn lock.\nAnswer: A TURN LOCK\n\nInput: Diane's dream was for a very large and famous house, unfortunately, her father refused to assist.  Despite his denial what did Diane do? Choices: \t A: get disappointed B: quit C: continue the dream D: work harder E: get angry\nRationales:  1. Diane clearly had a dream of a large and famous house, as she called her desire to own one a dream.\n2. However, we can infer that this dream would be expensive to fully achieve.\n3. Given that, a dream of this magnitude would require some assistance to obtain.\n4. Therefore, this implies that her father did in fact participate in her dreams to reach some level of realization.\n5. In the given options we need to identify which one best characterizes the behavior of father.\n6. The choices we have are: get disappointed, quit, continue the dream, work harder and get angry.\n7. The one that is farthest from getting involved in her dream and which is the most specific is 'get angry.' \n8. Diane's dream wasn't necessarily a big one, since what is a large and famous house can be different for different people. \n9. Since 'get angry' is specific enough and is the correct answer, it also has nothing to do with her father and so can be disregarded.\n10. So, the answer of choice B: quit is the one that best suits the given criteria.\nAnswer: B Quit\n\nInput: If it is an exceptional job, you will only do it once. You won't be likely to what? Choices A: make the same mistake B: lose the customer relationship C: do a bad job D: repeat the mistake E: do business again\nRationales:   1. The statement tells us that if the job is exceptional, then it", "answer": "C: need food"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, and open doors. \n5. The one which makes the most sense in this context would be 'open doors'. \n6. This means either unlocking or opening a door, which implies the action of turning a key. \n7. Therefore it would be best if he used his key to open doors.\n8. So, the answer would be E: open doors.\nAnswer: E : open doors\n\nInput: He had been a lawyer for too long; he needed a job change.  What did he do? Choices:  Grow a mustache E: shave E: change into something else B: grow a beard C: change into something else D: mustache E: shaving\nRationales: For the most part, the answer has to be a job change.\nFirst of all, let's disregard the odd beard option. Mustaches are part of the standard male uniform in all professions. If the lawyers mustache was considered unprofessional, then grow a beard is a better option.\nThen, the question asks about change into something else. Since no option is specified, I will not disregard it, although it does add to the ambiguity of the question. Therefore, the answer must be Grow a beard, the only option that explicitly suggests a job change.\nAnswer: D : mustache\n\nInput: I want the perfect carnation in my flower bouquet.  I always get the same kind, what's the name? Choices: G:  yellowish-red  B: maroon  I: maroon  I've picked out these G colors over the years H: coral  C: lavender  F: lavender D: white M: white  K: yellow I: soft orange J: blue  P: light green  E: light blue  Q: light yellow  N: brown  D: light salmon  L: light green\nRationales: The correct choice for the question is E: light blue. The question specifically asks for carnations, which can be found in a wide variety of colors. The name of the flower does not specify the color, and the description of it as a \"perfect\" carnation implies that it is important to pick out a flower with the perfect shade of light blue. There are many options for colors that", "answer": "E: hockey game"}
{"text": ", pocket, and open doors.\n5. Turn lock is a process of turning the key to get the lock open, which may not be possible from the given description of the task the man took his key out to accomplish.\n6. Pocket is one of the possible outcomes, but the man also needs to take the key, turn it and unlock the door in order to get inside to his home.\n7. So, according to the information given in the question, open doors is the only plausible choice, given the fact the question tells us that the man already \"got out his key\" and that they are the possible outcomes that result in him entering his home.\n8. Therefore, the answer choice is D: open doors.\nAnswer: D, open doors\n\nInput: She was a well travelled woman and this made her what? Choices: A: friendly B: good C: rich D: talkative E: thoughtful\nRationales:  1. First, we look to the question for the necessary context and relevant details to deduce the answer.\n2. The given option is 'rich'. However, being \"rich\" doesn't necessarily mean that one has ever travelled.\n3. Then, we look at the given options, excluding the irrelevant one of A: 'rich', we consider B: 'friendly', C: 'good', 'D: 'talkative' and 'E: thoughtful'. \n4. \"Friendly\" may mean the same as \"good\" or \"talkative\", but it is the least specific of the given options and could have any number of implications. \n5. \"Good\" may mean good manners, good looks, good at something, and so on. It is the second choice we eliminate. \n6. \"Talkative\" suggests that the person speaks a lot. This may or may not indicate that the person has travelled. So, \"talkative\" gets eliminated, and we are left with three options of \"thoughtful\", \"good\" and \"friendly\". \n7. Out of the last remaining choices, \"friendly\" is only vague about what the person is like, it could mean friendly behaviour through manners or through conversations.\n8. \"good\" may be a general character or skill, which does not necessarily indicate that a person is friendly, such as having good looks", "answer": "D: train station"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. Option A: turn lock cannot be answered since this option does not provide enough context. \n6. Options B: pocket and C: solution to problem are also not sufficient as there is no confirmation that these would have prevented him from opening the door. \n7. Option D: pocket is also not adequate as it makes it seem that he is just randomly holding his keys in his pocket. \n8. Option E: open doors is also too general to confirm that this action solved his problem.\n9. Therefore, the only possible option that could confirm that he solved his problem is option B: pocket and therefore, the answer is B.\n10. Answer: B: pocket \n\nInput: There is no one in the office.  Who is most likely to be the new boss? Choices: \tA: The intern\tB: The receptionist\tC: The intern D: The intern E: The receptionist\nRationales:1. The question asks about the person who is most likely to be chosen to be the new bos.\n2. One of the given options is the intern.\n3. However the intern's role is not to oversee or lead a workplace. \n4. Furthermore, there is no other person to compare to the intern and there is only one mention of the receptionist.\n5. Thus, the answer could be anyone other than the intern in theory.\n6. The next option is the receptionist as she is the first contact point for visitors and clients.\n7. However, the role of receptionists does not require them to hire nor oversee employees so there is not evidence that they are most likely to be the next boss.\n8. Hence the answer could be any of the given options. \n9. Therefore, from the given options, the best match is B: the receptionist.\n10. There is no evidence that the receptionist is most likely, so the answer B: the receptionist is more likely than any other option. \n11.\tAnswer: B: the receptionist\n\nInput: It's good to know what you want in life.

{"text": ", pocket, opening doors. There's a missing verb in between.\n5. We eliminate A: turn lock because the option means to turn a lock and the sentence already mentions he has got the key out.\n6. Next, we eliminate C: pocket because it is a noun and not a verb.\n7. D: opening doors does not mean the same thing as the question. The question gives us no clue about opening the door.\n8. Lastly, we choose E: open doors because it matches with the missing verb between 'turn' and'begin'. \n9. Therefore, the correct choice is E: open doors.\nAnswer: E/A: open doors\n\nInput: I would like to do something, it doesn't cost anything, and it's what I've always liked to do.  Choices:  A:[blank] B: write a story C: play piano D: read a novel E: write a poem\nRationales: Here is what I do to prepare: 1. First we understand the question from the context; the person wishes to do something that doesn't cost anything.\n2. Next we understand the meaning from the question; The option D: read a novel does not match up with the meaning.\n3. Another clue is looking at the other options; the other options are A: [blank], B: play piano, C: read a novel, E: write a poem.\n4. A indicates that there is a word missing that we need to fill out in the question.\n5. The option C read a novel doesn't seem to match with the meaning of the question.\n6. Another clue is looking through the other options, they are B: Play piano, C: read the novel, E: write the poem.\n7. Here, the missing word can be filled with \"a\" so, the option D: read novel could be a bit of a match.\n8. However we eliminate it because the other options could also fit with the missing word, it may not be the best option, B: play piano, E: write a novel.\n9. Then we eliminate the other options that seem the same because of the missing word, there is nothing different that would make one option better than the other. The person who is giving the answer can choose these options, then fill in the missing word. The given options are: A: [blank], C", "answer": "A: beast"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. Turn lock, pocket, and solution to problem are not relevant to lock opening, and are therefore eliminated.\n6. Open door is also not relevant to the question, it should be an option under Choice E because keys are used for opening doors. \n7. We are left with A: B to turn lock, which is similar in the sentence.\n8. Therefore, the answer should be Choice A.\nAnswer: A; B to turn lock\n\nInput: He took a nap and then he had the most incredible dream, something that can only be described as what? Choices: A: surreal B: odd C: absurd D: funny E: strange\nRationales: This is a tricky question and I would first eliminate any options that have a physical or descriptive meaning. \n1. Choice A:'surreal' can be described as existing outside the bounds of reality. \n2. While a surreal dream can be fantastic and have wonderful characters it also can be nightmarish and cause someone to be afraid and confused.\n3. Choices B and A are not the answer. \n4. Choice D: 'funny' is a physical action to have a laugh.\n5. Choice A'surreal' can apply to the dream as well as the dreamer's experience.\n6. Choice C 'absurd' can apply to things in the dream and the dreamer's feelings.\n7. Choice Choice E 'odd' is an adjective but not an abstract.\n8. Choice E'strange' can apply to the description as well as the dream experience.\n9. Option E'strange' could apply the abstract meaning of the dream.\n10.

So, we can eliminate them as incorrect options.\n6.

Hence, the answer must be D: pocket.\nAnswer: D. pocket\n\nInput: You can buy what?

Choices:   A: good time B: bad time C: good adventure D: bad adventure E: good workout F: bad workout\nRationales: The question contains several clue words or phrases that may help us to determine the answer. First, the word \"jungle\" suggests that the event being spoken about was a journey of some sort. \nSecond, the word \"hard time\" suggests that difficulties were encountered during the journey/event but perhaps not enough information has been provided on the event so far to make a judgment on how hard it was exactly.\nThe given options can help us to determine what kind of difficulties/challenges were encountered during the journey.\nFinally, the clue words can only provide us with partial information, or a hint, towards what the events described are. \nRules of thumb: 1. Don't make a statement about the event from the question only. 2. Use the choice options to make a correct statement based on the event (e.g., \"this event took place\" or \"it proved to be\"). 3. Try to summarize the event to the question as a whole (e.g., this was a... day\".) 4. Use the most appropriate option. Eliminate all other options except for the left over option at the last step.\n6. Therefore there are several rules of thumb that may help us make an accurate statement. \n7.

{"text": ", solution to problem, pocket and open door.\n5. We eliminate A and D because the given context indicates that he has already done both of these \n6. Next, we must determine which choice includes unlocking a lock because opening the door is irrelevant to whether or not he is ready to bike home yet.\n7. B and E do not apply because we can eliminate B because he has nothing to turn.\n8. We can also eliminate E because this term is general and can apply to other actions.\n9.

{"text": ", pocket, open doors, solution to problem and pocket.\n5. The choice of the word 'opening' hints that the person would be turning a door knob, opening a lock, using a key to get into a secured building or to open a door.\n6. Thus it makes sense to eliminate 'turn lock', 'open doors' and 'a solution'.\n7. The choice of 'pocket' is possible, if he was indeed carrying his key in his pocket. \n8. However, it fits with the question better to say that he was'ready', as opposed to unlocking or unlocking and locking.\n9. Therefore, he was ready to bi aka ride his bikhome and open a door.\n10.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, and open doors. \n5. These descriptions only partially relate to the action of getting out his key. \n6. For example, 'turn lock' clearly states the action of turning. \n7. 'Pocket' suggests storing something in a pocket. \n8. 'Solution to problem' describes a person who understands how to solve a problem. \n9. 'Open door' is the action that requires a key to open.\n10. Therefore, it is likely that he got out his key to open a lock. \n11. So, the answer will be D: open doors or E: open doors.\n12. The option A: turn lock does not accurately describe him getting out his key.\n13. The option B: pocket is not specific.\n14. The option C: solution to problem is not necessary.\n15.

The question has two parts. The first part states he tried to solve the issue, but didn't.\n2. The second part states that he wanted to try the newest style of dress.\n3. The two parts must be linked together.\n4. Because the style of dress is new, there is not much information about this style so he had a hard time making a decision.\n5. The options for solving the problem must be linked as well, with only three of five options being choices to solve the problem.\n6. Therefore we can eliminate A tried on different clothes, B: looking in the, C: consulting friends and D: consulting style of dress.\n7.

Choices: a: fix b: be polite c: help c: be harsh d: be kind e: teach\nRationales: Given the description \" we are going to help some kids write books\", this sentence introduces us to a situation in which a group of people intend to help the children by providing creative expression and direction.\nThe sentence then adds that \"We will be their editors\". Editors, in this sense, are people who will read and correct children's writing. This description could mean the following things:\n\t1) We will edit the children's books to make them sound nice to others.\n\t2) We will do a formal edit of the children's books.\n\t3) We will do a comprehensive edit of the children' a books.\nThe given options can describe any one of these different possible meanings.\n\t1) \" We can be kind.\n\t2) \"We can help them learn to write their books better\n\t3) \"We can be harsh.\nThe problem is that the question part does not specify where the answer option should be.\n\tThe question part doesn't specify that we should do editing; rather, it states that we will do editing.\n\nWe also note the following:\n\tWe are not editing a children's book, the children are.\n\t\"fix\" implies a minor adjustment to something that works, and \"harsh\" implies that the children will not agree with edits that the editors make.\nTherefore, we eliminate \"fix\" and \"harsh\".

{"text": ", open doors, pocket, solution to the problem, and pocket, all of which involve the key as opposed to just turning a lock.\n5. The only one of these choices that doesn't mention the key as part of the action is open doors, so this choice is eliminated.\n6. The next remaining choice is the solution to the problem, as this is in direct opposition to the given statement.\n7. The last two options to be considered are pocket and pocket, as neither of them mentions using the key or performing an action.\n8. Therefore, because there are two options for 'pocket' that do not include a reason for the man bringing his key with him, this makes the options 'open doors' and 'the solution to the problem' logical eliminations from the list.\n9. Then, looking at the other choice option remaining, 'put the key in his pocket', we realize that it doesn't require the key to be opened.\n10. So 'put the key in the pocket' can be eliminated in the same manner as 'the solution to the prblem' and 'open doors' due to it not involving the act of opening a lock and leaving the man with nothing to do with his key (as it is put in his pocket).\n11. Then, from the remaining two choices, 'turn lock', which requires using the key to open a lock, is the better choice as this was the initial goal in the question before the statement was given.\n12.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. But since the question is asking for an action he does with the key, choices turn lock and open doors could be disregarded as irrelevant to the question.\n6. Thus we also eliminate solutions to problem since the given answer does not mention finding or thinking of a solution.\n7. This leaves us with A: turn lock and B: pocket in the context of the question for being relevant answers. \n8. Popping or pulling out a key from a pocket can be considered an action performed with the key. So, if he got out his key to begin the process of opening a lock, it is more logical to conclude that the action the person does with that key is turn lock. Pocket suggests that the key is stowed in the pocket before the action performed with the key is done. \n9. This action could be any number of things, such as opening a door or looking for keys. Opening a door is an applicable answer because the question specifies that it is home he is going to. Opening doors may be the next step after unlocking the door, which is what the question states.\n10. Therefore, the answer to the question is A: turn lock.\nAnswer: A turn lock\n\nInput: She had to do this because she promised to help her friend.

The statement then states that she had to fulfill the promise.\n4. The given choice C: 'clean clothes' is one way to fulfill a promise.\n5. An important detail to observe is that the question is asking about the woman's intended goal, not the immediate action of cleaning clothes.\n6. Out of all the given options, F: 'get a college education' is the most logical choice given by considering the context of the story. It was for this reason the woman had to fulfill the given promise of helping her friend, as mentioned by the statement.\n7. It is logical", "answer": "C: corner"}

This is most likely due to overloading or malfunctioning, which can create a lot of heat and cause the computer to shut down.\n\n2.\nThe answer depends on whether frozen refers to a computer literally freezing or shutting down with the result being inability to play games (which is more likely).\n\n3.\nIf inability to play the game is frozen, then the only solution is either to use the back-up, switch out the gfx to a lower setting, or close off any potential connections/app that might cause overloading/malfunctioning.\n\n4.\nIf frozen refers to the literal physical state of computer locking up and shutting down, then the only answer here is to turn off the computer which is the obvious one that prevents it from locking up.\n\nAnswer: A. turn off wifi\n\nInput: This is a large company that specializes in producing what? Choices:   A: cars B: plows C: scrapers D: snow blowers E: snow cutters\nRationales:    1. The question says it is a large company, so it is obvious that what the company specializes in producing is something for large vehicles or something large.\n\n2. As the company produces what the questions uses, for example: scrapers, plows, snow blowers, so the", "answer": "A: pet store"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, and open doors.\n5. The first two choices refer to physical actions, pocket contains three words, all of which are nouns.\n6. A solution to problem is not an action.\n7. Open doors does not make logical sense as an answer. \n8. Therefore, the most correct choice is 'pocket'.\n9. His next action is to 'turn lock' or 'open lock'.\nAnswer: B: pocket\n\nInput: She wasn't wearing her lucky shirt. It was very cold in the room so she what? Choices: A: wore a jacket B: wrapped up warm C: got a hood D: put on a coat E: wore an old tshirt\nRationales: Start by breaking down the question. This question is about a person's choice in a situation in which they were cold. \n4a) First, consider the given options. The given options are: wore a jacket, wrapped up warm, got a hood, put on a coat, or wore an old t-shirt. \n4b) The given statements imply that she was originally wearing her lucky t-shirt but did not have it at the moment due to its loss or destruction. She wasn't sure if it mattered if she wore it then or not. She concluded, based on all things around her, that it would be just as effective, if not more effective, if she wrapped up warm, which entailed wearing an old t-shit instead of her lucky t- shirt. \n4c) Wrap up warm (with an old t-shirts instead of lucky one) is the option that indicates the most correct action performed by answering the question. \n5) Therefore, the answer is A, which is the correct action. B would mean she wore a jacket, C would be getting a hood, D, putting on a coat, and E. wearing an old t -shirt.\nAnswer: D, wrap up warm\n\nInput: The company is going to be very busy today as they are expecting a lot of what?

The answer is B: Guests/", "answer": "B: slow down"}
{"text": ", open doors, and pocket.\n5. These are all possible actions which can be taken by obtaining a key, but we can conclude that turning lock is not necessarily related to biking home due to the question's context. \n6. The action of turning key could mean locking the bike, or locking a door which is not relevant to the question's theme of biking home.\n7. Turning a key and opening a door are general actions, but pocket is the most specific choice. \n8. Therefore, the answer must involve pocket.\n9. There is only one option available that is specific enough to be the correct one:\n\"E: open doors\".\n10. Answer: E: open doors.\nAnswer: E(open doors): open doors\n\nInput: What did the boy tell his father? Choices:  boy A: I don't want to go B: I will do it C: not my problem D: don't make me E: I can't do it\nRationales: The father asked the boy, \"Is dinner ready?\" The boy replied what?\n1. The question requires us to deduce what the father asked the boy, and what the boy replied.\n2. The father asked a question, asking whether or not dinner was cooked.\n3. The boy responded to the father, with yes or no, yes meaning that he will continue to cook it.\n4. The boy's answer does not directly address the issue of dinner, and therefore does not reflect his duty in being the one to prepare the dinner.\n5. The other options given are \"I don't want to do it\", \"I don't have to do it\", \"not my problem\" and \"I can't do it\", which all share a theme of reluctance or disagreement with the father, implying that it is not the boys duty to cook dinner.\n6. Lastly, the boy's response of \"I will do it\" means yes, he will continue to cook, which is not the most likely to answer.\n7. Based on the information provided, the most likely answer must reflect the boy's willingness to do his duty, which is \"yes\", so the correct answer must be B: \"I will do it\".\nAnswer: B: I will do\n\n### Instructions:Answer", "answer": "A: read"}

Therefore, the correct answer is option C: put in an ignition. \n5. Out of all the remaining choices; pocket and solution to problem both require action from the user. Thus, all the remaining choices are not correct, because the user already took his key before hand.\n6. Finally, the last remaining choice is 'open the doors' but this only refers to moving forward with a task.\n7. Considering the above, the answer is C - 'put in an ignition'.\nAnswer: C: put in anignition\n\nInput: If you want to be in a movie, in what part of movies do you go? Choices:  a: b-movie b: cameo c: director d: extra e: main role f: producer\nRationales: Let's look at option E - 'the main role'.\nOption E states - in the movie, the person wanted to be in a'main role'. Based on this, we can eliminate certain options that are not correct. For example, options A, B, D. Main role is not the name of a part of the movie, which could be a'main role'. We know that option C can be excluded as it is not part of a movie. Likewise, we can eliminate F as it is not about being in the movie.\nThat left us with 5 options.\nOption C is 'cameo'. A cameo role is a brief appearance in a film or play. While the role is not large, it is significant. This eliminates option D as it says 'Extra'. Extras are performers who aren't major players in a film or TV series.\nOut of the remaining three options, we can't tell what they mean exactly. If we can eliminate any of them, great! We could eliminate one option by simply saying that the statement cannot be both true together. The statement can't be true that he wants to be in a movie and, also have main role in that movie. If that is not the case, let's have an explanation of each of the options. \nLet's try to understand what option B 'b-movie' could mean. There are not many instances where the term 'b-movie' is used.

However, the key is used to unlock a door, and doors are the main point of his leaving.\n6. Therefore it can be safely concluded that he put his key in his pocket.\n7. The word choice 'pockets' also refers to more than one place in the human body, which are not relevant unless the key is lost. Therefore, the correct answer is E: pocket.\nAnswer: E pocket\n\nInput: After losing the money, what does the narrator feel the most?  Choices:  A. Relief B. Pride C. Excited D. Humiliation E. Frustrated F. Disappointed G. Nothing\nRationales:1. The narrator lost the money. \n2. After losing the money, the narrator felt the most, whatever the given answer is here.\n3. Options \"A-G\" are all emotions. \n4. \"Frustrated\" implies that someone is in a bad mood because of not achieving their goal.\n5. \"Disappointed\" implies that someone is upset because of something or someone who disappointed them.\n6. \"Frustrated and Disappointed\" both imply being in a bad mood which is opposite to feeling happy.\n7. \"Relief\" implies experiencing happiness and/or satisfaction because something good happened.\n8. \"Relief\" is the only option that matches the context.\n9.

Since he has already obtained his keys, we can eliminate turn lock because he will be doing a different action, namely opening the door. \n6. Out of the remaining choices, pocket and solution to problem are both general options.\n7. Pocket simply refers to the action of keeping something in one's pocket.\n8. Additionally, a solution to a problem has many applications.\n9. Since we know the key is being used to lock something, pocket and solution to a problem can be dismissed. \n10. Therefore, it is likely that he would open the lock, door, home, etc.\n11. The choice that best describes this action is D: open doors.\n12. Hence, the answer to the question above the given options is E: open doors.\nAnswer: D=open doors", "answer": "A: driving"}
{"text": ", pocket (not likely), solution to problem, pocket, and open doors.\n5. We can immediately eliminate 'open doors' because it is not likely that the person would do that before leaving.\n6. We can also eliminate'solution to problem' as this does not directly imply the action of opening a door.\n7. We can then eliminate'solution to solution'.\n8. We can also eliminate pocket (not likely), because opening a lock often involves unlocking it beforehand.\n9. This leaves us with pocket.\n10. This indicates the use of a key in order to open the lock. Therefore, the answer must be A: turn lock.\nAnswer: A : Turn lock\n####Input: He was ready for the party, he was dressed and ready to what? Choices :  A: start B: meet C: arrive D: go E: walk\nRationales: As the question says, he was ready for the party. There are two possibilities: 1. He's waiting for someone (A: start) 2. He's ready to go (E: go) \nThough D: go has a possible use as well, the choice is not appropriate for this particular question because it is a part of the event, while party itself is mentioned as a noun and the noun is an object of the preposition in the question part: _ready _for _the_ party.\nTherefore the answer is E: go because the question part implies the action.\n\n\nRationales: He was ready to go, what does this answer mean?\nThis answer means that after he is dressed and ready, he's getting ready to go and attend the party, but he's just waiting for someone.\nIf he was ready but not waiting for someone, we would expect him to go on his own.\n\n\n####Input: As he is leaving his home, he will _______ it. Choices :  A. go out B. turn on the lights C. say goodbye D: ring the bell E: wake someone\nRationales: If you say he is leaving his home and you don't mention a location, it means that he is leaving it in his normal way, either by car or by walking. We must distinguish between things people usually do before leaving and when something is a part of leaving like ring the bell. \nIf he is", "answer": "E: class room"}
{"text": ", solution to problem, pocket, open doors. \n5. We can't say A: \"turn lock\" because he already picked up his key.\n6. Similarly, we can't say B: \"solution to problem\" because 'getting a key out' is not necessarily the solution to his problem of opening a lock, and this action is not mentioned in the passage.\n7. The term \"to pocket\", as can be inferred from its definition, refers to the action of storing something in a pocket, and it does not refer to performing a particular task. \n8. We can't exclude D: \"open doors\" because this activity is not specifically described in the question and does not directly refer to opening a lock.\n9. So, what remains are C: pocket and E: open doors.\n10. C: pocket is an acceptable solution to the problem of finding a key, as it may relate to finding the key in one's pocket. \n11. Thus, we can conclude that the man was ready to bike, he opened the lock, and put the key into his pocket.\n12. The answer is C: pocket.\nAnswer: C pocket\n\nInput: He went to the library for study time, he used what item to complete his work? Choices:  B: a laptop computer  C: books D: a paper E: a pencil\nRationales: The question asks about a specific item. We could make an exception to rules of grammar and punctuation by interpreting the question as a question with a question mark. If this were the case, it would be a bit easier to answer.\n\nThe other part of this is the question that must be completed. To do this, some kind of evidence must be read from the paragraph. We must first understand what the paragraph is saying. \n\n\nIn our first question, the text reads:\n\nEverybody has some sort\n\nof creativity, it\u2019s the best way to create what?\n\nBecause the first question involved people, the answer to the second question should probably involve the same kind of people. This would eliminate: A: create a work of art, B: write a book, C: sew a garment, D: create a new idea, and E: express your opinion.\n\nSo we are just left with the question:\n\nWhat was his solution to", "answer": "B: plane"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors. These all involve the action of opening a door either by turning a lock or pocket keys. \n5. Based on this, the answer is either A: turn lock, C: solution to problem, or D: pocket.\n6. Option A: turn lock, doesn't appear to be relevant here so it has to be rejected.\n7. Option D: pocket, does not specify if the key is inside the pocket or just in reach and ready to use.\n8. Similarly, option C: solution to problem is vague since it does not explicitly state if the key being used was also used to lock the bike in the first place.\n9. Therefore, the answer has to be option B: opened a lock.\nAnswer: B;opened a lock\n\nInput: The police officer questioned the accused for several long hours, what was the likely cause of the what? Choices: A. Accused's headache B. Confusion C. Stupor D. Nausea E. Bladder accident\nRationales:1. The question states the crime took place within a \"hot\" office.\n2. Hot can mean heat, but more likely it refers to the office being stifling from the many people that are inside of it.\n3. People often faint or get headaches when they over exert themselves, which the accused is likely to have done.\n4. This puts options C and B as the most likely causes for \"stupor\", as the police questioned suspects for several long hours, this can lead to confusion or mental exhaustion.\n5. Option A: Headache can also cause this problem, however the bladder accident is also a possibility due to option E: Bladder accident, where the suspect's bladder was likely full which would cause them to have accidents in their pants to the embarrassment of both the officers and the suspect.\n6. The officers' likely embarrassment puts option D: Nausea out but puts C: Confusion still as a possibility as the police have embarrassed the suspect by prolonging their questioning.\n7. Therefore the likely cause is C: Confusion, option B: Confusion can be excluded as the police questioned this person for so long, causing them to become confused, not just from the stress of the situation.\nAnswer:", "answer": "A: early morning"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket and open doors.\n5. Of the choices, we eliminate C: solution to problem because it is not necessary to open any locks before leaving.\n6. The statements \"he got out his key\" and \"began\" suggest that the key may only be used to open his bike lock. \n7. So we would need to unlock his bike, since riding a bike is something usually followed after getting out a key.\n8. We now have just two options that need to be opened or accessed before biking: A: turn lock and D: open doors.\n9. D: open doors is redundant because unlocking the bike is also considered opening a lock.\n10. In the last remaining options - which is about doors - the word 'open' is not used, thus the answer is A: turn lock. \nAnswer: A: turn lock\n\nInput: The book is still a good read even thought  ten years have passed since it was first published. Choices:  A : the way it was once a book B : because nothing was edited C : because it is still a great read D : when this was once in print E : it has been rewritten\nRationales:\n1. The phrase \"the book is still a good (something)\" means that the book has become something that it has been before.\n2. The statement that \"ten years have passed since it (the book has been) first published,\" gives us more information on the book's publication time.\n3. If the book was originally published ten years ago, then its publication date must have been 2012-2013.\n4. When analyzing the choice \"A: the way it (the book) was (originally) a book\" we see that the information provided does not match the given statement.\n5. The phrase \"the way (the book) was originally\" suggests that the originality of the book should be accounted as a benefit, while the date provided suggests otherwise.\n6. The given choices are very generic so we cannot directly determine that option A is the best way to account a good read.\n7. To determine which of the options has the best relevance to the original publication date, consider the statement \"ten years have passed\" and see that option B: \u201cbecause Nothing was edited\" is most relevant.", "answer": "D: illiterate"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, and open doors. \n5. Out of these we eliminate turn lock and open doors because they do not involve the use of a key.\n6. We eliminate solution to problem because this is the opposite of the action shown.\n7. In the end, we are left with two choices Pocket and B: begin to turn key.\n8. If he has his key with him, he is expected to use it to open the lock. \n9. Thus the answer is B: begin to turn the key.\nAnswer: B. begin to turn the key\n\nInput: The most common definition of \"stupid\" is a what? Choices: A: being smart, B: smart people, C: being dumb D: being dumb, E: being silly\nRationales:1. The term'stupid' is generally recognized as referring to someone or something that is not intelligent or lacks common sense.\n2. Out of the given options, only D matches the pattern of negation and qualifier: 'dumb'-a dumb _____ means \"not smart\".\n3. Thus, the answer must be D: stupid\nAnswer: D: stupid", "answer": "B: passing grade"}
{"text": ", which does not directly address the opening of the lock; pocket, which relates to the key being put away instead of being used; open door, which is an action not performed until actually leaving the place of residence; and solution to problem, which provides an explanation of his actions but does not describe what action he took with the key.\n5. Therefore the answer that best fits to the statement is most likely what the man did with his key: 'He opened the lock'.\nAnswer: A: turn lock\n\nInput: The kids were having fun in the backyard.  They jumped on the trampoline because they wanted to have what? Choices: A: a break B: a good time C: a problem D: work E: a boring day\nRationales: The question tells us that the kids were having fun at the backyard.\n\n1. This implies that they had a good time there.\n2. As well as this, when kids' play, they are often jumping on play equipment. We can know this because play equipment for kids is specifically designed to be bouncy and fun to jump on.\n3. Thus, the phrase'so they jumped on the trumpoline because..' relates to the word 'a.. good time.'\n4. Jumping on the trampoline refers to the action of having a good time by playing around the trampoline.\n5. So, out of the choices given, the option'a good time' can be considered the best because it fits the context best.\nAnswer: C : a good time\n\nInput: He didn't have the courage to confess her feelings for her.  Why? Choices: A. She was too beautiful to notice him B. He was too embarrassed to tell her C. She was not interested in him at all. D. He didn't have a chance E. He didn't know what to say\nRationales:1. First, we can tell that he didn't have the 'courage to confess his feelings for her', because he was, 'afraid to', tell her how he felt.\n2. The only option that makes sense to us is C : She was not interested in... him at all.\n3. This is because the rest of the options doesn't make sense to us.\n4. First, the option 'A", "answer": "C: meeting"}

Choices: A: we could do it, too B: watch how he did it C: take it easy D: work harder E: ask him\nRationales:1. The question tells about someone who had taught us a way to do it.\n2. From the question, we know that we could do it because he told us all how to go about it.\n3. Given the options, we eliminate A : we could do it, two as it is not a feasible option in the given scenario.\n4. We can also eliminate B : watch how he did it because it is not a possibility due to the nature of the questions and given statements.\n5. Option, C : take it easy is not a feasible possibility due to a lack of evidence.\n6. Option D : work harder may be a possibility due to his statement \"take it easy\", however considering the fact that the other options were used already,  it appears to be unnecessary. \n7. Lastly, we are left with option E : ask him which seems logical considering he could have offered a hand. \n8. Therefore, the correct answer would be E : ask him\nAnswer: E : Ask him\n\nInput: The doctor explained how his research could help in the treatment for this mental disease.

A mental disease is a condition characterized by disturbances of thought and mood,  resulting from the disordered functioning of the central nervous system.\n3. Mental disease is also referred to as mental illness.\n4. Since research is being done on these illnesses, we can get treatment for them.\n5. There are", "answer": "D: conjunction"}

Pocket is an action which does not relate directly to the given statement and does not logically provide a solution to the previous given solution.\n6. Look for problem refers to something that might be missing so should be added to complete the set-up of the given context. However, if he has already done everything he has to do, there would be no room for missing anything else.\n7. Opening doors is not logical due to the previously stated context, it is not an action that one would perform if one has left home. Likewise, the option turn lock does not provide an action that is logical after one has completed leaving home. So the answers to this question are E.\nAnswer: E.\n\nInput: Who's the one responsible for your car? Choices:  Cargo of the truck E. Car driver B. Truck driver\nRationales: The question above describes your car has been delivered by a truck. The truck is therefore the source of your car.\nThe question implies that the car's driver is to take responsibility for the car. From the options provided, only the truck driver can take responsibility of the car.\nThe cargo of the truck, and the car driver are not responsible for your car.\nAnswer: B. Truck driver.\n\nInput: Your friend said to you, \"The most popular color of this city is red.\" What does he mean? Choices:  E. People in this city often wear red clothes. B. People feel comfortable and relaxed by the color red. A. Red is the symbol of this city. D. The city's people like to use the color red when they do art. C. People in this city use the color red to express joyful feelings.\nRationales: We can tell from the given context that: \"The most popular color is...\" implies something being liked by many people (or to be the most popular), \"of this city\" implies that the color is commonly seen in this city, and \"said to you\" implies friendliness. \nWe conclude that our example friend is a friend of your city and friend of your person. \nIf the friend is of your city, the city should be friendly in the way it is often thought of to be friendly.

Option B: pocket is a logical option. He would get his key out of his pocket before using it to unlock the door, because his pocket would be in the way and he would need to remove it.\n8. C: solution to problem refers to the problem that the key is meant to solve. However, this problem is not described in the question statement, so it can be eliminated.\n9. D: open doors is similar to C, because it refers to a solution to a problem. However, if the problem itself is not in the statement, it should not be considered as an answer.\n10. E: open doors is similar in meaning to B: pocket, indicating that he would put a key in his pocket before removing it to open a lock.\n11. Hence, considering all the options, the correct answer is B: pocket.\nAnswer: B : pocket\n\nInput: There are two types of computers used in everyday what? Choices:\n  A: classrooms\n  B: homes\n  C: offices\n  D: hospitals\n  E: laboratories\nRationales:\n1. First, we need to consider the question statement carefully and eliminate any options that aren't relevant.\n2. We must start by eliminating E: laboratories because the question doesn't specify what computers are used in everyday laboratories.\n3. Next, we can eliminate A: classrooms because the question states that there are only two options given, which classrooms would exceed the given options.\n4. We then eliminate C: offices because if the computers were used in everyday offices, they would likely be used for everyday office work.\n5. There is only one option left that could reasonably be used in everyday classrooms, homes, and offices - B: homes.\n6. Therefore B: homes is correct answer.\nAnswer: C :homes\n\nInput: The doctor put on her gloves, she was ready to what?

The question tells that she is worried about the dog,  and she thought it was a pigg, but it turned out to a wolf.  \n2. The word \"it\" refers to the dog. So, The options are :  \n3. The question asks her reaction to the dog's being a wolf. The possible choices are :  \n4. The answer is \"She wasn't surprised.\" \nAnswer: She wasn't surprised\n\nInput: The cereal is already cooked. You don't need to follow what? Choices: A: recipes B: instructions C: a recipe book D: directions E: cookbook\nRationales:1. The statement \"The cereal is already completely cooked\" means that this is a precooked food item or pre-prepared meal option.\n2. \"Already cooked\" indicates that this food does not require any further cooking, and therefore does not need any extra instructions to prepare it.\n3. The given options given include : recipes, instructions, recipe book, directions, cookbook.\n4. Among the given choices, the ones that do not match what is being asked about are : recipes, directions, cookbook \n5. The choices between instructions and recipe book seem plausible, because these documents contain step-wise guidance for preparation of food.\n6. The difference between instructions and recipe books is that instructions are specific instructions, i.e., a single or multiple steps for preparing something. \n7. Recipe books, on the other way, are guides that contain lists of recipes (i.", "answer": "A: bookstore"}

The question is: He ate food ______ the garbage can, this [the garbage can] _______ what he [the human] used to make it?\n1. First, consider the options given for this question.\n2. Choice A: 'The garbage can' is a single word, and therefore it does not match the given sentence, as it requires a noun phrase. \n3. Choice B: 'The garbage can is a noun phrase, but it does not make semantic sense in the sentence.\n4. Although we can say that 'garbage can' refers to the can, we cannot say 'that garbage can' refers to his meal. It sounds awkward.\n5. Choice C: 'A pot' is a noun which is used to store food. It is what people use to make food into more palatable forms such as curries, soups, stews, and sauces. This can be said to be what he used to make his meal.\n6. Choice D: 'A knife' is not a noun which describes food. It is a tool used to cut or slice food into smaller pieces for eating.\n7. Choice E: 'A ladle' is a tool to scoop up or hold things. We cannot say that 'it' refers to the food he ate after scooping it up with it.\n8. Therefore, the answer to this question is C: pot.\nAnswer: C. pot \n\nInput: The man from the store was very angry, he grabbed his keys and what? Choices: A. went to the store B.", "answer": "B: dangerous"}

'Pocket' is a vague term and is similar to'solution to problem'.\n7. 'Open doors' is somewhat different.\n8. Thus, all we need is an action that is a bit more specific with the key than just 'opening doors'. \n9. The action that makes sense given the context is 'opening the lock with the key'.\n10. So, the answer must be D: open lock with key.\nAnswer: D. open lock with key. \n\nInput: They are selling something you already own.  They want you to get rid of yours, but they don\u2019t want to have to do what? Choices: A: buy B: deliver C: exchange D: repair E: work on\nRationales: The question tells us that they are selling something that We already own, and they don\u2019t want us to have to do what. \n1. Out of the options they want us to choose from, We want us to get rid of our.\n2. So that we can buy from them.\n3. So as to avoid a competition between two products, that is why these people don\u2019t want to buy from us, but they want us to buy.\n4.

They want us to buy from them because they don\u2019t want the second owner, who is us to have to do, what the first, owner or they, to do, their job again.\n6. But so that they don\u2019t have to get us to buy, they want us to get rid.\n7. They want us to get rid so that we get someone who doesn\u2019t bother them to give them the same product and do their job again. \n8. The person who sells things to us, will then get someone who is not us, to exchange for themselves the product so that they don\u2019 t need to do their job again, but they can work on us, to get their product.\n9.

{"text": ", pocket, and bike home which implies that he does not have the key yet and that he is still doing something before riding home. \n5. Option D: pocket is vague and is not directly related to the action of opening the lock with the key.\n6. Pocket does not provide any information regarding how he planned to use the key.\n7. Option E: open doors is also vague and does not specifically refer to opening the lock in order to bike home. \n8. Therefore, we can conclude that option A: turn lock is closest in meaning to the context provided.\n9. This is because turning and opening locks involves using the key, which the bike home suggestion implies. Hence, the answer would be A: turn lock.\n10. But remember you should always answer the given question in the way it is worded.\n11. Therefore, the answer would be turn, lock.\nAnswer: A/B: Turn, lock.\n\n### Direction:Answer the following multiplechoice question.\n\n## Instruction:Answer the given multiple choice question by selecting the BEST option.\n## Input: His family always took him out to different places, so he could experience all different what? Choices: A: countries B: cultures C: activities D: experiences E: environments\n## Rationales:\n1. Begin by looking at the context of the question: His family always took Him to different places where they could experience different activities.\n2. From here, begin to weed out the choices that do not fit into the context. Begin with option E: environments.\n3. An environment is a general term that does not fit within the given context. He is not referring to his environment (where he was) in these sentences, but rather refers to the range of options he experienced.\n4. Next, eliminate option E: environments. Then proceed with option E: experiences.\n5. To experience something is to actually experience it, and not just hear about it. \n6. This implies that He experienced the things that he was taken to, thereby being able to experience activities.\n7. Therefore out of the options available to you, the most appropriate choice would be option C: activities.\n8. Therefore choose C: activities\n\nInput: They thought a lot of thoughts.

Therefore, the term D: pocket would be an appropriate answer to this question.\nAnswer: D. Pocket\n\nInput: The team was on pace.  They had a good run for the first third of the half, but then they what? Choices: turnover ball fumble interception\nRationales: From the question, we can extract the following: The team was on a run, and they had a good run for a good amount of time, but they lost it.\nWe then get the choices: turnover ball fumbles interception.\nFumbles and turnovers are both ways one player loses possession of the ball; that is why they have that commonality.\nNext, we should identify any words or phrases that distinguish them, so we can exclude the ones we don\u2019t need. We notice that in the question, we are told that the players had a good run, and this implies that the other two options don\u2019t have something that is good or nice about them.\nWe also notice that the first three choices all end in \u201cturnover ball,\u201d so we can conclude that fumbles and turnovers aren\u2019t really that different. We also note that interception is not in the sentence structure that indicates good play, so we know we can get rid of interception.\nThe only choice that leaves is \"fumbles\".\nAnswer: A. Fumbles\n\nInput: Everyone had to show up and play in a football game, no one knew how this was supposed to turn out,  then a huge tornado came through.  The storm blew in and out in, what, a minute?

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, and open doors. \n5. Of these choices, \"turn lock\" is a specific action that the person was in the process of performing when he got the key out. \n6. The action of \"turning the lock\" is the solution to the problem of having a locked door, indicating that the person was getting ready to bike home by unlocking his door. \n7. Thus, since \"turning the lock was the solution to the problem posed by the locked door, then \"getting out the key\" must refer to an earlier action in the process of opening the lock.\n8. So, the answer must be B: getting out the key.\nAnswer: B.  getting out the key\n\nInput: Samantha likes the art world, what's Samantha's job? Choices:  artist  art student gallery owner museum worker art critic\nRationales: First, identify the goal or purpose behind the selection of phrases and then eliminate the incorrect phrases. \n1. Here's a list of the given phrases:\nart student, gallery owner, museum worker, art critic\n2. There's no specific phrase that conveys the sense that someone likes the art world or is a connoisseur of art.\n3. Moreover, the given options don't exactly convey this meaning.\n4. Since there's no phrase that suggests or proves the sense of liking the art world, then it can logically be implied that each of the given options can refer to any art-involved job that someone may have.\n5. So, since there's no explicit phrase that shows the sense of liking for art, then the correct phrase must be the one that can prove art love in the best way to the intended audience. \n\nSamantha is likely to be an arts worker who has the job title of either a museum worker, or art critic.\nRationale: These are the only 2 options (among the six given ones) that best capture the sense of liking art.\n1. A museum worker is someone who works in a museum. A museum is a place where art is shown, exhibited, and preserved (i.e., to conserve is to maintain art).\n2.

If the question asks for what the protagonist is going to do, which means his intention.\n8. The given choices B and C mean both unlock, this makes C the correct answer.\n9.

A group from the West was visiting North Carolina.\n2. Their visitors were from both New York and New Jersey which are both states in the East Coast.\n3. The given choices indicate different types of geographical regions or states.\n4. A: The West - This would be incorrect as the visitors are from the East Coast and not the West.\n5. E & G: New York & New jersey Area, and Both places - These would be incorrect as they are specifically from the area of New York/ New Jersey.\n6. C: New York & new jersey - This would be the most logical and straightforward option!\n7.

We eliminate A: turn lock because although 'turning a lock' would be a logical next step to 'get out the key', this action is not necessarily 'the necessary precursor to opening the door'.\n6. We eliminate B: pocket as well because we already had information about him 'getting out the key', so that's not the next important step.\n7. We eliminate C: solution to problem as well because 'getting out the key' and 'opening doors' are different actions. \n8. The answer options E: put in pocket and D: put in or pocket are also dismissed because they are not a necessary precursor to 'opening doors'.\n9. This leaves us with the action 'open doors'.\n10. Hence, the best answer is D: open doors.\nAnswer: D, open doors, open doors\n\nInput: The new teacher looked great in her short sleeves, but the problem was that her shirttails were what? Choices: A: too long B: on the floor C: out D: flapping\nRationales: One of the reasons he would want to keep the shirt tails tucked in is his concern about his image as a teacher in a conservative place. \n\n1. First, the question tells us that she looked great in her short-sleeved shirt.\n2. This indicates that her attire was consistent with the expectation of her profession as a teacher.\n3. Then the question provides information about an issue that she faces when teaching at a conservative institution, that her shirt-tails are 'blowing in the wind', which signifies that they are untucked.\n4. The options given offer three negative evaluations about her attire such as 'out', 'flapping', and 'on the floor'.\n5. However, A: too long is not a negative judgment as it indicates that the shirt-tails were too long, but not untucked. This does not help establish a connection between the shirt-tales and the issue of her working at a conservative institution.\n6. B: on the floor is a negative judgment about her attire because tucking in the shirt-tale would", "answer": "B: magazines"}

Out of these options, turning a lock is best matched to the bike-home scenario.\n7. 'Turning a lock' can indicate opening it, but it doesn' want to suggest that the lock was physically turned, only that it opened easily. \n8. 'Pocket','solution to problem' and 'open doors' do not fit well with the scenario as they do not directly reflect the actions of a bike-home process; thus, they are unlikely to be the correct answer.\n9. Therefore, out of all the options, the answer must be A: turn lock, as it can be taken as the action of opening a key.\n10. The action of turning a key can generally be taken to mean opening a lock.\nAnswer: A, turn lock\n\nInput: You could be right on the money, or you could be what?

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problems, pocket, and open doors.\n5. Pocket and pocket are nouns related to the act of putting something in a pocket - they are probably irrelevant.\n6. Solution to problems implies solving problems and it is not a possible action of biking or opening a lock.  Also,'solution to problem' does not mention a key hence eliminated.\n7. Hence 'open door' is a possible answer indicating that he might have got out his key to lock up the house.\n8. However, the key he was about to use to unlock the lock may have also been used to open the door.\n9. Therefore, the answer could just be 'bike home' or 'unlock the lock', and it is not necessary to explicitly say the answer is 'opening the door'.\n10. Therefore the correct answer is the second option and it is D: pocket, because this is the only one where one can use a key to unlock a lock. \nAnswer: D: pocket\n\nInput: The person said that the dog needed to be walked.  The person knew it was time to pick up the dog, but they didn't have a leash on them.  What is likely to happen next with the dog? Choices:  a: barking B: crying C: eating E: jumping D: panting\nRationales: The question states that the dog is most likely to do the choice:\n\n1. A: barking because they didn't have the leash on and were probably excited to be outside again because they hadn't been walked in a while. \n2. This doesn't say what the dog is supposed to be doing, it just says it was likely they were going to start barking because they weren't happy. So even though this seems like the most likely choice it must be eliminated because it is not definitive of what the dog is supposedly going to do.\n3. B: crying is a potential option because they might miss their owners, but this too is not definitive because it doesn't specify what the child is going to do next. \n4. C: eating is not likely for the same reasons why A and B are not likely, and we also don't know why there won't be a leash on the dog.", "answer": "A: work in life"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem and open doors.\n5. 'Solution to problem' can be a term associated with using a lock key to open the lock to get in a home.\n6.

Out of the remaining three options: 'turn lock', 'pocket', 'open doors'.\n9. 'pocket' is not relevant, as biking doesn't require a key.\n10. 'turn lock' implies an act to turn the key towards the lock and this is not the ongoing action of this question.\n11. Therefore, 'open doors' is the most appropriate choice.\n12. Thus, the answer to the question is 'open doors'.\nAnswer: D: open doors", "answer": "C: going to court"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, and open doors - however open doors is inappropriate as the lock would need to be opened first. \n5. Pocket and solution to problem can indicate an attempt to fix something with the key, such as lock or bicycle, which then allows for the bike to leave.\n6. Therefore the correct choice is A: turn lock, as it allows for the lock to be opened so that the bike can later be unlocked and leave, whereas B: pocket, C: solution to problem and D: open doors are not consistent with this sequence of actions.\n7. So the answer is A: turn key.\nAnswer: A/B/C: key\n\nInput: You were given a chocolate chip cookie and you put it on a plate,  Now it has been what? Choices: A: chewed by two persons B: baked by two persons C: cooked by two persons\nRationales: The question is asking us how the food (the chocolate chip cookie) got from where it was given to the person to where it was later served.\n\n1. A plate is used to serve food, we can deduce this from the question.\n\n2. Therefore, we analyze the other statements in the question and determine the next action (cooking) that led to the serving of food off the plate.\n\n3. \n\nAnswer: D: cooked by two people.\n\nInput: The girl was eating her lunch, and then she got her homework done and walked to school. Choices: A: ate lunch B: cleaned the table C: talked a lot D: did some reading E: finished her lunch\nRationales:\n\n1. First, the question tells us that the girl is eating her lunch.\n\n2. Then, we are given that she must have done other things before arriving at school.\n\n3. At the end, 'walked to school' is the last thing that happened. \n\n4. This makes us question the other things that were mentioned - 'ate lunch', 'got her homework done' and 'did some reading'. However, they have some level of consistency that makes them plausible options.\n\n5. 'Ate lunch' could be an action before the girl did something else, or the action", "answer": "B: bedroom"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors. \n5. The choices indicate that he is putting the un-used key somewhere in preparation of use which would make 'open doors' a suitable choice.\n6. The options 'pocket' and'solution to problem' may also apply but do not explicitly state the un-used key being opened or used.\n7. It is logical to infer that opening the lock with the key is the most direct and only thing he is ready to do. \n8. Therefore, the answer must be 'open doors'. \n9. However, consider the last choice'solution to problem'. In this case, 'problem' could refer to the lock that he wants to open but 'pocket' still makes more sense because of the wording 'got out his key'.\n10. But, after further deliberation, the answer does not need to be'solution to problem', one could say that, he is ready to bike home so he is just going to open the locks.\n11. And, the options 'turn lock' and 'pocket' are interchangeable but, 'open doors' still stands out as an answer.\n12. Therefore, the answer to 'He was ready to bike, he got out his _____ _?_ he began?' is open doors.\nAnswer: Open Doors\n\nInput: Ancient peoples may have made something of this. What could it be? Choices:  Riddle A: a necklace B: a toy C: a bracelet D: a crown E: a weapon\nRationales:  1. The question offers details about ancient people while also including the idea of something that they could have made. \n2. Ancient people were thought to have made many items of gold that have now disappeared. \n3. So, the question is asking which of the given choices could have been made by the ancient people. \n4. In the options, A: a necklace and B: a toy are very unlikely to have been made by ancients and would likely be made for other purposes.\n5. C: a bracelets and D: a crown are more plausible, but without additional details, the choices are difficult to determine. \n6. This leaves the choice of E as: \"a weapon\".

This leaves only the choice of 'pocket his key' or 'pocket a solution to his problem'.\n7. These two choices are ambiguous because it seems he has already addressed whatever problem (or situation) he may be having, since he is ready to bike home and had time to 'pocket a solution.'\n8. If the situation was something that he was going to handle later, or on the way home, this doesn't make sense with the given context. \n9. In this circumstance, based on the given evidence, we can assume that he has not found a solution to whatever his problem (or situation) is. As he is about to bike home and he is still carrying his key. It is therefore most likely that he is pocketing his key in preparation for finding the solution to whatever he is facing on the way.\n10. Therefore, the answer of 'pocket his keys' is incorrect, as it assumes he has already found a solution to his problem.\n11. The correct answer is: 'pocket a solution', as he is most likely preparing to find a solution on the way home.\n12. This statement is a type of inference, based on the given context and available evidence. \n13. Remember, the correct answers must be supported by the context and available evidence given. \nAnswer: B: solution to problem\n\nInput: The only item missing in their picnic basket is a what?

After identifying these food items, we are asked to identify the one missing food item.\n3. Out all the given choices, only the choice A: a pot is most suitable.\n4. 'Pot' means any of different objects made of metal or earthenware and used for cooking or boiling food or water, especially one with a raised rim.\n5. Therefore option A: pot, the missing item in", "answer": "B: schoolroom"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors. All these descriptions are not explicitly about opening a lock.\n5. Solution to problem can be solved because the subject is a problem, while pocket and open doors do not relate directly to keys.\n6. So to identify the plausible action, the term 'open doors' must be ruled out first.\n7. Since he is trying to bike home, we can infer that the doors are not the doors of his house.\n8. We then identify that the 'open doors' choice is most likely about 'opening doors' to bike through. \n9. So, the only options that remain are B: turn lock and C: solution to problem. \n10. Turn lock is a plausible action given the context of keys and the door he is about to bike home through.\n11. So, we can infer that he must have turned the lock and started to bike home. This makes the answer C: solution to problem incorrect. \n12. Since he is ready to bike home and turns the lock, we can infer that a bike is ready for him. This means it is already open.\n13. So the action in place at the moment of this question is C: solution is complete. \n14. Therefore, the answer must be C: solution is complete, i.e., he already possesses the key so he simply picks it up. \nAnswer: C: solution is complete\n\nInput: The only way to get a good night's sleep is to not eat a lot before going to bed.

This means that it is possible for a person to find the key in their other pocket. \n6. Therefore, based on the context, pocket seems to be more specific choice than solution to problem, and so it is likely the person pockets the key before he begins to open the door. This is why pocket is the best answer.\n7. The last option, open doors, is not only vague, but can be found in any other context.\nAnswer: A. Pocket\n\nInput: The boy needed something for his art. He needed a can of which? Choices:  Paint brushes, Paint canvas, Cans, Watercolors, Pipettes\nRationales: For the first part, we have the boy who needed something for his art so he needed a can of what he needed for his art. In this case, his art is painting and so he needs a can of paint. For the second part, we see that the boy is working specifically with a watercolor style where he will need something to put the water in. A 'Can' would generally refer to a very large metal bottle that is typically used to hold liquids. A watercolor brush has a bottle tip filled with water similar to a pipette (which also fits the watercolor description), but a pipette would not be used for mixing other artist tools.\n\nAnswer: Pipes\n\nInput: Aunt Bessie and uncle Jim were very happy to find which they brought from home?

Among these choices, 'turn lock' could mean to open a lock, but this is not relevant in our case as the given statement makes it clear that the key is already out of the pocket, meaning it is already opened.\n6. Likewise, 'turn lock' is vague regarding exactly which lock needs to be turned.\n7. So, 'open doors' is the correct option because the given context and keywords make it the most obvious action to take to get home.\n8. Therefore, the answer to the question is E: open doors.\nAnswer: E :open doors\n\nInput: The tuxedoed waiter set down a plate of cavatappi to a customer. What will the customer most likely do with the cavatappi? Choices:  (A) Add some olive oil for flavor.  (B) Add bacon and cheese.  (C) Toss with a salad.\nRationales: (A) Add some oil for some flavor implies that the customer would also be adding the other ingredients given in the question.\n\n(B) Add bacon indicates the presence of cheese, but bacon and cheese together have no real relevance to food. \n\n(C) Toss with salad is just an action, it doesn't contribute to any conclusion, and it's an unlikely option. \n\nAnswer: (B) Add baconn, cheese\n\nInput: While driving, the weather channel forecaster is likely to announce an upcoming storm, which would be located in what?

Therefore the correct answer is B: pocket, since the answer choice is a more specific action, which is \"pocket\", than the given options.\n7. The term \"pocket\" refers to holding a thing, such as a key or a key-like object in one's pocket.\nAnswer: B. pocket\n\nInput: The old guy got mad because he had to go to the grocery store all the time and his food was in short supply. His diet got what? Choices: A: fatty B: rich C: lean D: nutritious E: salty\nRationales: (1) The question asks what happened to the old guy's diet. (2) It mentions that the old guy was 'angry' because he had to go the grocery store often, and his food was in'short supply'. (3) The word 'diet' refers to a person's food habits; it is generally used to discuss their nutrition and the types and amounts of different foods they eat. (4) Looking at the options 'fatty', 'rich', 'lean', 'nutritious', and'salty' - all these are types of foods; however, they do not correlate with the concept of'shortage'. (5) Only option 'fatty', as a type of food, can be related to the concept of'short supply'; however, the context is 'angry' and not'short supply'. (6) From this, the appropriate answer would be option A: fatty.\n(7) According to the context, the guy's diets are related to eating fatty foods as he was 'angry' and the food he had in'short supply' were 'fatty'.\nAnswer: A: fatty\n\nInput:  When the man walked outside, the sun was at the horizon.

It is a daily activity.\n\nThirty seconds from 5:00 is 5:29.\n\n5.00+0.30 = 5:30\n\nThus, the question is looking for an answer that is earlier than 5:30.", "answer": "B: avoid eye contact"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, and open doors.\n5. These choices are not necessarily logically in order, nor does each option make sense as it relates to being bike ready:\ni. It does not make sense to pocket your key to bike down the street.\nii. It does not make much sense to bring your bike inside your home before you unlock your front door with your key.\niii. It does not seem realistic for a solution to a bike problem to be \"turn lock\". \n6. Out of the remaining options for choosing the action that he took at this point, \"open doors\" is more logically aligned with the question.\n7.\"Open door\" allows him access to the door and in a bike-ready state.\n8. This option also makes more sense than \"solution to problem\" or \"pocket\", as turning the lock or placing it back in your pocket is not likely to be a solution to a bikey problem.\n9. Therefore, we conclude that he most likely opened the doors.\n10. So, the answer to our task is D: open doors.\nAnswer: D : open doors\n\nInput: He had a big task, but it was difficult for him. So, what could he do? Choices: 1. Decide not to do it 2. Call for help 3. Try to figure it out on his own 4. Avoid it altogether 5. Just do it and fix it afterward\nRationales: When the given statement says \"he had a big task, it was difficult for him\", we can infer that he is having trouble with this task.\n1. Then the question asks us \"So, what could he do?\"\n2. Here, we know that there are 5 given options:\n3. Decide not to it\n3. Call for help\n4. Try to figure it on his own\n5. Avoid it altogether\n6. Just do it and then figure it out afterward.\n7. All three of the last three given options are about trying to figure out on his own whether or not he should do the task.\n8. This is contrary to the initial given information and to the statement of the question, therefore, none of these 3 options are feasible.\n9. The initial given information tells us about a difficult task. Then after he doesn't do the", "answer": "B: create art"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. Here, 'pocket' is a general term suggesting he took out the key to put in his pocket.\n6. But this could also be a step prior to turning the key, and pocket would only be the next step after everything else is done.\n7. So we can eliminate 'pocket' as an option since he could have been about to turn the key.\n8. 'Solution to problem' is a vague expression referring to anything he did for his problem.\n9. So, we can eliminate it too. \n10. 'Open doors'; is the opposite of turning the key - locking or unlocking the doors is not the objective.\n11. Lastly, 'turn lock' is the same as 'turn key', suggesting the same activity.\n12. However, we can eliminate 'turn lock' as well because it sounds generic and doesn't describe more specific actions a person might do with a bike lock.\n13. So, this leaves us with B: pocket and D: open doors as the most likely options remaining.\n14. But since the first key word 'He' already suggests the speaker is a boy, it's more likely he didn't have to 'open doors' later, which makes sense.\n15. So, the correct answer is B: pocket.\nAnswer: B(Pocket): pocket\n\nInput: He told her that the best way to improve his grammar was to read more stories or what? Choices: A(stories) B(songs) C(books) D(articles) E(websites)\nRationales: Step 1: The sentence 'He told her that the best...' tells us that the speaker is 'he' and he is giving advice on how to improve the grammar of a 'her'.\nStep 2: The sentence 'the best way to improve his grammer was to read more stories...' tells us that 'he' is giving advice to improve his spoken (grammar) by reading stories.\nStep 3: Analyse each option to exclude all that do not fit.\nStep 4: Evaluate each option to find the best fit.\nStep 5: Verify that it's a viable option.\nStep 6: Verify the correct pronoun is used.\nStep 7", "answer": "A: swimming pool"}
{"text": ", pocket, open doors, solution to problem, and pocket. \n5. None of these relate to actually opening the lock, except 'pocket' and 'turn'. \n6. As 'pocket' cannot be a feasible option, it leaves us with a choice between 'turn' and'solution to problem'. \n7. The statement makes it clear that he already has the key, since he has already taken it out of his pocket and is holding it in his hand; so he cannot be seeking out or looking for any'solution to problem' after having already taken the key out of his pocket.\n8.'solution to problem\" can mean some kind of preparation that he is making before he opens the lock.\n9. So then, his action could be the 'turning of the key', which opens the lock.\n10. As a result, the best answer to the question: 'what was he doing' is A: turning lock.\nAnswer: A; turning lock\n\nInput: How did the people on the expedition determine if they were close to a new species of animal or plant? Choices: 1.A: smell or touch 2.B: find a source of food 3.C: find a water source 4.D: look for bones 5.E: look for a freshly made hole\nRationales:1. The question asks how the people on the expedition determined if they were close to finding a new species.\n2. If we look at the options given, the only options that make sense are 3.B and 4.D.\n3.B finds a source of food suggests where the humans are going to spend some time searching for food.\n4.D looks for bones implies that the people on the expedition will be scanning or looking for the bones of animals they previously have killed or hunted.\n5. Out of the given options, E: look for a fresh hole is the most vague and does not make sense, so that leaves us with C.\n6. Therefore the best answer would be 4.D: look for the bones of an animal, as this is how the people on the exploration determined if they were close enough.\nAnswer: D; look for bones\n\nInput: How is the following statement different from its opposite?

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, and open doors.\n5. A: turn lock indicates the action of turning a lock, however, we can eliminate this option directly because the wording doesn't mention the key being used to turn the lock.\n6. Similarly, C: solution to a problem and D: pocket are also eliminated since they don't seem to provide a direct correlation to the action mentioned in the question.\n7: Lastly, E: open door can also be disregarded as unlikely choice, as it does not necessarily indicate the action of the using a key, but instead the action of unlocking a door. \n8. This leaves us with two choices to consider. Either A: turn lock or B: pocket. \n9. Considering the context of the prompt, it is more likely that the chosen response would have included the action of the key, in response to this, it is more probable that he turned the lock, instead of pocketed it.\n10. So, the answer must be A: turn lock.\n11. Thus we can conclude that A: turn lock is the right choice.\nAnswer: A. Turn Lock\n\nInput: The problem was solved using a simple solution, a way in which it was used. Choices:  A. Simple B. Basic C. Short D. Simpler E. Easy\nRationales:\n1. There is a problem in the system.\n2. The solution is simple.\n3. The solution for each system is simple, the same in each case.\n4. Simple is a way of solving problems in the system.\n5. The solution can be done in one move and without making changes to anything else.\n6. It is a method a person can use as part of the routine that they do each day.\n7.

The direction of the night sky, 4. There is no reason. 5. The height of the sun\nRationales: The sun rises on the east because it is in the east at the moment. The sun is located east of the planet's midpoint which gives the appearance of rising in the east. The process of the Sun rising is known as helio-astronomy.\n\nInput: I had a good time but the movie was what?

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. 'Solution' refers to the means of solving the problem. We need to eliminate other possible options that do not fit this description.\n6. 'Turn lock' does not imply solving the problem of unlocking the lock. Hence, it is eliminated.\n7. 'Pocket', though seems a plausible solution at first, suggests that he carries all of the items that he was planning to use for bike riding in his pocket, which is not likely.\n8. 'Open doors' indicates that he opened all doors to the place where he was going to bike home, which is not likely the case since the question mentions that he was ready to begin the trip.\n9. This leaves us with 'B: pocket'. \n10. This is a plausible choice. Pocket may mean a small bag which will contain things such as keys, bike lock and possibly a bike helmet which he will use during his bike ride.\n11. Therefore, the answer to the question is D: pocket.\n12. Answer: D: pocket\n\nInput: Her hair was thin, so what did she choose to do? Choices: \n1. A: braid 2. B: add extensions 3.

{"text": ", pocket key, open doors, and pocket.\n5. Out of all the options, we know that opening a lock is not the action that is being performed because we have been told the action is performed with the key and not the lock.\n6. Therefore pocket and open doors appear as inappropriate options.\n7. Next, we assume that the bike lock may be broken and that the key is only being used to open a broken lock, which makes the next action to be turn lock.\n8. Moreover, from the given words, we infer that there is only a single bike, and that he is opening the bike lock instead of his house lock.\n9. Thus, turning a bike lock is the only option that makes sense.\n10. As such, the answer is A.\nAnswer: A. turn lock\n\nInput: The first line of the song talks about \"a friend who went away\".  He went across the border, what is the likely reason he went? Choices:  [a]: take a job b]: visit a friend c]: do the dishes d]: go to an art event e]: study f]: go to a friend's wedding\nRationales:\n1. The song is speaking about \"a friend who left you behind\".  The lyrics describe this person as someone who is gone, as shown in the line \"a friend that's gone away\".\n2. This further indicates the person has gone away from where you are, which shows that this friend is likely to be in a different country.\n3. Next, consider which countries these could be.\n4. The word \"border\", as used in the lyrics, can refer to the border of the United States, as shown in the examples, \"I see Mexico across the border\", and, \"crossing the border\".\n5. This hints that the country being referred to is probably not the United States.\n6. Moreover, the United States has some of the most secure and effective border control policies in the world.  The word \"border\" may also be used to refer to different states in a country. There is often a divide between people belonging to different states, even within the same country.\n7. For example, consider the United States of America, which is often referred to by various terms based on whether it is divided by race or class.\n8.

Turning the lock could also be done to unlock a door to get home with his bike.\n7. So, the option that fits the best among the given choices is 'turn lock' as the action of turning the lock is a logical conclusion to his bike ride. \n8. Therefore, the answer choice is A: turn lock.\n9. Note: 'turn lock' doesn't necessarily mean it was the only way he would have biked home, but logically and in this context the statement is clear about this.\n10.

Choices A: take a raincoat out of his bag B: put a hat on his head C: take a selfie photo of the sun D: enjoy himself out out E: go to sleep\nRationales:\n1. Firstly, the given statement says that he saw the sun through the cloud.\n2. This tells us that the sun was hidden from view, but that he was still able to see it due to the presence of clear or broken pieces of cloud.\n3. When we read on, we discover that there is no rain, or precipitation, occurring.\n4. He was ready to bi\n5. Now we can begin to understand why he decided to what.\n6. It is logical to assume that the statement 'He saw the sun through the coud' is the reason for his decision. He decided to what, because he saw the sun through a cloud.\n7. The options we have are A: take a rain coat out of his bag, put a hat on his head, or take a selfie photo.\n8. All three of these options are not logical explanations that link the reasons that the decision was made. \n9. This leaves us with the remaining options: to enjoy himself and go to sleep. \n10.

The given statement: Danny loves music, 2. Danny was always interested in music since he was a boy.\n3. Danny played different instruments growing up.\n4. Danny learned to play cello when he was young.\n5. The given options: cello, violin, flute, bass and harp, are all musical instruments.\n6. One has to figure out the instrument used the longest, based on the statement about Danny playing different instruments growing up, cello does not fit since he played it when he was young and then stopped, but violin, bass and flute are all currently used by musicians, and Danny is currently a musician.\n7.

{"text": ", open doors, pocket, solution to problem and pocket. \n5. As the options don't explain what he did immediately after getting out his key, we can reject 'turn lock'.\n6. 'Pocket', 'open doors' refer to actions that were not done immediately after getting out the key, so we can reject them too. \n7. This leaves us with 'pocket' and'solution to problem', as the only two that can be directly linked to getting out the key. \n8. Out of these two choices,'solution to problem' may refer to him looking for a solution to a problem, and does not directly mention the key. (which is different from the given options of getting out the key and then doing an action with the key). \n9. Therefore, the correct answer is E: open doors.\nAnswer: E.

So you know, there is not just one option here. The best answer should have something to do with the coworker who is annoying them. Therefore, in this question, you should think about the coworker who made me do something against my will. A. Stop - This is not a correct answer because the person is already yelling at their cowworkers. B. Start yelling - This is not a work appropriate answer because that would mean he or she is working in an environment that is not friendly. C. Start yelling - Same as before Choices: Bottom line, they didn't do anything so the correct answer should have something to the annoying coworker. D.

We should eliminate turn lock because it does not specifically mention unlocking the door, and we should also eliminate open doors because it is not an action related to unlocking the door.\n6. The solution to problem is an action that has to be undertaken when a problem arises, so this one doesn't make sense either.\n7. So, this leaves us with pocket, as the most suitable answer.\n8. Pocket has to be used to retrieve something, for example - a door key.\n9.

Choices A: New York B: Los Angeles C: Denver D: Paris E: Rio \nRationales:1. The question asks us to figure out the name of the city whose mayor the person asking the question lives near.\n2. This tells us that person is living in a big city and lives near a very important person.\n3. Among the given options: New York, Los Angeles, Denver, and Paris,  only New York is as big or bigger than the question's description.\n4. Also, New York is one of the biggest cities in the world and the country where the mayor of New York lives is a country that is very well known, so this is a likely plausible answer.\n5.

We understand from the question that 'wildcat' is a word sometimes used to describe a certain kind of cat.\n2. We should eliminate the crazy cat because crazy cats are not usually wild, and therefore are not likely to be referred to as something wild.\n3. We should also eliminate the cat in public, as this kind of cat is probably more comfortable indoors.\n4. So we are left with domestic cat, which is the same as house cat - a domestic cat which most of the time lives indoors and sleeps or eats", "answer": "A: drugstore"}
{"text": ", open doors, pocket, solution to problem, and pocket.\n5. First, turn lock and open doors are not applicable since they can't be accomplished with a bike lock on the front door.\n6. Second, solution to problem and pocket do not make sense since turning a bike lock is the next step in getting ready to bike home and not a solution to a problem.\n7. As for pocket, the given wording implies a physical action and bike lock is a device that is opened by sliding the key into the lock cylinder.\n8. Thus, the options that can be excluded are solution to problem as well as pocket.\n9. Now, there is only option B: open lock, which is a valid action to take before biking. \n10. There are two reasons for choosing 'open lock':\n11. First, 'key' is a type of tool and is usually used with locks.\n12. Second, the question mentions 'get out of the key', which implies some form of manipulation; opening a lock could be a manipulative action.\n13. Hence, the answer should be B: open lock.\n14. The rationale for this is: 1. The action of getting out the key is to be manipulated. 2. The action of manipulating a lock is to open a lock. 3. The action of opening a lock is to be in a position to bike home. 4. The action of being in a position to bikee home is to be ready to bike home\n15. Therefore, the best choice is A: open lock.\n\nInput: He got his shirt, pants, and jacket from what? Choices A: a barn, B: an attic, C: a wardrobe, D: a closet E: his room\nRationales: A. The first part of the question asks the student to identify each item from a list. The student needs to determine which of the given words correspond with each item.\nThe sentence describes each item as a'shoe' while another item (the'shirt') is referred to as being 'near'. As can easily be determined from the context, the item near the shoe is referring to the shirt, as the shirt is nearby. Therefore, we eliminate all clothing-related options (the shirt", "answer": "D: table"}

Open doors is also too broad and may not be applicable in the situation.\n8. Therefore, the best answer that fits within the context is 'begin to open the lock.'\n9. As of now, this is the only choice to provide a concrete action in relation to the context, so the answer is 'begin to open'.\n10. Note: Open does not have to complete the whole process.\n11. Just opening the key by turning it may suffice as him 'bike home.'\n12. Therefore the correct answer is D: open doors.\n\nInput: She didn't want to let her best friend into her room and go through all her private things. She wanted her to know that she what? Choices: A: trust her B: respect her C: was ready for them D: cared for them\nRationales: The statement tells us that Sarah didn't want to \"let her best friend into her roms and go through all her \"private things.\" This provides insights on her feelings towards her best friend. \n2. Sarah then went on to say that she wanted her to know that \"she cared for them.\"\n3. From the context of the statement, Sarah has a desire to protect something and it appears there is some level of trust between the two.\n4. However, the question does not specify Sarah's intention or feelings towards her best friend at the time\n5. The only remaining option that fits the context is C: was ready for us, as it tells us that Sarah is prepared or ready for her best friend to go through her things.\n6. So the answer is C: was ready.\n\nInput: The man wasn't able to understand her, He stopped to what? Choices A: continue to make fun of her B: answer everything she says C: listen to her D: let her speak for herself E: talk over her\nRationales: It is obvious the man was frustrated with his inability to understand the woman. He then tried to change the subject.\n2. He was \"not sure what she needed\", which means he had only a vague notion of what she needed or wanted.\n3", "answer": "A: laugh"}

The last option does not clearly correlate to the action of opening a door lock, but it does have the connotation of an end goal in the context of leaving.\n6. Thus comparing the choices, we can conclude that B: pocket is the more likely answer, the other options are eliminated.\n7. Therefore the answer is B: pocket.\nAnswer: B\n\nInput: Your sister needs a car.  You are giving her your old one. That means what? Choices: A: good,  B: bad, C: sad, D: helpful, E: happy\nRationales: Start by understanding what the question is asking. \n1. The question asks 'Your sister needs a car. You are giving her your  old one. That means'. \n2. The sentence gives hints about the meaning that the word 'that' intends to convey. An old used automobile can be considered helpful only if it fits the needs of the receiver. \n3. Your sister's need for a car can imply that she doesn't have access to an automobile or is looking to upgrade. \n4. It also indicates that the car you will give to her had been used by you, possibly a very long time ago.\n5. If she does not already have a car and is merely looking to upgrade, and if you give her the car for the sake of charity, then it can be considered helpful.\n6. If she already possesses another means of transport and is expecting a car solely for the purpose of upgrading, then the word 'helpful' does not hold as much meaning. \n7. The phrase you are giving her is only an extra hint about the gift and does not specifically indicate an intent. In this context, it merely implies that your sister has requested the use of an automobile and that she may even accept it as a gift to express her gratitude. \n8. In most scenarios, when someone gives someone an abandoned used car they have had awhile, it is a sign that the giver can no longer use the vehicle. \n9. This indicates that, in this scenario, the phrase you are giving her does not necessarily mean that your sister will receive the car for the purpose of upgradation or any other positive reason, but that it may just signify the transfer of an item to a recipient, and", "answer": "B: basement"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, open door, and pocket.\n5. We eliminate A: turn lock because opening a lock involves physical action, while turning a key implies more of a mentally based activity as people tend to twist rather than turn a key.\n6. We also eliminate D: open door because it contains a word that is not related to the given key/lock situation.\n7. The remaining options are: pocket and solution to problem. \n8. Pocket refers to a container people keep in a bag or coat that acts as a storage container for various objects. \n9. However, we reject this as option primarily because the phrase 'begin to' suggests he had not fully completed the action of pocketing.\n10. This leaves us with option C: solution to problem.  An additional line of reasoning could suggest this choice because pocketing things implies one has identified an item they would like to hold on to and put in their pocket. \n11. However, the statement suggests that he was 'getting out' the key, which implies that the action of 'getting out' the keys refers to getting the key before the subsequent action of bike riding. \n12. Therefore,'solving a problem' is the most appropriate phrase out of the given options.\n13. Thus, the answer must be A: turn lock. \nAnswer: A: turn lock\n\nInput: The two sisters live together, but when they are in the kitchen, their tone of communication changes. Aunt Edna says they are likely to do what? Choices: A: disagree B: argue C: talk D: sing E: pray\nRationales:  1. The question asks which of the given options aunt Edna says the two sisters are likely to do when they are together in the kitchen.  \n2. The question states that two sisters live together and the change of tone of communication occurs when they are both in the kitchen.  3. This implies that the two sisters are related and probably have a close relationship.  \n4. Aunt Edna could be asking this question because she has noticed a difference in their tone of communication.  \n5. Out of the given options,'sing', 'argue' and 'disagree' may apply to sisters in general due to the family tie between relatives (mother, father, aunt, uncle, brother, sister", "answer": "C: own home"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors. \n5. Pocket means carrying something without opening it.  \n6. This means that out of all the given options, turn lock, solution and open are all activities that involve a key so that pocket and bike cannot be the answer. \n7. If the key is used to open something or solve a problem, he would not need to get it out of his pocket before using it.\n8. He would know where it was, therefore, if he got his key out, it would be to unlock the door.\n9. This concludes that his next action would be to turn and open the lock, so the correct answer is:  D: open door. \nAnswer: D: open door.\n\nInput: What would be a better choice from the two following options for someone whose favorite music has changed from classic rock to new wave?

Choices O. 3: O & C 4: A & B 5: A & C 6: A & B 7: A & C 8: A & B C. A & B = change to music which does not mean to change the music  So, the choice to consider are D & E.  So Option A will be eliminated and so will option B. since A & B = change of music  and therefore option B cannot be a better one  D = A new wave is not a music from the past  So, option E will be eliminated and only options D and E can give A new wave.  E= B & D Since we started with option A, it is better A= B & D.  Answer:-  D= A new wave is not from the past  So A&D = to change to a music which is A better choice to keep up with the new wave music.\nAnswer: D. A new wave is not the music from the past, and new wave is A. better a choice to keep up with new wave music.\n\nInput: Which two consecutive integers are divisible by 4?

Solution to problem, and pocket are not specific enough to infer whether he turned the key on his lock or not.\n7. Pocket is excluded as well because he would only be able to pocket his key if he already turned it.\n8. Therefore, we can conclude that he turned the lock, since it is the only option that fits into the context of the statements. The answer is A: turn lock.\nAnswer: A turn lock\n\nInput: We want to get some exercise, so what do we have to begin with? Choices: 0 A:  running shoe B:  water bottle C:  workout clothes D:  exercise routine E:  workout equipment\nRationales: It's the \"we\" part that tells us that the choice would be made as a group.\n\n### Explanations:\n\nIn the first example, \"What?\" was posed to you to make you understand the scenario and what exactly the problem was. To complete the task efficiently you must answer the what?, why?, where, how, and when questions of an exercise.\n\nFor this first task, answer by picking up the paper, reading the problem/given statement, and answering those questions. \nAs opposed to answering to your own definition, if you are uncertain of the correct answer you can refer to other solutions.\n\nThe second example explains the thought process and gives the options. For this, read the question thoroughly. Try to read it without referring to the options to see which one can be the most plausible choice. If you continue with the incorrect options, keep in mind, the question was posed to ask the questioner something. If you are confused by any answer, refer to earlier solutions or other sources to confirm it is not plausible. \n\nThink about the context of the problem: does it relate to the initial conditions? Does it relate to the question? If so, it should be the answer.\n\nThe third example provides the best type of creativity for the customer. For this task, you must evaluate the situation and select one option that fits best.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, and open doors.\n5. Out of the choices, only A: turn lock and E: open doors suggest the action of opening a door.\n6. Turn Lock can be eliminated as lock turns can be aided by electronics or magnets.\n7. Solution to problem C: can be eliminated as it is something to do after biking home, so the previous choice (getting out his key) suggests that this has already been done.\n8. Therefore, only A: turn locks and E: open doors are the feasible choices. \n9. However, E: open doors is not as specific as A: turn lock.\n10. So the answer B: turn lock is the correct choice for this question.\nAnswer: B turn locks\n\nInput: I saw a guy, He's been living with his girlfriend for a couple years, so I'm guessing who does what here? A: He Does everything, She gets benefits B: She does everyting, He gets the benefits C: They does everything, but it doesn'ta matter D: They do everything E: Neither\nRationales:\n1. Start by breaking down the question into simpler statements to figure out the exact context. 2. The first sentence, tells us that the guy has been living with his girlfrend for a couple of years.\n3. This implies that they live together, so the boyfriend supports or has contributed to their relationship economically.\n4. This implies that \"He does everything\", or \"He gets everything\", doesn't fit here.\n5. The second sentence: \"but it doesn't matter\". Is not relevant to the previous statement implying it must describe one of the first four statements. \n6. Out of the first three statements, \"He gets everything\" and \"She gets everything\" are both possible sentences but do not explain the boyfriend's possible contributions, thus they are not the answer.\n7. \"They do everything\", is too broad, it needs to be more specific.\n8. Therefore only \"She does everything, He gets the benefits\" fits the statement, and it is the correct answer. \n9. After the first statement, the question then asks who does which part.\n10. They both probably have individual responsibilities, so we only need to decide who gets the benefits from their", "answer": "E: dirty dishes"}

Turn lock refers to specifically turning a lock, which would imply there is a need to unlock the door he planned to bike through. \n6. However, the question indicates that he had 'begun to' the action of opening a door, thusly, the other choice options do not support the conclusion of 'turn lock.'\n7. Hence, if he had 'begun', he must have started the action of opening a locks.\n8. So, according to the options given, the given solution is closest to this action as it involves a 'pocket,' which implies containing locks or keys.\n9. So, the answer to the question is E: open doors. \nAnswer: E: open doors\n\nInput:  I'm going to the library today,  I'll be on campus today.  I'm going on a trip later today  I would like to meet my friends later today.  You'll be free later today.  What will I do?   Why is this answer correct?\nRationales:1. The second sentence of the text says \"I'm going to the Library today [and then] I'll be on Campus.\"  This implies that he will be on campus today.\n2. The third sentence suggests that he will be going on a trip after he \"will be on Campus today.\"\n3. As a result, 1, 2, and 3 contradict each other.\n4. Therefore, he will be on the library.\nAnswer: A and C\nInput: Which is the most effective approach to improving sales skills?

During an act of sex 7. During or after pregnancy 8. Before graduation 9. After graduation 10. On the wedding day\nRationales: The question begins by asking \"when does a person give birth?\"\n1. As there's no such thing as \"giving birth\" to an event or object, it's obvious that it can never be a specific day that it happens. \n2. Among the choices given, \"At a wedding ring\" implies that the wedding ring and the birth should take place at the same time. However, the wedding ring is a symbolical object and not a birth object, so it cannot be given birth to. \n3. \"During the act of sex\" does not refer to a wedding ring, as if someone were to \"give birth\" using the given time period, it wouldn't produce a pregnancy anyways! \n4. \"Before pregnancy\" does not refer to being born by an object (wedding ring), nor does it refer to a pregnancy or any event taking place before or at the time of giving birth. \n5. \"Before and after graduation\" does not refer to an object. \"Before\" and \"after\" are usually used in comparisons and aren't typically used as specific time periods that can be given birth to.\n6. \"After graduation\" could refer to \"a graduation ceremony\", but graduation ceremonies don't refer to being given birth to.

This leaves us with either option E: open the door or option C: solve a problem.\n8.

The young woman's job is likely to be related to her life and career.\n2. Therefore, the young woman's lifestyle is likely to be related - job skills provide a person with the necessary skills to excel at a job.\n3. The young woman is likely to put in the effort to develop the skills she needs to advance her career. \n4. Since she is thinking and planning ahead, she is likely to be ambitious.\n5.

For C the answer is 'No'.\n4. We eliminate the other options because they are not likely to be the correct answer for C.\n5. We also eliminate A and B because they are not likely relevant.\n6. E is the answer because for a 3-by-by magic square the numbers can only be 1, 2, or 3.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. Turning a lock is not what he is about to do.\n6. Opening a lock is not the solution to his situation of getting ready to bike home because he has not locked his bike. So, he most likely will open the door to get his bike.\n7. Solution to problem usually implies something that could help him with his bike riding (like fixing it) or a problem he will have later (like forgetting his bike lock at home). Instead, he just got his key out to go home, so this cannot be the option. \n8. Pocket is only logical if he is going to put the key in it instead of using it.

Only two remaining options then, Solution to problem and Open doors.\n\n12. 'Solution to problem' is more logical choice than 'open doors' for three main reasons. First and the most obvious one, 'Solution to problem,' is more specific than 'open doors.' \n13. Second, the 'pain' is something that has happened in the past, whereas 'opening doors' is about a future action.\n14. Third, the 'problem' is not 'getting ready to go on a bike ride,' but 'getting home after getting locked out of the house.' One solution for this problem are the doors in this house. This makes 'opening doors' a less suitable option than the given'solution to problem.' \n15. Therefore, 'Solution to the problem' is the answer.\n\nAnswer: D: solution to problem.\n\nInput: The old farm was completely different from what?

The given options could possibly mean \n\t1. A: never go back: If you are not satisfied with the treatment of a person then do not go back to him.\n\t2. C: Beg her to go back: You can beg someone for some favor, but if you go back to the same person repeatedly and he again acts badly then that person is bad and it is better not to go back to him. \n2.

So it is highly unlikely that the key relates to 'turn lock' as his solution to a problem: If he is locked out, a solution to a problem - which the key would then be involved in relating to - would be to call someone, or get the solution from somewhere else.\n7. Out of'solution to problem' and 'key', 'pocket' sounds more realistic as a choice of action when compared to 'turn lock' and 'get out his key' which are more about using the key to do specific tasks.\n8. The last option, 'open doors', is about bikes and bike racks at the start of the question so is disregarded.\n9. This leaves us with 'pocket' as the realistic choice, as he got his key out and likely put it in his pocket. \n10.

Choices:  An: delegate duties A: fire B: hire staff C: promote staff D: praise workers E: yell at them\nRationales:  1. The question starts with \"She was the boss at the plant and felt she just\nrequired encouragement...\" which implies a specific task of her. \n2. Delegate duties and hire staff are general terms that do not necessarily provide encouragement.\n3. Fire, promote, and yell are all very direct, while praise would mean complimenting, which can also not be considered encouragement.\n4. Now consider the given choices carefully and ask yourself if praise at any point in the question would serve to motivate and encourage her. \n5. It would not, according to the question.\n6. As a result, we can conclude that the correct answer is D: praise workers, because praising them directly relates to the question.\nAnswer: D; praise workers\n\nOutput: She was the bob at a plant and felt sh just needed encouragement.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. However, out of the given choices, B: turn key makes more sense because the key is needed for locking and unlocking the bike for riding.\n6. Similarly, the choice E: open doors refers to turning the key.\n7. This leaves D: pocket which means he put the key into his pocket, however, this does not make sense because the keys for a bike are usually attached to a chain, which the person would have removed before riding.\n8. Therefore, the correct answer is B: turn key.\nAnswer: B turn key\n\nInput: They can't seem to catch up to their teacher.  They're always lagging behind. What should they do? Choices: .\nRationales: The question is asking what students can do if they are always lagging behind their teacher.  \nTo answer this, first consider the options available.  \nC:  get caught up with them The option C is not the correct choice, because \u2018to catch up to\u2019 in this case means \u2018to arrive at the same place as\u2019, thus this choice would imply that they already arrived at the same place as their teacher, but this is not what we are told here.  \nA: be more organized The option A has some similarity to the choice C, but this doesn\u2019t fit with the context we are given. After all, we are told that the children always lag behind their teacher, so this choice is not correct.  \nD: work harder The answer D is not correct too, because if this were the correct answer then the children would never be able to catch up to their teach, and that would mean that they are always lagging \u2018behind\u2019.\n\nAnswer: A: get ahead The correct answer is \u2018to get ahead\u2019 because this choice is appropriate for the given context.\n\nInput: If you're going to be happy as a person, you should be what kind of worker?

E: hardworking isn't the correct response either, because there isn't enough information to help determine it as the best option. D", "answer": "C: spreadsheet"}
{"text": ", solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. Turn lock is not logical answer since as per this action he would not be able to open it.\n6. We further eliminate solution to problem because for this one we have already got a key.\n7. Pocket is another wrong answer, although he has already done 'get out the key' still he would get it from somewhere.\n8. So, the only logical answer remaining would be open doors: as his objective is to bike home so he needs to open the door to get out.  \n9. Hence, the answer choice is: open doors.\nAnswer: B- E: open doors\n\nInput: Misha is a good dancer. She likes dancing a lot, you should do what? Choices: A: encourage B: compliment C: join D: help E: appreciate\nRationales:\n1. The question indicates that the dancer in question (Misha) is in good enough condition to dance.\n2. This suggests that she is reasonably consistent and proficient with her dancing skills. \n3. Complimenting her dancing skills can encourage them to do more dancing as it is a way of showing approval towards her. \n4. Misha is a skilled dancer and being able to compliment her on her dancing can help make her better at dancing. \n5. Furthermore, we know that Misha likes dancing and is willing to do it frequently.\n6. Therefore complimenting her dancing is a correct choice.\n7. The given options are A: encourage B. compliment C. join D. help E. appreciate.\n8. We can disregard B. Compliment C. join as she is not skilled enough to become a professional dancer and D. Help because that is the objective i.e to compliment her. E. Appreciate is not applicable. \n9. So, the correct answer choice is A: encourage.\nAnswer: A- E: encourage\n\nInput: Which of this group of women is closest to being one and the same with a baby? Choices: 50%: 30%: 20%: 10%: A.

{"text": "(which makes no sense), pocket, solution to problem, pocket and open doors.\n5. The word 'pocket' is repeated twice, and both times, there is no indication that the person actually gets out his key.\n6. Therefore we can conclude that the action of getting out his key is the action of opening a door on his bike.\n7. Hence the answer is D: open doors. \n\nInput: You should learn what? Choices: A: that B: not to C: how D: what E: where\nRationales: Start by understanding what 'You should learn what?' means. \n1. 'You should learn what' is a sentence fragment with an omitted subject, meaning it does not have a subject or it does not convey an action. \n2. 'what' is the object of the sentence 'You should learn what?'. \n3. 'what' is also an object of 'learn' which is the verb in this sentence. \n4. If someone says 'You should learn what,' what does they mean? \n5. What is an object in the sentence 'You should know not'? \n6. The object of the sentence is 'not'. \n7. Therefore, what is the object of the question 'You should learn what.'? What is the verb in this question?\n\nThis grammar and structure is very common in english questions, so if you memorize these rules you will know how most english grammar works.\n\nSo in this sentence, \n\nYou should learn to not.\n\n'what' stands for 'not'\n\nWe know from the above paragraph that 'what' is an object in the question 'You should not....'. \n\nTherefore the question 'You should what?' will have 'not' as it's verb.\n\n'Learn what' is just another way to say 'learn to not'\n\nSo 'You should learn what...' is equal to 'You should learn to not'\nThis is the answer to the question of what the subject 'you' should or does learn.\n\nAnswer: Learn to not (do).\n\nInput: A cow produces milk, this is its function, what is it doing?

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. The answer could be A: turn lock, C: solution to problem, or D: open doors, however each option is slightly awkward. 'Turn lock' does not relate to his actions or state and 'C: solution to problem' does not logically describe a particular action.\n6. Therefore the only plausible answer must be to do what the person actually does:  D: open doors.\n7. Hence answer is D: open doors. \nAnswer: D: open doors\n\nInput: A dog is trying to make a human understand something, we think that the dog should speak in what? Choices: language, language, language, language\nRationales: This type of question is often about comprehension and logic. 1. Since we know that the answer must have something to do with language, we can narrow the choices down to options A, B, and C. 2. As a dog cannot speak to a human, neither could one communicate with the other by using the same spoken language. 3. As a dog does not have the capacity or ability to understand what humans say, it is unlikely that a man would understand what a dog was trying to say. 4. If we put language in as the first option, we see that it can be eliminated because it is not the case that two people from different languages can understand each other when only one understands the correct language.  5.

In other words, it is logical to infer that he began to turn the key (and subsequently open the lock) in order to open the door upon his arrival.\n7. Therefore the answer is E: open doors.\nAnswer: E. open doors\n\nInput: When the door was jammed, I had to what? Choices A: knock with an object B: break the door C: put the key in D: use the key E: use the key in the right place\nRationale: 1. When the door is jammed, I would have had to do something, but what exactly? We could deduce that he had to use the key.\n2. It might be tempting to think that only choice A: knock with an other object is a logical answer but think about this choice: it does not have much relevance to the situation the man faced when the door was jammed. \n3. On the other hand, choice D: use the key sounds perfectly relevant because we know that in such a situation people inevitably resort to making use of the key/lock at least once.\n4. However, if we are to consider the phrasing of the question, you must take note of the phrase 'in the right place'.\n5. Hence, the only logical/relevant answer to the question is either choice D: use the right place or E: put the key in the right/appropriate place.\n6. Thus it stands to reason that the man's action or reaction to the situation will always involve 'using the key', in some form or another, and the way the man uses it will be determined by the location (or place) where he puts/places the key.\n7. Hence the answer is B: putting the key in the right (proper) place.\nAnswer: B: putting the key (in the right) place", "answer": "B: appear beautiful"}

He may have already solved a potential problem on the way to bike home, but if he still has any other problems at home then he would have an open door. \n7. The other choices may be feasible answers, but with the provided information, a key refers to unlocking a bike, and opening a door is not part of a process to bike home. \n8. In comparison, 'pocket' does not make sense in this context because he has his key, not a pocket in his coat. \n9. Also, 'pocket' refers to placing things into a pocket, therefore, he may have already placed his key inside his pocket, but that would have no use, as he is ready to bike home and has his key.\n10. Thus, the answer must be 'begin to what?' 'Open' means to unlock a bike.\nThus, the answer is A.\nAnswer: A.\n\nInput: He could think of no better plan, how could he avoid the situation? Choices:  F: try and pray D: give up E: keep his promise G: have a plan\nRationales: The given statement suggests that he couldn\u2019t think of any better plan.\nThe other given choices F D E G are all very vague, and there is very little about them to judge them on.\nHence, the best answer must be A: give up, which is the only option that actually helps, by giving up on the plan.\nAnswer: A\n\nInput: The first question I had to answer, didn\u2019t have options.

Therefore, the answer here is C: turn lock.\nAnswer: C : turn lock\n\nInput: The police had to let her go, they were not able to identify the burglar. Why would this not let the family feel satisfied? Choices:  G: They didn't know who broke in A: Because the man was a different race B: Because they don't feel satisfied about how things went C: Because the family felt helpless D: Because they didn't arrest the man who broke in\nRationales: The police had to release the un-identified man. How this relates to satisfying the family: He is not the burglar but the police caught him anyway. They should feel satisfied with the solution. Because the police captured him, they do not have to worry about another burglary. \nThe police catching this man (un-identified) may make them feel happy that they stopped an unknown individual and satisfied with their work, even without charging him.\nThere are only two choices which deal with the man being released: G: Because there was no arrest and A: because he is a different race. \nBecause he is a different race is the wrong choice because the family probably would have felt good about the man being arrested. \nThe correct answers are: D:  Because they didn't arrst the burglar who broke in  and C: Because there was no charge, only the guy who was caught felt bad.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. Out of the provided options, 'open doors' is the only one that does not specify what will happen if he turns the lock.\n6. This means that the answer must involve him either pocketing or unlocking. \n7. 'pocket' can be a specific way of putting an object like a key in the front right pocket, in which case, it wouldn't be relevant to the question's request for more specific details. In contrast, if someone is 'pocketing' a key, they are typically using the action of 'putting something in a pocket' as the answer.\n8. Therefore, the choice that will best fit the question is B: pocket.\nAnswer: B : pocket.\n\nInput: The kids in the second grade will be happy to have the new playground equipment, they'll also be happy to have a what? Choices: A: teacher B: good homework partner C: playground toys D: playdate after school E: teacher\nRationales: This is a sentence completion question. The answer should be from the second part of the sentence (where the italics begin). We know that the first part of the sentence is talking about second graders receiving new playground equipment. Now we have to figure out the meaning of the second half of the sentence. The second half starts with \"They will also be happy to have...\" Look at what the playground equipment is. The answer must be a playdate after school. There are no playground toys listed later in the sentence. Also, there are no new playground machines or teachers listed later in the sentence, so the answer wouldn't be a teacher or good homework partner, which don't really make sense in the context of the sentence. A playdate after school is the answer because play dates happen after school; the kids in the second grad will be happy if that happens; also, they are talking about how happy the kids will be to have something that will probably happen after school (ie: if school lets out early enough, they have the rest of the day free to go home and see their friend).\nAnswer: Answer: E: teacher\n\nInput: The new law should be easy to understand.

Thus, his next steps involve opening doors which can be inferred from the word 'pocket'. The given choices only offer the options of turning lock and pocket, but the information given suggests that he needs to open doors, and thus this leads us to eliminate the options for turning lock and pocket. \n7. So, since the choices can be narrowed down to only one, the answer is C, which is B: pocket.\nAnswer: B; pocket\n\nInput: I hope to find the right job next month, I'll have a interview this next week, if what it my skills, I'm almost sure to succeed, but if I didn't do well on my math course this year I could have a what? Choices: A: trouble B: problems C: job D: job opportunity E: new job\nRationales: A. If the question makes mention of an interview, then it is not likely that the person in question would already have a job. This then leaves us with 'job opportunity' as the only answer out of the options given that make sense as a possible outcome.\nB. As a person is interviewing for a job, if their skills are appropriate for the position, they most likely will get the job. The correct choice out of the options given is 'job'. \nC.

Since the question has mentioned that all the other actions have been done prior to this, he must be trying to unlock the door. \n6. Since the question only mentions opening the lock, it can be safely concluded that he was getting ready to unlock the door and not the lock itself.\n7. Therefore the correct answer choice is D: pocket, as it describes the action of opening the lock. \n8. The action of opening the lock is needed before biking, therefore, this is why he is most likely just going to his pocket to unlock the door/lock. \n9. This leaves us with three choices: 'turn lock', 'pocket' and'solution to problem'. \n10. As we can see, the word'solution' is not used anywhere else in the sentence but 'turn lock' and 'pocket'. Therefore, the answer is option E: turn lock.\nAnswer: E; turn lock\n\nInput: The dog's leash is very long.  How do you prevent it from becoming a problem? Choices:  M: put it around your arm B: put it around your leg C: keep it wrapped around your shoulder D: keep it off the floor E: keep your hands free\nRationales: The choice (M) put it around your arm does not fit to any of the reasons stated in the question, as it is not said anywhere that a person is wearing the dog's leash around their arm (option M). Therefore, the answer must be kept from getting tangled under foot (option D).\nInput: Mikael has three jobs. What could he do to create more time? Choices:  B: take care of his grandpa A: buy his own house C: hire a caretaker D: move into an apartment Housing estate E: ask all employees for help\nRationales: Option Housing estate is not related to the question because hiring a caregiver is already a good and plausible solution to the question, not 'buying his own house'. \nInput: Which will stop rain from the house faster?

Since the unexpected car accident happened in the desert, they are feeling stressed.\n2. They must feel stressed as some group members died because of the accident.\n3. Since the accident happened in the desert and not at home or in a city, they are feeling embarrassed.\n4. The unexpected car accident happened, they might face a lawsuit and the remaining members would feel embarrassed because the accident they were in the desert.\n5.

Choices:  I: brake lights II: brake fluid III: rotor IV: squeaking brakes V: tires VI: brake pedal VII: fluid leaks VIII: pads\nRationales: First, it is useful to eliminate all the choices that are not related to brake maintenance - that is, the choices that are neither indicators of nor reasons for the need for brake work or replacement.\n1. Brake lights indicates a need to fix brakes because your brake warning light is on. However, the brake light would not turn on if there is not a need for brake work. \n2. Brake fluids are used to lubricate and cool the brakes. The need of brake fluid would not indicate the need of brakes.\n3. If the rotor squeaks, it may be a sign that your brakes will need work soon. \n4. If you hear squeaking as you apply the brakes and also notice other physical signs of brake wear, it is likely that you will need to replace your brakes soon.\n5. But, hearing a squeak is not proof that you need to replace your brake pads.\n6. Tires could also be in need of work if you hear noises that sound like squeaking. But in that case, you would not necessarily need the brakes changed. \n7. The brake pedal would not indicate a need for repair/replacement as it depends on the vehicle the brake pedal is attached to.\n8.

Choices A: burn it B: boil it C: add sugar D: melt it E: add water.\nRationales:1. The first sentence of the prompt begins by providing us with the main idea: 'you don't want the ice to melt.'\n2. Ice melting is a natural process that requires time.\n3. The given choices are A: burn it B burn it C: add sugar, D: melt it, and E: add water. \n4. We know that the prompt does not want ice to melt.\n5. Therefore A: burn it out, B: burn it B C: add sugar D melt it E:add water are out of the question, and option E: add water does not make sense either.\n6. Next, we think about whether melting the ice could help the problem.\n7. This implies the ice is cold and hard.\n8. This then leads us to option C: add sugar, which will help soften the ice, and will help prevent the toffee from becoming cold.\n9. This brings us to the conclusion that the correct answer is C: add sugar.\nAnswer: C add sugar.\n\nInput: Which option will allow the person to get to the other side of each level of the waterfall? Choices :  A: an oar B: a boat C: a jet ski D: a raft E: a bicycle.\nRationales. : 1. The word 'each' in the prompt is referring to 'a level of the waterfall,' so there can only be one 'level' of the waterfall. So, we eliminate E: a bicyclen and C: a jet ski.\n2", "answer": "B: rhythmic movement"}
{"text": ", open doors, solution to problem, pocket, and get out his key.\n5. Turn lock is something he does before trying to open doors, so this can be disregarded. \n6. We can also discard solution to problem and pocket because it's logical for him to get ready to use his bike lock by simply getting out his key.\n7. 'Getting out his key' implies that he has put it in his pocket or other storage beforehand, making a conclusion about his lock and his doors. \n8. So, the answer can be either of A: turn lock or B: pocket as they both fit these requirements.\n9. However, because A) turn lock does not really involve him starting the activity of getting his key ready to open the bike lock, we can conclude that the answer is more likely to be B: pocket.\n10. Since A: turn lock can be disregarded, it leaves us with only B: pocket.\nAnswer: B. pocket.\n\nInput: Some people believe that life exists elsewhere,  if they discover it where would you place an additional what? Choices: A: planet B: sun C: moon D: universe E: galaxy\nRationales: The question mentions that some people believe they have discovered life elsewhere, so the following question will have to be regarding space. \n1. The options listed are: 'Planet' and 'Sun', as given, we eliminate 'Sun' as it is a star but not a planet. \n2. We can also eliminate 'Moon' because it is part of Earth and not an additional galaxy. \n3. Option 'Universe' seems to fit best as there are many galaxies in the universe, each with its own cluster of planets.\n4. We can also eliminate option 'Galaxy' as it only refers to a particular group of stars and does not refer to space as a whole.\n5. Finally, option 'Planet' is likely to be the best answer as there are many planets in the universe, and it would be a reasonable place to place additional life if it were discovered.\nAnswer: A. planet\n\nInput: He took a trip to the nearest town, he saw an old cottage, and it was what?

So it leaves us with D: pocket which makes sense since his next action is to take out his keys.\n6. So the answer is D: pocket\nAnswer: D: pocket\n\nInput: He has a bad back and he doesn't want to move too much. He'll just have to take a what? Choices: A: break B: day off C: seat D: rest E: nap\nRationales:    1. The patient has a bad back and doesn't want to stay in bed all day.\n2. The options tell us that taking a \"break\", a \"day off\", or a \"rest\" would be appropriate for someone with a bad back.\n3. However taking a \u201cnap\" can cause the patient to become more stiff and their back would become more painful.\n4. We can logically conclude that taking a \"seat\" would be the most appropriate course of action for someone with a bad lower back.\n5. A \"seat\" is the best action to take because it allows the patient to sit back and relax while still being able to move around to an extent.   \n6. So the patient should take a \"seat\". So the answer is E: seat\n7. Therefore, taking an appropriate \"seat\" is best for the patient.\nAnswer: E Seat\n\nInput: What is a common side effect of taking too many painkillers? Choices: 1. headache 2. dizziness 3. anxiety 4. constipation 5. tiredness\nRationales:   1. According to the question, taking too much painkillers is not a healthy or appropriate action for the patient.\n2. This is because some side effects that may occur are headache, dizziness, anxiety, constipation, or tiredness.\n3. Tiredness is the best fitting answer because it is logical to conclude based on the information provided in the question that taking too much painkillsers is related to sleep issues like tiredness.\n4. So the answer is B.\n\n### What", "answer": "B: sea world"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. We can eliminate 'turn lock' because it is not the action of unlocking the door.\n6. We can eliminate'solution to problem' because solving a problem is less immediate, less urgent, and probably not as actionable as the given options.\n7. Similarly, we can eliminate 'open doors' as the given options all indicate a desire to unlock the door and open it quickly.\n8. This leaves us with either 'pocket' or 'pocket'.  'pocket' can also imply that he's going to return the key once he has done whatever he is about to do, but 'pocket' usually refers directly to the action of putting something inside a pocket.\n9. Furthermore, 'open doors' has the word 'quickly' in it, which reinforces that it is a direct action, and it's the main goal of the subject in the question. \n10. Therefore, we conclude that the correct answer is 'open doors'.\nAnswer: E: open doors\n\nInput: She was not going to put her phone out to air charge, she was going to plug it in to what? Choices A: USB charger B: outlets C: 110V A/C plug D: battery chargers E: adapters\nRationales:1. The question tells is that she was not going to put the phone out to air charge.\n2. This could mean a number of things. The best answer based on the question is most likely to be plug it in to USB charger.\n3. Plugging the phone into USB means that the phone is using a usb cord and is charging using a USB charger. Charge using a USB charger can also mean to charge using an AC adapter which is very similar to charging with USB, but it might come with a USB adapter.\n4. The other options, A, C and E are not the correct solutions to this problem because they involve removing the phone from its place, not charging it. The options B and D, being charger-related, are also not the right answer because they make use of chargers to power up devices. In this case, the phone itself needs to be charged, not the device being charged. Admittedly, some newer phones have built-in micro-USB", "answer": "A: guilty conscience"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, and open doors.\n5. Pocket answers the question of what he did after he got his key out which was to put it back. \n6. Solving the problem would require more steps than is given in this choice and does not provide a context for how he began to open the lock after getting his key out. \n7. Therefore, out of the given choices, the only answer that fits the context is E: open doors.\nAnswer: E. open doors\n\nInput: People who smoke weed love to eat food what? Choices: A: stinky B: funky C: nasty D: delicious E: delicious\nRationales:  1. Start off by analyzing the question for the context and the tone used. This tells us that 'people who smoke weed' are the primary target of this question.\n2. It is a given that they love food but it is not given their exact reason for liking food. Because the question states that \"People who smoke weed love food,\" and implies that it is the reason given in the following sentence that we should look out for in the answer choices.\n3. The sentence after the question contains the words, \"people who smoke weed\" and is followed by the word, \"love\", and the verb, \"to eat\".\n4. Therefore, it is clear the answer should be the word, \"food\".\n5. However, there are other words that also relate to food. A: stinky, B: funky, C: nasty, D: delicious.\n6. Out of these four words, we can eliminate A: stinky because it is not relating directly to food but to the smell. \n7. The word, \"nasty\" is the same as the word, \"nastiness\" which is only part of the whole definition (a characteristic, quality or aspect of something). \n8. B: funky has the same reasoning as A: stinky.\n9. The word, \"delicious\" is not a characteristic or quality of food. \n10. This leaves C: nasty, which is synonymous to nastiness.\n11. Although it is relating to food, it is still not a complete description of the word \"food\" because it only includes the meaning of something that is", "answer": "C: small group"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. Among these options, A: turn his key is a suitable choice.\n6. Turning the key means opening the door and he is ready to bike home; this is what he is trying to do with the key.\n7. But, if he was not turning a lock, he could either have been preparing to walk (D) or looking for another solution to the problem (E).\n8. Therefore, the answer has to be A: turn lock.\nAnswer: A; turn lock\n\nInput: It requires a certain amount of skill, precision, and physical effort, what does the phrase a? Choices:  C: job B: job skill D: task E: position F: trade\nRationales: This question is asking about the type of task one should possess in order to perform a job. \n1. If anyone possesses a job, that means they have a job. A job, in general, refers to a job that one is paid to perform in exchange for work.\n2. The use of the adjective \"certain\" could imply a specific skill in order to perform the job.\n3. Among the given options, if someone possesses D: position they will most likely have a job.\n4. The other options could refer to specific types of tasks one can perform. In this context however; we need a broad and generic enough term.\n5. Therefore it would be best to leave F: trade as a non-concrete answer.\n6. The given options could also pertain to a specific job position such as C: job B: a job skill. \n7. But the phrase \"certain amount\" in line 3 implies that this is a very generic and very broad way people perform tasks. One would require skill for every single job, and one may also require skill to do any single task within a given job.\n8. With that understanding, the most likely answer is between B: job skill and A: job.\n9. However, B: job skill could pertain to the ability to perform certain tasks within a job. However A: job would be a slightly better fit as a job is generally more comprehensive than a job skill.\n10. Also, D: task could relate to performing certain tasks, but a task is not a job, therefore the question is asking about which option best describes a job.", "answer": "E: air out"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, and open doors.\n5. First, we eliminate options C and D because they are not the same action as suggested by the question.\n6. Also notice that none of the given options begin with \"open...\" as suggested by the given description of him about getting out his key and opening a lock.\n7. We also eliminate option B because it suggests that he was about to start something.\n8. This leaves us with A: turn lock, which is most likely the same action he would have done after getting his key.\n9. Therefore, the answer would most likely be A: turn lock.\nAnswer: A, turning a lock", "answer": "D: distress"}
{"text": ", key, open doors, pocket and solution to problem.\n5. None of these answers is as plausible since they do not make sense in this context.  It is unlikely that he would have chosen to turn the lock without the key.  It is also unlikely that he would have looked for a solution to the problem when no problem was mentioned, and no lock is mentioned.  It is also hard to imagine he would have pocketed the key that unlocks the door unless he was going to keep the key instead of attempting to open the door.\n6. When these options are analysed, and the context of the question being'ready to bike home' is considered, the action of beginning to open the lock, which is what it was he had just gotten out, makes sense as part of the context.\n7. Therefore the answer is A: turn lock.\nAnswer: A A: turn lock\n\nInput: The pine tree has adapted where? to survive. Choices: Wet. Dry. Cold. Hot. Shade.\nRationales: The given statement refers to the way the pine tree has evolved to survive in its environment.\nSo, the question asks where the pine tree has adapted to survive.\nWe can eliminate options that don't apply to where the pine tree is typically found.\nWet and hot don't apply because the pine tree grows in cold places.\nDry doesn't apply because the plant's survival means it can adapt to its conditions, not vice versa.\nShade doesn't apply since a pine tree typically grows in an open area, not shaded.\nThis leaves two options - cold and dry.\nThe other options that haven't been eliminated are a mix of cold and dry environment.\nFor example, the tundra and the desert are cold and dry environments.\nSo, it can be concluded that the pine tree has survived by adapting to a cold and dry environment. \nHence, the correct choice is \"Dry\"\n\nAnswer: Dry\n\nInput: When the teacher asked why we must be punctual, there were many responses.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. From among these choices, pocket and pocket are clearly redundant.\n6. The given choices do not reveal which problem he has solved, so we can eliminate D: pocket and E: open doors.\n7. Solution to problem makes sense to solve, but also doesn't reveal a specific problem.\n8. Therefore, the answer must be either one of B: turn lock or A: open lock.\n9. Because of the similar spelling of B: turn lock and B: turn key, it may be confusing.\n10. However, the only other choice which makes sense in this context is A: turn lock.\n11.

Since we already know that he cannot go home yet, we can eliminate choices in the direction of solving a problem or taking the bike somewhere else. So, B and E are eliminated.\n6. The other options are Turn Lock, Pocket, which suggests that he has done either of those actions. This means that he is close to going home as he probably has a key for the bike and his pocket may hold the key for his bicycle or house, although he still needs to open the lock.\n7.

Choices A: find B: work C: help D: research E: do research\nRationales:1. The question tells you that he (Jeremy) has to use the computer.\n2. Then, it goes on to tell you that there is no choice but for him to use the computer to what.\n3. Since there are lots of choices for him to do on the computer, but the given condition of 'no choice but to...' indicates that there is only one choice that he has, the correct answer will be the first choice he has.\n4. The options to do with his home (A), work or career (B), and his job or profession (C), can be done on the computer, although all of these actions might have a better chance with Jeremy searching on his phone instead of his laptop.\n5. Since the actions of the other three options can be done on his phone it is likely that they may also be done on his phone in which case there would not have been a need for him to use the laptop.\n6. The given action to use the computer indicates that he cannot use other equipment to do what he needs to do.\n7. Therefore since the actions of A, B and C can be done on other devices, the answer must be D: Research.\n\nInput: She doesn't like talking to people, though she has many friends. She does it to what?

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. A 'turn lock' is a specific action to unlock a door, while 'pocket' and'solution to problem' are unrelated actions.\n6. Also, 'open doors' would not occur until after 'turn lock'.\n7. So the choices that are directly relevant to lock the chain lock are solution to problem and open doors, however, solution to a problem may or may not occur after getting the key.\n8. 'open doors' happens in a later time period, so it cannot be the action of doing the question.\n9. Therefore, the answer can only be either 'pocket', the action of putting something into a pocket, or 'open doors', the action of unlocking the door.\n10. Out of the given options, 'open doors' is a more probable action, and the given answer options, it fits the best in the context.\n11.

Out of the other given options, 'pocket' and 'open doors' require actions that are usually completed after one has already reached his/her destination, however; the person is ready for that, considering the fact that he has been getting his key. \n7. So, the only option that is logical is B: 'pocket'.\nAnswer: A: turn lock\n\nInput: The woman was very well mannered, she didn't speak to the what? Choices: A: young B: male C: older D: stranger E: old man\nRationales: First, look at the given statement which tells us that the woman was very well mannere.\n2. This suggests that she spoke politely and appropriately, without any offensive comments.\n3. Then look at the other given options: 'young','male', 'older','stranger', and 'old man'.\n4. Considering that the statement implies that the woman spoke politely, the word'stranger' should be excluded, as this option suggests that the woman was speaking to someone she doesn't know - which isn't necessarily an offensive comment.\n5. Next, consider young, male and older. \n6. They relate to the age and gender of the woman.\n7. Since we've already ruled out stranger, we can safely eliminate young, male and older since these don't fit the age or gender criteria.\n8. So the options left are young and older, both of which refer to age only.\n9. Now consider the question statement: the woman behaved well manners, she didn't \"speak to a stranger.\"\n10. Thus, since stranger implies that she spoke to someone who she does not know, this would be an offensive comment. \n11. As the question part only asks for a noun which would be an offensive statement, the answer only includes 'young man and 'an old man'.

Of the given choices, turning the lock is a possible solution to the problem of unlocking the door, however, it does not fit in this context as it would only be needed if he had trouble unlocking.\n6. Therefore pocket option seems logical as it is a general action and indicates that he put the key into his pocket, it does not necessarily imply anything else, such as turning the lock.\n7. Moreover, the \"however\" in option C, that is, \"however, bike lock is not very difficult to turn\", adds more confusion as it might suggest an alternative solution to the problem.\n8. Thus, the answer cannot logically be A: turn lock, since the given context does not support it, because it is not easy to unlock bike lock or it's not an alternative solution to the given problem.\n9. Furthermore, neither of other options, B: pocket, C: pocket, D: pocket, E: open doors describe the action of putting key into a pocket.\n10. Moreover, none of the other options fit in the given context of \"He was ready to bike.\"\n11.

Pocket is more specifically called for when the given character \"gets\" some kind of object out of it, which is not in this case as getting out a key is the task he is doing.\n7. So, the most plausible answer is B: pocket because he got out his key. \n8. \"Begin\" is used earlier in the sentence to refer to the action of getting out the key.

However, the sentence doesn't explicitly confirm that Liz was thinking about anything besides her future. \n3. There could be any number of possibilities.\n4. Since 'future' is not stated in the choices, we can eliminate all options other than the given ones.\n5. Therefore all the remaining options are feasible.\n6. However, when looking into all the options, considerate seems the most unlikely choice as it is too neutral.  Optimistic and thoughtful could both be plausible options. \n7.

Choices:  C: trying D: making E: asking help F: working H: succeeding\nRationales: The given options suggest that the man had just worked hard to earn money and now he wanted more since it wasn't enough, however, the next sentence states that he is determined to keep on what's he is doing, which is working for money.\nTherefore \"working\" must be the best answer.\nThe sentence does not indicate that he was failing or working less or less efficiently.\n\nAnswer: C: trying\n\nInput: She went to a store and bought what she needed and a few extras that he liked.  She asked him to buy something, it was something he needed so he bought it.  He left before she asked him again.  Do you think he went back to the store? Choices: Yes A: No B: He is a fool C: He already had it D: It was the same price E: It was the same kind\nRationales:\nThe man left before she had the chance to ask him again, if he had been the type of person to always go back and get what he needed, he would have been curious to see what she was asking for, so he probably would have gone back and bought what she needed.\n\nAnswer: B: He is a FOOL\n\nInput: You can have all that the sun gives.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, open doors, which only A, B & C seem applicable.\n5. A and B seem similar, since bike lock cannot be \"opened with a finger\", it means they can't be turned 'with' a key, but rather, using the key to open the lock. \n6. Therefore, he will use the key on the lock to open the bike, which is B: pocket. \n7. The given options D: solution to the problem and E: open doors are general, vague and not applicable to this situation, and thus can be eliminated.\n8. Finally, the answer is B.\nAnswer: B : pocket\n\nInput: She was sad, so she did what? Choices: A: cried B: played C: cheered D: sung E: called\nRationales: The question mentions that the girl was sad.\n1. In response to this sadness, it indicates that she does something, which in this case, is cry. \n2. Crying is a general term that does not directly indicate the cause of the sadness, and can be associated with any emotion.\n3. Crying is further described as a behavior that often indicates a mental state. It is a general word that can refer to any form of cry.\n4. Similarly, calling, which refers to the action of phone calls and talking on the telephone.\n5. Talking over the telephone can show any number of emotions, however it is a general form of communication that is not dependent on specific feelings or sadness.\n6. If that were the case, the specific word 'crying' would be used. In fact, the use of the word 'calling' implies that the girl cried on the phone.\n7. The remaining options, playing and singing, imply entertainment as the mode of response. In fact, playing has some element of distraction to it, as described by the definition of the term.\n8. Singing on the other hand is another form of entertainment, and does not explicitly include sadness as a cause. \n9. Therefore, calling, crying is a more plausible option to complete the question.\n10. Crying refers to the sadness, and 'calling' refers to phone calls as a mode of sad expression. \n11. Hence, the answer to the question", "answer": "C: friend's house"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to a problem, open doors, and pocket.\n5. Out of the given options, 'turn lock' makes little sense as the statement explicitly states that he was ready to leave.\n6. If he had to turn the lock, then the statement that he is ready to leave indicates that he hasn't turned the lock before leaving.\n7. This, in addition to the statement that he got his key, which normally indicates he is ready to open the lock, indicates that we can disregard 'turn lock'.\n8. 'Pocket' should not be considered because it suggests the action of putting the key in your pocket, which is an indirect action of unlocking the lock. So, the given options left are 'pocket' and 'pocket'.\n9. The given options only imply the two actions of 'opening a lock' and 'putting the key in your pocket' respectively.\n10. However, these options are not specific to the only reasonable action for a person who is ready to leave and has their key handy, which is to get the key out of their pocket and open the door. \n11. So, we can conclude that the only reasonable action for the given scenario is 'open doors'.\n12. Therefore, the answer to the question is D: open doors.\nAnswer: D open doors\n\nNote that in the above sentence that the statement told us that he was ready, and we inferred that he had opened the door.\n\nInput: What is a word that might describe a man who works with metal? Choices: 0: carpenter B: mechanic C: welder D: tool maker E: craftsman\nRationales:  1. This question contains a grammatical error that does not reflect the correct meaning of the sentence.\n2. The sentence indicates the person who works with metal, and it should read: 'what might be a word that describes a person who works with (whatever the noun in the sentence is)' rather than 'what word might describe'.\n3. In other words, we should identify the noun that describes the person who works with metals, rather than a word that describes the person.\n4. Starting over, the given sentences indicate that 'a word that might describe' a man who works with'metal'.\n5.

We can eliminate turn lock because this suggests the action of turning the key, which could also refer to the action of turning the lock.\n6. Similarly, we can eliminate pocket as this suggests the action of putting something into the pocket, which does not directly suggest opening the lock.\n7. The choices solution to problem and open doors only indirectly suggest the action of opening the lock.\n8. Therefore, out of the given choices, only pocket suggests the action of putting the key in the pocket but we can eliminate this too as the question states that he started to open the lock.\n9.

B: The food. C: The venue. D: The noise. E: The music.\nRationales:\n1. The police suspect one of these guests. \n2. So they must be concerned about what exactly has the potential to be at the root of the problem/\n3. We can eliminate options A: The guest list and C: The venue, since the police are not concerned about a list of guests, nor with the location of the party.\n4. Eliminate option D: The noise, since there must be a root cause for the police's concerns.\n5. The remaining options are: The music and The food. \n6. The music likely causes problems for most parties, but, in this case, is likely not the problem. The police have concerns about the partygoers, so the option E: the music must be eliminated. \n7. This leaves option B The food as valid. \n8. The police suspect one partygoer, so they must be concerned about the food (or guests) which they believe are the source of the problem.\n9.

Among these choices, 'turn lock' could mean operating a locking device by any means, but this does not necessarily imply directly turning a key.\n6. 'Opening doors' and'solution to problem' are too generic to be used here, as the question is specifically asking us about biking home and using a key to unlock a lock. \n7. 'Pocket' can be used because the statement specifically references a pocket.\n8.

Turn lock is not related to the opening or closing of a lock. Solution to problem can suggest an alternate way of doing something, but it is not specific to the opening of a key. There is no indication that a problem has occurred or that there is a need for a solution. \n7. Pocket could refer to the pocket in which the key was kept, or a pocket where other things are kept, but not necessarily the pocket that holds the key.\n8.

C. see if they fit put them on and if yes tie them to your feet D. buy them E. pull them up and go\nRationales 1.The question starts by asking you to consider shoes and all the different ways in which you can determine how well they fit. \n2. Considering these many ways, eliminate A. tie them to you feet. from the options. Tying shoes will not exactly tell you the fit. 3.

The best answer is - buy them, as it is almost certain that if you want to buy shoes you will want to make sure that they fit you correctly. \n7. Also, with the remaining answers, if you already know that they are fitting properly you would not have to pull them up to verify, thus D. buy them is the only possible answer.\nAnswer: D.

Choices :  A: crime scene B: suspects evidence C: investigation D: suspect E: crime suspect\nRationales: The question offers a description of a detective (A: good) who is noticing something is missing.\n1. The detective (A:good) is noticing something is  missing - this could be anything including clues, details, evidence that are relevant to the investigation. Or, it could be the detective him/herself.\n2. The phrase \"from what?\" implies that the detective is noticing something is'missing' at a crime scene.\n3. Outer of the given answers:  A, B, C, D, and E, only A is a description relating to a crime scene, as B, C, D and E are about something or someone related to the investigation.\n4.

Since he is looking to work from home, it is not likely to be an office job. Therefore, we can eliminate the options involving an office from our choices, leaving: job, career, someone, and something.\n\nOut of these options, the correct one is likely to be someone or something. These options represent people or things relevant to the job itself which he is looking to work with or on.\n\nThe sentence offers us no additional details regarding the job, which explains why it makes no sense to answer in terms of office, work, or place.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.

Since A: turning lock is an action that indicates a person is almost ready to cycle somewhere, we can say they are both ready to cycle somewhere and they are almost done.

This leaves us with the choice - open doors, which can be interpreted as unlocking a door or multiple doors.\n8. Since the door may refer to where he lives or to the door of a store he passed by as he went out of the school, the door may not necessarily be where he lives.\n9. Hence, it is logical to eliminate the option - E: open doors.\n10. This leaves us with A: turn lock.\n11. As he's ready to bike home and he already has got his key out from his pocket, the best action which implies that he is almost about to leave his house is - turn the lock. \n12.

The statement does not offer much information about the motivations for why they continued to hire sales associates.\n2. However, the given statements contain information about the company and its business, noting that the primary reasons for hiring many sales associates is due to growth in revenue and decrease in quality.\n3. This indicates that the company will continue hiring more sales associates to better serve their customers and increase their earnings.\n4. Therefore, the phrase \"this was due to the fact\" suggests that the company's primary motivating factors for hiring more sales associatives is growth in revenue and quality.\n5. According to the given answers' explanations, we can see that it is most likely C: Increased demand is the correct answer.\nAnswer: C\n\nInput: You want your computer to know you're leaving.

Out of those, only pocket and opening doors relate to the activity of opening a door lock, therefore they are excluded as incorrect answers.\n7. The word 'open' in the question is repeated, creating a connection between opening a bike lock and opening a door lock. Thus 'open doors' could be the correct choice. However, there is a word which is repeated in this choice that we can exclude.\n8. Furthermore, this choice is an action which implies one step. However, one step is usually an activity which is done while bike riding, not when you reach a destination.\n9.

Since the sentence also mentions the word pig, it can be safely assumed that the girl has an Asian ethnic appearance and dark eyes, i.e. the girl might likely be Chinese.\n3. The sentence talks about her looking cute, and selling fish. So, it can be inferred that the girl is likely to work in a fish market.\n4.

Choices:  standing A: speaking B: practicing C: rehearsing D: introducing speaker E: practicing speech\nRationales:  1.The given information is that A) We have a person, B) They are standing at a podium, and C) They are making a speech.\n2. It is not specified where they're making the speech; it could be for a school activity or even a job interview at a company.\n3. All of the options given (A, B, C, D and E) have to do with what is usually considered \"preparation\" for a speech, except for Option A. \n4. Options A is already an implied answer to the question, as they are standing but not speaking. Also, we can eliminate this from the choices as it is unnecessary details and can be assumed. Also, A already implies that the person is about to give the actual speech.\n5. Options B, C, and D are all acts of \"preparation\" that could precede a speech, such as practice, practicing, or rehearsing.\n6. Option E is the most inclusive option given, as it encompasses all options already given, plus the act of \"introducing the speaker\" after the speech.\n7. Hence the answer is E: Practicing Speech.\nAnswer: E - Practicing Speech", "answer": "A: under rocks"}

So, among options only B: turn lock and E: open doors could possibly fit the context because both involve the action of opening some sort of door.\n6. Pocket and to solve a problem are not directly associated with opening a door.\n7. Therefore the given statement and the context suggest that he turned the key and opened the door. \n8. Hence, the answer choice is B: turn lock.\nAnswer: B; turn lock\n\nInput: She is a quiet, respectful person; as a result, if you  asked her to what, she would readily agree. Choices:  A; sing B; dance C; do a cheer D; dance B; read in front of an audience  E; teach in front of an audience\nRationales:\n1. She is a respectful person; this means she knows how far is too far.\n2. If a person knows their limitations, they will hesitate to volunteer for something that is over their head.\n3. Therefore, she would not volunteer to teach in front of an audiences.\n4. In this context, the options that make the most sense are B: dance and D: dance.\n5. Since she is respectful person, she would not teach in front of an crowd if she was not confident in her skills.\n6. So if she agreed to teach in front of a crowd she would be confident and comfortable being in front of a multitude of people.\n7. She is quiet, but she is willing to talk as long as the situation is right for her.\n8. Also, being out in the public and being the center of attention is not unusual for her.\n9. So singing and dancing, both public performances, would be a good fit for her.\n10. She most likely would volunteer for the first option, dance.\n11. It is the more comfortable with public speaking and singing is a more delicate art.\n12. Dance is a well-rehearsed and polished art.\n13. Therefore the answer is A: dance.\nAnswer: A; dance\n\nInput: She's not like them, they think she is a freak.  And she thinks they have what?

Out of these options, we should eliminate turn lock and open doors because they do not really make sense here, specifically: - it is more likely that he got out his key before turning the lock, so we should choose A or D.\n6. Solution to problem and pocket are unlikely choices as the question is about the action of opening a door, and not the action of solving a problem or putting something in his pocket.\n7. This leaves us with A: turn lock and D: solve the problem.\n8. Thus, the answer should be D solution to problem.\nAnswer: D solution to problem\n\nInput: Every company, large or small, can profit from the internet. What sort of profits can a company what? Choices: increase A B C D E\nRationales: I: First, we note from the question that every company can benefit from the internet.\nII: The word 'can' is an indicative verb and is used when talking about potential. In other words, every company has the prospect of profiting from the internet.\nIII: Next, we analyze the following phrase: 'large or small,..' which suggests that no matter the size of the company, it will be able to profit from the internet.\nIV: Using the information above, we can conclude that the given phrase could imply that the company will profit 'heavily' or 'to a large degree'.\nV: From the options, we eliminate C.\nVI: We also exclude E because it is too generic to be the answer.\nVII: B and D are vague answers. Only A offers a specific definition, so the answer to the question is A: increase.\nAnswer: A increase", "answer": "B: respond"}

Was that accountant a what? Choices:A: liar B: moron C: thief D: genius E: idiot\nRationales:\n1. We know from the question that the accountant forgot to \"track\" travel expenses in the accounting system, which led to only claiming her \"expenses,\" implying that travel expenses were actually paid for.\n2. Given that the question asks us to determine if the accountant was a \"genius\" or not, we have to find a possible plausible reason for her to claim the expenses and forget to track the travel expense reimbursement.\n3. We can be certain that the accountant is not a \"liar\" because she only claimed expenses paid for by the company, which was an expected requirement of the expense reports. \n4. Similarly, we can be certain that she is not a \"moron\" because she successfully passed the accounting system training program to be considered an accountant. \n5. It is impossible to know whether she was a \"thief\" because we do not know whether her action was intentional or not.\n6. Since she only claimed the expenses paid for, we could say she was \"smart\". \n7. However, we do not know whether she was actually aware that she had received this reimbursement already before making this reimbursement request or a separate reimbursement request.\n8. Therefore, we can be certain she is neither a \"liar\" nor a \"moron\", because she cannot be accused of lying or being a moron when she", "answer": "D: connecticut"}

So, the answer to the question is B: turn lock\nAnswer: B: turn lock\n\nInput:  It's possible to eat a large piece of pie and still have room left over for an apple dessert,  What does it say about a large piece of pie? Choices: 1. It's very delicious A: 2. It's not as unhealthy as other food B: C. It's too much to eat D:  It's less satisfying than other dessert item E: It's very filling\nRationales:  1.The given statement says that eating a large piece of pie is possible to still have room left over.\n2. This provides us with information about the large piece of pie, not about an apple dessert.\n3. We can understand the purpose of the question, which is to find the best way to describe the large piece of pie.\n4. The choices are arranged in chronological order from most descriptive to least descriptive.\n5. Choices A: It's very delcious and C: It's too much are both considered to make the apple dish less satisfying so both can be eliminated.\n6. E: It's  very filling, which means there is a large quantity of food that can be digested by the body due to the size of the piece or number of food components. \n7. This does not describe the larger piece of pie since it could still leave over room for the apple dish.\n8. Therefore, the answer that can best complete the question is B: It's not as as unhealthy, since it is the most descriptive option according to the chronological order.\n9. The other options are A: It's too delicious, E: It's filling and D :It's less satisfying.\nAnswer: B :It's not as as unhhealthy\n\n```\n\n\nInput: I thought the new house was going to be really cool, but the decorating was", "answer": "D: being bored"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, and open doors.\n5. Given that the question asks about a solution to a problem, we can assume that the choice 'pocket' can be disregarded. \n6. So, we are left with A: turn lock, B: pocket, C: solution to problem, D: open doors.\n7. To distinguish between'solution to problem' and 'open doors', we need to break down the problem at hand. Is he trying to solve an issue of his bicycle or something unrelated? \n8. As he only has one key, it is unlikely that he is trying to fix something regarding his bicycle.\n9. If he's trying to solve something unrelated to his bicycle, then the choice of'solution to problem, C: solution to solve problem, D: open door, which are still plausible answers that a person would perform when approaching his/her home, \n10. is the answer. \n11. He will either turn his key, open doors, or give someone the solution to a problem.\n12. However, the choice of B, 'pocket' does not directly address either of the given options.\n13. 'Open door' and'solution to problem C: solution to problem' are both very possible outcomes regarding the person's next action after turning the key. \n14. Since C: solution to problem is vague, let's focus on whether B: pocket and D: open doors present themselves as viable answers.\n15. 'Pocket' is usually a response action when a person has retrieved his key to use it.\n16. Since the person in this situation already has his key out, the action of pocketing can't be the answer. \nThe remaining answer choices are A: turn the key, B: pocket, and D: open the doors.\n17. 'Turn the key' is the response choice that will address whether the door is locked or not.\n18. As long as the door is still closed, the key will be still in the keyhole, and we will know that the lock hasn't been turned. \n19.

There is no indication that He would keep a solution to his problem inside his pocket, so the choices C: solution to problem and option E: open doors should be eliminated.\n7. He isn't leaving the home, he's leaving to bike, so we can eliminate option A: turn lock.\n8. Out of the two remaining options, we can eliminate option D: pocket, because we already know his keys, which is what is inside his pockets.\n9.

However, to avoid this ambiguity, and to avoid the possibility of guessing, we will assume 'pocket' to mean'sit in', and eliminate it from the given options.\n8.

Choices :  A: the future B: the present C: a different time D: the past E: somewhere\nRationales: The answer is to be deduced. The question is asking: \n1. is she a special, unique person from somewhere?\n2. We know that she is special and unique. \n3. So she must be from somewhere.\n4. To answer where, we need more information about this special, unique person, this would be her characteristics. However, we can deduct she is from the present as this information is not available in the given context.\n5. The question is in the present, therefore: the answer is : A: from the future\n\nInput: John has great interest and talent in playing the guitar. Where is he from? Choices : \n1.

The word 'problem' in \"solution to problem\" does not directly relate to a lock or a door and it is more generic.\n7. So, out of the given choices, it is logical to eliminate 'open doors' and 'open lock'.\n8. Then it is safe to conclude that 'open doors' and the solution to a problem are unlikely options for the rest of the question.\n9.

Choices: A: traveling B: crafts C: shopping D: eating E: knitting\nRationales:1. The question includes two statements. The first one tells us that the woman has a large collection antiques.\n2. The second statement tells us the second trait or interest of the woman, which is that she enjoys knitting.\n3. From the options, C: shopping is not specific to the interest of knitting, and D: eating is not about possessing a large collection of antiquities.\n4. The only option left is A: traveling.\n5. This is most likely because the woman may use traveling, like a vacation, as an opportunity to visit and purchase antiques that are interesting to her.\n6. So the correct answer is A: traveling\n7.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pockets, and open doors. \n5. We eliminate A: turn lock and B: pocket. \n6. Turning a lock or putting a key in a pocket might still mean we haven't opened the door yet, so they are not the correct choices.\n7. Likewise, the term'solution to problem' does not refer to opening a lock.\n8. Therefore, of the remaining choices, 'open doors' would be the most appropriate to use in a context related to unlocking something.\n9. Moreover, 'pocket' and 'pockets' could still mean opening a lock in some cases, so we eliminate these choices as well.\n10. Lastly, since he got out his key in this scenario, the key must be already in his pocket, so 'pocket' is also a redundant choice.\n11. So, now, we are left with E: open doors.\n12.

Choices:    A: rest B: sleeping C: bedrest D: lay E: restroom\nRationales:\n1. The question asks us what a good night's rest is followed by the example, \"sleep\".\n2. This is a common phrase that describes a good amount of sleep, where one is in a deep, refreshing, and restful sleep.\n3. This implies a lack of the phrase's opposite, \"rough night's sleep\".\n4. From the given choices, we can eliminate A: rest, B: sleeping, C: bedrest because when one has a restful sleep, one tends to wake up feeling rested and refreshed.\n5. The given condition tells us that the person had a good, a restful sleep, so it makes sense to eliminate those options.\n6. Likewise, the other options we have left, D: lay and E: restroom, can mean a state of either rest or sleep, so we also consider those as inappropriate.\n7.

First, let's eliminate 'A: is that a bicyle or a', and 'C: is this a bicyle, I sure have a bunch of questions', as 'a' here should be a noun, and 'bunch of' should be 'a lot of'. These options aren't grammatically correct.\n5.

This further implies that he has to solve a problem first or has an issue that he has to remove before opening the lock.\n7. This means that the least likely choice among the choices specified is the answer.\n8. Hence, the most plausible answer is: A: turn lock.\n9. The option A: turn lock is also a likely solution to opening a particular type of lock as it implies turning it with the key.\n10. So, it fits the best within the context of the question being asked.\n11. Hence, the answer A: turn lock or the solution to opening the lock has to turn the key is the correct answer in context.\nAnswer: A, turn lock or the solution\n\nInput: The old man is getting ready for the evening, he washes himself, then what? Choices: A: shave B: dress C: read D: eat E: watch TV\nRationales:1. The given statement offers information about the old man, his daily routine and his next activity.\n2. He does what every regular person does before going to bed at night such as: \"wash himself\".\n3. Then, he has to prepare to do what next? \n4. He selects an activity according to his will, as he has a choice between: \"shave\", \"dress\", \"read\", \"eat\" or \"watch TV\".\n5. A: shave B : dress C : read D : eat E : watch TV\n6. All of the given options fall within the scope of the statement and the actions indicated.\n7. Among the given options, the one that does not logically follow the statement is: D: Eat since washing himself usually follows before eating.\n8. C: read indicates the next activity in context.\n9.

Solution to problem is ruled out because the key can't be a solution to the problem if that is not the action being done with it.\n7. We also eliminate open doors because he has already bike home.\n8. Pocket is eliminated because there is not enough information on why he got his solution to the problem out of his pocket.\n9. Therefore, the correct answer is C: open doors.\nAnswer: C, open doors\n\nInput: The dog was chasing its tail and it looked like what? Choices: A: a dog on a long leash B: a dog on a very short leash C: a dog with no leash at  all D: a dog with no tail E: a dog with a broken neck\nRationales:1. The text reads, \"The dog was chasing its own tail.\"\n2. This suggests that the dog was behaving in an erratic and repetitive manner.\n3. The given choices refer to dogs wearing different kinds of leashes. While each of these choices may seem like appropriate options for the dog to be behaving erratically and repetitively, no other information suggests that the dog is wearing such a leash. \n4. So, it is more plausible that the dog is behaving erratically because it has no leash.\n5. \"a dog with no leash\" is the only choice that could describe the dog in this context.\n6. The answers B and D provide leash information, but neither explains the plausibility of the dog's behavior. The given explanation of the dog's erratic behavior is due to lack of a leash, not a lengthy or short leash.\n7. Therefore the correct answer is E: a dog with no  tail.\nAnswer: E, a dog with no tail\n\nInput: He has to choose between a dog or a cat; he can choose either. Choices: A dog or a cat.

Choices: A: you like biking B: the people are C: your friends are D: you are E: your house is\nRationales: The question first asks us to guess the nature of this \"place in how\" referred to in the statement. We look over the given choices, starting with A: liking biking, then B: people, C: friends, D: house, and E: self. A: liking bikiing - bike paths are good places for biking. B: people - many people enjoy these paths, and C: houses in the area - we can't see everything when we look at someone's house. D: friends can do the same, and E: me - I can't see myself from the ground floor of my house, but if we could see ourselves by a bike path, perhaps we could see them too. We can't eliminate any of the choices; each offers some possibility, but nothing rules out all the others.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, and open doors. \n5. Looking at choices B and D, turn lock and pocket suggest specific actions. But as we do not know what those specific actions are, these may be eliminated.\n6. Solution to problem appears to be a plausible option.  We can eliminate it since the question is not asking what the solution to bike home is, but what the action of opening the lock with the key was in relation to bike home. \n7. Looking at the remaining choices, open doors is a word that is more generic, meaning \"to enter\" or \"to gain entry through\". In addition, it cannot be the only thing the person did when he got his key because the question states he began to open the lock with his key.\n8. Therefore, the answer appears to be A: turn lock instead of B: pocket or D: pocket.\n9. Turn lock means that he got his key out and began to open the lock.\n10. Answer: A: turn lock\n\n### Instructions:\nInput: In a way, it works a lot like a biological memory,  You put all this stuff into your long term memory.  Then you pull it out, when?Choices:  A: when requested B: when appropriate C: for some reason D: whenever needed E: when necessary\nRationales:1. The question asks in 'a way', it works a lot like biological memory.\n2. This tells us that long term memory is somehow related to biological memory.\n3. We understand in 2 that long term memory relates to keeping memories somewhere for later use.\n4. Therefore, in long term memory, you put information somewhere so that you can pull it out 'when you need it'.\n5. According to the given choices, A: put stuff in, 'when requested'  can be eliminated as it does not directly relate to the original statement.\n6. So can B: do what is appropriate, although this is a reasonable option to explain later use of info, it does not describe the putting and pulling of long term memories.\n7. C: Do something for some unknown reason is similarly vague and can be eliminated.\n8. E: Do something when needed is a plausible option as this indicates the need to pull info from long term memory when needed.\n9. So,", "answer": "D: school grade"}

{"text": ", pocket solution to problem, pocket, and open doors.\n5. There is no mention of any solutions or keys in the question, so pockets are disregarded as a possible answer and the other choices are likely to be incorrect.\n6. Turn lock is redundant; if the question were to simply say he got out the key, then turn lock doesn't matter.\n7. Solution to problem is not a proper terminology and is not a typical action to take in order to open a door.\n8. So the only choice that remains is pocket which refers to the action of placing something into the pocket or carrying it around one's body.\n9. Therefore, he was ready to bikey home and began to pocket the key.\n10. The answer is C: pocket key.\nAnswer: C. Pocket key\n\nInput: The man was excited about his upcoming trip.  He had never been on his own before, but after what? Choices: A: a lot of sleep B: traveling C: eating D: reading E: thinking\nRationales: Start by analyzing the sentence: \"He had never been on his one before, but after...\"\nThe first part tells us that he had never been alone before. However, this means he was on his own previously as well. (If you are on your own, then you have been alone before, and this has likely happened many times. Hence, he would not be in his first time being alone).\nTherefore, there must be a time when he was not alone, but after which he was. This must be the phrase after which the man would not be on his own before. \nThe sentence continues to say that he was excited about his up coming trip. This means he was looking forward to his trip.\nSo what caused his trip to become more exciting? What changed for him?\nThis change must be specific, as it is not a general feeling of being excited.\nSo what did he do after being on his own for a while?\n\nWell, traveling is a common action for people to take on holidays. So, he is likely to have had a travel experience, after which he was never on his own before.\nSo, when did he travel?  It had to be after he had been able to be on his own before, so it had to be after he stopped being on his own before. He must have", "answer": "B: hospital"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to a problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. A key turns a lock.\n6. Therefore the given response doesn't imply using the key or the lock. It is also possible that the choice B: pocket could be used but the question asks what the key is used for, which does not include A: turn lock B.\n7. For this reason, any of the other options don't completely make sense either. We rule these out along with C: solution to problem because that would require knowing the solution to the problem beforehand, instead of after opening the lock.\n8. The given options could either be re-worded or simplified, thus there is no clear choice that is the most obvious response.\n9. The question also seems to not be related at all to the lock, so there is clearly some context lost between the given facts.\n10. Out of all the remaining options, 'open doors' is the only plausible response as to what a key is used for, after it has been out.\n11. Therefore, the answer to this question is E: open doors.\nAnswer: E-open doors\n\nInput: What is the difference between a person who is careful and a person who is cautious? Choices:  An: Person who is cautious is careful  B: A person who is careful is cautious C: Person who is careful is cau D: Person who is cau is careful\nRationales: The question asks for the difference between a person with two traits, namely a careful person and a cautious person.\n1. The given options are a definition for each trait.\n2. The definition does not provide the difference between the two terms.\n3. The difference is not defined, so the answer cannot be drawn from the definition itself.\n4. So, we must look at the options as a whole and decide which is the more logical answer to the given question.\n5. Option B: A person who \"is careful\" is \"cautious\".\n6. This does not seem to be the right answer as careful does not necessarily imply cautious.\n7. Option C: is defined as: \"Person who \"is cau\" is \"careful\" does not make sense and cannot be the answer due to lack of logic in the sentence structure.\n8. Option D: \"Person who \"cautious", "answer": "C: happiness"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to a problem.\n5. The choices C: pocket and D: pocket E: pocket indicate that he put it in his pocket, but pocket does not necessarily imply opening a lock. 4. The solutions to certain problems usually require a certain action. For example, finding a solution to a problem at school might entail a paper, writing an email, or completing other tasks.\n6. Therefore we exclude the latter two options as they do not imply a direct correlation to the problem of opening a lock.\n7. The choice remaining: B: turn lock, describes unlocking a door or a lock.\n8. So the answer is B: turn lock\nAnswer: B: turn lock\n\nInput: His roommate is a very good musician, however, he has decided to not to what? Choices;A: become famous B: pursue music C: audition for orchestra D: play trombone E: join band\nRationales:1.The question tells us that his roommate is a good musician, however he decided not to pursue music. \n2. Since the question does not make any specific descriptions regarding the quality of the musician, we can assume that the person is talented and good at what they do. \n3.The reason that this person does not pursuit music is due to his decision not to do so.\n4.When studying the sentence in the question, the option which provides this information is D: 'has decided to not'. As a result we can eliminate remaining choices such as A: 'become famous' because the person would not have decided not to pursue a musical career due to not wanting to gain fame. \n5.We also exclude C:'audition for orchestra' and E:'join band', as these options provide no direct information on why the person does not pursue music. 6. Since the only question left is from the list is 'play trombone', this option indicates that the musician decided not to play an instrument, in this case the trombone. \n7. Therefore the answer is D: plays trombone\nAnswer: D: plays trombone", "answer": "D: city block"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, and open doors, but only the last one deals with the action of unlocking. \n5.

Choices: A: trail running, B: river swimming, C: mountain biking, D: rock climbing E: ice climbing, F: climbing\nRationales:1. The question asks us to find the choice that completes the sentence: I enjoy hikikng and doing.. \n2. We start by eliminating A: trail running and B: river swimming because they are not an appropriate activity related to hiking, which is walking or climbing uphill in rough terrain and is associated with the activity of hiking.\n3. We also eliminate D: rock climbing, E: ice climbing and F: climbing because they refer to the act of climbing a rock wall or mountain, in this instance the question does not indicate that they are a part of hiking. \n4. Since we know that the activity that we are given is hiking, \"mountain biking\" is not appropriate as it refers to a different activity.\n5. \"Mountain biking\" involves traveling on technical downhills, rocky and mountainous terrain using a special type of bike.\n6. Furthermore, the choices from A to C do not directly link to mountain climbing except for mountain biking by A: trail running.\n7. This means that C: mountain bikings best completes the sentence. \n8. The sentence would be: \"I enjoy hiking and mountain biking\" and C: mountain bikikg is an activity associated with hiking, as it involves the act of traveling on difficult terrain and rocky or mountainous terrain using a mountain or off-road style of bike.\n9.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, and open doors.\n5. The first two choices, turn lock and pocket, contradict the main message of the question or the statement.\n6. Therefore the key being taken out of the pocket, is not necessarily the action of turning a lock.\n7. Moreover, pocket does not mean a solution to a specific problem.\n8. Hence, the given choices eliminate these two choices, leaving us with the answer, 'open doors'.\n9. From the way the question is set up, there is almost no doubt that he intended to open a door before bicycling home.\n10.

As 'pocket' and'solution to problem' do not address the action of unlocking, \n6. we should use  'turn lock' and 'open doors' to see which solution fits into the context of the story or scenario better.\n7. Turning a lock suggests a deliberate action, while opening doors may just mean that he took the key out.\n8. So, out of the two we can eliminate 'turn key' as the answer, leaving us with 'open doors'.\n9. Therefore, his action was: opening doors.\nAnswer: E\n\nInput: His wife did not like him being a smoker, so he what?  Choices:  A1: put her on the back burner B: made her his priority C: stopped taking care of her D: did not take care of her enough E: took her off the back burner\nRationales: Let's first understand what the 'back burner' means here. The term is a metaphor that is often used to describe an activity that is less important than others. It implies that whatever is considered to be on the backburner is not being actively pursued and is instead being neglected for a more important activity.\n1. Let us then understand the different options and the choices that come to mind after that:\n2. He may not take C: stops taking care of her, as  it is not natural to put someone on the back burner while they themselves are already on the back burner.\n3. He may not take D: did not take enough care of her, as it makes him look rather selfish.\n4. He may not put her on A1: puts her on the back burners, as it will not be a good thing that he does.\n5. He could put her on B: makes her his priority, but he would also have to do A2: put her on the front burner.\n6. Therefore the answer is E: takes her off the back burn.\nAnswer: E, Takes them off the back burner", "answer": "E: learning about"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, open doors, and pocket.\n5. Out of all given choices, we can eliminate turning a lock since it would mean he had to bike the entire way back and open a lock on the way. \n6. Out of the remaining choices, we can eliminate solution to problem since it could be understood as a metaphor and opening doors since he should already have the door opened. \n7. This leaves us with pocket. This would likely relate to putting the key in his pocket or taking it out of his pocket and holding it.\n8. Therefore, the answer choice is D: pocket.\nAnswer: D. pocket\n\nInput: Which two of the following could best represent the problem faced in this issue? Choices: 1) A: not taking care of old people 2) B: poor treatment of workers 3) C: lack of help for the sick 4) D: not following laws\nRationales: Note: There were two options that are inadvertently in reverse order. The order the option should be in is, option 2 should come before and option 1 should come after option 3, and option 3 should come before option 4. The question had only two choices, option 2 and option 5. Option 2 and option 3 are interchangeable for the purposes of this question. This was not an issue for our solution, so we will continue with the options as they are. \n1. Incorrect. Option 2 is a solution and can not be a problem itself 2. Incorrect. Option A does not address a specific ethical issue that was mentioned in the text of the sentence. It does not address an injustice that was committed. Option A could be seen as a type of issue a worker may face but there is not explicit problem mentioned. 3. Incorrect. The option does not specify which type of help it is referring to which is what needs clarification in the sentence. 4. Incorrect. The order of the words in this sentence can be interpreted in multiple ways. There is no mention of any law being broken or followed. 5. Incorrect. The same concept from option 4.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, open doors, and pocket.\n5. 'turn lock' and'solution to problem' are logical, as a lock needs to be turned, but the question does not mention the solving of a problem. \n6. Therefore, the person would be more likely to 'open doors' rather than 'use solution to problem', because of the lack of a problem.  This leaves us with A: turn lock, B: pocket and C: open doors as our final choices.\n7. 'Opening doors' does not necessarily suggest pocketing keys, even if this is the most likely action to be observed by someone who is leaving the house, and 'pocket' does not necessarily apply to the whole 'biking home' part of the question. \n8. So, it is possible that the person is simply opening doors and leaving their keys on a shelf or table, and we know this because of the given statements about his keys: \"pocketed his key, begin to turn...\"\n9. Therefore, we can conclude that we should eliminate options A: turn lock and option C: open doors because these options do not specifically point to the fact of pocketing keys. \n10. We can also eliminate option E: pocket, as the statement also mentions that the person is putting his key on the table, indicating openness to action, and we know that the statement is true, because the person is able to \"begin to turn...\", indicating they are able to reach the key before they leave.\n11. The choices left are: \"B: pocket\" and \"A: turn lock\", both of which are feasible actions for him to take before leaving the house. \n12. However, the only way to turn a \"lock\" could refer to turning a door latch, which is the action of turning a key in order to open a door, which is more feasible than simply putting the key in his pocket, as we are specifically told it is \"pocketed his keys and begin to turn\", and the fact that in order to be able to turn the door latch, he must have the key in his possession. \n13. Hence, the answer would be A: turn lock.\nAnswer: A : turn lock\n\nInput: It is important to think before you what? Choices: A: drink B: smoke C: eat D: talk E: do dru", "answer": "B: music shop"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, and open doors.\n5. Turning a lock or putting a key in a pocket does not necessarily mean he is ready to bike home; therefore 'pocket' and'solution' are eliminated from the option list.\n6. This means the choices left are: turn lock or open doors.\n7. Although it is possible that he was getting his bike ready to go by turning his lock, which could be part of the action of opening his bike door, it is unlikely that he was waiting until he opened the lock. If this was the intended meaning then the question would have not asked what he was starting to do, but what he was starting to 'do', which is not grammatical.\n8. Therefore, it is more reasonable to assume he was starting to open the door of his bicycle and was ready to ride it.\n9. The given answer is an action, not a verb tense, so E: open doors makes sense.\nAnswer: D.: open doors\n\nInput: He had plenty of toys to play with at his party. What was his favorite toy of all? Choices:  a: the box the toys came in. B: the squeaky one. C: the one that moves. D: the one made of wood. E: the one he broke most.\nRationales:1. The given answer choice \"A: the box the toy came in.\" is very logical for someone who plays with toys for the entertainment.\n2. The sentence: \"He had plenty of toys\". The phrase \"please of\" means that he had plenty of the thing, not for the thing.\n3. A: it doesn't really make sense for a child to think that the box the toy is in is the best toy.\n4. B: he did not make mention of liking the squeaky toy.\n5. C: the one moving may have been the best to play with for a moment, but it will not last very long.\n6. D: this does not make sense.\n7.

Pocket does not make logical sense as a key would not be kept in there. \n7. Similarly, open doors is not logical in this context because one would not lock their car if their doors are open. \n8. While'solution to problem' is related to the context, it does not imply opening a lock.\n9. So, out of the remaining options, choice b: pocket is the one that provides a logical answer to the question.

Choices: A: have a good time B: feel sorry C: be absent from work D: stay at home E: take sick day\nRationales: The question states that those who get sick with colds often have to work, go/attend class. This is a statement that implies that people who are sick with colds are usually required to attend work or school despite being ill and would have to stay home.\n\n1. When examining the options offered, Eliminate A: Have a good time and C: feel sorry because being sick with the common cold implies that you cannot fully enjoy the activities that you would be feeling good for.\n2. Also, Eliminate B: feel sorry because this is a more general term that can be used to express various emotions. As stated above, it can be concluded that the sick person would most likely stay home and not enjoy an activity while feeling ill with the common cold.\n3. Eliminate D: Stay at home because a sick person is not required to physically stay at home when they are sick. It might be suggested that they need to rest a lot, but this is not defined through the question.\n4. Eliminate E: Take a sick day because it implies that the sick person must take a day off from school or work. Since we know that the sick person must stay home in many cases, we can conclude that they do not need to take a sick day.\nThis leaves us with remaining options A: Have a good Time and B: Feel sorry.\n5.

Choices:  D:  Take a shower A: Go to the library B: Read a book C: Watch television D: Have some water\nRationales: First, we understand from this context that she was really hot, implying that she was overheated or experiencing a feeling of being overly warm. \nSecond, we understand from the statement that this overheating could be relieved by a given problem and so she would be cooler if she solves this problem. \nThird, we identify from the given choices that options (c) Watch television and (d) Have some water are not the best option or plausible solutions, due to the given context in which both are not related to the problem of overheating, as television and water are neither hot nor cold, so they have no effect on temperature or heat.\nFourth, options like going to the library or reading a book would normally be done in air-conditioned places away from the sun to avoid overheating.\nFifth, the given problem would most likely be a problem that is cold or that provides coolness.\nSixth, options A: Go to the Libraryand B: Read a book do not solve the stated problem of her being hot.\nFinally, we eliminate all irrelevant options A: Go to library and B: Read a book due to the given context. \nSeventh, we identify that the best matching problem would be a coolness-related problem, thus the best option is D: Have some water.\nThus, the answer has to D", "answer": "A: look beautiful"}

Since 'open doors' is not applicable as the person is obviously not arriving from another location, we eliminate it and focus on 'turn lock' versus 'pocket'.\n6. 'Turning a lock' and 'pocketing a key' are both everyday actions many people take routinely when they're planning to lock their home or leave something in their pocket for safekeeping.\n7. However, for the given context, 'turning a lock' is a more applicable choice.\n8. Thus, the answer to what next he would do is 'turn lock' or B: pocket as this more directly addresses the context of the question regarding a lock.\nAnswer: B : pocket\n\nInput: A child on a horse would feel ____ doing a what? Choices: A: secure B: scared C: unstable D: uncomfortable E: happy\nRationales: First, let's focus on the question phrasing. It asks about a child on a horse, without any additional context. When someone is on a horse, there is a chance that they may also be doing a what? Now, let's eliminate the ones that do not fit into the context of a child. \n5. Eliminate A: secure because this does not make sense to apply with children.\n6. Eliminate C: unstable as this also does not make sense applying to children.\n7. This leaves us with four choices to select between: B: scared, D: uncomfortalbe, E: happy, and C: unstable. \n8. However, even though it applies to a child, in most cases'scared' would be more appropriate because the situation usually makes a child feel this way.\n9. Therefore, the answer would be the option D: uncomfortability. \nAnswer: D: uncomfortableness\n\nInput: The sun came out, and so did the what?

From here, we can eliminate D: pocket because the given statement gives us a clue that he has something in his pocket, but this cannot be determined without prior knowledge.\n7. Lastly, we can eliminate E: open doors, because the action of opening a door could be accomplished after locking the bike with the key, or even just going through the door itself.\n8.

What advice could you give them? Choices: \tA: Go to the restaurant to ask for help B: Go to the hotel to ask for help C: Let the baker tell a story\nRationales:\t1. The question tells readers that the bakers didn't have anywhere to take those who needed their help.\n\t2. They mention that they had no where to go next.\n\t3. This indicates that they are at a dead end.\n\t4. They need a solution to their problem.\n\t5. After analyzing the choices, we find out that 'going to the hotel to ask advice' and 'letting the baker tell a'story'are very unlikely as solutions because they do not address the actual need of the bakers.\n\t6. These two choices take people back from their situation. \n\t7. 'Going to the restaurant to ask the help' is also not an ideal way given that it asks people to interact with others to get assistance. \n\t8. We assume that the bakers do not want to be in front of people to receive help because they may feel ashamed of needing help.\n\t9. Out of all the remaining choices, this indicates that they need 'a new strategy'.\n\t10. This is the only left choice that answers the demand of the question.\n\t11.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. 'Turn lock' does not directly indicate the intent to open a lock, and 'pocket' could mean simply storing the key.\n6. 'Pocket' generally refers to small compartments found in pockets or backpacks. However, the question says nothing about taking out the key from a pocket.\n7. 'Solution to problem' is outright incorrect as the person is already at home.\n8. Finally, 'open doors' could suggest the opening of doors to enter or exit his home, but the question only states that he has a key to an inside door.\n9. Thus, the only reasonable choice is D: open interior door.\n10. From this, one can infer that the person opened the interior door to get inside and bike home. \n11. Hence, the answer to this task is D: open inside door.\nAnswer: D open interior door\n\nInput: She used her laptop to check social media, where did she use it?

Similarly, it would not be necessary to 'pocket' the key, as usually pockets are used to store things besides keys, making this option unlikely.\n7. 'Open doors' is a common occurrence, yet it does not indicate what the person is about to do with the key.\n8. Hence, the two remaining options are'solution to problems' and 'bike'. \n9. However, this question is not asking about a general problem, but simply the next action he would take after opening the lock. \n10.

Choices: A: 10 feet B: 7 feet C: 3.6 feet D: 3.4 feet E: 3.0 feet\nRationales: To help better understand the height growth of a bonsai tree, consider that while it is young and maturing, it grows quite steadily with plenty of room to develop. \nAfter it matured and reaches it's height limits, a bonsai tree stops maturing and it's growth stops at the base of it's canopy. \nLooking at the choices, D: 3.6, E: 3.4, A: 10 and B: 7 feet;\nIncorrect choices: Although some of the choices show the base of the canopy to look like the height of the tree's trunk, they're all over than the height of a Bonsai tree. So, they can be eliminated.\nCorrect choice: Looking at the correct answers (D: 3.6 and E: 3.6) we can see that they refer to the height of the Bonsai tree's canopy to refer to it's height. \nAs B: 7 doesn't refer to the canopy's height, it can be rejected as incorrect answer.\nIf we focus on the height of the canopy of the Bonsai, we can see that 3.6 can be the maximum range of the trunk's height (3.6 feet) \nIf the tree's height exceeds this, it would be referred to as a giant or as a fullsize pine (B: 7 feet).\nTherefore, the correct answer is choice D: 3.9", "answer": "D: field"}

Choices:  F: Get out the screwdriver  G: Throw out the dishwashing tabs  H: Open the power panel  I: Get out a new dishwasher J: Throw out the sponges  K: Call the service technician\nRationales: The question asks us \"What should you do if the Dishwasher stops while the power is connected and The fuse is still good?\"\nBased on the question, we see that \" The fuse is still GOOD\".\nThis means that the fuse is not blown and we have not run out of power.\n\nThe given steps are:\n1. Get out the screwdriver: This implies that we need to take the top off our dishwasher in order to check the wires inside the machine, which is not necessary as long as the power is working.\n2. Throw out the disheswashing tabs: Tabs are disposable plastic pieces that make up the rack in a dishwasher.  They act as a filter to catch food, grit, and water spray.  It is not necessary to throw out the tabs.\n3. Throw out the sponge(s): This is not logical.  Sponge is a disposable item and is often a removable part of a dishwashing machine.  It would be logical to check it for issues.\n4. Open the power panel: Opening the power panel of a dishwshing machine has nothing to it with repairing it.  It can be opened while a machine is still working to check the wiring underneath the machine.\n5.

As for C: solution to problem, D: pocket, and E: open doors, these options do not make any sense with the context of the question or with the actions so far.\n7.

As the question asked us to answer the question, it can be deduced that it is a factual sentence and not an indicative one, i.e. not an indicative or declarative sentence.\n6.

Out of all the given options, only option A: turn lock is an imperative sentence.\n8. Out of its parts, the phrase \"turn lock\" contains only a word. \n9. This means that it is not descriptive enough, and it does not meet all the characteristics of an imperative sentence. 10.

This suggests that the professor taught the history of a war, and the reason that the war was interesting or exciting is not given.\n3. Among the given options, it is clear that D: in depth, is the best fit because it has both the words 'long' and 'history', so it is about a long history. In 'history', the meaning of depth could be the depth or complexity of the event. \n4. 'In-depth' could mean the process of research or examination into the war.\n5.

For the first two, turn lock and pocket, the question does not specifically state that they are part of the sequence of actions that he is undertaking to bike home. Hence, they are not plausible options.\n6. Further, the last choice, pocket, is used as a possible option as well because the action of taking out a key, which directly leads to turning a lock, can be completed in one swift movement.\n7. Therefore answering D: pocket is most likely, as it was what he did to access the lock, followed by E: turn lock as indicated by the next part of the question:  He got his key out and turned the lock.\n\nAnswer: D: pocket, E: turn lock\n\nInput: He asked to be paid more money, the boss refused, he stormed out, angry, and didn't come back.

This suggests that we should try to identify what went wrong. As we look at the five choices, the sentence \"He stormed out, angry and didn't come\" tells us that the baker did not return to the job that day.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, and open doors.\n5. Among these choices, we have to be careful of the ambiguous choice of 'turn lock'. 'Pocket' and 'open doors' both clearly represent the action of opening a door or a lock, so we can disregard them. \n6. We know that he already started something with his key, so he cannot have 'turn lock' as his next action because that would be a reiteration of that previous action. \n7. The choice of'solution to problem' may be a misfit for this question because although a person may have a solution to the problem, he would not immediately turn to it and start to do so once he has retrieved it.\n8. Similarly, 'pocket' may also be unsuitable because the key is usually kept in the pocket, thus the actions of putting in the pocket and opening a door are essentially repetitive.\n9. We can further eliminate choice D: pocket, as the question clearly states that he has already taken the key out of his pocket, so it is not logically possible for him to take out the key once more, and put it back into his pocket.\n10. At last, we are left with choices A: turn lock and E: open doors. The former choice of 'turn lock' clearly means to open a lock, which is redundant for the given context. However, 'open doors' is the correct answer, as it directly associates to the action of opening a locked door.\n11.

A hunter normally has an advantage over his prey in two ways of two which are either having an advanced technology or having a particular set of skills which includes knowledge. \n3.

The main characteristic of this scenario is that he is learning something and that it has been a long term process for him, so he should be carrying something that could be used for learning.\n2. The given options are: toilet paper, keys, smart device, phone, and pen.\n3. The first three do not fit the given scenario, toilet paper and keys do not require much thinking or learning. A smart device, like a phone, is a good example of technology that requires some thinking and learning to use effectively.\n4. That leaves us with the pen.\n5. Although it can be used for many different things, it is the most likely option because learning something requires writing, reading, thinking, drawing, researching, and other things that are associated exclusively with a pen or pencil.\n6. Therefore the answer is: pen.\nAnswer: Pen\n\nInput: He knows that his cat was in the litter box, his cat had what on its body?

We can also see that the cat has something on its body (\u201chas\u201d does not always mean a positive feeling like \"I like this cat because it has soft fur\"), so we can guess that it might have a hairball (or another bad thing). \n3.

The choice of turn lock indicates the action of biking home, but what would that have to do with the key?\n7. Solution to problem is used in an inappropriate context, it does not suggest anything that precedes what is happening.\n8. Pocket is used in an incorrect manner, it does not convey any actions that can be done while holding a key.\n9. Opening doors, like opening a lock, generally indicates an action after all the preparations are complete and it is time to start a certain activity, i.e. entering and getting in the house. In the context of the question, this would not be what the man intended. \n10. Hence, out of all the choices, A: turn lock is a very unlikely choice, and B: pocket is the most precise choice in terms of what actually happened - he turned the lock.

First, he is looking at someone else in a mirror, and then, it implies that he keeps looking.\n2. This indicates that he is not paying full attention to something else he should be looking at.\n3. Therefore, we are looking for what kind of \"seeing\" that could be referring to.\n4. Out all the given choices only K: not observing, H: not noticing, and J: not listening can fit the bill.\n5. But K: not observing suggests looking but cannot explain the noticing part.\n6.

The patient needed to wash his 'entire arm' in either'soup' or 'water'. \n1. There are two options: washing in water OR in soup.\n2. Because the doctor is concerned about infections, and we know water is a liquid, soup is the most likely choice.\n3. Soup is also a liquid, and soup is a possible cause of infection, so washing in soup is more logical.\n4. However, soup could be either hot or cold soup or 'chicken soup'.\n5. It is likely that the patient may not have a suitable bowl. Thus, it is more practical to immerse the patient's hand or arm in water.\n6. The given choices: A water; B: water, C: soup, D: soup, E: drinks. \n7. The doctor's instruction is to immerse the patient in 'liquid', which, according to the definition of liquid is the same as soup or water.\n8. However, A water, soup C soup, D soup, E drinks are all liquids, but the choices A: water and B: water are too specific to be the answer.\n9.

According to the statement, \"Making a plan is the most important purpose of a person in the committee.\" Making a plan is often done or the responsibility of a group in a committee.\n2. Therefore, the purpose mentioned here refers to the goal of the committee member.\n3. The group member does not decide to be or become a part of a committee, so it is logical to think that being a member of a committee is not the main purpose.\n4. Another word that also refers to the goal of a committee is objectives, however, the use of this word is vague and does not specify the goals of the group.\n5. After looking at the given choices and analyzing their context, the answer to the question can be found to be C: chief executive.\n6. Since the purpose of the person in a committee is making a plan, it is likely that the group is working towards the goals or vision determined by the person in power who is not necessarily an original member of the committee.\n7. Therefore the committee's focus is often on reaching the goals of their chief executive.\n8. So it is most appropriate to choose C: chief executive as the answer.\nAnswer: C; chief executive\n\nInput: Which of the words in the given list would the author not pick as a  synonym of \"invest\"?

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket and open doors.\n5. Turn lock involves a specific action of turning a key or other device.\n6. The question is asking an action, not a specific step, so solution to problem or open doors can be ignored.\n7. What remains are Pocket or pocket, of which there is only one correct answer.\n8. Thus, the correct response is E: pocket.\nAnswer: E. pocket\n\nInput: At last he knew his work had what? Choices: A: importance, B: value, C: quality, D: usefulness, E: value to society\nRationales: The question refers to a situation where a person has completed their work.\n1. At the last stage of their work they have finally found out what their work has.\n2. The options are important, value, high quality, usefulness, and valuable to society.\n3. Quality does not relate to value so it can be excluded from here.\n4. Value, means 'a concept of how important', 'worthy of respect', 'worthy of attention' or'something held in high regard' \n5. As the situation does not specify why the work is important, this option may not apply.\n6. Therefore high importance can be excluded from the options.\n7. Usefulness means'something which is helpful or practical in some way'. In the previous sentence the word had is used to mean, 'being in a state of completion or completion itself', which indicates purpose.\n8. Lastly, of the remaining options, only one gives us a meaning that will fit the situation.\n9. Therefore it is given that this person learns that their work has been 'of value to society'\nAnswer: E: Value to society.\n\nInput: She was the perfect match for him.  He is her best friend and his love is what she has longed for.  She finally found it with him.  Now the question is what?

Pocket is a verb that is related to holding an object, however it does not apply here because the man did not get the key to put into his pocket.\n7. Therefore all that remains are 'pocket' and 'open doors', which the answer is given as D: open doors.\nAnswer: D. open doors", "answer": "E: farmer's market"}

However, it can be ruled out as a plausible action - the key will not turn the lock without a keyhole. \n7. There is no clue in the given choices to suggest that a bike lock could be opened without a keyhole, so this option can be disregarded.\n8. Of the remaining options, turning the lock is definitely a possible action that the given person could take in this scenario.\n9. B: pocket and C: solution to problem seem quite obvious, however, we need to eliminate these options - turning the key is a specific action the person is taking out of all the choices given.\n10. D: pocket can also be disregarded - a bike lock can only be opened from the outside by turning the keyhole if it is available. \n11. The other two remaining options are what are directly correlated with the context of the question: A: turn lock and D: pocket.\n12. So, what is likely to be done first? The person is ready and has the key - so the person can be expected to turn the lock and not put the key back.\n13. Therefore, the correct response to the given question is D: pocket.\nAnswer: DPocket\n\nInput: The most common type of bird found in Australia is the what? Choices: A: emu B: kookaburra C: dingo D: cockatoo E: wattlebird\nRationales: The answer is D: cockatoos. The emu is the largest bird in Australia, but is not a common type. The kookaburra, dingo, and wattlebird could all be found in Australia, but are all uncommon types. As such, the correct answer is D: coockatoos.\n\nInput: Which of the following could possibly be placed in a safe deposit box?

'Turn lock' is a process and not a specific action, it may even suggest further action of \"turning the key in the lock\", and'solution to problem' is ambiguous.\n6. This is because the key may or may not have been brought out to solve a problem before it is put back into their pocket.\n7. This leaves B: pocket and C: solution to problem as the only viable options.\n8. 'Pocket' seems to be a more likely choice since the key would probably go back to their pocket before the bike ride back home.\n9.'solution to problem', however, seems to suggest a solution that could help with a lock without opening it, so we can reasonably say that this isn't the right answer.\n10. So, the correct answer is C: solution to problem.\nAnswer: C D: solution to problem\n\nInput: They will try to avoid a large company, but they must decide \nif they will compete by how many products or marketing campaigns.

Therefore the answer is E: pocket.\nAnswer: E pocket\n\nInput: One difference between the mall and a park is that the park is what? Choices: A: much cleaner B: much more expensive C: much cheaper D: much less popular E: much less crowded\nRationales: In the given statement, the park is cleaner, less expensive, less popular and has fewer crowds. \n1. The question asks for a difference between the mall (a type of shopping center) and a park that's opposite of what the given options are.\n2. The given statements tell us certain facts about the mall and park.\n3. Option A says that the mall is cleaner than the park, but options B and C say that the mall is much cheaper and less crowded than the park, making option B incorrect.\n4. Option C can't be the difference we're looking for because it describes the opposite of what the given statements tell us about the mall.\n5. Option E tells us that fewer people go to the park than the mall, but this still doesn't answer the question.\n6. Therefore we can conclude that option D is the correct answer as it tells us that the park is much less popular than the mall.\n7. D: much less popular\n\nInput: Your grandparents might have been able to get around on a bicycle, but they would have had to stop and rest much sooner because of what? Choices A: no sidewalks B: no helmets C: no bicycles D: modern sports bicycles E: no energy drinks\nRationales: First, by understanding the original question, we can infer that the elderly would have gone in a bicycle at some point earlier in their lives when they were young. We can also infer that they may not be as fast or have the same stamina as younger people because of what the given statements are saying. This suggests that their'modern' bicycle would have been very basic compared to bicycles today", "answer": "A: botanical garden"}
{"text": ", open doors, pocket, solution to problem, and pocket.\n5. Of these choices, none indicate the action of opening a door lock and therefore do not meet the requirement of opening a lock.\n6. Of the two choices, 'open doors' and 'open locks' are homophones for each other, which often creates ambiguity.\n7. Therefore there are only two choices left: pocket and solution to problem. \n8. 'Pocket' does not specifically relate to the act of unlocking something, whereas'solution to problem' indicates solving of a problem. \n9. Among the options, only'solution to problem', which directly relates to the action of opening a 'lock'-door/unlocking, is left.\n10. Therefore, the answer for this question is E: open doors.\nAnswer: E, opens doors\n\nInput: A shoe factory in japan that had 10,000 employees has closed.  So it's now what? Choices: A: in use B: disused C: used D: disused; unemployed E: unemployed F: disused\nRationales: The information tells us that a shoe factory, which had 10, 000 employees, has closed.\nWe can eliminate choices A: in use and F: disused as the factory has closed.\nThis leaves us with the other choices; we eliminate D: disused; used, E: unemployd, and C: used as none of them include the term 'unemployed.'\nTherefore, since the factory has closed, the workers that used to be employed by it are now without jobs and employment.\nThus, the answer is choice D: disused; the former workers are now unemployed.\nAnswer: D, disused; unemployment", "answer": "D: clear"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. Turn lock can refer to locking as well as unlocking. However, it is unlikely that someone is locking their bike when they're about to bike home, so this is eliminated. \n6. So, we eliminate this choice. \n7. 'Pocket' could be the pocket in our pant or the pocket in our bike. However, it does not mean opening the bike lock, so this cannot be the action he took when he was ready to biate home. Thus, pocket is also eliminated.\n8. Therefore, the answer should be E: open doors or D: pocket.\n9. E: open doors means opening the door of the bike to allow him to get on his bike. Pocket is a noun, not a verb hence cannot be the correct answer.\n10. D: pocket could be referring to a pocket in his pant, but the word 'begin' suggests that he took the key for the first time. If the key was in the pocket all this time beforehand, he would not need to take it out to begin to use it to open the bike door. Also, he would not need the action of using the key 'begin' since he would have used the key before.\n11. Therefore, the answer D: begin to or E: open door is the correct answer. \nAnswer: D: begin to or open door\n\nInput: People don't realize that the earth was created from what? Choices;  A: space B: clay C: dust D: dirt E: a hole dug\nRationales:1. The question makes the initial statement that people do not realize that the earth was formed from space.\n2. Considering the statement in context, it is probable that it is a fact that people are unaware of.\n3. As for the given choice, B: clay, while possible, it may not be plausible. This is due to a factual element in the choice, as clay is defined as \"a fine-grained soil\".\n4. In contrast, C: dust and E: a hole dun is unlikely as they are too specific or literal.\n5. Moreover, D: dirt does not give much information about the creation process, though it may be plausible if people", "answer": "E: sheet music"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket and open doors.\n5. Of all these choices, only \"open doors\" can be considered as a general action to describe the concept of opening a lock.\n6. \"Open doors\" describes a situation in which a door is unlocked, which is different from the lock opening of \"turn lock\". \n7. Furthermore, the verb 'pocket' does not convey the action of opening.\n8. Therefore, the action of opening a key is described by \"open doors\". \n9. This makes the correct answer to the question \"open doors\", because it directly relates to the verb 'open'.\nAnswer: C: open doors\n\nInput: What will a computer be able to do? Choices:  the human brain A: make B: a C: big decision D: better decisions E: the internet\nRationales:\n1. The statement \"What will a computer be able do?\" implies that a computer will be able to do something. \n2. From this statement, we can understand that only'make' or 'do better decision' are appropriate options to answer the question 'What will a computer be capable of doing?'. \n3. We may also reject 'a big decision', 'better decision' and'make' because they do not directly relate to the question 'What will computers be able to do?'. \n4. For example, computers do not'make' decisions on their own, they follow orders from a human.\n5. Therefore among the given options; 'do better decision' and'make a big decision' are out of scope.\n6. When we compare the choices that are left, both'make' and 'do better decision' relate to computers being able to perform some action.\n7. However,'make' is the verb form for'make a thing', and 'do better decision makes it clear that a decision is still being made, rather than just done. \n8. 'Make a thing' is not a specific action that computers can do, but it does not relate directly to the question either. \n9. Thus, 'do better decision' is the term that fits best into the concept of'make', as it is the closest answer that relates to the question. \n10. Out of all the given options, the only term that directly relates to'make' is 'do better decision'.", "answer": "C: bakery"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. However, the question is asking for the action that most closely follows the act of reading out his key.\n6. Turning a lock (option A) and pocketing the key (option C) are not the same, as pocketing the key implies carrying it away with him. This is opposed to the act of turning the key to open the lock.\n7. Out of the other options, pockets, are used for carrying things, so if he had a key in his pocket, then that means he had gone home at some stage of the day. \n8. Thus, the actions of option B: pocket and option D: open doors could both be a solution to this problem.\n9. However, out of the two choices that could address the situation, option B pockets are more likely because his preparations to bike home didn't take very long, so he had to go on with his day after pockets.\n10. On the other hand, opening doors (option D) implies a more time consuming activity, so he would have had time to open the doors after biking or otherwise completing his day's activities. \n11. Therefore, the appropriate answer is B: pocket, which means he pocketed the key before biking home.\nAnswer: B. pocket\n\nInput: To get a good grade, one needs to what? Choices A: try B: study C: have fun D: work E: sleep\nRationales: Options try and study show how to get a good grade but do not actually get the grade and are therefore incompatible with the word 'get'. \nOptions work and have fun are incompatible with the word try and do not demonstrate how to get a good report card, and are therefore also incompatible with the word get. \nTherefore the answer is work.\n\nInput: Who does the cleaning?

So there is a high likelihood that he was attempting to open a lock, or his bike lock.\n7. In which case 'open doors' may not be an applicable option, because it would require something other than his key; and 'pocket', since it is unlikely the action in this context required putting the key back immediately.\n8.

We can then eliminate choices A: turn lock B) pocket and E: open doors because they do not directly relate to the action of opening the lock.\n6. Between option D: solution to problem and option C: pocket, which are both options that imply the action of opening a specific lock, we are given more information in the second part of the question, telling us that he is ready to bike home and also \"began to unlock doors.\" This means that the bike lock is what he is unlocking, implying that we can answer the question with option C: pocket.\n7. The question is now asking what action he began to perform with the key, so the correct answer is 'pocket'.\nAnswer: C: pocket\n\nInput: If she were in a tug of war, her team is likely to win because she is what? Choices: A: tough and strong B: muscular C: flexible D: a fast runner E: big and tall\nRationales: (1.) The sentence is an incomplete one that consists of two incomplete phrases with some given information.\n(2.) The problem we have to solve is what is the correct missing option.\n(3.) To do so, we need to identify the given information, understand the sentence and think of a plausible completion for the given phrase.\n(4.) When we look at the missing phrase, it is a one word phrase that begins with the letter A, therefore, the answer has to begin with the same letter. Also, the missing phrase is a noun phrase, the answer must be a noun that is parallel to the word \"strong\". \n(5.) Finally, we need to consider the given information that there is a question mark after \"tug of war\", since a question mark indicates that a question is missing instead of an independent clause, we know that the question mark is actually telling us that a question is missing and that it should correspond to the missing phrase in the sentence. \n(6.) Let's think about the given information in the second phrase. She has her team is likely to be the main noun. Team being a collective noun, she is a singular being and her likely to win part being a verb phrase implies it must be followed", "answer": "B: being annoyed"}

For this question, start by analyzing the given choices. \n1. Consider starting with No Really, Very Very, Not Crucial, and ABSOLUTEL Y Not crucial. \n2. Firstly, it is easy to disregard Not Crucial as one of the wrong choices for the simple reason that the word is very similar in spelling to the given phrase 'Christmas Greeting Card'. \n3. Next, if you look at the other options, some of them are even more similar to the question itself, such as Very Very, which are almost exact in spelling/punctuation. \n4. Lastly, ABSOLUTEL y Not Crucial is another wrong choice as it has a slight spelling difference for all of the similar terms. \n5. So, to narrow down the scope, only consider the terms that slightly vary or differ from the question.\n6. There is only one remaining choice out of the given ones that slightly varies from the question: Absolutely. \n7.

Now looking at E: close lock, The question mentions that we are to answer for what he got ready.\n8. The action of getting out his key indicates he is getting ready to bike, thus the action of getting ready cannot be closing a lock.\n9.

We eliminate turn lock and open doors, which do not directly mention turning or opening a lock, and pocket, which does not always involve opening a lock.\n5. So, he likely began to turn the lock, but the problem is that a lock is still secure.\n6. Therefore the answer is B: pocket, because it is most likely he wanted to try to open the lock or found another way to unlock it.\n7. This option is also the only one out of the choices that does not mention finding a solution to a problem, since bike riding home already is the solution to the problem of getting home. \n8.

Choices:  First two years of the War Second two years of the War Before the War After the War\nRationales:\n1. The given statement indicates that the place takes place during the war.\n2. The first two years of the war lasted from 1939-1941. During this time, Hitler began to invade all of Europe, eventually declaring war on the United States.\n3. The given options can then all be considered as possibilities, however the option After the War seems to go against the rest of the information.\n4. Therefore the answer must be either Before the War or After the War. Looking at the options more closely, we see that Before the War covers the years from 1937 \u2013 1939 and After the War covers the years between 1945 \u2013 1948. \n5.

It also states man has problems.\n3. \"What-if\" is used more often to refer to a question than an answer.\n4. This rules out choices A: \"whatever\" and B: \"anything\".\n5. \"What-if I were wrong\" sounds like a question.\n6. D: \"thing\" and E: \"thing is\" are in the wrong place in the sentence.\n7. Choice C: \"whatever is\" implies a thing, which doesn't make any sense in this context.\n8.

Among these, solution to problem is the least likely to be the correct answer. A solution to a problem is usually not an action, it indicates a concept that addresses a larger situation. For example: if the question asked us if the person was ready to bike, one possible solution that could contribute to this readiness is carrying a spare bike tire.\n7.

If they are friends, they can go with author.\n\n3) You can eliminate married couple because the author does not have married manners.\n\n4) No one is not a good option because no one knows where Disneyland is. It is not like a trip to see neighbors.\n\n5) We can rule out one more thing based on logical deduction.\n\nDisneyland offers a package for people like adults.  Children would be charged different.  We can eliminate those who want to be charged differently from adults for children because the author is in that group.\n6) The author wants to go to Disneyland is confirmed. So we can eliminate children.\n\n7) We understand the age of the author is 3~8 years old. So we can assume that the author is a child", "answer": "B: fridge"}

Solution to problem and pocket are phrases that aren't specific to bike-lock unlocking or opening a bike, while either option can be the correct one.\n7. Lastly, opening doors is definitely not an expected action by a person ready to bicycle home.\n8. Thus, the action that must be done next is 'open doors' or, in other words, unlock the door before riding the bike.\n9. Therefore, the question asks us to predict what the next action will be, and the options given are simply too ambiguous to determine which one is correct. The only answer that directly fits the context of the question is the action 'open doors' or 'unlock door'.\n10. Hence the answer is E: open doors.\nAnswer: E; open doors\n\nInput: He is on the edge of his chair, with what emotion? Choices:  B: joy A: excitement C: anxiety D: discomfort E: annoyance\nRationales: The question states that one is sitting on the edge of his or her chair.

Out of all of these options, 'pocket' is a more likely sequence of events than the others.\n8. In the context of the question, this makes sense, he is preparing to lock the door before leaving.\n9.

Choices:  B: yes C: maybe D: no E: certainly\nRationales: A patient suffering from pneumonia may find it difficult to breathe but a person suffering from whooping cough should not find it difficult to brea.\nThis is because whooping cough refers to paroxysmal coughing that produces a peculiar gurgling or whistling sound, caused by an obstruction in the respiratory tract.\n\nIf the patient cannot breathe, the obstruction in the airways is not caused by pneumonia, but by a foreign body or fluid obstruction in the trachea or larynx.\nThis condition is rare unless the patient is heavily sedated, so the correct choice should be (Option E).\nHowever, If the patient cannot breaththee, he would obviously be breathless even if he did not have any respiratory issues.\n\nAnswer: E: Certainly\n\n### Instructions:Choose the term that best completes the statement.\n\n### Example:\nInput: If the price of a sandwich is $4, what is the difference between it and a turkey breast sandwich?

Similarly, 'pocket' is unlikely, as this implies placing the key into the pocket, though he has already done this. \n7. 'Solution to problem' and 'open doors' are both possibilities, but do not accurately describe what is happening here, as opening doors would imply that he has already arrived at the door. \n8.

Pocket is the action of putting something into a pocket, however it is not the opening of any specific door.\n7. Solution to problem is a somewhat logical solution, however, the question does not actually ask for a solution. The answer to the question is the action of opening a door, which is the only logical solution to the problem of getting home.\n8.

Choices:  TAKE AP TEST B BE GENERAL TAKE AP TEARS C TAKE AWAY TO BE A PERSON D GENUINE USE ALL SENTENCES  E LET LOOSE TAKEN  F MAKE\nRationales:\n1. The question starts with \"He had a very hard problem\" which implies that he is facing an obstacle or problem that he is unable to overcome.\n2. Given that he had a very hard problem and an obstacle to overcome, he had to have the determination and knowledge to do so.\n3. Then, the options state what the person ought to do to get a definitive answer. \n4. \"TAKE AP TEST\" means to get an Advanced Placement (AP) test. This seems like a logical solution to the question 'to find a definitive answer'.\n5. However, it would not be the 'best' solution as the question refers to a definitive answer, suggesting that there can only be one right answer.\n6. Additionally, the options A, B, and E are not logical solutions, as they are not related to getting a definitive answer.\n7. Among the remaining options, 'C: TAKE AWAYS TO BE A PERSION' seems to be the most logical solution to the problem. 'TAKE AWAY' means to 'take something away' and refers to the idea of 'taking something away in order to solve a problem'.\n8. Taking away the 'problem' is a logical solution. However, in this case, the actual context of the statement implies that the person is taking away a negative thought, not actually an action", "answer": "B: think"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors. \n5. To find the correct word, we eliminate the choices that do not make sense in the context of the question: turn lock, solution to problem.\n6. Next, we eliminate the action of pocketing as this is not a very common way to start biking home.\n7. This leaves us with two choices: open doors and open.\n8. However, the idea of opening doors sounds too specific and may not be the most reasonable option.\n9. Similarly, opening, which may mean any door, does not seem to be a very specific task for him to start biking.\n10. Looking at the options again, we realise that there's an anomaly in the given choices. The key he uses to open the door is the same key he gets out of his pocket.\n11. We can therefore conclude that 'pocket' does not indicate a specific type of pocket or pocketing action.\n12. From this understanding, we may conclude that it is more likely for him to open doors or open a door using his key, which he gets out of his 'pocket'.\n13. Thus, the answer can be 'open doors' or 'open'.\nAnswer: A: turn lock\n\nInput: The best time to get an umbrella is to get one before it starts raining; otherwise, the umbrella's potential won't be of what? Choices B: any use D: any use D: be of any use\nRationales: Start by analyzing the whole sentence.\n1. The sentence states that the \"best time\" to get an umbrealla is to get one before the rain begins. \n2. This implies several things: first, that an umbrella will be put to use if the person does not wait too long to go get one. \n3. Second, that if a person gets an umbrella before the rain, the umbrella has the potential of being used. \n4. Next, we look at the given answer choices: Before, it was assumed that B: any use was a possible answer, however, it does not directly answer the question as it only refers to the general nature of the use of an umbrella.\n5. D: any use does not answer the question as it is an extremely vague answer option. \n6.", "answer": "A: school"}

Choices: A: learning B: behavior C: homework D: self-esteem E: schoolwork\nRationales:  1. A mom is usually trying hard to be a good one, so this suggests she cares enough about her children to make their lives better.\n2. From the statements given, it is clear that the mom is actively involved in her child's life and takes an active interest in what they are doing.\n3. The activities and habits of a child's life include academics such as learning and behavior. \n4. However, they may not necessarily include self-esteem and schoolwork.\n5. This is why B: behavior and D: schoolwork are incorrect answers. \n6. Thus, it seems that she is trying hard to be a caring and responsive mom by being a good listener and helping them with their problems.\n7. This makes C: homework and E: self-esteem most related to the context of the mother's behavior.\n8. But, out of the two options, C: homework makes better sense than E: self-esteam, being that homework is related closely to behavior and is a learning activity that is often a part of a child's day.\n9. So, the answer to the question is C: homework.\nAnswer: C. homework\n\nInput: All of the animals at the pet shelter could use a hand.  If no one does anything, these what's will starve.

The question is \"why didn't they say that if they had a good ride\".\n2. We must infer the answers based on how others would typically behave. \n3. The obvious answer for anyone speaking together, without any implication of bad intentions, is that they would say it if they had had a successful ride, because it is their good experience, or achievement.\n4. The only possible answer that fits this inference is C: \"they knew they had a good time\".\n5. The given choices are A: \"they knew they'd had a good time\" - that does not make logical sense as they knew they already had a good time; B: \"the conversation didn't continue\" - this is a reasonable suggestion but this conversation might continue with a less obvious response to their happiness; C: \"You don't say something that's obvious\" - this is incorrect because they are not discussing something that is obvious but instead a success or experience that warrants a response or feedback; so it is incorrect to say: you cannot say something that is obvious or implied to be true.\n6. E: They didn't say it because it was implied that you don't say that if you had a good riding experience.\n7.

How many years did they know each other after the relationship? Choices: 5: A: One 6: B: Two 7: C: Three 8: D: Four 9: E: Five\nRationales: The first sentence of the question tells us that they didn't Know each other when their relationship became close. \n1. This suggests that they initially knew each other for a short time before their relationship became very close because long-term relationships normally do not take place in a few years unless two people initially knew each other for longer periods.\n2. Considering there are only four numbers in the options, it makes more sense to eliminate choices: 8: four (which is longer than the time period given in the question) and 9: five (because the question tells us they did not know each other initially so one cannot know each other initially for five years and be close after that period of time).\n3. We also eliminate choice: 6. The question mentions that they did know each other in the first sentence, so it does not fit in a scenario where they didn't know each at all.\n4.

'Bike home' can also be understood as a physical barrier that could be entered by a key and unlocked through the use of a key, leaving A: turn lock and C: pocket as the only remaining choices.\n10. If we use 'turn lock' as the correct option, we can use the question information to deduce that a 'bike home' is probably associated with a door. \n11.

Therefore the correct answer that best completes the question is 'open doors'. This is the most obvious option because it most accurately fits with the context of the question and the given statements.\nAnswer: E : open doors\n\nInput: The children want to eat dinner before they go to bed, but what are they supposed to do? Choices:  Lose weight A: have dinner B: watch tv C: listen to music D: read a book\nRationales:1. The given statement describes that the children have homework they need to do.\n2. Therefore, they don't want to go to bed until they finish their homework.\n3. We can then deduce that they want to eat dinner before their homework so they will have energy.\n4. They want to eat dinner before being distracted by TV, which they could do while finishing homework and which would make it more difficult to focus.\n5. They also don't necessarily want to have dinner and go right to sleep since they don't want their homework to suffer in favor of television.\n6.

Choices: A: took a taxi B: jumped on a bus C: got in a car D: hired a helicopter E: walked to the location\nRationales: First, we understand from our question that the bride was in a rush.\n2. The given choices tell us that the bride either didn't take a taxi, but got in a car, or she jumped on a bus to get to her location.\n3. It is doubtful that the bride got in a car as she would not typically hire a car to take her from one location to another.\n4. The choice bride didn't \"hop in a car (get in a car)\" that means she chose either B: jump on a bus or took a taxi to get to her next location.\n5. She also did not \"get in a car\" because she is not the owner of the car, but \"got in a car\" is more accurate as she is the rider who gets in the car.\n6. It is also not correct for the bride to hire a helicopter since it is not commonly used and doesn't align with her lifestyle.\n7. These are the reasons that we eliminate \"hired a helicopter\" from the given list choices.\n8. The only remaining choice left is bride didn't get in a car, which is quite a bizarre answer. In this case, it means she likely jumped onto a bus which is a more accurate answer.\n9. Therefore, the answer must be", "answer": "C: city"}

Choices: A: seats B: beds C: cots D: blankets E: no places for resting\nRationales: The question tells us that the baby was tired; however, there was no place for the child's nap.\nConsidering that the baby was tired, the infant may have been sleepy or fatigued enough to require rest.\nIn addition, the question states that there was no place for this baby's nap. Looking at all these given choices, there are two options that do not match well with the conditions in the question; those are seats, and beds. A seat can be defined as an upholstered object intended to support a person in an idle, relaxed and/or elevated position, such as a bench or chair. Therefore, this choice is out of consideration due to the lack of mention of any type of seats or furniture in the question. Also, the use of the word seats does not align with the given context in the question. As for the option beds, the baby was not looking for somewhere to sleep or sleep on at all.

Therefore, the answer would be C:\"solution to problem,\" because he started to unlock his bikey\nAnswer: C:\"solution to the problem\", which is his bike lock.\n\nInput: Which sentence is most similar to the second one about the bookstore? Choices: A: I don't like the second one because I didn't enjoy reading.  B: I liked the first one.  C: The second one is not my thing.  D: The second one is similar to the last one.  E: I liked the third one best.\nRationales:\nThe sentence, \"\"I like the third one best.\" isn't much of a choice; because it doesn't say anything about a bookstore. In fact, it doesn't even remotely compare to other sentences.\n\nThe sentence, \"I don't like the third one\" says that the person doesn't like 2nd or 3rd (bookstore) 1st = I like the first bookstore.\n\nThe sentence \"I don't enjoy reading\" is talking about reading but not a comparison of book stores which is the subject.\n\nThe sentence,\"I liked the first one\" would be saying that the person liked the first bookstore as compared to the 2n and 3rd. That is not much of a question.\n\nThe sentence\n\"The second one is most similar to the last\" is talking about how one book store was similar to another. I like the first one - the last one - they are similar? Are they talking about another subject? \"The second one is\" most \"similar to\" \"the last one\" - that comparison is not much of a comparison.\n\nTherefore,\n\nA: \"I liked the third one best\"\n\nAnswer:\nA: I liked the third best\n\n### Require", "answer": "B: in motion"}

The other choices, then, do not offer a possible solution to him simply turning a lock.\n7. Therefore the answer is D: pocket as it's the most plausible choice and the most fitting solution for the situation.\nAnswer: D. pocket\n\nInput: An earthquake could hurt animals, that they depend on what? Choices: A: food B: friends C: homes D: each other E: habitats\nRationales: The first thing we notice is the word 'they' which implies that it might be referring to animals from nature.\nFollowing from this observation, we also notice that the word 'could' is used, which also denotes that the earthquake may potentially cause harm.\nNow looking at the given options, we see 'food', 'friends', 'homes', and 'each other'. Out of the four options, only 'habitats' refers to animals in the wild while the rest refer to animals inside the home.\nTherefore, the correct option can only be E - 'Habitats'.\nAnswer: E: Habitats\n\nInput: The house was destroyed, so where did the homeowners go? Choices: 1. A: somewhere else. 2. B: a hotel. 3. C: the neighborhood. D: somewhere else. 4. E: a hotel.\nRationales: We identify the question as telling us that the home was destroyed as a result of an accident.\nNext, we determine the most applicable answer. Looking at the answer, the homeowners are likely to move and are going to live in another home.\nThis eliminates the options \"somewhere else\" and \"a hotel\".\nNext up is \"C: the neighborhood\". This indicates that the homeowners may have found another home in the neighborhood.\nHowever, this is not the \"where\" the question is asking us.\nIt is still necessary to identify where they are going to live.\nIn this case, the homeowners will be looking for \"somewhere else to live\".\nThis is eliminated with its own option, \"somewhere else\". \"D: somewhere else\" is, therefore, the logical choice.", "answer": "A: outside"}

He found where he was staying and the landlord said where? Choices:  (1)  A: goodbye B: you have to leave now.  (2) C: you can stay.\nRationales: (1)1. First, we analyze the question and understand the given information.\n2. Next, we compare the given options.\n3. The given options are: goodbye, you have to leave now, you can stay.\n4. Goodbye isn't the answer because he's looking for a place to live, not goodbye. \n5. You have to leave now doesn't make any sense within the context of the given statements.\n6. Therefore the answer has to be you can stay.\n(2) (2) The next statement gives new information related to looking for a place to stay.\n7. So, the answer options are: goodbye again, you have to leave later, you can stay. \n8. Goodbye again doesn't make any logical sense for the new information given.\n9. You have to leave later is an incorrect choice because it doesn't address the action of looking for a place to dwell.\n10. Finally, the only option that properly addresses the newly given action is (2) C: stay.\nAnswer: (1)C: You can stay\n(2)C: You can Stay\n\nInput: If she can come with me,  We should go over as quickly as possible before she gets out of what?

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, and open doors. \n5. He was ready to bikeit home.  Therefore, what he intended was to open the lock, but got diverted when he got his key.  Since the solution to problem, pocket, and open doors do not mention lock, let's eliminate those options.  Turn lock means that he intended the action to turn the key to turn the lock, but that was already done as he got the key.  Solving the problem means that something occurred related to lock and the keys such as not having the key or unable to open the lock, which is not what the question implies the man to be doing.  Therefore, the man was not trying to solve a problem with his lock, nor solve a problem with his key which leaves our final options as pocket and open doors.  Pocket would not fit because there is no mention of something being in the pocket nor pocketing the key.  Open doors would not fit because the man is getting out a key, which implies that the doors are not locked.  Therefore pocket and open doors are likely options even though they are not mentioned, leaving us with A: turn lock for the correct answer. \n6. Answer: A: turn lock\n\nInput: 25. When the word 'the' is used, what is included? 26. What is the opposite of the adjective 'fast'? 27. What is another way to say 'little'?\nRationales:\n25. The word \"the\" is used when a specific person, place, or thing is being identified.  When the word \u201cthe\u201d is used in a sentence, it usually means that something has been already mentioned.  For example, in the sentence \u201cMy brother is the smartest person in his family,\u201d the word \u201cthe\u201d means that the person being spoken about has already been recognized as \u201csmart.\u201d \n26. The opposite of the adjective \u2018fast\u2019 would be \u2018slow\u2019 or \u2018slowly.\u2019\n27. Another way to say \u2018little\u2019 is \u2018tiny\u2019 or \u2018insignificant\u2019\nInput: After many nights of crying, what caused him to finally fall asleep? 28.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors\n5. Since opening a lock is the activity that matches most closely with 'getting out his key' we then eliminate: Turn lock, Solution to Problem, Open Doors \n5. Pocket and Pocket suggest that he had placed the key in a pocket. However as the only explanation we have is getting out his key, placing a key in a pocket is not sufficient.\n6. Therefore pocket is eliminated.\n5. If he does have his key, then he could turn the lock and cycle home. Although he does not have a solution to his problem, this also is not a feasible answer as the given choices are very specific.\n7. So, we are left with only opening doors as a feasible choice. \n8. However this only really makes sense in the context of a building or another similar structure. His home is usually a house, which a key does not have an impact on.\n9. So, the answer must be B: pocket. \n10. So, the answer can only be Bike.\nAnswer: B. pocket.\n\nInput: To prepare for the next round is a way of what? Choices A: get stronger B: win E: prepare for another round C: become more skilled D: succeed\nRationales:1. First, we notice that the question is asking us to choose the proper word.\n2. The context refers to a sport.\n3. In order to prepare, people practice as much as possible to get better.\n4. Hence, the answer would be B: get stronger.\nAnswer: B\n\nInput: Which of these words does NOT go with \"too\" OR \"to\"? Choices A: a,e B: b,f C: c,g D: d+e,e+f\nRationales:\n1. The question begins with the words \"If we remove the word\" too\" from a sentence, so we will be using the words that are directly after the word too. \n2. A + E - means that words that will not always equal A and E and therefore can have a word removed from either A or E. Hence there is no meaningless relation between the 2 words in this case. \n3. Similarly B and F is also meaningless because C and D is also meaningless, hence D + E will not result in A,", "answer": "D: cease fire"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors. \n5. Out of these options, A: turn lock and E: open doors refer to unlocking/opening the bike lock.\n6. B: pocket and C: solution to problem do not reference locking or unlocking.\n7. Therefore the most likely choices to fulfil the function of locking/unlocking the bike lock are A: turn lock and open doors.\n8. We need to further eliminate C: solution to problem because he had the key so, he simply needed to use it to open the lock.\n9. Out of the remaining two choices, A: turn lock sounds more plausible because it would require using the \"key\" to unlock the bike's lock.\n10. Hence, the answer choice is A: turn lock.\nAnswer: A. This suggests the act of unlocking/openING the bike lock\n\nInput: The kitten is screeching up and down like this  because this:   Choices: A:  it doesn't like you B:  it wants to leave C:  it needs cheese D:  your cheeks are scratchy\nRationales:  1. The kitten is screaming and the reason for that is that:\n2. The reason that the kitten is screecheing or screaming is not given in the input.\n3. Out the the following choices C: it needs cheese and D: it wants to leave are the most logical because the kitten is scamering without being touched\n4. E: it doesn't like could be used because it could be screaming in fear but this doesn't seem as logical\n5. B: it might want to leave seems the least likely it might be screaming because it is in pain or is scared\n6. However in the given context of the input A: your cheeks are scratching doesn't seem likely the kitten is scream because a human has already touched it\n7. It can be concluded that B: it wants to leave and C: it needs chees seems more likely for a reason other than being injured.\n8. Therefore A: your cheeks might be screetching is removed as a possibility.\n9. Lastly and most likely that it needs cheese or it wants to leave was removed", "answer": "A: seaside town"}
{"text": ", pocket, pocket solution to problem and open doors. \n5. The given statement implies that he is ready to leave his house, which would mean he did not leave anything else in his house. \n6. Thus pocket and pocket solution to problem are not applicable for him.\n7. The statement does not directly mention the action of opening doors, however, it could have been a possibility. \n8. This leaves us with the remaining choice A: turn lock.\n9.

He got a good deal on the house, He would have to keep it neat and clean.  He could take  what? Choices: A: a new loan B: a few hours of work C: just a small one D: a week off E: a few dollars on the side\nRationales: The given statement presents us with a man who wanted to leave his house, so he got his master key to enter the house and unlock the door.\n1. The house he wanted to leave was a good deal, which suggests that he must have found it to be of good quality, and that he could benefit from it.\n2. As such, he would want to take care of the house and keep it clean and in good condition.\n3. So, he can take \"a week off \", since having to spend time maintaining the property would prevent him from enjoying his time off. \n4. Another possible answer is \"a few dollars on the side\", as it suggests that he could make some additional income from renting out part of his property. \n5. \"Just a small one\" could suggest renting out a small portion of the property.\n6. \"A few hours of work\" is unlikely since he was only looking to take a \"week off\" from the property.\n7. Finally, to take \"a new loan\" would suggest that he could find someone to rent it, assuming that he couldn't afford to pay for the property himself.\n8. Therefore, out of all the possible answers, \"a week off\" best fits what the man could do with the property before renting it out. \n9. As such, the answer to this part of the question is A: a week off.\n10.", "answer": "C: die"}

What happened next? Choices: A: the cat let him go B: he escaped C: he stayed D: The cat ran away E: he chased the cat\nRationales:  1. The sentence tells us a story about a cat chasing a person and the person doing everything to get away from the cat.\n2. The cat was described as being relentless, and at the end of the sentence, \"The cat ran after him\", which suggests that the cat still wishes to chase the person away. \n3. The person who is being pursued in the story is trying his best to get away from the unwanted cat, but he is not being able to do that.\n4. Among the given choices, the only one that is possible and logical is \"The cat ran after\" which is an action being performed by a cat after realizing that it couldn't catch the person.\n5.

We are able to see that he could not find anything to \"READ\" (meaning READ material that contained words).\n4. So, the library must have had everything for \"Reading\".\n5. We are able to discard \"writing\" as an option because it does not indicate that the library contains everything for \"writing\". \n6. Option \"thinking", "answer": "C: computer science"}

Since question 5 relates directly to a response to the question, it can be ruled out. \n2. In order to select an appropriate answer to the question, one must first be able to categorically identify the qualities. \n3. The given response options can be broken down as: VERY and ___ ___ ___ ___.\n4. In order to be able to answer the question, a clear and concise response must be found that matches a specific quality. \n5. Option 4: very strong willed sounds similar to having a strong personality, which is why it can be eliminated.\n6. Option 3: very determined to be stoppped seems to be a response that refers to not wanting to be stopped, rather than the inability to change one\u2019s mind. So it can be eliminated too.\n7.

Choices: good; awesome; fantastic; phenomenal; exellent\nRationales: One may say that the carrot cake was good. Or perhaps, its flavor was phenomenal. If any of these options fit the question, you can take a crack at the answer.\nThe best course of action is to eliminate one option at a time. The given options for the carrot cake are: good, awesome, fantastic, phenomenal, and excellente.\n\nLook at the clues. The phrase is \"the carrot cake was\" followed by the modifier that the noun \"surprise\" was.\n\nThe modifier or adjective phrase that describes the carrot cake is going to be located after the word \"was\" - meaning these adjectives/adverbs will follow \"was\" with no space in between.\n\nFirst, cross out any options that appear to begin with a word that does not describe some aspect of the noun, carrot cake.\n\nNow, eliminate any options that are redundant or too narrowly defined.\n\nThe phrase indicates that the cake will likely have a strong flavor (due to carrots).\n\nBut, \"Good\" describes nearly any cake. It's almost like saying \"good\" - which is why you may eliminate this.\n\nEven \"great\" doesn't seem to fit. There are many great cakes, but if it's a carrot cake, surely it's going to be phenomenal?\n\nIf the carrot cake tastes well, it might be called good, but it could also taste amazingly good.

Therefore the only two options that could logically describe the action of opening a door lock are; pocket and pocket.\n7. Therefore pocket is a valid option for this task. \n8. However, by combining 'the key' and 'pocket', it becomes clear that 'pocket' is the most plausible and common choice considering the context.\n\n9. Further, consider choice D: pocket. Pocket is a valid option.\n10. However, by combining the use of keys with locking systems, it is logical to choose 'pocket'.\n11.

Choices: A: afraid B: embarrassed C: confused D: dejected E: delighted\nRationales: For the given options, we consider whether the given options are logical in the given context. \n\n1. If you were on a scale, you would weigh something, so it's common for people to be afraid of a scale because they don't want to weigh too much.\n2. If someone is embarrassed, they would be embarrassed to step on a scale while others are around, so option B does not make sense.\n3. If someone is confused, they are confused about something because they just don't know what's happening. One thing that they would not be confused about, is their desire to be on a scale, so their confusion does not apply.\n4. Confusion typically does not apply to anyone's desire or feelings, so option D does not make sense. \n5. The emotion of someone's dejected is sadness or sorrow and usually occurs in certain situations.\n6. It is not logical to feel dejected when you desire to step on a scale, this is usually a positive thing to people who are aiming for a fitness goal or weigh less.\n7.

Choices: ----- A: sophisticated B: witty C: educated D: bright\nRationales:1. In the question, it says, \"People who are able to understand...\" This implies that the people in question are a subgroup of people, able to understand subtleties of the sentence. The question then asks us what we can call people who are able to understand subtletries of sentences.\n2. All the given choices are adjectives that may help us form an answer.\n3. The adjective D: bright can be an option even though it is not a suitable fit for the question. The question asks us what people who are able to read subtleties can be called.\n4. 'Bright' usually implies having a high level of intelligence, not necessarily being able to read subtletites. So, let's further rule this option out.\n5. The term C: educated suggests that people who understand subtleties of a statement are people educated about language, like people educated in philosophy, literature, linguistics, and the like.\n6. Among the other choices, we eliminate A-B-C-D.\n7. The options we are now left with are D-E\n8. The term E: subtlety is the only adjective that fits in with how the question is phrased.\n9.

Similarly, solution to problem is not specific as it may be in the form of a physical action.\n7. This leaves either B: turn lock or A: open door.\n8. But since there are other locks besides a bike lock in the house (the door locks), we must assume that the bike lock key is the only key in hand.\n9. Therefore, the sentence implies that he was about to bike home so he opened his bike lock to begin locking his bike, hence the right answer is A: open door.", "answer": "A: cupboard"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. Turning a lock may take longer if it is complicated, so the other options should not be eliminated.\n6. We can eliminate 'pocket' because it does not fit well with the question's context of him being ready to bike home because he has already turned the lock and is ready to cycle.\n7. 'Pocket' is only one of the two options containing this word.\n8. Therefore, if we eliminate the other option that is'solution to problem' it fits the best into context.\n9. Lastly, the options 'open doors' and 'pocket' both involve him opening a lock by key, so we can eliminate those two options.\n10. Hence, the answer should be D: pocket.\nAnswer: D. pocket\n\nInput: She looked at her calendar, it was March of 1917.

E: April 2009\nRationales:\n1. The calendar, of March 2017, is a pre-requisite that we must first understand before being able to answer the question.\n2. This is because the question asks what month  a year from March 1917 might be?\n3. This suggests that March 2016, was already a year ago at the time of 1916, which in itself already shows that March 2027, would be in the same position of 2020 as in 2017.\n4. In this case, the correct answer is 'D: March 2009'.\n5. March 2008 was about 1 year ago so logically at this time march 2009 would be a year from march 2008.\n6. The question is based on the fact that in 2009 march would still be 1 year behind 1916(in the answer choice )\n7. In 2", "answer": "E: cure"}

Similarly, if we consider pocket and solution to problem, the question would have told us, he was ready to open the doors, the key to those doors would be in his pocket or he had a solution to his problem.\n7. Therefore a key has yet to be in his pocket, meaning he wants to take it out. This indicates he was ready to turn a lock.\n8. Consequently, the answer is C turn lock.\nAnswer: C turn lock\n\nInput: He is taking a course; his instructor always tells him which books he must read.  This is because the instructor knows which books he will enjoy reading.   Which statement best describes the difference between reading a book and what the instructor asks him to do? Choices:  Choice A: watch video B: do homework C: play football D: enjoy a book\nRationales: The question presents two scenarios: reading and enjoying a book, and homework. The text mentions that the instructor knows the books he will enjoy reading, which is the reason for him to'read the books' and do 'homework'. The text also mentions that by having homework, the instructor is 'asking him to do homework', suggesting that the instructor is not 'asking him to play football'.  Therefore, the 'difference between reading a book and 'playing football' is one of 'enjoyment' since homework is a burden and 'playing football', enjoyment. This distinction allows us to rule out options D and E. The difference is based on the instructor's knowledge that the pupil will not enjoy the homework. So, the answer must be some combination of A - B. Since the instructor is aware that the pupil will like the book, A will not satisfy the answer since it does not present any knowledge. So, between B and C, we pick C because enjoying a book is at the same time work and fun: 'work', because you need to be focused to understand the reading correctly; 'fun', because enjoying books is pleasurable as a hobby.\nAnswer: C reading is always fun, B is homework.\n\nInput: Which of the following statements about the", "answer": "B: high school"}

Change, Choices:  A1: increased supply B2: decreased demand C3: more factories D4: excess stock E5: increased cost\nRationales: The term change is a general term that often applies to an increase or change in an aspect. \n1. 'More supplies' is a general term, that can apply either to supplies of quantity, or to a better supply of quality.\n2. There are two types of supply, namely a continuous supply of a specific commodity, like oil, or a stocky supply, of limited quantity only. \n3. The term in question is increase in what? 4. 'Due to' is a transitive preposition, meaning that in order for the noun in the phrase to be understood, it must be paired up with a direct object. \n5. 'Due to the increase in use/increased use' the noun must be increased use, followed by what. \n6. All the other terms given in this part of the question are direct objects of increase in use. This gives us a clearer indication regarding the terms that can be discarded. \n7. 1. Due to increase in supply. 2. Due to decrease in demand. 3. Due to more factories 4. Due to excess stock\n8.

If you need to go somewhere, how might you save the environment? Choices:  L: Take a flight B: Take an electric car C: Leave the home D: Use a scooter E: Take a bus\nRationales: Question: One of the causes (out of many) of pollution is automobile.\nSolution: If you need to go to somewhere, how can you save the environment without taking an automobile? \nOptions: Take a flight, take a bus, use a scooter, take an electric car, leave the home.\nSince the question starts with \"if you need to go to\" means that it might not always be true.\nSo out of the 5 options, we should eliminate:\nL: Take a flight (might no be necessary most of time)\nBus: take a bus (might not always be easy)\nScooter: use a scooter (might not be safe)\nLeave the home: leave the home (most likely answer)\nTake an electric car: take an electric car (might be expensive (if there is a fuel shortage), pollutes the environment, and takes electricity which means more pollution due to coal/oil power generation)\nSo we get: E: Take a bus (if there is one)\nAnswer: E: Take a BUS (if there is one).\n\nInput: She had a good day because she ate too much food.

{"text": ", pocket solution to problem, pocket, open doors, bike out. \n5. Turn lock implies that he first turns a lock before opening the door. This doesn't necessarily align with turning keys, which would be necessary if the person wanted to open a door.\n6. Pocket solution to problem also doesn't make sense in this context as there is no indication that the person has a lock on his door or a solution to the problem that requires opening it.\n7. A: turn lock out of all the options given, seems the least likely action to take after getting the key. \n8. Pocket: it doesn't seem likely that after getting the key, he'd immediately put it in his pocket.\n9. Pocket the doors: the problem seems to relate to an impending closing of the door and not to pockets. \n10. Bike out and open doors are both actions that can either be related to turning the key or not. \n11. So, among all the options, the most plausible one is D: pocket. \n12.

Choices:\nin the best physical state B: always active C: grown adults D: able to handle problems E: able to protect themselves\nRationales:\n1. Start by analyzng the question: \"We must keep children safe from of the elements (nature like rain, snow, etc.) because they're not the best physical state.\" \n2. From reading the question, we can see that the author is concerned about children falling victim to bad weather outside, so we start by looking for a word that indicates the condition of being in harm's way due to elements.\n3. Then, we look for the phrase \"the elements.\" The element is a general term, meaning weather phenomena, which suggests they are outside of the given options, which are in reference to the conditions of body.\n4. Also, it is important to note that there are two possible answers: B: always active and E: able to protect themself.\n5. B: always active means to be physically active or dynamic, which is not necessarily a negative thing, but it is not directly related to what the question specifically asks us to find.\n6. E: able to protect their self indicates that there is a degree of self sufficiency, and not reliance on others.\n7. So in order to find a strong conclusion, we look for the answer that relates the children to protection.\n8. Finally, D: vulnerable/helpless could work as an answer, however it is a general term that could also be used to describe any other category of children in danger.\n9. It may not be appropriate for a broad statement about keeping children'safe from elements' because it may generalize to include children other than those in danger.\n10. Therefor the best answer to find is E: able to protect yourself.\n\nAnswer: E: able to protect yourselves\n\nInput", "answer": "B: pantry"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, and open doors.\n5. We can eliminate turns lock because the question doesn't tell us he needs to turn it, and solution to problem is also an out of place option because it would imply that he had a problem and a solution to it, whereas the question only tells us that he was prepared to leave the area.\n6. The remaining options are: pocket and open doors.\n7. We know that he has his key, so unless he has another key for some type of lock, the likely inference is that he wants to use his key for something. \n8. Pocket is a possible option, but it does not match with the context and given information. It is not practical to think that he would want to put his key in his pocket when he is leaving. When he is leaving, more likely he wants to leave as quickly as possible.\n9. Open doors is a logical choice because it suggests that he can use his key to unlock a door. \n10. Therefore, as the only option in the given choices which matches with the context and given statements, the answer is E; open the door.\nAnswer: E : open door\n\nInput: You got to the corner after being at the market for hours.  They have what at every corner? Choices:  M A: sigh B: bicycle C: phone D: fruits E: stop sign\nRationales: The question first tells us that they have stop signs at every corner. This is a clue that they do not exist at our corner, but this hasn't been stated yet.\n1.'sigh' does not make much sense at the given location. It is more of an emotional reaction that is likely to be related to unsuccessful events.\n2. 'bicycle' probably means a bicycle stand that can hold bicycles stationery. This is plausible, especially when people park their bicycles and look for something in the markets. \n3. The given locations are different in different contexts, and might or might not be valid. In our case, they do not match with this situation.\n4. 'phone' is possible, but the question does not tell us their phone numbers. So, the use of 'phone' is only speculative.\n5. The only choice that could possibly make sense is 'fruits'. \nHence,", "answer": "C: control children"}

Therefore, since the answer includes the action 'getting out his key' in the answer, we should choose a choice that makes sense with the context; it would most likely be B: pocket.\n7. Then he began to open the lock on his bike, using his key.\n8. The answer is E: open doors.\nAnswer: E open doors\n\nInput: If you are lost in a strange city, ask a passerby for directions, not the police. They won't what? Choices: A: help B: know C: know the law D: know the area E: think you are lost F: think you are being mugged\nRationales: The first thing we need to note is that option B: know is superfluous. As we know from the second line of the question \u201cthey won't know the law\u201d it is assumed that we are asking a passerby and not the police. The only reason we\u2019d bring up knowing how you feel is if it might directly impact their understanding of where your directional problem is.\n\nThe only options that really require a deeper interpretation are C: know the area and E: think you are mugged. Option C: know the area is ruled out by definition in option B: know the law. This means the remaining option \u201cE: think you are being robbed\u201d needs to be evaluated. \n\nLet\u2019s first consider what the first clue in the question (\u201cask a passerby for directions\u201d) suggests. A passerby in most cities is just as likely, if not more likely, to be another tourist, as a local. Since most tourists are not necessarily looking for directions to specific places but rather how to get around in general, it seems likely they would give the correct answer in that situation. It goes on to give a clue that what you might be doing is unusual (\u201clost in a strange city\u201d). The passerby is more likely to find you unusual than think you\u2019re being mugged, particularly since the second clue (\u201ca stranger\u201d) further defines the passerby\u2019s lack of familiarity and that your intent is to find directions and not get arrested.\n\nHence we can see the answer", "answer": "C: clerk"}

A few options would be specific and applicable in the given context: \"learn\" and \"prepare\". \"learn\" could mean prepare yourself for an upcoming event, such as a speech or exam, while \"prepare\" could mean physically preparing for a task by gathering supplies or gathering materials to prepare for a certain task.\nAs only one option relates to specific preparation, we should conclude that \"prepare\" is the correct option.\nRationales: After understanding the question, we determine that the option \"live comfortably\", when analyzed according to the given statement, \"the two siblings who were about to fight, but decided to live comfortably\", it would appear that the options \"live\" indicates that the siblings will live together while \"comfortable\" indicates that they will enjoy living together.\nBecause the option is either a single word or a phrase, we can use the same reasoning to conclude that the two options are correct based on what the statement would imply.\nOption A: \"live comfortably\"\nOption B: \"live comfortably\".\nOption C: \"live comfortably, and work as a team\"\nOption D: \"live comfortably until their parents died and took over\"\nOption E: \"live comfortably as they work toward becoming doctors\"\nAs the siblings would likely still live or continue living together after", "answer": "C: anger"}

Why? B: Aggie Ann C: Aaggie D: Agg E: Aggie\nRationales:  1. The question starts by giving us some specific information about a friend.\n2. The friend is the mother of a 'good' child.\n3. A good/moral quality of a child that is mentioned several times is its \"goodness\".\n4. This is followed by: \"Her name is who?\" which is the key for cracking the question.\n5. The options given are: \"I think A: Ann, who's her own mother.\" which is the name the question itself provides, or \"Why? B: Agggie Ann\", which is not at all logical.\n6. C: \"Aggie\" is the most likely option because it is grammatically correct.\n7. D:\"Agg E\" has nothing to do with \"Aggie Ann\" nor does it make grammatical sense.\n8. E: \"Aggie Ann\".

This means that the local children have been known to steal from people for some time, and probably from visitors.\n2.

'Pocket' or 'picked pocket' are possible solutions to the problem, but they are also unlikely since the person would not be able to unlock the door if his key is in his pocket or if he picked someone's pocket.\n8. Thus 'pocket' doesn't convey the required information.\n9. The other choice is'solution to problem,' which suggests the solution is to open doors. \n10. 'Turn lock' is another choice which can be considered for this interpretation, but it does not mean to actually unlock a door.\n11. Lastly, 'open doors' is the only choice that answers both the actions of getting out the key; opening the door.\n12. Therefore, the best answer is E: open doors.\nAnswer: E. open doors\n\nInput: Do you want to hear the good news? It can't be that bad, they're all what? Choices: a: dead, b: in prison, c: lost, d: gone, e: dying\nRationales:  1. Here, the speaker uses an expression 'They can't be that' bad to suggest that whatever the other person is feeling is not bad enough to merit the listener's sympathy.\n2. Hence, we must understand the speaker to be talking about the other person who is feeling bad; 'They' are the speaker's viewpoint of the other person.\n3. As a result, their 'they' must also be pronouns of personal experience.\n4. So, the pronouns 'dead', 'in prison', 'lost', 'gone', or 'dying' are potential options.\n5. The first three options are common past tenses of pronouns, indicating an individual has already experienced these particular events.\n6. This implies that these events are not very harmful, since it means the person is at peace after experiencing the events.\n7. The last three options are also unlikely as the speaker is talking about the other person.", "answer": "D: having fun"}
{"text": ", pocket and open doors, all of which suggest unlocking.\n5. Unlocking is different from opening a door. He is ready (already unlocked the lock), he has the key (got it), and he is about to bike home (do something), so the action is turning the lock.\n6. He is ready to bike home because he has all the materials necessary to do so.\n7. The given choices cannot tell anything about the materials that he has, and he is not ready to go because he doesn't have something yet (in this case, his bike).\n8. Thus, the answer choice is C: beginning to turn lock. \n9. Answer: C: beginning to turn key\n\nInput: It was almost time for school and Sarah was getting ready.  She checked herself in the mirror, then what?\nChoices:  A: walked B: checked out C: drove D: brushed hair E: combed hair\nRationales: This question is similar to the last three questions, except that it has four options, not five.\n1. The given sentence tells us about the timing.\n2. Sarah is getting ready; she checks herself in the mirror and then something follows.\n3. We know that there is only one action that precedes checking. \n4. Out of the given options, checking herself (walking, checking out and driving) do not come before checking herself. \n5. Brushing hair (combing hair); check the options again. Do they have anything to do with checking hair? \n6. Checking out (walking, brushing hair, driving). Sarah checks herself out before checking herself in the mirror.\n7. Now, checking herself out does not necessarily mean driving; checking herself out could mean checking out on her appearance. \n8. Therefore, the answer that makes the most sense in the context of the sentence is \"combing hair or checking her appearance\".\n9.

{"text": ", solution to problem, pocket, open doors, and pocket.\n5. The terms \"turn\" and \"open\" refer to actions that include movement, and \"pocket\" does not necessarily suggest opening the pocket.\n6. From these, we could rule out turn lock and open doors.\n7. Of the remaining choices, solution to problem is an example of what he could be doing with his key, but it does not directly involve unlocking a bike or anything having to do with biking.\n8. Pocket is also possible, it is something that he can do with the key and the question does not limit this. But then you get to the line: \"He opened the bike gate from the other side, then got on the bicycle and locked the gate again.\" It is more likely that he is using the key to unlock his bike gate and not his pocket. This also follows the common association that bike locks are placed on bike racks.\n9. The sentence after that does not make it clear what he is doing with his key, however, this can be used to disregard solution to problem and pocket, as they were never relevant in the conversation.\n10. This leaves us with A: turn lock and D: pocket. \n11. Out of these two only turning lock is relevant to the task, which means that the key is used to unlock something for a particular reason, this reason can be deducted as bike in this case.\n12. So, the answer to the question, \"He was ready to bike what?\" is A: turn lock.\nAnswer: A turning lock\n\nInput: The teacher noticed his students are becoming tired, they're losing focus. He decided to use what action? Choices: 1. A: more repetition 2. B: short rest break 3. C: less noise 4. D: better presentation 5. E: more structure 6. F: more variety\nRationales: -1. Consider what the teacher is doing. The question asks for what action. This usually refers to someone taking an action, rather than something someone is not doing.\n-2. Among the given options,'more repetition' implies doing the same thing at the same rate, for longer. \n-3. 'less noise' implies doing something less. \n-4.

'Turn lock' and'solve the problem' imply a solution that has not been implemented as yet - which does not match the information provided by the question.\n6. 'Pocket' means to place the key inside a pocket and is unrelated to either the bike or the door. \n7. We remain with the final option - open door, which implies using the key to unleash the lock of the door. \n8. Hence, in the given context, he opened the door with his key.\n9. The answer is therefore C: key.\nAnswer: C :key\n\nInput: He is a nice person and he always does what? Choices: A: make friends B: listen C: speak D: read E: write\nRationales: The question informs us that he is nice and he always do/s something. \n\n1. The question does not mention 'what', but rather, 'he always does this'. \n\n2. In the options, B: listen: sounds good because people can easily be friends with people they know. \n\n3. Option B also has the quality of 'listening' but it is not necessarily'making friends'. \n\n4. In this option,'making friends' would be done as a result of listening.\n\n5. Furthermore, the options D: read and E: write mention reading and writing, which are skills, not actions. The given description of the nice person is more specific as he is someone who always does something, implying him to do an action.\n\n6. Therefore, the action that he always does is making friends.\n\n7. The answer, therefore, is A: make friends. \n\nAnswer:  A: make friends\n\nInput: Which of the following is the same as a word? Choices: A set B group C set of words D vocabulary E all\nRationales:\n\n1. The first sentence describes a'set', a noun, describing a word.\n\n2.

{"text": ", pocket, solve problem, opens doors, and pocket.\n5. Turn Lock is ruled out because it is not a verb, which is what is most likely required here.\n6. 'Pocket' by itself just means that he placed his key on or in his pocket, which is too general.\n7. 'Solution to problem' is another option but does not specifically describe what he is doing in the process of using the key to open the door.\n8. 'Opens doors' is ruled out for the same reason. \n9. 'Pocket' is an option by itself but does not tell us what he did specifically with the key before proceeding.\n10. Hence, the answer that best fits into all the above considerations and explanations is C: pocket because it conveys just the right connotation, and provides specific information in describing the entire action of using a key to open a door.\nAnswer: C. Pocket.\n\nInput: The dog needed to be rescued, so the owner started what? Choices: A: rescue him B: hug him C: treat him D: cuddle him E: pick him up\nRationales:1. The owner of the dog needed to rescue it.\n2. Rescuing means to save/help someone or something to be alive or from harm.\n3. Out the options, D: cuddling him can mean, but doesn't necessarily imply, rescuing.\n4. Therefore, the most likely option is A: rescue him.\n5.

The given options are: 'they prefer each other's', 'they are loners', 'they keep each other safe', 'they enjoy having someone to trust', 'they are protective'.\n2. Some crabs prefer others' company, but this does not explain why it always happens that these crabs stay together.\n3.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, and open doors.\n5. 'Turn lock' and 'open doors' suggest the use of the key, but the action of turning a lock would be completed after unlocking the door and opening the door itself with the key.\n6. Hence, out of the given options, 'open doors' and 'turn lock' are incorrect and can be disregarded.\n7. 'Pocket' is also incorrect as it doesn't relate to the starting action of unlocking a door.\n8. Hence, the given options narrow down to'solution' and 'to problem'.\n9.'solution to problem' is a plausible choice because it explains the meaning of'solution'.\n10. 'To problem', however, leaves us guessing about what he was trying to resolve at this point in time.\n11. Hence, out of all the correct choices, it would be logical to eliminate 'To problem'.\n12. The remaining choice'solution to problem', describes what the person was trying to do before leaving, and is therefore a suitable option.\n13. The solution to problem is likely finding the right key or opening the lock.\n14. Therefore, the correct answer is: 'to do'.\nAnswer: E: to do\n\nInput: We see this a lot of late: the answer to a question is always B: what?  Which leads to a what?

The statement after the question indicates 'We see this a lot of...'. \n3. This indicates the person is talking about something that happens frequently.\n4. If the problem is a 'plan', then we don't see why people would always be suggesting plans.\n\nThe question part:\n\n5. Which leads to a...

{"text": ", pocket, and open doors. If he chose to turn the key because he wanted to open the lock, it wouldn't be logical.\n5. If he chose to pocket it, this would contradict the given statement (he would not have done everything he needs to before).\n6. Finally, the given choices could be chosen to open a lock only, however, it's unlikely that this is the full extent of opening doors that's needed.\n7. Thus A: turn lock is the incorrect answer.\n8. B: pocket is incorrect because it does not mean opening a lock.\n9. D: pocket is incorrect because a key is generally used for opening a lock.\n10. Therefore, the answer must be C: open doors, because it is a plausible combination of the statement and the question.\n11. The action of pocketing a key does not exclude the act of opening a lock because pocketing a key might have been done in preparation for further opening activity related to locks.\n12. However, when the key was pulled out of the pocket and held it, the user will need to open a lock.\n13. So, opening doors with a key is not only logical, but also in line with the way the key would have been used.\n14. Hence, B: open doors is correct.\nAnswer: B. open doors\n\nInput: She's tired, I know because she yawns when she walks.  I want to invite her for a night of what? Choices A: strolling B: sleeping C: relaxing D: hiking E: resting\nRationales: First, let's interpret the question for context.\n1. The question begins by describing a subject (she) as being tired.\n2. The sentence in the statement follows directly after, stating that she is displaying a specific behavior (a yawn when she walks).\n3. The question then tells us what the writer wants to do with the tired subject.\n4. Out all the responses given, C: relaxing is the best option because resting is similar to sleeping but it can coexist with being awake.\n5. This implies that the subject can do these things concurrently, and therefore it is a plausibly option.\n6. The other responses given do not involve the full spectrum of activities done when tired.

Turn lock: \"turn\" does not directly translate to the act of the key unlocking the bikey. The statement only shows that he turned the lock, not that he unlocked the bike.\n7. Pocket: the question does not refer to \"pocket\" as the action performed by the key. \n8. Solution to problem: the key could be used to unlock the bike; however, not all keys would be able to open every lock. Therefore, this is not relevant to this particular question.\n9. Pocket: this choice refers to putting something into a pocket. This is not relevant or specific to the key.\n10. The remaining choice is open doors. \"Open door\" is the best option to conclude the question. \n11. This choice also directly relates to the action of the key, as it would be used to unlock or open doors.\n12. So, the action of the key to begin unlocking would be: \"open doors\".\n13. Therefore, the answer to the question is \"open doors\".\nAnswer: B: open doors\n\nInput: They had to go to the bank today and they had to get a loan, so they went to a new bank, this new bank doesn't have what? Choices: A: security, B: much traffic, C: large lines, D: the newest machines\nRationales:1. They had to go to a bank to borrow some money. \n2. They probably did not want to go to an old bank because there was already a reason why they were leaving their own bank.\n3. A: Security - This choice does not specify \"the newest machines\".\n4. B: much traffic - This choice does not relate directly to the security of the bank. We can assume that a new bank with traffic issues such as long lines may have security issues too, however, the given context specifies that they just want to get a loan.\n5. C: large lines - This choice does not specifically mention \"the newest machines\", and \"the newest\" implies they are the latest or newest models.\n6. So the answer is \"B: the newest machines\"", "answer": "E: might dream"}

Therefore: A: turn lock, B: open door and pocket can all be eliminated.\n7. Option D: solution to problem does not provide a correct answer. 'Solution' may refer to the key itself but does not provide a clue as to what the person was solving.\n8. Hence: C: open door.\n9. Finally, out of all the remaining options, biking or some form of travel home requires the opening of a door, but biking home is a bit convoluted.\n10. Therefore, the best option is: C: open door as it is a direct and logical next step to bike home. \nAnswer: C: open door\n\nInput: Which of the following would result in more accurate results at a test? Choices:  Hint: it's about having a specific idea in mind when solving problems. A: Doing random guesses B: Studying what others have said C: Relying on trial and error D: Experimenting different things E: Using previous knowledge\nRationales: Start by analyzing the context provided by the question. 'Which would result in more accurate findings?', indicates more accuracy as opposed to less accuracy.\nHence the word 'increase', which can be found in all of the given options can be eliminated.\nIt can also be determined here that 'accuracy of findings' refers to the amount of correct results at any given test.  Out of all the given options, the only ones that offer a clear concept of the concept of accuracy regarding the results of a test are option A: 'Doing random guesses' and option E: 'Using previous knowledge'. \nBoth provide more accuracy in findings, but using previous knowledge is preferred as it offers more concrete results over random guessing. \nHence, the answer is E using previous knowledge.\nAnswer: C using previous knowledge\n\nInput: It is good to be with your friends on a snowy day.

{"text": ", open doors, and solution to problem are all related to using a key to open a lock; however, \"turn lock\" is not a specific description which leaves out B: pocket and D: pocket. \n5. Out of A: turn lock and E: open doors, we can eliminate E: open doors, as it is not a specific description of the opening of a lock.\n6. This further leaves D: pocket because in the given statement, the option A: turn lock is already eliminated. \n7. Hence, A: turn lock is the most appropriate description for this statement. \n8. Thus, the answer to this question is A: turn key.\nAnswer: A. He was ready to bikey home.\n\nInput: The tiger was not angry,  he was very what? Choices: hungry thirsty tired restless irritable mad\nRationales: The given statement suggests that the tiger was not angry.\n1. \"Hungry\" and \"thirsty\" are not necessarily negative emotions, which can make them difficult to connect with the concept of anger.\n2. \"Tired\" can still be neutral in that it could imply that the tiger has been through a lot, but is not necessarily in a state of anger.\n3. \"Restless\" or \"irritable\" could be interpreted as anger, but they could also just indicate that the tiger is feeling agitated or uncomfortable in general.\n4. Finally, \"mad\" can describe a state of anger, but it could also indicate that the tiger has other mental issues in addition to anger.\n5. Therefore it is likely that the given statement is not referring to actual anger, but rather describing the tiger as relaxed, calm, or peaceful.\n6. Since \"mad\" implies anger but in a more extreme way, it is logical to determine that the tiger was probably resting, or otherwise not angry.\n7. Hence the answer is: E Mad\nAnwer: The Tiger was Mad\n\nInput: A spade is the object of choice to dig a whole in the garden. What is used to dig a hole is called?

Therefore the choices are C: pocket and D.pocket and the answer is D: pocket.\n\nThere is no explicit mention of opening or unlocking anything, and the action is performed with a key rather than a lockpick, so it is not likely that the person was preparing to break into a nearby building to use its bathroom or to access the locks to find something hidden there.\n8. So, the answer for the above instruction is D: pocket. \nAnswer: D: pocket\n\nInput: What is a word with more than two letter that doesn't have a vowel? Choices: \n A: vow B: consonant C: word D: letter E: word\nRationales:\n1. First, let's take a look at the given options. The term 'vow' stands for vowel, as it has a vowel in it.\n2. Vowel is a consonant sound, the opposite of consonant is vowel.\n3. The terms word and letter can be considered to be a type of vowel.\n4. So, only 'consonant' does not have a vowel in it, but consonant is a broader term, so there are possibilities where consonant may have vowels or consonants without vowels in it.\n5. There are 'v' and 'w' in consonant. Thus, 'consonant' is not correct option.\n6. Now looking at the options that have consonants in it and don't have a vowels in it: 'vow' has a vowel in 'vow'. Also, there are options which have a vowel A: vow B vow, and E: word.\n7. Looking at the first option, Vow does not have a consonant, which is the opposite of consonants.\n8.

This makes turn lock and solution to problem unlikely, since the key is not used for either of those.\n7. Pocket is also not a suitable choice because it doesn't include details about when or how he put the key in his pocket.\n8. Therefore, the answer choices that are most consistent with the given details are B: pocket and D: pocket. \n9. Pocket includes the verb 'put', which indicates he is storing the key until he is ready for the next step of his task. \n10. Meanwhile D: pocket gives the addition of 'open' which tells us that he then immediately does something with the key, namely open doors by using it.\n\nAnswer: 'B: pocket' and 'D: pocket'.\n\nInput: The girl who hugs strangers is happy and kind.  What makes her that way? Choices:  Happiness, Being Kind Strong Feelings, Blessed\nRationales: The question asks for what makes her happy and kind.\nWe understand that:\n1. the girl was talking about someone who hugs strangers.\n2. in general, strangers typically do not have strong feelings for each other, which leaves us to interpret the statement in a less literal manner. \n3. we assume it is about someone who is known to the speaker and not necessarily to us as the reader. \n4. this question is to determine what makes her happy and nice.\n5. out of the options given,\n6. none of the given options match the context and specifics of the question except for Strong Feelings.\n7. a person can be happy and nice for many reasons: Being kind, Strong Feelings and Blessed.\n\nAnswer:\nWe find this to be a tricky question, because we know that not all people who are nice, are also happy.\nHere, we can interpret the girl's statement to mean that whatever makes this girl happy is what makes her nice.\nThis is why 'Strong Feelings' is the best choice as it can explain how one can be kind by implying they may be happy, by also having a warm disposition towards others, resulting in her being nice.", "answer": "A: new experiences"}

The question was not asking for what he put in his pocket.\n6. Similarly, solution to problem does not suggest the action of lock opening.\n7. Finally, open door does not suggest the action that was actually performed by the person. \n8. We eliminate all of the above choices, and get the answer to D: open doors.\nAnswer: D Open doors\n\nInput: My mom told me to clean my room, then I cleaned it and I was a happy camper, what did my mom say was what I did? Choices: 1. cleaned 2. happy 3. did what I wanted 4. make bed 5. make my room nice 6. organized C: clean Clean\nRationales: First of all, we understand from the statement that the mom told the person to clean their room, and then, we see that the person cleaned their room.\n7. They were happy about it, and the word clean in the question is what did my mom say I did.\n8. The question is asking about the action done by the person.\n9. In such a case, we conclude that the action \"cleaning\" is done by the person. So, the correct answer option is C: Clean.\n10. Hence, the answer choice is C: Clean\n\nInput: I got home at 4:00 in the afternoon, we sat down at 5:00 to have dinner together, when we finished having dinner I told my family that I was leaving early the next morning for the job, what time did I leave for work?

'Open doors' also sounds reasonable, but the wording isn't as specific as 'turn lock'.\n7. So, we can rule out the other two choices. \n8. In a situation like this, if he has a key to open the lock, he is probably trying to get into a house, which means he most likely has to 'pocket' the key or hold onto it in order to begin the next process of opening the lock.\n9. Therefore, the answer must be either 'A: turn lock' or 'A: pocket'.\n10. For the choice 'pocket', it is unclear whether the pocket is his personal pocket or a pocket to keep the key in that is near the front door of the dwelling. Therefore, the correct solution to the problem is by 'turn lock', so the answer is A: turn lock.\nAnswer: A/B: turn lock\n\nInput: In many cultures, the sun and its power is what type of animal or object?

Out of these options, we should first eliminate the word 'rainbow', which doesn\u2019t relate in any way to the statement that the sun is associated with an animal or object, and we can also eliminate the option C: cloud which refers to only a specific cloud, and we can eliminate option Rainbow.\n4. Then as the question asks to select the correct answer among these 5 options, we should consider the options in a way that the answer should be directly related to the given statement.\n5.

Pocket is a likely choice for the bike owner due to the context in which it is presented, but it is also a plausible choice for the thief since it is commonly used for hiding stolen items. \n8. Therefore, the only remaining choices that directly address the situation are D: pocket and E: open doors; however, E: open doors is less likely due to the implication that he's going to take his keys out of his pocket to open a door.\n9.

Choices: A: valuable B: important C: meaningful D: useful E: funny\nRationales: The question starts off by stating that the narrator was told by her mother to never throw away notes. It is clear through context clues, that these notes could be letters, cards, or even junk notes, so the narrator should never throw them away.\nThe narrator is then told that the notes with 'good information' are what the mother wants to keep. The mother then says to throw away the junk notes.\nIt is important to understand that the mother wanted to keep the notes with good information is because these are valuable and useful and help the mother in some way.\nFrom here, it is evident that 'valuable' is the best option that the narrator could have taken from her mother's instructions.\nOption D: good could be taken as valuable, however, good doesn't necessarily have the same definition as valuable in this case. We see that 'valuable' and 'good' can be swapped out because the narrator said it wasn't important for the note to be good if it isn't junk.\nOption B, important, is also plausible however, the mother says you should not keep 'notes with good information' you should keep 'important notes with good information' which implies that valuable isn't just any information but that its important information.\nThe narrator said that notes with just junk information are what to throw away, so if this is so then the mother could be specifically referring to junk which is not valuable or even very useful.\nOption C, meaningful, is also an option however, this option could also be used", "answer": "C: income"}
{"text": ", pocket, pocket, and open doors. \n5. We disregard the two choices that are related to pockets. \n6. The given options imply that you are either searching for a key with a lock or unlocking a door. \n7. Since he started opening his key, 'open doors' and 'turn lock' are not relevant.\n8. Looking at the remaining choices, the term that best matches the action of the sentence is \"begin to open\". \n9. 'Bikey home', in a sentence like this, is a redundant phrase and can be substituted with \"biking home\".\n10. Then, we also realize that choosing 'Open doors' can leave the sentence awkward and incomplete. \n11. Therefore, 'Begin to open' is the answer to the question.\nAnswer: C : Begin to open\n\nInput: He had a very difficult life, he overcame it by doing what? Choices: A: talking about it B: drinking C: fighting D: taking action E: thinking\nRationales: All of the following answers are acceptable.\n1. He had a difficult life, but he struggled and persisted by doing what we are asked to choose.\n2. The key to determining the best answer is to analyze whether the given choices describe actions which overcame hardship or not.\n3. A: He talked about it a lot, it may have led to more people understanding his difficulties.\n4. However, \"talk about\" is insufficient in overcoming a problem in life.\n5. B: He drank too much when faced with obstacles, which made him irrational. \n6. So, drinking is not necessarily a solution to the problem.\n7. C: \"Fight\" is used as a synonym for \"overcome\" which is contradictory to our statement. \n8. Focusing on the literal definition of the verb \"overcame\" provides a different perspective. \"Fight\" is a word that has a physical meaning and refers to physical fighting rather than mental or emotional struggles. So, this is an incorrect answer. \n9. D: He chose to do more actions.\n10. The sentence does not explain what actions he chose to do, so it is ambiguous. It's possible that the actions he took were actually not", "answer": "B: have fun"}
{"text": ", pocket, pocket, open doors. \n5. 'Turn lock' cannot be the answer, because a key can only apply to unlock a certain door or door object, whereas here, the key relates to an unspecified lock - \"lock\" is an ambiguous term here. \n6. Similarly, we eliminate 'picked pocket' as a very specific term and not relevant here.\n7. 'Pocket' and 'open doors' can both seem appropriate, however, when we consider the question fully, 'open doors' would not necessarily require a key, since we do not know what the key refers to in relation to the bike home.\n8. This leaves us with 'picked pocket' and 'pocket'.\n9. The first choice, however, doesn't make sense in light of the context of the question - since the person has already done what is necessary to leave and has the key out, it makes most sense that they pick or unlock their bike.\n10. Therefore, the answer to the question is 'pocket'.\nAnswer: B: pocket\n\nInput: This is a very difficult question, what does this sentence mean? Choices A: This is an incorrect question B: This is a false question C: This is an easy question D: This is a complicated question E: This is a very hard question\nRationales: Read the sentence from left to right to figure out which words are key to understanding the sentence. Choices \"This\" and \"question\" will not be used to determine the type of question.\nAs the sentence breaks into four pieces (the \"and\" in the sentence separating these two halves), start by identifying which words in each of these halves are important to the meaning.\n\n1. The first piece uses words \"if\" and \"this\". \"If\" introduces a condition, \"this\" is the condition.\n2. Thus the second half contains \"This\" and \"is\". \"Is\" is a verb, and will need to be modified by an adjective to fit properly in a sentence.\n3. Therefore, to correctly answer this question, the verb needs to be modified by an appropriate verb.\n4. Next, the sentence breaks in half at the \"and\" mark. The third piece contains the word \"difficult\" and the first half contains the word \"question\".\n5. By removing letters to leave the word remaining", "answer": "B: fast food restaurant"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. If it were about opening a lock, we would expect to see the term 'turn key'.\n6. So, B: pocket makes the most sense as an option. \n7. Pocketing the key suggests that he is preparing to go by bike, and this also means that he is getting ready to \"lock\" something, such as his bike.\n8. So, the answer choice is B: pocket.\nAnswer: B : pocket\n\nInput: \"I'll be able to see you next week.\"  \"That's terrific news, we are excited to meet you.\"  I will meet her in what? Choices: A: one week B: two weeks C: one month D: two months E: a week\nRationales: The question tells us that the speaker said \"I'll be back next week.\"\n\nNext we interpret the answer choices.\n\nA: one week is incorrect because the speaker said \"next week\".\n\nB: two weeks is incorrect because the speaker only said \"next week\".  \n\nD: two months is incorrect because the speaker just said \"next week\", so they can't mean \"one week\" or \"one month\".  \n\nE: one week is correct because the speaker said: \n\"I'll be able see you next week.\"   \n\nSo the answer choice is E: next week.  \n\nAnswer: A: A.\n\nInput: \"The woman was so annoying.

{"text": ", pocket, pocket solution to problem, open doors. \n5. The word \"solution\" does not mean the same as key, so we eliminate C: pocket solution to problem.\n6.

Choices: A: compassion B: calm C: composure D: kindness E: courage\nRationales: The given sentence tells us that someone has extinguished the fire in their home. If this is true, there won't be a pandemonium. But there must be something in the past to cause such a pandemonium, for instance, the fire. This means the fire in the house, caused a pandemonium in the end. To reduce all this damage, people need something in contrast, to calm the pandemonium, which must be positive, something that'll help people to be calmed down.\n\n(A) compassion: this emotion is very soft, which means it's not a suitable emotion to calm down a pandemonium after all the damage.\n\n(B) calm: calm is a state of having no energy at all or being peaceful. It is also used to describe weather conditions which are not extreme. These all means that calm people cannot be used to overcome a pandemonium as it's too hard-hitting to calm.\n\n(C) composure: this emotion is in between calm and compassion.

She can't really see him a lot right now,  but the few times she does, the time is really what? Choices: sweet A: sad B: happy C: uncomfortable D: exciting E: comfortable\nRationales:  1. We can already make sense of the statement by analyzing the question, \"Lana's grandfather\u2026\" with the knowledge that \"the few times she does\u2026\" is a phrase that describes the quality of the time spend with him.\n2. The given options are: A: sweet, B: happy, C: uncomfortabler D: exciting, E: comfortable.\n3. \"Sweet\" is an emotional response to being with someone, and an appropriate adjective to describe the time spent with someone close.\n4. The opposite of \"sweet\" is \"uncomfortable\", therefore the word \"uncomfortable\" cannot be the correct answer.\n5. \"Comfortable\" is a synonym for \"sweet\", thus the phrase \"time is really [comfortable]\" is meaningless. The word \"uncomfortabler\" is a synonym of uncomfortable. This implies that if grandfather is \"uncomfortableness\", the time \"grandfather\" shares with others cannot be \"sweet\". The only other option left is \"happy\", as it implies a positive association with the word \"grandfather\", and the only opposite is \"sad\". \"Happy\" is more appropriate for the feeling of being with a grandfather than \"sad\". \n6. Thus, \"happy\" is the correct answer because all options other than \"happy\" are inappropriate or meaningless.\nAnswer: D. happy\n\nInput: Why did she have so many buns?

Caf\u00e9'.\n1. Caf\u00e9 is the longest line.\n2. This is a factual question, so context is not needed here.\n3. B. Lobby is the shortest line.\n4. C. Gift Shop is the second shortest line and has been deemed longer than B. Lobby by the narrator.\n5. F. Snack Bar is the fourth shortest line.\n\n### Notes\n1. Do not try looking for an answer that does not make logical sense in the context of the question given. (context vs content related questions)\n2. Remember, the answer should be what the statement makes more logical: it is not up to you to decide which answer sounds more logical as this is not supported by facts.\n3.

Choices:  housing and planning council A: city council B: state orchestra C: county hall D: the department of education E: state orchestra\nRationales: Start by analyzing the statement, which informs us that his new home needs help.\n2. From there, we can see which options make the most sense, out of all the choices given.\n3. Housing and Planning Council (A), City Council (B), and County Hall (C) are all governmental organizations of a certain level.\n4. This means that they may be able to help find someone to move things on your behalf, or at least advise you on how to proceed.\n5. State Orchestra (D), the Department of Education (E), and the state orchestra all seem unrelated to the situation at hand.\n6. There are only four options, but, due to the specificity of the question, the most logical choice is B: city council.\nAnswer: B. city council\n\nInput: The young man had an hour to finish his reading.

To accomplish this, he needs to divide the amount by one hour.\n3. Doing so, we see that it is the number of segments that is more than the number of the hours, so logically speaking, the choice, B: three would be the most appropriate because you have a three in the question and a three in the answer.\n4. Also, D: seven because he just read three segments instead of ten segments.", "answer": "D: shopping malls"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. Choice A: \"turn the key\" is a plausibly wrong answer because even though the key's main function is to open, it's more likely the person would turn it than open the lock.\n6. Choice B: \"pocket\" means putting the key in one's pocket, but the question mentions a beginning, so it is likely that the action of getting out his key has already happened. \n7. Therefore, since all the remaining options relate to opening or unlocking something, Choice C: \"open doors\" should be disregarded.\n8. Likewise, Choice D: \"pocket\" should also be eradicated because it was already performed. This leaves us with Choice E: \"open doors\".\n9. Thus, based on the actions that have already happened, the person has gotten the key out, so it is logical for them to already have been at the doors, ready to open them.\n10. Hence, the answer must be Choice E: open doors.\nAnswer: E:\"open doors\"\n\nInput: What does a person wear in a hot season? Choices:  B: gloves E: socks C: long sleeves D: short sleeves F: sunscreen\nRationales: This question is meant to ask for a choice that someone may wear to protect themselves from heat.\nThe words long sleeves and short sleeves will help us eliminate D: short sleeve. This is because people in hot areas prefer long sleeve shirts over short sleeves.\nE: socks will also be eliminated as they are worn on the feet only and would be a poor choice for warm conditions.\nF: sunscreen will be eliminated as it is used to protect from sunburn which is different from the question at hand.\nThe key words in the question will help us eliminate the options B: gloves and C: long sleeve and leave us with E: socks or F: sunscreen.\nIt is unlikely that people would wear gloves in hot weather.\nThis narrows our final choices down to E: socks or sunscreen, but the latter is a better answer as the weather is likely to be hot and sunny in a hot season and since people would be outside more often, it makes sense for them", "answer": "B: ungulate"}
{"text": ", pocket, pocket, solution to problem, open doors. Out of these choices, opening doors is the only action directly relatable to the purpose of the key i.e. unlocking the door.\n5. However, turn lock is very ambiguous. Also, the remaining options of opening, pocket, solution to the problem, pocket are less plausible because they can be performed at anytime.\n6. Furthermore, pocket is repeated at the end making it redundant.\n7. Hence it is clear that he opened a door, which is the answer to the question.\nAnswer: E : open doors\n\nInput: How do you get a good nights sleep? Choices: 1. get more exercise 2. have a good diet 3. eat chocolate cake 4. drink herbal tea 5. be careful what you eat\nRationales: It helps to understand how questions and clues are structured to complete a multiple choice task. To get started, we should identify the question: \"How do you get a good sleep?\" and the clues: \"get more exercise\" \"have a good diet\" \"eat chocolate cake\" \"drink herbal tea\" \"careful what you eat.\"\n1. Consider the question, it is asking about methods of getting a good night's sleep.\n2. Then look at the clues, \"Get more exercise\" and \"Get more diet\" are both correct because they are things one should do to get a good night's rest.\n3. The phrase \"Get more chocolate cake,\" does not fit in the question since it is not about nutrition.\n4. Herbal tea is relevant to the question, as it is about nutrition. The phrase \"be careful what you eat,\" is too vague to be considered a method for getting a good night' sleep.\n5. Therefore the answers D and E are more plausible to be correct, both indicating correct nutrition. The answer A is correct because it is a clich\u00e9 statement which cannot be used as an actual method.\n6. The answers D and E are both close to each other, but D is more specific and gives more insight into what nutrition can do to affect sleep.\n7. So the answer to the question is D.\nAnswer: D\n\nInput:  What is the best choice to make in", "answer": "A: tie shoelace"}

Therefore the two remaining choices to consider are 'find solution to problem' and 'pocket'.\n7. 'Find solution to problem' refers to a potential problem/issue while being on the way, i.e., before he arrives at his destination. If he arrives before finding the solution, he will have an unresolved problem.\n8. Therefore, 'pocket' refers to picking up or saving his keys safely as he is ready to bike home - the keys are essential to unlock the door to the house or bike when he is ready to go.\n9. Therefore, the answer 'pocket' is the most plausible choice.\nAnswer: A\n\nInput: I like the red car, they make you very relaxed, what else makes you relaxed? Choices:  M: food B: exercise C: travel D: wine E: music\nRationales: First we understand the red car is pleasant to look at.\nSecond, we understand the car is making you relaxed for the sake of this question.\nNext, we understand, you like the red car more than other cars because of relaxation they offer you.\nSo, from the question, we understand that red car is pleasant to view which makes you relaxed, to compare with other red cars.\nIn these choices, they are all other activities that can make you relaxed also.\nWe don't know only why you like red car more.\nBecause you choose it for it to be relaxing.\nSo, we need to understand, what is relaxing other than choice M - the red car, is it a different car or red car makes you relaxed.\n\nAnswer: B - It is exercise.\n\nInput: I would like a coffee but I don't want a cappuccino, I want  what else?

If black and regular coffee, is equivalent, then regular comes to my mind and M is incorrect.", "answer": "E: street"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, and open doors.\n5. Out of the given options, turning a lock is not logical because he has the key to his lock and the wording \"picked his lock\" appears later in the text. This suggests that he is already unlocked. Therefore, this option can be ruled out.\n6. The options pocket, solution to problem and open doors aren't very helpful or logical.\n7. This leaves D: pocket. This one has a chance of being correct.\n8. Later in the text, it tells us he took the key out and then began to work on his bicycle.\n9. So, the most logical answer would be: A: turn lock.\n10. Then, it turns out that the answer was D: pocket.\n11. This could lead people to start thinking that D: pocket is more likely than A: turn lock. \n12. But we can see how the two words \"turn lock\" are more plausible and correct than any other option.\n13. So, the correct answer is A: turn lock, as this best answers the question.\nAnswer: A - Turn lock\n\nInput: Which is the most important type of intelligence?

The options given are emotional, logical, creative, psychic and physical. \n3. Among the given choices, emotional and logical refer to different dimensions of intelligence that have nothing to do with physical intelligence.\n4. Psychic as a type of intelligence does not make sense in the context of the question since it is a more recent term. Also, physical intelligence does not seem to be a type of intelligence as it is a skill or something learned.\n5.

From the context of the question, we infer that the choices A and B should be eliminated as they do not make sense in the given context.\n6. A: turn lock is out of context from the way the key could be used, as it does not imply the action of opening a door.\n7. B: pocket is a more general term for keeping or storing an item, which does not imply any action with the key.\n8. C: solution to problem is a vague and improbable term, the key doesn't imply solving a problem when used to lock a bike.\n9. D: open doors directly implies the action of unlocking and using a key to enter a building or door.\n10. This leaves us with E: open doors, which is a most likely choice for the question.\n11. Opening the door is an action for bike locks, and the question provides evidence that the person has everything else ready to leave, implying the action of opening the lock.\n12. Therefore, the answer to this question is E: open doors.\nAnswer: E. open doors\n\nInput: The person didn't like it when the dog ate the toys, but she realized that the dog was what?

First, some items that we can eliminate out of necessity:  A: smart, because it does not align with the context of the story.  B, curious and C. The term 'Funny' fits the context of the sentence much better, so we keep that one. D: cute, since the word 'cute' is not directly relevant to this question or the context of it. E: happy, because we do not know if the pet is truly happy, or simply tolerating its owner.  Here are the remaining selections: A: Curious and B: Hungry.

This is a choice that can be a reasonable choice, however, it doesn't tell us whether he is putting the key in his pocket.\n8. Finally, the given choices include Open door, and this also does not specifically explain which process the person was doing.\n9.

Therefore, answer C: She expected that is not the correct answer.\n3. We also use common-knowledge reasoning to support that she likely isn't accustom to that, as being from and east doesn't mean she is familiar with the local climate that she is visiting.\n4. We find only one answer: She isn't.\n5. She isn't is the correct answer as it directly states what we know about her familiarity with that climate, eliminating the other two possible answers.\n\n6. Answer: She isn't\n\nInput: His job allows him to get up early, so he has the luxury of a what time? Choices:  Anything after 11AM All the time 1 2 3 4 5 6", "answer": "E: anger"}
{"text": ", pocket, and open doors. To understand this more, look into what opening a lock refers to; if he was trying to turn a lock. It is logical that he was opening a lock, which means he's trying to unlock his bike.\n5. However, we also find out that he got out his key. If he already has his key, it means that he has the bicycle locked, thus 'turn lock' cannot be his next action.\n6. We also know that he has done everything he needed to do before he leaves. He would not be getting out his key if he was not prepared to unlock the bicycle. Also, 'open doors' does not refer to anything related to his bike.\n7. So, only one of the options is plausible. As the question tells us he was'ready to bike home', the option that logically makes the most sense is 'open door': 'turn lock' and 'pocket' do not offer an explanation. The choice 'open door' simply fits the situation and the context of the question\n8. Hence, the correct answer is C: Open door\nAnswer: C: Open door\n\nInput: What did the boy get from eating a pink cake? Choices:  (all correct) A: a nice night B: a sweet night C: a wonderful night D: an exceptionally nice night E: an unforgettable night\nRationales: The answer choice which best fits the question is A: a nice night. \nA: \"Wonderful night\" is not specific and would be a good answer for any nice evening.\nB: \"A sweet night\" is a vague answer that can also be said of any type of cake.\nC: \"An exceptionally nice night\" is a vague adverb which is better used as an intensifier and does not clearly indicate anything in particular.\nD: \"An unforgettable night\" may be appropriate if the boy has had one very exciting or interesting morning but will not necessarily work for an ordinary night.\nE: \"A nice night\" is a very specific phrase which could indicate a night consisting of any number of qualitative descriptors.\nAnswer: A. a nice night\n\nInput: My mother will definitely get what that I need for my science project.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, open doors, bike home.\n5. The key was already in his pocket, which means the choice \"pocket\" does not fit. \n6. \"Bi,\" he is getting ready to bike home; \"ch\" are pronounced sounds that suggest turning the lock (like \"B-I-C-H-home\").\n7. The choice \"solution to problem\" sounds more like it refers to the action of solving a problem as a previous step, it does not directly address opening a lock.  For the same reason, the choice \"open doors\" doesn't make sense either. \n8. The choice \"turn lock\" is a vague and ambiguous phrase, and it is too specific to mention the action of turning the lock.\n9. Therefore, the answer should be B: open lock.\nAnswer: B. open lock\n\nInput: The car was going 20 mph. the driver realized he was about to crash but there was no  what? Choices: B: emergency room C: safety D: safety guard E: time\nRationales: In this situation, the driver is in a life or death situation. The car was going at 20 miles per hour, the driver realized he was going to crash, but there was no time to stop. In order for the driver to emerge victorious from this life or death situation, he would need a safety guard, there would have to be no collision, or there would have to be plenty of time.\n\nHowever, the choice of emergency room does not meet any of the requirements that would ensure this life or death situation did not end poorly for the driver. The choice of emergency room is an incorrect answer choice because it is clear that the driver's goal is to avoid crashing his car. If he crashes, he will be at fault and likely sent to the emergency room for severe car accident injuries.\n\nTherefore, the answer to this question is D: Safety or C: SAFETY. Safety is not a noun, therefore the capital S is unnecessary and incorrect. However, it is a good idea to capitalize safety if the word is going to make other words capital as well to show emphasis or as is done in the sentence for effect. In this case, the answer to this problem is choice D: SAFETY or choice C: Safety because", "answer": "D: step forward"}

'Solution to problem' does not imply the act of opening a lock, so it can be disregarded.\n7. Pocket sounds too vague to indicate the act of turning a lock or opening a door.\n8. Therefore, the only remaining choice is D: Pocket, which is most likely the action of grabbing his key and getting ready to go. \n9. Therefore, the answer to this prompt is C: pocket.\nAnswer: D.

Choices:  -  A: offense B: defense C: dribbling D: foul E: passing\nRationales: One of the ways of getting the ball to the basket is passing. When another player already has a teammate in order to pass to, that player is usually said to be in offense or defense.\n1. The other choices are the dribbling, foul and the defense. We can disregard the dribbling because it is a different way to move to the basket.\n2. The foul is usually said to be a defensive tactic, so we can disregard the foul for being a way to help an athlete move the ball to the basket.\n3. The defense is said to help the athlete in moving the ball to the basket through means such as blocking shots or stealing the ball with a defensive block.\n4. Therefore the answer is the passing.\nAnswer: Passing\n\nInput: When a ball moves to another player of the offense, what is this called? Choices:  * A: dribbling  * B: passing  * C: foul  * D: moving to ball  * E: scoring\nRationale: 1. We can eliminate \"dribbling\". We know that the ball moved to another player offense. This answer gives us \"moving to ball\".\n2. We can eliminate \"foul\" because it involves a defensive tactic. It includes actions such as blocking shots, stealing balls, etc. \"moving to ball\" doesn't mean this.\n3", "answer": "C: shop"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, and open doors.\n5. 'Turn lock' and 'open doors is a potential solution to the problem of not having the correct key to unlock the door.' is not a correct answer as it is not related to the biking, nor the getting out of his key.\n6. 'Pocket' is a correct answer because when he got out his key to prepare for biking his bike, he probably also put his key in his pocket to ensure that he has it when he goes out to bike.\n7. 'Solution to problem' is a potential solution to not being able to bike home. \n8. 'Pocket solution to problem' is a logical plausible answer, since he gets out his key, and probably puts it in his pocket.\n9. It is most likely that when he began to open his key from his pocket he accidentally opened the lock, and as he was turning the key his finger somehow got stuck in the lock.\n10. This would then lead to his actions to what?

Choices:  A : feel like a good person B : solve some personal issue C : feel confident D : deal with the anxiety\nRationales:\n1. In this context, the question makes sense when we consider where the person's anxiety is coming from.\n2. It describes how the person is currently feeling (on edge), but also how they feel they will feel after their presentation goes well.\n3. Anxiety comes after feeling apprehensive. Here, the person is describing how they intend to feel after their presentation goes very well, so anxiety is unlikely.\n4. If they are worried about feeling anxious during their presentation, feeling more confident is a more plausible solution.\n5. However, feeling confident may not actually be the result if one's presentation goes well, so it is not the best choice.\n6. The best answer is C: Feel confident.\n\nAnswer: C: feel confident.\n\nInput: You're out of milk for your morning cereal.  What is the best way for you to get to", "answer": "C: intelligence"}

Choices: 1. strong 2. heavy 3. fast 4. small 5. well-balanced\nRationales: So, the question has five options, out of which we can exclude one. So we exclude the fifth option, which is well-balanced. We know that engines are powerful and run at great speeds, so if this were the best quality for the engine, then it should have been a speedy flight. It would be a much safer way for the plane to take off than, say landing on an aircraft carrier while it's moving. If that were the case, then every single take-off and landing would result in the death of countless passengers. If anyone can do this, then at least the pilots would have the option on how to do it. And if that were not possible, then every flight would involve risking your life.\n1. The engine needs to be tough, and in situations where it's doing its job, like taxiing on a runway, it also has to be strong. This might be enough to overcome all the possible difficulties we would face in flight.", "answer": "C: authentic"}

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket and open doors.\n5. Among these options, open doors and solution to problem are too general while pocket is an action that does not have a specific purpose.\n6. Turn lock is a logical action, but the question does not ask for a logical action, instead, it asks for a specific purpose.\n7. However, opening a lock usually serves a specific purpose, for example, locking a bike or opening a door, so the key opens a door is plausible.\n8. However, the question does not ask us for a plausible action, instead, it tells us to focus on one of the given choices.\n9. Therefore, we conclude that the answer is D: pocket key opens a door.\nAnswer: D pocket: key opens a door\n\nInput: You should learn to write well.

We can eliminate A: read a lot because reading involves reading and writing.\n2. We can eliminate B: read often because reading involves reading and not necessarily writing.\n3. We can eliminate C: learn to read good writers because learning to read a good writer would mean improving one's writing skills.\n4.

The person wasn't having any problems before unlocking the door.\n7. So, only B: pocket and D: open doors remain.\n8. Then, we know that D: open doors makes more sense than B: pocket.\n9. Open doors means \"to move something away from the area where it is kept\" and \"to move something to make it more easily seen or accessible\".\n10.

Didn't go to church anymore \nRationales: the given context in the sentence is  \"He wanted to be liked\" and the student's choice mattered a lot \"What did he do?\" so we know that he made a choice between A. B. C. D. or E. so we can eliminate A. C.

We can rule the option A: turn lock out because turning a lock is an action that only needs to be done once, not on each and every lock.\n8. We can also rule out option B: pocket as a choice due to its vague nature. \n9. We can also eliminate option C: solution to problem as it does not suggest a specific outcome that would allow the key to be used in this situation. \n10. Lastly, we can eliminate option D: pocket as the action of putting the key into a pocket is not necessarily followed by the act of opening a door.\n11. Only the options E: open doors are left because that's the clearest indication that the key was being used. It suggests that the key was opening a door. \n12. Therefore, the answer must be E.\n13.

So as per the statement, a decision has been made to do what?\n1. A is incorrect because it makes no sense for a person to move their carpet to a more safe place if they don't like it.\n2. B is incorrect because a sale happens to a third person. It does not seem like a logical choice since the loopy is the person's own place.\n3. C is incorrect because it doesn't make any sense to change a carpet.\n4. D is incorrect because removing a carpet does not make sense since the main intention is to replace.\n5. E is incorrect because throwing away makes no sense considering it's a carpet.\nIt makes the most sense to choose the answer as A\nAnswer: Choice A: Put carpet somewhere safer", "answer": "E: printer"}

Choices: A business district B downtown C suburb D tourists E streets\nRationales: Given: \"The city is now called a 'bustling metropolis'\". A bustling metropolis is a metropolitan area that is very busy, with many people, industries, and activities. A bustling metropolitan area is therefore more crowded and developed than a suburb. A suburb is a part of a city or metropolitan area that is at a distance from the city centre, but connected to it by a road or rail.\n(1) 1. \"The city is now\" - When we use \"now\", the implied time is right now.\n\n(2) 2.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket and open doors. \n5. Turn lock is a general term for the action of rotating the dial of a lock and opening a lock.\n6. Pocket is not specific because it refers to any place where something can be stored, or \"kept\". It does not tell us where the key was being held. \n7. Similarly, Solution to problem does not tell us anything about the action of the key or the lock.  It only tells us that the key is meant to solve a specific issue. That is why it is not selected as a plausible answer. \n8. Pocket is a concrete way to describe the actions of holding keys in one's pocket, which is why it is not ruled out right away.\n9. Lastly, Open doors does not necessarily describe the specific action of holding a key in one's hand to unlock a door and let it swing open.  It only refers to an action where one's goal is to open a door.\n10. Therefore, out of the five options, open doors does not fit the context of the question well because it does not specifically imply the action of holding the key in one's hands to open the door.\n11. The only concrete action implicated by the question is the action of holding a key,  which will lead us to answer the question as A: turn a lock, which is the only option that clearly specifies this specific action as a possible answer.\n12.

'Pocket' doesn't specifically mean using a pocket to hold the key, it also includes putting the key away. \n8. As for,'solution to problem' - this wording is vague to such a small action as opening a key, and the concept itself is too general. \n9. 'Pocket' and 'open doors' are both general terms, which can be done before he starts to bike home, unlike 'begin to bike home' which requires something more specific to the process.\n10.

The options all tell us what we cannot 'do' to someone if we aren't happy, bored, afraid, etc.\n2. However, there isn't a negative connotation or reason given in the sentence.\n3. Therefore, we have to determine what we cannot do to someone that would be considered negative. The only ones that offer negativity are B: angry and E: afraid.\n4. 'do' may indicate a physical action, but it also means to'make', 'assist', or 'help'.\n5. By looking at the options, we see that the only choices that convey negative physical actions are B: angry and D: happy. 'B: angry' tells us that we should not do something to someone if we aren\u2019t angry, as in 'get angry'.\n6. This is a negative physical action. \n7. 'D: happy' means we shouldn\u2019t help someone if we aren\u2019 to happy. Similar to angry and happy, we know we can make someone more or less happy, so this is also a negative action.\n8. Therefore we eliminate C: bored as 'bored' doesn't suggest a negative physical action.\n9. Next we eliminate E: afraid as 'afraid' does not suggest a positive physical action.\n\n\n## Hints : 1\n\n## Hints: 2\n\n## Hints 3\n\n## Hints4\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">R</span><span class=\"highlight\">A</span><span class='hightlight'>D</span><span class=highlight", "answer": "D: shelf"}

'pocket' and 'open doors' aren't really applicable since they are not actions involving a key; rather than turning a lock, unlocking the door, or opening the door with the key.\n6. Out of all the option choices, B and D can be eliminated because they are vague and too general.\n7. Finally, we conclude that D: open doors is the correct answer choice because it is specific to the question and is a likely action that the person took when he got out his key.\n8.

A: 20th century, B: 70th through 80th; 400 years in addition A: 5th century; 400, 000 years; and C: 50th century until 60th century; 450 years in addition to 80th through 90th hundredth.\n1. 20th century through 25th century, 400 to start and 500 years in addition to century is not a suitable answer, because this is less than the life span of the tree.\n2. 70th through end of 80th century, 440 years and life span is not a suitable answer because it is less than the life time of the tree.\n3. 5th century, 250, 00 years, and 600 and 700th century, 245, 000 is too less; and 30s century to century of 2000 is sufficient, hence 90th Century is chosen; to year of planting, which is 600 through 800 century is 450 years addition for century of 700, which makes total 445.\n4. 400 years,", "answer": "B: generous"}
{"text": ", open lock, pocket, solution to problem and open door. \n5. Turning a lock and getting out the key are equivalent actions indicating getting ready to open and locking a bike lock.\n6. This is because they involve the action of \"getting out/retrieving\" a key that was previously \"turned in\".\n7. However, in this question these two actions are used interchangeably with get out and pocket.\n8. The actions of taking a key out and putting it back in a pocket, such as turning a lock, do represent a step in the process of opening a lock and getting ready to bike.\n9. So, the given choice E: open doors makes the most sense.\n10. Therefore, the answer has to be E: open doors. \nAnswer: A: turn lock.\n\nInput: The company is not getting as many orders as it used to.  It needs new marketing techniques and what they're lacking right now? Choices:  a: quality products b: low prices c: sales people d: strong branding e: promotions\nRationales: The company is not satisfied with its revenue and it's getting fewer orders than it used to.\n\n1st Option: They're lacking new marketing techniques, but the company already spends money on marketing.  If they spend more, it will help them with getting more customers, which is what they're looking to do.\n\n2nd Option: They are lacking new marking techniques, but the main idea that sells products aren't the quality of the product.  People buy items for different reasons, and having quality products doesn't help.\n\n3rd Option: They're not getting as many orders because it's a very competitive niche, so they might not be getting as much attention from buyers as they want to.  Selling products is about getting more attention.  There are people who purchase items solely based on their price.\n\n4th Option: The people that work in marketing and sales are very important when selling items.  They are the ones that help sell products to people.  The company is getting fewer orders due to the fact that they aren't selling the item as much as they could be.\n\n5th Option: The company is lacking what's needed right now because their brand", "answer": "C: have knowledge"}

Therefore. he was most likely unlocking a door or lock to leave.\n7. 'Pocket' cannot be the correct answer either as the key was too big to fit into the palm.\n8. 'Pocket solution to problem' makes no sense and does not seem like an immediate reaction.\n9. Therefore, from among the options, D: pocket, is the most likely answer, as it is the only one that matches the context without contradictions.\n10. So, the answer would be 'D': pocket.\nAnswer: D : pocket\n\nInput: Which of these words is an antonym? Choices:  a: sad B: happy C: lucky D: disappointed E: unluck\nRationales: First, we identify the question, \"Which of these words is an ANTONYM?\" This clue is indicating that there is at least one word that can go with \"unluck\" but is the opposite of this.\n2. The dictionary defines an antonym as \"a word, phrase, or expression that expresses a meaning opposed to the meaning expressed by a particular word, phrase, or statement.\"\n3. Therefore, \"unlucky\" is the opposite of \"lucky,\" which is the choice that is \"lucky.\"\n4. The remaining options can either be excluded because they do not directly relate to \"unlucky,\" or can be eliminated as they are not opposite of it.\n5. So, as options B: happy, C: lucky, and E: unlucky relate directly to \"unlucky\" but they are not opposite, they should be eliminated.\n6. Option a: sad is not an opposite of unlucky, as it is the positive of the adjectives unlucky's synonym: lucky.\n7. As a: sad is not the opposite of unlucky and neither options D: disappointed nor E: unlucky provide an opposite, neither is correct. \n8. Thus, unlucky's antonym is lucky, and we must choose B: happy as it is the opposite of unluck.", "answer": "C: spinning wheel"}

Further, 'pocket' suggests that the key will be kept inside the pocket, not left inside the room.\n8. Therefore, the choice most relevant to the statement of the given options is 'open doors'.\n9.

A: box holds a lot of different types of objects and does not specify that paperclips should be stored \n2. B: envelope is too small and can hold only few objects other than paperclips \n3. C & D: are too big, if paperclips are the main objects, folders and file do not really make sense and drawer cannot hold enough papers clips for long.\n4.

Choices: 10 A: none B: half C: one D: two\nRationales: The first question we will ask is: How many steps closer an ant will be after a hundred jumps?  We know that he will be climbing up a very inclined surface. Inclined surfaces can be anything from a slope in a mountain, the surface of a roof, road, etc. Inclined surfaces provide friction. If it were a vertical wall, he wouldn't climb it at all. It would take a very, very strong ant.\nThe ant needs to calculate each jump, 10 jumps.

However, rooster is the one who crows, not the sun.  The rooster crowing would mean that sun rise could take anywhere from 11:0: pm to 9:00 p.m., since the rooster would depend on the time of year, and the time zone it was in.", "answer": "C: lake"}

So, the most precise choice becomes 'pocket' as it directly tells us what he most likely did after getting the key.\n7. Therefore the correct answer is C: pocket.\nAnswer: C pocket \n\n### Instructions:The questions here are about the nature of words, phrases or sentence constructions. Use logic and common sense, and if you need help, a dictionary is your friend.\n\n### Test:\nInput: A bird sits on a branch. The bird on the branch is a what? Choices: A: animal B: creature C: creature D: pet E: species\nRationales:\n1. The use of the word 'bird' in this sentence implies that the word 'bird' will refer to an animal that has feathers. \n2. So, the bird in this sentence is a bird, or something that is identified as a bird, and is classified as an animal with feathers (in this sentence). \n3. Among the given options, there is a category of \"creature\", which is usually used to refer to a person, animal that may exist in myth, or imaginary creature or monster.\n4. We discard A: animal, C: creature, and D: pet as these do not fit the definition of a bird.\n5. E is also rejected, as only birds are referred to in this sentence, not people, animals, mythical beings or pets. Only species can be referred to as what they are (species), not what they are called by human beings. \n6. So, based on these analyses, the answer is B.\n7. Therefore B: \"Creature\" is the answer.\nAnswer: B creature", "answer": "A: zoo"}

As it suggests that he put his key back into his pocket, it is likely that he has only turned the lock and put his key, along with other things, back into his pocket.\n6. It\u2019s also probable that the door was already closed so he did not need to open doors.\n7. The process of opening a lock is also an action that someone may do before leaving.\n8. So he most likely only turned the lock and pocketed his key before he started to bike home, using an outside door that he hadn't opened earlier.\n9. Therefore, the answer to the question is C: turn lock.\nAnswer: C : turn lock\n\nInput: At first he knew almost nothing about what to expect, but after his education he was ready to work what? Choices: A: for the next seven years. B: for the next four years. C: any job. D: forever.\nRationales:1. The question tells you that he knew almost nothing about exactly what to expect out of the military.\n2. After completing his education, he realized he was now ready for what the military had to offer.\n3. He would then find work with the military during his next seven years.\n4. Therefore the answer is A: for the next 7 years.\nAnswer: A : for next 7 years. \n\nInput: The first step to becoming a member of the community is to what?

{"text": ", pocket, pocket, key, pocket, open doors. \n5. Out of all options 'turn lock' does not make logical sense as the action of 'turning lock' is a way of opening a locked door, not a problem.\n6. Additionally, among options 'pocket' and 'key', pocket refers to storing an item, and therefore would not be used in the scenario if the question tells us that he has already gotten his key out.\n7. Hence the only relevant option left is 'pocket'. So, the answer is C.\nAnswer: C.\n\nInput: If a person is feeling down do you think you could cheer them up? If not, how do you think you could? Choices:  C: cheer them up D: tell them good things have happened E: listen to their problems F: try to distract them\nRationales:\n1. The question asks whether a person is feeling down, and if we, as the one asked, could cheer them up.\n2. If the person becomes cheerful, that means we have done something that made the person feel better.\n3. Among all the given options, only 'cheer' can change the scenario, as 'tell', 'listen', and 'distract' could potentially make the situation worse.\n4. However, there are no wrong answers, as there is no one right way to cheer a person up. \n5. So, one could do any of the given options, 'cheer', 'tell', 'distract', and 'listen' to lift the spirits of a down person. \n6. Therefore, we cannot say that we couldn't cheer the down person up.\n7. However, we can say that we couldn' tcheer the person up with the given options of 'cheer', 'distract', 'tell', and 'listen'.\n8. To be more specific, we should consider the type of person who is feeling down and the situation we are in.\n9. For example, trying to distract a person who is in a relationship crisis would be unnecessary and could cause unnecessary stress.\n10. This also implies that the best way to cheer the downperson is personalized, and depends on what makes the person feel better, not based on general options. \n11.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, and open doors.\n5. So, we can exclude turn lock and solution to problem because these do not include opening a lock, and so they may not necessarily be the next action taken.\n6. Pocket may be the action of retrieving the key from the pocket, but it generally does not provide insight into what the person will do next. \n7. Therefore, 'open doors' seems to be the most relevant option because it aligns with the action of taking out the key.\n8. The question mentions that he was ready to leave, so opening the door that leads to the outside is the next logical thing to do.\nAnswer: EE: open doors\n\nInput: Daphne's grandma bought a new car and drove how far today? Choices:  D: 50 miles E: 5 miles\nRationales: Here is how we solve this question:\n1. The question includes the term 'how far' which is indicative of distance, and 'today' is usually synonymous with'recently'.\n2. Additionally, the term 'new car' indicates that the amount of distance traveled is significant enough for one to notice.\n3. Based on the context and information given, Daphne's aunt is probably visiting her daughter and the distance from Daphne's house and her daughter's house is probably more than 50 miles.\n4. We can eliminate the most inaccurate, '5 miles' as this amount of distance would be quite insignificant to a car owner and is not mentioned in the question.\n5. The remaining options are 50 miles, 85 miles, 100 miles, and 135 miles.\n6. One of the given options is '85 miles' which is definitely not enough to consider a'significant' amount.\n7. The next choice is '135 miles', which is still significantly too far for it to be considered for the answer.\n8. Another option, '100 miles' can be ruled out as it does not fit in with the amount of distance 'new car' implies.\n9. This leaves us with the correct answer, '50 miles'.\n10. This is because the amount of distance travelled by a car that has been used for less than 70 miles", "answer": "C: house"}

Out of the given options, 'turn lock' and'solution to problem' can't be the choices, because it's not only one's responsibility to open a lock, also another person's.\n6. 'Open doors' is a logical choice, but 'pocket' would contradict the idea that he \"got out\" his key, plus we don't expect to hear about the pocket unless it is somehow special or important.\n7. We can eliminate 'pocket' and 'practice' from all the choices.\n8. So, we have two choices left which is turn lock and open doors.\n9. Therefore, the question is seeking the choice that best describes what he would do next.\n10.

The question tells us he thought of a joke. Then, he decided not to tell it, because he thought of a better one. \n4. Therefore, he had two ideas of jokes and was willing to wait for a better one.  To decide whether to tell a joke, it must be tested to see if it works. \n5. This requires feedback from the audience, so they must be considered in this choice. \n1. There were several possibilities about what caused him to change his mind, one was his mood, others were other people's moods. \n3.

Since my brother's driving is poor so his choice of the road will be bad (road is a word, it could mean any road and not necessarily the main road, it could also mean the one going right) which comes under place. And the way might not be as bad as driving a car and it could still be a good way to something and not a shortcut. This is the way a bus driver drives a bus.

Besides, 'pocket' is a somewhat vague word because there are many possible pockets. The given statement only says he 'got out his key' and not 'put it in his pocket'.\n7. Thus, B: open doors, seems to be the best choice as he got out his key to use it to open a door.\n8. C: solution to problem is also considered as there is a chance he might have had other problems to solve.\n9. In fact, E: open doors does not suggest that he 'had something' to do, which eliminates C: solution to problem.\n10. However, the key is a general word and may apply to more than one action. The only specific action related to this phrase is A: turn lock.\n11. Hence, the answer to the statement can be found in A: turn lock as he used his key to unlock the door, and also C: solution to problem because this statement can have many possible reasons why he opened the door.\n12. The key may have been the solution to another problem, such as locking the bicycle.\n13. Therefore, the answer can be found in A turn lock or in C solution to problem\nAnswer: C: solution to problem\n\nInput: He saw a man crying, who looked very sad.  He asked him how his day was, and the man said, \"I would like to know my mother.\" What would the man likely do? Choices:  P: ask him the exact same question, Q: offer to let him spend the night at his house, R: take a picture with him, S: offer him a ride home, T: give him a big hug\nRationales:\n1. He sees a man crying, which indicates that something went wrong that day.\n2. Thus, this man is likely to be sad and distressed by whichever problem he is facing.\n3. He approaches the man to ask how his day was. He could have only asked this because he felt some form of em", "answer": "E: laundry room"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, and open doors.\n5. Pocket can mean collecting or carrying something in your pocket, so it is incorrect here.\n6. Pocket can also imply to carry something to one's self, but here we are discussing opening something.\n7. Solution to problem does not suggest any concrete action of opening or unlocking anything.\n8. Open doors is incorrect, as it refers to the action of opening doors only.\n9. This leaves only B: turn lock and A: turn lock, which fits the question and all of the given options.\n10.

Choices: A: the tracks B: station platform C: platform B D: platform C E: the tracks\nRationales: The question gives us a clue about the place where the passenger waited for the train by saying that she stood by the platform.\n1. Platform refers to structures in train stations or bus depots where passengers wait for trains or buses to arrive and depart.\n2. The passenger waited for the train to arrive by standing on the platform.\n3. When we look at the other options, we see that the tracks and the station platform are in the same location, since tracks are placed under platforms. So, the right answer is B: platform B\nAnswer: B. platform B\n\nInput: I wonder what he wants.  Why does he look so angry?  He hasn't been very nice to me since we  went on our first date,  What is the problem, then? Choices:  C: got hurt B: was nice D: had a bad experience E: had a bad day\nRationales: All of the options listed under \"What is the problem, then?\" seem like reasonable explanations for a situation in which someone's behavior becomes problematic. \n1. The sentence \"I wonder what he wants\" sets up the question by creating uncertainty about why the other person is behaving in this way.\n2. The sentence \"Why does he look so angry?\" implies that the protagonist has noticed a change in how the other person is acting, which likely points towards something negative.\n3. \"He hasn'", "answer": "A: humidifier"}
{"text": "(locking something), pocket (putting something in your pocket), solution to problem (dealing with problem or issue), pocket (putting in pocket), and open doors (opening doors).\n5. Among all the choices, only 'turn lock' involves what the key is for.\n6. To ensure that the correct word or action will be provided in the answer, we can add 'to what' and make up an ending, (for this example), 'the lock on his bike'.\n7. Then we can read the question again, substituting 'turn the lock on his bike' for 'turn lock', 'his bike' for 'lock' in the question, and 'his bike' at the end, we get: He was ready to bicycle home, He got out his key and turned the lock on his bikey (i.e. on his bike).\n8. So, he is expected to 'turn' the lock 'on his bike' since this is the action indicated for the key. \n9. Therefore, turn key to what would be 'turn lock' and 'turn lock on your bike' would be the right choice.\n10. Hence, the answer would be B: turn lock.\nAnswer: B/d: turn lock\n\nInput: At 6:00 am everyday, the man awoke and stretched on what? Choices: A: the couch. B: the mattress. C: the kitchen table. D: the carpet. E: the bed\nRationales:\n1. The question tells use that at 6:00 AM everyday, the man wakes up and stretches.\n2. We know that man usually doesn't choose to do work as his only activity at 6:0 0AM. \n3. The only reasonable action the man could do at that time is stretch.\n4. The only choice that matches this scenario is'stretch'. The others do not. For instance, A: the couch, B: the mattrase, C: the kitchen table, and D: the carpet are specific pieces of furniture. \n5. Therefore, A: the coushc, B: the matrest, C: the kitchen taables, and D: the crapet do not provide answer to the question.\n6. However", "answer": "B: frustration"}
{"text": ", B: pocket, C: solution to problem, D: pocket, E: open doors. The first three choices, \"turn lock\", \"B: pocket\", \"C: solution to problem\" all can describe an action done before locking his bike. This implies that he was already done locking his bike, meaning he likely already used the bike and thus doesn't need to lock it. So, out of the given choices, all three aren't the actions of locking his bike door.\n5. The last choice, \"opening doors\" is also vague, and does not give information on which doors he is referring to and what action he did with them.\n4. He likely opened the door of his office or storefront.\n5. Therefore \"open doors\" is not the correct choice.\n6. There is only one choice out of the given choices that has the word \"pocket\" in it: 'D: pocket.\"\n7. This word could refer to his hand pocket, or a storage pocket that is part of the locking mechanism.\n8. \"Pocket\" by itself is unlikely to contain the action of unlocking a lock, thus it is likely that he unlocked his bike lock while holding onto it.\n9. The given options are: turn lock, pocket, solution to problem. Although we don't know which lock was locked, we can eliminate the action of turning a lock after removing the key. We also eliminate the two remaining actions as he was done.\n10. Therefore the answer must be the first given option: D: pocket.\nAnswer: D.

Focus on failing C. Keep doing the maths D. Get a 100% E. Get a 60%\nRationales: The question begins by stating that some people hate maths at schools due to a fear of failing. The fear of failing could be due to a lack of confidence in one's maths skills.\n\nFear = negative\n\nThe only statement that mentions \"getting a 100%\" and \"getting a 60%\" is C which states \" Get a 101% or a 61%\". While the goal of 100% would be desirable it doesn't deal with the fear of failing or provide a solution to the people who \"keep trying\".\n\nOptions that mention fear include A, focusing on failing could be stressful and not a solution to the lack of confidence in the person's maths skills since they are both similar. D is also not valid since no percentage is mentioned.\n\nThere is only one solution which is to \"Keep doing the maths\" which means work on improving your skills and this means that there will naturally be failures since you're improving your skills. In this case failing is considered as a way to learn from your mistakes.\n\nThe answer is A.

He didn't even have to think; he just knew what to do:  what he would start with. Choices:  H: his bath A: his home B: his food C: his dog D: his garden E: his keys\nRationales: The given context tells us that John just got home, which means that the choices are out of order to be what he would start with when he comes home. \nA Bath (H) could be what is normally done first when you get home. However, you would normally put on your clothes first as they are more important. Keys are often left outside a door and are not necessarily considered part of 'home'. If John is going to make some food then he must have got home with something to start with, but this is not consistent with the given options. A Garden (C) is not normally associated with the home or an immediate priority when coming home. It also could be too big of a task. Food (D) is more associated with a meal than it is something that can be done as soon as John gets home. Dog (E) is not normally considered part of home.\nTherefore it can be concluded that John is a person that has a home and probably lives in a place with some kind of home, but", "answer": "C: cupboard"}

Here, we know that the man was very thirst and wanted to drink some water. But \"the water from the lake\" was dirty. so the man didn't want or remember to get any water from the dirty lake.\n\nThen look at the answer options B,D,E.\n\nB and D only mentions the man's thinking (he \"thought...he should wait\" and he \"remembered...he left the lake...because he liked the idea to get clean water\").\nE, however, is the option we are looking for, since it mentions the man's action of \"he remembered about the lake and...\". Since the lake water was clean, he wanted to go and get more water.\nTherefore, the correct answer is\nC: he thought he should wait: the man had a thought, but no idea what to do or how to find clean water. so he \"thought\" he should wait for something without even thinking about what the \"something\" should be in the future. And if a situation where everyone is thirsty occurs, how they will find the clean water to quench the thirst.\n\nInput: John wanted to know who is stronger.

{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors. \n5. 'turn lock' could mean turning, fumbling with the lock, or trying to engage the lock - however, the action of 'turning lock' does not directly suggest the action of 'getting out key', or 'beginning to open a lock'.\n6. 'pocket' is not specific and could relate to putting his keys in his pocket or just checking if his keys were in his pocket.\n7. 'Pocket' does not directly relate to the action of opening a door.\n8. 'Pocket' could also refer in this case to holding a key to unlock the door which contradicts the first statement \"He was ready to bike\".\n9. 'Pocket' therefore cannot relate directly to the action of 'opening the door'.\n10. Therefore, 'pocket' is probably best excluded from consideration.\n11. Next, we eliminate'solution to problem' as the same reasons apply for this answer choice \u2013 it does not exactly specify 'opening a lock' and does not relate directly to the action described.\n12. We also exclude 'open doors' as 'open doors' would imply a range of actions, many of which do not directly relate to opening a lock.\n13. 'Open door' could refer to the action of 'entering', however the first statement would contradict this answer choice.\n14. Next we examine 'pocket'. While 'pockets' could be interpreted to be a solution to the problem, 'keys' and 'open locks' could be referred to instead.\n15. This leaves us with A: turn lock.\n16. Finally, we know that he was ready to leave 'home', which suggests that he was 'inside', and was unable to leave 'because of a lock'.\n17. Therefore, the most likely answer to the question is A: turn lock. This is because it best fits the context of the question, and makes the statements coherent and unambiguous.\n18. This rule could be summarized as:  \"The answer choice that makes the statements most coherent and un-ambiguous is the correct answer.\"\n19.

The person asking the question is most likely to be the one opening the door.\n2. The person is then reminded that they don't know what to do next.\n3. The options then are given as follows: 1) A: someone to come help - someone would most likely be called upon in case of emergency, where opening a door would be necessary\n2) D: nothing good - this choice is nonsensical, as there is a problem (door's locked) which needs to be solved and this person is already aware of it\n3) E: open it, do it, solve the problem - this is the solution\n4.

The correct choice among the two remaining choices is D: pocket.\n7. It is more logical for him to put his key in his pocket to make it more convenient to open doors with the key.\n8. So the answer is D: pocket. \nAnswer: D: pocket\n\nInput: Toby was late for his bus and wanted to make it on time.  He began to what? Choides A: run B: hurry C: prepare D: get ready\nRationales:\n1. First, we need to understand what exactly Toby was attempting to do.\n2. The given sentence states that Toby was late.\n3. This indicates that Toby has already done everything that he was supposed to do before the bus arrived.\n4. The given options are: run, hurry, prepare, and get ready. \n5. Although they differ in degree, their general purpose is to do what Toby is trying to do, which is to get to the bus on time. \n6. Although all of the given terms can be considered correct depending on the context, getting ready is the best definition as it is the most inclusive of them all. (ex: getting ready can mean the same thing as \"running\") so it has to be the best choice among the given options.\n7. Therefore the answer is D to get ready.\n\nAnswer: D: get ready\n\nInput: Where can I get the address of a pizzeria near here? Choices: \nA: directory B: map C: list D: database E: wikipedia\nRationales: First, take a look at what the question is asking.\n1. It is asking for specific information about a pizzeria. \n2. It suggests that the question is looking for a specific type of information.\n3. There are several locations where one could find such information, including a map, a directory, a list, a database and wikipedia.\n4. However, the location in question is asking for a pizzeria, which means that wikipedia, a free and user-generated information database, is the most plausible option.\n5. So, the answer to this question is E: wikipedia. \nAnswer", "answer": "C: honest"}
{"text": ", which again implies opening a lock, pocket, solution to the problem, which can either mean thinking of a solution or taking action to solve a problem, or pocket.\n5. Only pocket can be eliminated as the question tells us that he had his key to open a lock, so he did not need to get his wallet to carry the key.\n6. This eliminates A: turn lock, B: pocket, C: solution to problem, and D: pocket.\n7. Therefore the answer is E: open doors.\n8. The question tells us he got out his key to begin the process of unlocking the door so he had already turned the lock but didn't need to.\nAnswer: E- open doors\n\nInput: She made a good score on her test,  she has not studied for this  test because what?

Choices A: talk about other peoples troubles when one is feeling sad B: look into one's troubles when one  is feeling sad C: act as if you aren't feeling any  troubles when one is feeling depressed D: talk about other people's troubles when you feel lonely E: look into one'\nRationales:The question asks \"It is better to... \" which implies that talking about other people's  troubles when one is  feeling  sad is not as good as the other options.\nThe next sentence says \"looking  into one's troubles  when one is feeling sad\" is a  better option.\nSo, we can eliminate A & B as options.\nNext, the question says \"acting  as if you aren' t feeling any troubles when one is feeling  depressed\" is the right choice.\nBut we can also eliminate this answer as it is not as useful as the one left which is \"It is better to look into one's  troubles  when one is  feeling sad\".\nHence, the answer is E.\nAnswer:E) Look into one's troubles.\n\nInput: It would  be useful to  know which  methods of eating  food", "answer": "A: holding"}
{"text": "(lock/turn combination), pocket (keys), solution to problem (lock/turn combination again), and open doors (lock/turn combination).\n5. Out of these options,'solution to problem' is the most specific, which suggests lock/turn combination.\n6. Therefore the sentence means that he got out his key to unlock the front door.\n7. Answer is D: he got out his key which is the same as what the answer is. \nAnswer: D: he got out of his key\n\nInput: They could not find a solution, so what did they do? Choices: 1. A: get upset\n2. B: get angry\n3. C: accept it\n4. D: cry\n5. E: give up\nRationales:1. We see that they did not find a solution to their problem.\n2. Since it is mentioned that they did not find any solutions to their problem, it is most likely that they were angry.\n3. Outside of the list of options, what other option could they possibly do?\n4. 'Give up', which is the only one that contradicts the statement, is incorrect.\n5. The other options which include 'angry', 'get upset' all fit the statement.\n6. 'Accept it' and 'cry' may seem to not fit the statement, however, given that their problem seems to be of such magnitude, it is most likely for them to become upset, which can lead to them crying or being angry.\n7. Out of all the options, 'get angry' and 'get upset' seem to be most logical as we are given that they did not find an answer to their problem.\n8. Angry people may express anger in different ways and upset people may cry if they are angry.\n9. The reason upset people and angry people both cry is because crying is an expression of one's negative emotions and both upset people and angry get are upset.\n10. Therefore, the options can all be considered to be correct answers because they all fit the given description of the emotions these people will likely have if they did not find a clear solution to their problem.  \nAnswer:\n A: He got upset, B: He got angry and C: He accepted that which all are reasonable reactions given that they didn't find a solution", "answer": "D: city centre"}
{"text": "- he is not ready to move, pocket - pocket, solution to problem - this is inaccurate because it does not relate to biking home, pocket - pocket, open doors - he is ready but not yet leaving.\n5. Therefore the only way he can start leaving is by opening a lock.  So, the answer is C option A: turn lock.\n\nAnswer: C: turn lock", "answer": "C: desk drawer"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, pocket, open doors.\n5. Out of these choices, we note that pockets are mentioned in A: turn lock, B: pocket and D: pockets.\n6. This indicates that 'turn lock' and 'open doors' can be disregarded.\n7. We can also rule out 'pocket'. This is as there can't be any more pockets to open. Furthermore, 'turn lock' and opening doors does not seem to suggest anything useful for finding a key.\n8. So, this leaves us with'solution to problem'.\n9. After noting that the given options do not clearly mention problem solving, we can narrow it down to either 'open doors' or'solution to problem', out of which'solution to problem' is a general term, thus more inclusive, which is the answer.\n10. Therefore, the answer to the question is E: solution to problem.\nAnswer: E; solution to problem\n\nInput: She went to the art museum to see what? Choices: A: the artwork B: the paintings C: new artwork D: exhibits E: different pieces\nRationales: Given: 1. She went to the artuseum to see what. The question is asking about what the woman saw that she went to the art museum. \n2. Among the choices, she could have seen either the artwork itself or the exhibits, but since they are both mentioned as things she probably saw, the only difference between them is how she saw them. The given clues indicate that'see' must be done indirectly instead of directly, so we can eliminate the options 'artwork' and 'exhibits'. \n3. The given choices are A: artwork, B: paintings, C: new artwork, D: exhibits and E: different pieces.\n4. The only option that does not suggest viewing or seeing is'see'.\n5. A: artwork refers to the object itse'f, and not the view or sight of it.\n6. This means that she would have been looking at artwork, so she does not directly \"see\" it.\n7. The same reasoning can be applied to B: paintings.\n8. When asked if she saw the new artwork, we can assume that she saw the art, but doesn't directly see", "answer": "E: toy store"}
{"text": ", pocket, solution to problem, and open doors.\n5. Out of all these, turn lock is the least likely because it is more specific and requires key turning to lock a door.\n6. A: turn lock and B: pocket, as they are both generic terms, may seem like fitting options, but they do not provide specific answers to the question. Also, they do not account for the specific act of \"opening doors\" provided in the question.\n7 So, among D: pocket and E: open doors, open doors seems more plausible because the person has the key, and has already done everything else, so he is more likely to open doors next rather than take off his jacket which is what D: pocket refers to.\n8. Thus, the answer would be E: open doors.\nAnswer: E. open doors\n\nInput: As a parent, I have a responsibility to care for my child.

{"text": ", pocket, open doors, and solution to problem.\n5. Turning a lock or opening a door is unlikely since he has already opened his door. The given choice 'pocket' is too general; you could put anything in a pocket.\n6. Lastly, we can eliminate choice 'pocket' as well since 'pocket' refers to keeping your belongings with you, and the problem is a solution to a problem about keys.\n7. So, the only remaining choices to choose from are opening doors and solution to problem, the former being a logical option given the previous actions that the individual has performed.\n8.

Choices:  _A_: eating a salad a day  _B_: not being in too much pain  _C_: having a big breakfast  _D_: having a big dinner  _E_: getting medicine from pharmacy\nRationales: A: eating a salads a day is not the best solution for securing someone who is sick from food poisoning because eating lettuce alone is insufficient to be safe from food poisoning.\nB: this option does not mean \"not being in too much pain\".\nC & D: they do not help prevent food poisoning.\nE: this does not prevent people from food poisoning, but it is used to treat someone who is already affected with food poisoning.\n\nThe correct answer is E: getting medicine from pharmacies.\n\nAnswer: C: having a big breakfast\n\nInput: A very hot summer.

Choices: A: a radio, B: a CD, C: a GPS, D: the latest design\nRationales: There is no evidence of what the radio, CD, or GPS could be.

'Pocket' in option A: turn lock means just putting a key in one's pocket, not using it to do anything.\n7. 'Pocket' cannot be the best option for his action since it just involves 'having a key in a pocket'.\n8. This leaves us with A: turn lock and B: solution to problem as viable choices.\n9. 'Solution to problem' is a vague choice that does not provide information about the kind of issue in the given situation.\n10.

Choices:  F: Stinking A: Roses B: Chocolat C: Lavender D: Old Books E: Bitter Coffee\nRationales: The question starts with the term  \"He found some stinky shoe in the backroom,\" which implies the presence of an unusual smell - possibly a bad one.\nAn underrated smell is one that is not commonly regarded as a pleasant smell. So, we will be trying to find an underrated smella based on the fact that the person found shoes stinky.\n\n1. Let's look at the given options, first, we eliminate C: Lavender as the given statement specifically states that only a stinky smell is available at the moment.\n2. We also eliminate D: Old Books because the word \"old\" implies that the smell is a bad one.\n3. If the given statement is true and there is only bad smell, the other smells mentioned do not meet the criteria of being an underrated smel.\n4. That leaves the options F: Stinking and B: Chocolata as viable answers.\n\n5. Now consider if the given bad smell is stinking, F: Stinking can be considered as a less underrated choice.\n6.

The question uses the term \"open his lock\", so the term 'open the door' does not make sense.\n9. Furthermore, solution to his problem can refer to anything from solving a problem to making a decision.\n10. Thus, the last two options left is 'open the doors' and 'pocket'.\n11.

However, using the key does not include all of the ways people use a key, there are still more ways. \n6. Solution to problem could be used as a verb for finding a way out of an issue or problem, or as a verb for finding an answer to a question.\n7. Though pockets can mean something akin to a storage area, most often they refer to that which someone puts in their pockets.\n8. Hence, pocket in this sense is unlikely to be correct.\n9. Open doors could mean to physically open it, either as an action or as a verb.\n10. However, when the given options are considered, opening a lock and opening a door are very vague actions, there are other ways to open a lock or door; thus, open doors cannot be said to be the answer. \n11.

{"text": "D\n\n### Answer: D: fridge\n\n### Input\nThe forgotten leftover covered in mold is most likely a piece of food. The forgotten left overs had gotten quite an old and covered in mold most likely meaning the food was left for a long time, and was not refrigerated. The question asks where the piece of food got covered in mold. If a piece of leftover food was placed on the carpet or refrigerator the food would not have covered in mold if its not old (unless the food was already moldy when first placed, but the question clearly states leftovers)\n\n### Choice A is carpet, this makes the most logical sense of all the choices for the question, carpets are rarely in rooms where food is left (besides a kitchen for rugs) so it could not be an option, as well as the food would not have come into contact with mold from the carpet, the breadbox is not really a logical choice either, it is unlikely someone would keep a piece of lefrover in contact with a breadbox, mold thrives in places that are moist like an interior of a refrigerator or on bread and mold typically is a result of bad handling of moldy food to prevent the spread of such food, but these leftovers are more likely not at all moldy because of the situation the food has been left for over a week and mold had gotten quite old and covered in mould.", "answer": "B: refrigerator"}

The statement indicates that the individual is keeping a book, but is unable to continue reading because they do not have a place to put the book down while they read it. It says nothing about the book, and asks only where it would be stored.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe information given by the statement is that the individual is unable to continue reading the book because they have not stored the book in a bookcase. The given choices of options include A. The closet, B. The library of congress, C. The classroom, D. In Bed, and E. On The Desk. By eliminating all choices except one, we can determine if the option chosen corresponds to the information given, and therefore which choice was correct.\n\n### Choice A: The closet:\nThe statement does not refer to a closet specifically, and the book can be stored in any location where books can be stored. We eliminate A.\n\n### choice B: the library of congress:\nThe statement does say that the book is being held on the desk, and since the desk is the only point of reference in the statement, we can eliminate choice b.\n\n### Option c: the classroom:\nThe book is being read, and the author is unable to continue reading due to a lack of place for it to lay.

Choice A, auditorium, makes the most sense among the options given. Auditorium is a large place where people can gather to sit in front of speakers.\n4. Choices B, C, D, and E, are not related to where people might gather to listen to a speech. While it makes some sense for a synagogue to host such a meeting since congregants tend to gather there, it still should be a large room, so synagogue might not be the right answer. A church would be similar, a confession office would be a place for speaking, but it's the wrong place since it's not located in an auditorium. \n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct answer is A - auditorium.

This is similar to shame, but is a feeling of embarrasment that stems from outside stimuli.

{"text": "\"What might a kid do before going to play?\"\n\n\"I'll explain my thinking.\"\n\n\"There might be various actions one could take 'before playing' including all of the following:\n\n- **laugh** in the way kids do (e.g. hysterically)\n- **be entertained** by what others are doing or saying\n- **sit** still or watch carefully before getting active\n- **being engaged** in math\n- **meet** other people who will perhaps later play with one\"\n\n### Analysis\nAnalysis: The question describes what one might do. In one-word formulations, the question suggests that the kids are going to play for a while but a kid is asking what he might do before that happens. One might \"meet\" some people, \"be entertained\", \"be engaged\", or \"being with people who play\"... but it is a little vague. Perhaps that is the author, perhaps it is the reader.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the author should provide two explanations. The first is before. The second is after. The first could be \"being with people\" while the second could be \"getting active\" with said people.\n\n### Question:What should you do next when the alarm goes off?

The question requires you to identify the choice which means this person requests, calls, demands or explains.\n\n2. Let us examine each of 6 choices:\n\nA: The choice A suggests \"call\". However, calling is a different process entirely than requesting. \n\nB: This choice suggests a demand is in order. This cannot be done as it would be too rude and obnoxious.\n\nC: The choice C suggests that you \"request\". This is what the customer in the scenario is trying to do as she is requesting her paycheck. \n\nD: The last choice is \"explain\". This is likely a solution to the bank's poor behaviour but not a customer's request for an explanation.\n\nE: Finally, the choice E says to request. This choice is likely the best one to select as it is the correct verb choice and is also the solution the situation requires.

For example, the goal of \"paying bills is to pay off debts\" or \"pay off debts is to pay bills\". In other words, paying bills and debt paying are both activities that are conducted to accomplish a certain goal.\n- Choice B, \"making money\" is still not the correct option because making money is still a certain activity that a person may do at one time in order to create money.

With that interpretation in mind, we proceed by considering each of the other options.\n\nChoice A: \"public place\". This choice would suggest that people travel in a public place. Traveling in space is not likely to take place in a public place, so B is not correct.\n\nChoice B: \"space shuttle\". This choice is a vehicle for traveling in space. Choice C could be related to this answer as well, but there are many different kinds of space travel, including shuttles, aircraft, and ships. While \"roadblock\" is not specific to space travel, it is specific to space travel in a space shuttle, and may be the best selection. Therefore, the answer would be C, \"space shuttle.\"\n\nAnswer: C: space shuttles\n\nInput: A new type of engine was invented and now it is the 400 horsepower engine. A new car came out and it now has the 600 horsepower engine, will it go faster than the 400? Choices: 1 A: no 2 B: yes 3 C: depends on the speed of the car 4 D: depends on the speed limits E: depends on the quality of the engine\nRationales: Begin by understanding the question. It asks whether a new kind of engine will make a new car go faster or not.\n1. We start eliminating some of the choices. \n2. The new kind of engine is 400 horse power, which is less than the new car's engine of 600. So 1 must be correct.\n3. The new car's engine is called 600, but it may be referred to in another unit like miles or kilograms. To keep the question simple, assume it's in feet.\n4. The engine's power does not directly affect how fast a car can go. That is determined by a number of other factors.\n5. Choices C and D express this, but the question does not ask if different engine power will make cars go faster or not", "answer": "C: space shuttle"}

Refrigerators preserve food, but a turkey is already cooked so it wouldn't benefit from a refrigerator.\n\n#### The second answer choice: B is fridge. This isn't just a refrigerator, but a large cabinet-style fridge that can contain and store food. This is a good answer choice.\n\n#### The third answer choice: C is freezer. This is a good choice because in this situation, a fridge wouldn't help but a freezer would keep the food from spoiling.\n\n#### The fourth answer choice: E bought at store. A turkey is already bought at a store, so it's already been stored. It doesn't need to be bought at a store, it already was. In this context, this answer choice is incorrect.\n\n#### The last answer choice: D is oven. An oven is used to cook food, not store it. If the turkey was partially cooked and needed to be baked after a while, the oven would be appropriate. In this case, an oven is not useful.\n\nOverall, the most likely answer choice is fridge.

A person who wants a loan could be eligible for a bank loan, but could also be eligible for getting a credit card. They could possibly apply for both if they were eligible.

Choices: A: Google B: dictionary C: phone D: library E: smartphone\n\n### Rationale: The rationale behind the answer is as follows:\n\n* Option A is \"Google\". Google is a good source of information but it requires more work and more sources to achieve the desired result.\n* Option B is \"dictionary\". A dictionary is a good source of general knowledge, however for specific knowledge one may need to consult with different source such as encyclopedia, which is not mentioned as an option.\n* Option D is \"library\". Libraries provide a great source of information as they are constantly being updated with new and used sources and books and are a good overall source of general information to reference for specific information.\n* Option E \"smartphone\" is a valid option for this question. Although, it should be emphasized is a last resort. Although the smartphone is a good source of specific information it should be used only if other resources are not available and even then should be used only when there are specific requirements for that information.\n* Option C \"phone\" is also a valid answer; however the context provided in the statement is the \"best place\" and the phone is more of a personal source of information. \n\nThere are many sources to be researched and used to find answers to questions, however a smartphone can only provide specific information to questions that may pertain to that one particular smartphone.

So based on the question, it seems as if the lab assistant got the sample \"pure\" not \"dirty\", so the right answer is D \"conataminated\". \n\nThe given choices are:\n\nChoice D is the right choice, as it states the lab assistant got the lab sample \"contaminated\". \nChoice A is unlikely, as it would be quite a stretch to call \"pure\" and \"contaminated\" one and the same thing in this case. \nChoice B is \"applied\", which is also not related to contamination. \nChoice C is \"dirty\", and once again it seems unlikely to call things like this \"dirty\". \nChoice E is \"fresh\", which once again looks out of place in this context.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D \"Contaminated\".\n\nAnswer: D: Contaminated\n\n### Input:\\` I wanted to contact someone with a particular name, what should I do?

If that person is not commonly searched for online, you may not find their information through a simple Google Search.\n\nNext we review Choice B which says \"check the person with a similar surname\". While this may be helpful in certain circumstances, the problem can arise if the person being searched for shares that name with many other people.\n\nChoice C suggests \"a directory\".

Choices:  A : Before the flood B: After the flood C: When the house is flooded D: When one's house is still wet E: After one has repaired the house.\nRationales: As per the question, we can see that what is being discussed is regarding a FEMA programme and since this is the case, we have to answer what happens after the house gets flooded. Therefore, we can eliminate A,B C and E from our choices.\nNext, we can see that D does not seem to be the answer since the question does not ask about what happens after the repair work is complete, also, the flood could have taken much more than a day to repair thus it is also ruled out.\nThis leaves D and E.

Look at each of the choices and figure out how they apply in terms of math.\n3. Evaluating each choice, we see that choice A is calculus, it's complicated math, you do the mathematics required in calculus when we're able to prove and demonstrate results that make sense.\n4. Choices B and C are both algebra, which is the most general type of math, if we were to study basic arithmetic then it's likely these would be the first subjects we choose, since they're the most basic.\n5. Choices D and E are trigonometry and statistics. Statistics are more complicated than the rest, since it requires the input of data that is organized, like a table. \n6.

This seems unlikely, as cabinets usually are filled with items you can buy, not those that are not for sale. \t\n\nChoice B:  computer printer. While it is possible that large pieces of paper were once produced by printers, printers are much more likely to produce small pieces of paper like inkjet, laser or photo paper. Furthermore, if large pieces of paper were being produced by printers, the computer printers would likely be owned companies and not available to the general public. \n\nChoice C: suitcase. Large pieces of paper are not normally stored in suitcases. Like cabinets, suitcases only store things that are for sale.\n\nChoice D: office supply store. This is a likely choice, as it is where most people are likely to buy paper. \n\nLastly, the choice E is an artist\u2019s studio. While it is possible a studio might have some large pieces of paper for sale, it is doubtful whether it would not be for sale. Furthermore, it seems unreasonable for this to be the answer as if the paper had been for sale and the artist had made some profit off it then it seems reasonable to think that they would likely be selling it for a profit and not giving it away. \n\nThere is only one choice that makes sense for this question, which is choice D, the office supply store.

However, this makes no sense, as James's bouncy ball can't move unless it is in action.\n\nChoice C suggests that the ball is \"active\". This is correct; when James wakes up in the morning, his ball is always \"active\", and so it changes from being at \"rest\" to \"active\" or \"upside down\".\n\nChoice D suggests the ball is \"waking\". However, this is an expression of activity, and not a state of the ball.\n\nLastly choice E states that the ball is in \"rest\". This does not make any sense since James's ball must be in active state since it does not get any rest.

Therefore, this cannot be the correct answer.\n\n3. Choice C, \"the kitchen cupboard\" is the most likely answer because of the way it is structured. \"The\", \"a\", and \"the\" can be replaced with a space if not necessary. Kitchen Cupboard would be the most logical answer:\n\nKitchen : a room in a house where you cook and eat food, not usually used to describe a place where people keep other items.\nCupboard : a box to store things.\nTherefore, \"Kitchen Cupboard\" makes the most sense because it can describe the place, the object, and its function.\n\n4. Choice D, \"Italian Restaurant\", is a restaurant, not a room in a house or place where people normally keep things. In fact, restaurants generally are not used to keep things unless they open a retail establishment or a food/specialty supply establishment.

This verb refers to a state or status of being while playing music is a thing you do. \n\nThere is nothing else in the question to help decipher what the writer would do and why. Therefore, the only choices that fit into the question are those ones related to listening and playing music. After discounting D and E, there is only one option that fits. \n\n### Choices:\n(1) Skate is not a verb, but a noun, which means it will not fit the question.\n(2) \"Play piano\" is what the writer wants to do, but can also be associated as something that is already completed. This means the writer will not be doing it in the future because it has already been done.\n(3) \"Fiddle\" does not fall into the \"playing music\" or \"listening\" category, so can be excluded easily.\n(4) \"Play piano\" can be the answer in the event that the writer wants to complete the activity, however, we cannot count out option B because of this.\n\n### (1) \n(1) \"Have fun\" is another verb, but in the question \"play music to\" is used.

Choices: \n\n### Response : \n\n### Inputs are an essential part of an experiment because they are used to control variables. Without controls, it is impossible to draw meaningful conclusions or generalizations about the experiment. \n\n### Choice A states: In other words, it enables scientists to control the variables during an experiment. \"Control\" is an important word in this context. It is used to describe a way to limit how some aspects of an experiment can affect the results. An instrument cannot control a variable as that would go against the definition of a variable.\n\n### Choices B, C, and D all talk about measurement or measuring.

{"text": "Answer: D: christmas tree\n\nGift wrapping is a common Christmas tradition and gift wrapping paper is available in most grocery and department stores. This means that the items should be in close proximity to the tree which is often located in the living room within easy reach from the kitchen or bedroom. Furthermore, wrapping paper is not typically stored beneath any type of tree, because it would be too cumbersome and could potentially tear if too much weight is applied.\n\n**Rubric**\n\nCriteria | Exemplary          | Acceptable   | Insufficient         \n--- | ---   | --- | ---  \nRationale | This criteria provides rational explanations for both correct and incorrect options.  | This criteria provides rational explanation for ONE of the correct options. | This criteria provides rational exlanation for NO correct options. \n\n### Instuction:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Choices:  A : Department Store\n\n## Rationale:\n\nThis answer choice is incorrect because the mother wraps the gift under the Christmas tree. She does not wrap the gift as a present for a particular department store. The mother is gift wrapping the presents, not the department stores herself (the wrapping paper itself would be a present, but the wrapping paper itself is not a department).\n\n## Choices :  B : Fraizer fur\n\n## Rationale :\n\nThis answer choice does not make sense either, as the mother would not wrap a gift for someone in the fur business. If we know that the child receiving the gift is not yet aware of what the parent is wrapping, we would not be able to rule out if this could be a business, or instead a pet. This creates a lot of uncertainty and makes it the incorrect answer.\n\n## Choice C : speciality store\n\n## Rationale\n\nSpeciality store is a good guess for this question, but we can't entirely rule out that the gift is not for a Fur store. As we are not sure what kind of pet the child has, we have no way of ruling out that the speciality store is not also the pet store for that particular type of pet. So we cannot assume that the child will not receive the gift because the child receives a gift from a pet store owner for having a pet of that type.\n## Choice D : Christmas Tree\n\n## Rationale \n\nThis answer choice", "answer": "D: christmas tree"}

Look at the four choices and write down if each choice could be used to describe any of the options from the question. \n\na) Choice A suggests that the boss is overbeseing, but nothing is mentioned about the personality or character of the boss. \n\nb) Choice B suggests that the boss can be disrespectful towards their staff. \n\nc) Choice C suggests that the boss may be kind to their subordinates. \n\nd) Choice D suggest's that the boss isn't kind to staff but doesn't mention if that boss is disrespectful. \n\n3. Now that we have eliminated the choices that don't match any of the four bosses, it's time to look at which ones are right. \n\na. What could Boss C be called? Kind : Boss C could be called kind because his actions were helpful and he showed that he cared and respected the employee\n\nb. What could Boss D be called? Kind (or caring) : Boss D could be described as either caring or kind because of their behavior\n\n\nc. What could Boss A be called? Dependance: Boss A is bossing the employee so they cannot make their own decisions or do their own tasks which results in dependence from the employee\n\nd. What could Boss B be called?

{"text": "Analysis of choices: Choice A is \"remember\". While it's possible that you can't \"remember\" things at a casino, this is not the most logical answer. You could in theory be forbidden from \"remembering\" details after the fact, but this is not relevant to the question.\n\nChoice B is to \"help\". This is possible, but it's not what they're asking. \"Helping\" can mean a lot of things. It could mean anything from handing someone a glass of water to cheating to playing a different game than what you're actually permitted to play.\n\nChoice C \"count\". This isn't allowed in casinos, which is the question I'm trying to answer.\n\nChoice D, \"winning\". In theory, it is possible to be prohibited from winning, but this does not make sense as the question is about what you can't do, not what you can't win.\n\nLastly is choice E, \"dealing\". The options to deal cards are in effect doing what it says on the tin. Dealing is what it says it is. This is not a correct answer as it fits the situation.\n\nTherefore, an accurate response is that there is nothing illegal you are prohibited from doing when you play cards at casinos. There isn't anything illegal to 'do' because the problem asked what you are prohibited from, as opposed to what you are allowed to.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNothing is illegal to do when playing cards in a casino.\n\n\n### Input : Can you please do the shopping or will a friend please help me out?\n\n\nAnalysis: The question asks how to refer friend asking for help in English.\n\nChoice A is \"shopping\". While this is a commonly known phrase, it doesn't quite fit the question. The friend is asking for help and the phrase \"shopping\" has nothing to do with a friend.\n\nChoice B would be \"please\". This is correct, as it is a pleading tone, asking the friend for help. However, the word \"please\" is not the full sentence or \"how are you\".\n\nChoice C would be \"friend\".

This is incorrect because judges are deciding on who is best, not on who has done worse.\n\nChoice B: judging suggests that judges know the difference between the pigs and are able to determine the winnners properly. There is no hint of evaluating them.\n\nChoice C: responsibility implies that when judging pigs, judges must be accountable for their decisions. While this is part of assessment, it doesn't have to do with the decision making process of the pig judging.\n\nChoice D: evaluating suggests that judges know how to determine the best pig in a fair. Judging is the process of choosing the winner, evaluation is determining how well one can do compared to the rest.\n\nChoice E: prejudice would be the best answer. Prejudice is an inclination to favor or dislike based on incomplete information or on a bias, which explains our choice.\n\nTherefore in order to avoid prejudice, we should not look at the judges experience, their responsibility, or their evaluation because those don't necessarily affect the way they make decisions.\nRather, if we look at the fair, it's easy to spot a prejudiced judge: they favor a specialized pig over all the others.\n\nSince it's unlikely to spot a judge who doesn't favor his preferred animals, it would only be fair to choose the answer Choice E.

This is the correct answer because a \"vote\" is an action a person uses to choose something or someone. Voting is the main way for a person to express their opinion about political and social issues.

First, Choice 2, Operation A, B, C, D, E, is likely to be unavailable because it is an unusual phrasing. However, Operations 2 and 4, B and C, respectively, refer to specific procedures in the medical field. Therefore, these two are possible answers to the question.\n3) Consider Choice 5 for an alternative interpretation that makes it easier to understand the context of the question.

It is possible for a person to give the grave to the church or arlington, but still, they\u2019ll need a cemetery.  This doesn\u2019t mean that there isn\u2019t a chance for a church or arlington to be considered, because they can be considered.

Because the players sat emotionless (rather than scream in terror as normal) they were likely playing poker. Poker is a card game and also an abbreviation for \"poker face\".

Let's look at choices A-E.\n\n3. First choice A, which is 'food court' refers to some kind of public area where people can eat. It likely would be some kind of public area that is near food and is popular. Therefore, it does not meet the criterion of living within a heavily populated area.\n\n4. Option B, which is 'Jerusalem' is another area where people can buy food. However, it likely is not heavily populated. As such, we cannot select it as an answer.\n\n5. Option C which is 'New York City' is a heavily populated area in the United States. We are looking for a heavily populated location, so this is a good choice.\n\n6. Choice E, which is 'town' is an unspecific location that could be anywhere. We are looking for some place other than a food court or a heavily populated area. So, we can eliminate it.\n\n7.

Therefore, it is safe to assume that any type of theatre would be present in the choices we have been given.\n\nIf we look at the choices provided, we can see that a school and populated area can potentially be related to theatre, as they are education and people related, respectively. However, churches and military bases are completely unrelated to theatre, as they refer to places of worship and warfare.\n\nFinally, the last choice, opera, can potentially be related to theater, since it is a type of performance that may be considered theater. However, the word \"opera\" is very specific in its meaning and relates to a specific musical genre, so it cannot be used as a catch-all answer.\n\nAfter taking these considerations into account, we can conclude that the best answer is D: E: church, as the word \"church\" refers to any place of worship, and therefore, any type of theater could potentially be present there.\n\n### Input:`When to turn a boring project into an adventure?

Choices: \n* A: Use a map with the gas station starred\n* B: Get out of the car\n* C: Drive southwest\n* D: Drive\n* E: Get a hitch-hiker\n\n### Response\uff1ause the map with the gas station stared.\n\n### Rationale:\nLet's look at the question carefully. It's asking \"If I wanted to go...\" It's a hypothetical prompt. As the question does not require a factual answer, but a speculation, the options are just suggestions.\nThe last 2 options (hitch hiker and drive) are similar, therefore the answer is still between C and D. We can rule out E because it's not necessary in this case. The phrase, \"get a hitch-hicker\" can be replaced with \"pick up other rider of the vehicle\". As it is written, C and D sound more promising. \nC: Driving is an action, therefore it's more realistic than getting out of the car, which is not. We can eliminate option B.\nD: \"Drive southwest\" sounds more natural than \"driving.\" As there's a gas station nearby, and the person knows where he or she is, no map is needed. So D is still in the mix.\nNow let's compare option C vs D. If option C has 4 out of 5 of the words, then it would make sense to choose it, because it is more specific. However, for some of the words, there are synonyms in English (for example \"drive\" may be replaced by \"ride\", \"go\" can replace \"go to...\"). Therefore, we conclude that option C is more specific than option D.\n\n### Analysis:\nAnswer option B: Get out of vehicle\n\nAnswer option C: Drive southwest \n\nAnswer option D: Drive\n\n### Analysis for Option E: Get a hitter hiker\n\n### Answer option C: Drive south\n\nDrive southwest could be replaced by:\nRide, travel, go\n\nDrive could be replaced by: Take, use, work, run", "answer": "D: say you're welcome"}

{"text": "The answer is C: sweating.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. Begin by understanding what cannot be enjoyed by deafen people, which is the activity sweating. A person that is singing might know they cannot be heard if the person is deaf, but this does not mean the person cannot enjoy the song they are singing. Similarly, a person that is smiling might not be able to hear.\n2. We then evaluate each choice.\n\n### Choice A: Smile: Even if someone could not hear them smile it does not mean they could not still enjoy smiling. While a deaf person would not be able to hear a person smile, it does not mean they cannot enjoy the smile.\n\n### Response B: Singing: Even if the people in the room were deaf, it would not prevent them from singing along, they can also still enjoy it.\n\n### Sweat: The act of sweating is specific for any particular time due to external factors, such as the weather and physical activity. So it will not be the same for every person. Apart from that, sweating is also an involuntary physical reaction, which means the person will have no control over it. Since there is no joy or beauty associated with sweating, it does not allow for enjoyment regardless of a person's hearing ability.\n\n### Answer: sweat", "answer": "B: singing"}
{"text": "Input: There are many cubicles in my office. They all have computers for employees, _______  for employees to do their work. Choices:  A. Teach B. Cost Money C. Do Work D. Be productive E. Help people\nDemonstration: The choice would make the most logical sense to say the employee can use the computers to do their work and is therefore the answer.\nRationales: This is a simple text-completion task. In the instructions above, there is nothing specifically related to teaching and computers. Therefore, all options which are not related to teaching are unlikely to be the right choice. As such, this task should be easier to complete because there is only one relevant option.\nNow we evaluate and compare each of the options carefully:\n\nChoice A is \"teach\", this might be used at some office but it's not suitable for every office since some of them are not designed for teaching. Thus, choice A is ruled out.\n\nChoice B is \"cost money\". We could imagine offices where computers are provided to employees because of high costs, but it's not what the instructions are asking about.\nTherefore, it's not the right option.\n\nChoice C, \"do work\", this is an accurate option because the computers in offices are there to help employees do their work.\nThis is the only correct answer so it's the right choice as well.\n\nChoice D, \"be productive\", is the same as \"do work\", although it's slightly less accurate.\n\n\nLastly, and least accurately, is choice E. It's \"help people,\" this is the least accurate phrase of the choices because it's focused on an end-goal, in contrast to the direct goal of what's already stated in the instruction. \n\nSo, in the end, choice C, \"do work,\" is the best choice.\n\nThe chosen solution is: Choice C.

A church would have statues as part of its religious purpose and a large city would have a plethora of statues as a form of decoration.\n2. Choice A - church. The description of a place with many statues implies a Christian-based structure, and churches are regularly decorated with hundreds or thousands of statues and other art forms that depict religious figures.\n3. Choice B is 'theatre'. Although theatres may have statues, such as those used in the context of Shakespearean plays, the description is too vague to pinpoint a specific type of theatre. \n4. Choice C is 'large city'. This option is the most reasonable answer as a large city has many inhabitants, which is a necessary attribute to have a thousand statues. It also has a variety of areas or parks, which could potentially have statues. \n5. Choice D - water fountain. A water fountain does not feature statues as its main purpose; in fact, statues are usually erected as part of a garden or a park, and not in fountains. \n6. Choice E central park.

{"text": "1. Input: The human looked down longingly ___?__ (the context says from the space station the man is on)\n2. Choice A: The choice says he missed: the nearest house. The choice is incorrect because we know that the question is about a person in space and he wants something down below. The closest he can get to is the surface of earth. And from the surface of earth, he looks down and misses the ground or the ground below, so he won't miss the nearest house when he is in space.\n3. Choice B\nChoice B: he misses his workplace. He will miss his workplace because he is not in it, so he misses the workplace or he misses because he cannot go to work so he looks down and he misses the work.\n4. Choices C\nThe choice says: he misses: the surface of earth. he will miss earth because earth is an entity, so he misses this or since he is on it he cannot know what else exists underneath earth and that is why he looks down and miss it.

Choices D\nChoice D says: he misses his office block, it says office block and it means like the nearest building or a place he lives like a building where he stays or lives, this would be incorrect because he is in space and looking down from or at his space station.

A few options I considered were the word bank from another exercise and an educated guess.\n\n### One Option:\n### One example:\n### Answer: D\n\n### Another option:\n### Answer and explanation for the choice D\nAnother option is to use the provided choice set to determine which answer is the best. \n\n* What type of space that would be more likely to have a garden or an office building? This will help in identifying the right choice. An office building would be more likely to exist in a city. A garden would be more likely to be out in the country, possibly on a farm, or small town. \n\nThere are probably multiple answer choices that are correct for this task. \n\n### Rationale:\nA garden could be out in the country as well. There are different definitions of it. However, the location that is more likely to have gardens is probably a smaller place, most likely a rural place. \n\nSo, since the answer choices are all in the same geographical area. One of the choices, D, is the only city option that could contain a garden. Thus, answer choice D is correct.\n\n### Rationales of the other answer keys:\n\n* A department store:  This is possible, however it's not clear if this is inside or outside. A garden is more likely to be found outside and an office building is more likely to be inside. Thus, answer choice A is unlikely.\n\n* Office building:  This is unlikely. A department store would probably contain a garden as well. In this context, the word \"building\" seems to refer to a place that has many people and is probably inside. \n\n* School or garden:  This is incorrect. There isn't any information about where Sam's shoes were. Sam could be in a garden or school and would still have muddy shoes. \n\n* House:  This is also incorrect. \"House\" doesn't contain any further context and it doesn't identify what kind of house that would be.

But we haven't read anywhere in the question (yet) that the person wants to relax because they're taking vacation.\n\nContinuing to the next choice, B. The question has mentioned that people take vacation for good things in life.

The closet is only likely to have clothes that the one who purchased them was wearing. In addition, it is unlikely that a person would go to a specific cinema hall or mall to purchase clothes. Only a department store could be the one that purchased the clothing, as it was more expensive than a movie theatre or other shopping spaces.

Choices:  D: personal  E: job  F: name  G: birthplace\n\n### Rationales:\nIn this question, the person asking the question is searching for information that might have a certain meaning or importance to them. As personal information and birthplaces can be linked, it is best to rule these out as being the most important information. This leaves us with the choice of job and name. To get more information, we first need to know the context.\n\n### Response 2:\n\nThis could be relevant, as personal information could have implications for job search, such as a name or birthplace match, for example, where a name or birthplace were common to the person searching, but the names were different. This leaves us with a match with jobs, and name as a possibility. The best answer is G.\n\n### Avoid inaccurate information from multiple choice questions: If there is only one correct response, the rationale is that the response should be true in most, if not all, circumstances. If many, if not all, of the choices can be correct in particular circumstances, then the question is often ambiguous and should be phrased or constructed so that the correct response is easy to find. For example, suppose a sentence provides an example in which multiple statements are true. In this case, one should choose the choice that, if removed, leaves all of the other choices true as well. In some cases, the context or nature of the question can create confusion among many of the responses. When such ambiguity occurs, the response can be wrong.", "answer": "B: mall"}

{"text": "The answer is B.\n### Explanation:\nIn this question, we are being asked why a person is approached by a lot of different people.\n\nThe first step to solving this question is to evaluate the choices.\n\nAnswer A is \"care.\"  While being cared about could cause a person to be approached, this would be too specific, and it doesn't explain why being cared about causes people to approach. In addition, the wording of the question implies that being approached is ongoing, so taking care of someone may not be the cause.\n\nAnswer B is \"compliments.\" Compliments would cause some people to be approached more often, but again, the wording of this question points to ongoing behavior in the response.\n\nAnswer C is \"know all.\"  Having knowledge about a person would cause a person to be more approachable, so this is out.  This response still does not address why a lot of people are coming up to an individual.\n\nAnswer D is \"popularity.\" Popularity might cause people to be approached more, but this does not mean that a person will always be approached by so many.\n\nLastly Answer E is \"understand themselves.\" Individuals do not understand themselves so much that they are being surrounded by a lot of people.\n\nSo, after going through all of these choices, we come to the conclusion that answer B is the most logical answer.\n\n### Inputs: I went to the grocery store and left my wallet on top of my cart. What should I do? Choices:  *A: call the grocery store\n*B: call the police\n*C: call an ambulance\n*D: call 911\n*E: lose everything\n\n### Response\nThe correct answer would be to call the police, due to the fact that the cart is in a potentially dangerous spot.", "answer": "D: popularity"}

Another one was violating a court order.\n3. Another one was trespassing into a house.\n4. Another one was stealing mail.\n5. Another one was trespasing into a house.\n6. Another one was selling illegal drugs.\n7. Another one was breaking into a house.\n8.

It's not the police's job to enforce these things.

{"text": "To store my chess paWN when I'm not using it, how about a tiny toy STORE. \n\nThe correct answer is choice E: small case. There are specific places in the question where the letter 'e' is repeated, so sometimes the letters appear similar to each other. There is no 'toy' in choice C. Although it seems logical to assume 'toy' is meant in place of 'toy store', one should verify this through examining choice C's second word,'strategy', which is not about storing chess pawns. Choice A has a's' in it that represents an 'e'. Choices B and D both have an's', but at the beginning of a word, and therefore have the possibility of representing an 'es'.

Answer: Crowds of fish \n\n### Instructions:Answer the question for the following image.\n\n### Rationales:\nChoices A and D.   The question asks to match the image with the best synonym.  \n\nChoice A: The word \"unbearable\" means painful. The dictionary definition of the term reads, \"incapable to be endured or tolerated:  intolerable.\"\n\nChoice B. The correct answer is C  This is an adjective in this context, one that is best used to describe foods, such as eggs. Thus, \"yummy\" is not the best synonym for the word in question.\n\nChoice C. \"Painful\" is the incorrect synonym and not the correct answer. While this could be deemed a painful experience, we are not given sufficient context. Thus, it is incorrect to say that it is painful.\n\nChoice D again is incorrect. There are several definitions of the word, but none of them apply to this image. While this may describe the experience of getting a vaccine injection, it does not describe the image as a whole, nor does it offer a direct correlation with the given definition.\n\nAfter taking all this into account, choice E is the best answer. \nThe answer is E.

{"text": "The correct answer is choice B - aircraft carrier. Planes that are not being utilized can be found on an aircraft carrier, which is a war ship. Also, the term \"airplanes\" is used instead of \"aircraft,\" which suggests that this context is related to the military.\n\nTherefore, we can rule out options A and C from the question. Additionally, option E (crashed planes) is too specific - we are looking for planes that are not being \"crashed\", but rather being used or utilized for some purpose.\n\nLastly option D (the graveyard), also known as aviation graveyards, is a place for airplanes that are no longer in use. These places are typically for both military and non-military aircraft.\n\nSo, the answer is airplane carrier.\n\nAnswer: B: aircraft carrier\n\n## Contents\n1.

In this situation, the question is, \"Where does a beaver live?\".\n\nThen we should evaluate the choices.\n\n* Choice A states \"wooded area\", this implies that a beaver lives in a wooded area. Beavers are an aquatic animal that live in wetlands, rivers, and lakes and build dams there to create safe havens for them and their families, so a wooded area is not a likely location for beavers to survive in.\n\n* Choices B and D both suggest that the beaver lives in a body of water, and both can be correct options. A beaver builds dams and lodges on the sides of bodies of water as their homes. Their bodies of water can be a river, lake, pond, or even a small area of land near the ocean. A body of water should be a valid option unless something like a desert is stated in the question.\n\n* Choicing C is the ocean, which is not a likely place for a beaver to survive. Beavers cannot survive in salt water; they are only adapted to survive in freshwater bodies of water.\n\n* Finally, the last choice is the \"zoo\" where a beaver may live, but this is an unrealistic choice as beavers are wild animals and cannot be kept in a zoo environment.\n\nAnswer:D: body of water", "answer": "B: body of water"}

Choices: \nA: chicken \nB: peanut butter cake \nC: chocolate \nD: chocolate chip cookie dough \nE: apple turnover\nRationales: Begin by understanding the question. The question tells you that you are making dinner for friends. It asks what you should eat before you begin grillings to keep from starving. The choices are A: Chicken, B: Peanut Butter Cake, C: Chocolate, D: Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, E: Apple Turnover\nA: Chicken is meat and is a good source of protein. Protein helps your body make new cells, repair tissue, and build muscles like your heart. It also tells your body when it is fatigued and gives you energy to complete tasks. However, chicken is not appropriate for your situation because it will take time to prepare. \nB: Peanut Butto Cake. This is not allowed before cooking because your body processes it differently than protein or carbohydrates (sugar). A healthy diet for cooking includes carbohydrated and protein. It is not allowed to eat peanut butter or cake before cooking if you do not want to be starved. It is also not a good idea to eat peanut cake after you have gone through all of the recipes.

{"text": "Answer: D: great relief\n\nChoice D is \u201cgreat relief\u201d. This is a good choice as it is accurate and correct, since \"feeling better\" is a consequence of forgiveness. It could also be expressed differently like \u201csome feeling relief\u201d.\n\nChoice A is \u201credemption\u201d. This phrase seems to be used to describe a feeling of hope. While redemption may be a side effect of forgiveness, it is not always the case. In some cases, one could be redeemed from guilt or mistakes but still choose not to forgive.\n\nChoice B is \u201cisolation\u201d. When people are isolated or separated from others, the relationships they have are impacted. In some cases, this is a result of forgiveness. However, there are other reasons people may be separated from others.\n\nChoice C, \u201cabsolution\u201d.

The one you select for each setting will determine how the camera records a photo.\n\n### Choice A\n\n#### Rationale:\nYou'll need to keep in mind that the word \"Resolution\" in this context means _how fine_ an image is _when it's enlarged._ Higher resolution will result in a higher-quality image.\n\n#### Choice B\n\n#### Rationale\nSince the screenshot's example shows Resolution as being set to 4 MegaPixels, you'll need to set it to 4. This will result in a higher image quality.\n\n#### Choices C\n\n#### Rationale.\nLowering the resolution will make your photo less clear when enlarged and will result in lower quality.

Choice B is that the scientist wanted to learn what had made him feel so tired recently. An analysis of the provided choices reveal that choice B is the most appropriate choice for a number of reasons. \n\nChoice A is incorrect because the phrase in reference doesn't necessarily state that he wanted to perform experiments rather he was just curious about why he felt so tired.\n\nChoice C states that the scientist was interested in the past but that's not what was asked. The question asked why the scientist had been curious about his tired feeling and how he wanted to find out what had caused him to feel tired recently. Therefore, choice C does not reflect the right answer.\n\nChoice D suggests that the scientist wasn't interested in learning more but that he wanted to perform an experiment in which he would put his name on everything he had found. While this may seem like an appropriate response, it is not what is asked. \n\nLastly, the", "answer": "C: enjoy"}
{"text": "The question asks about whether the rug was for any one of several purposes including the house, living room, desk table, or Persia. \n\nConsidering the context, a mother with a desk probably uses the desk and house interchangeably. A rug can be used in multiple areas, so even \"Persia\", as it's often spelt, which was historically a region, may work. \n\nHowever, given that we do not know the name of the mother we must not make that assumption.\n\nTherefore, we can eliminate \"desk\", \"rugg\" \"living room\" and \"persia\".\n\nAs the question asks for a rug that can be used for a particular purpose, only two options we can eliminate is B & C. Given that A does not have a word, it can't be any word, it is correct. B&C, however, can include words to form valid sentences.\n\nB has table, and C includes living room, each of these is a place to use a rug.\n\nTherefore our final answer will be B. Table.\nAnswer: B: table\n\n### Input - The teacher left his pencil at home but he taught anyway? \n### Response - The question asks whether or not it's strange that the teacher taught without a pencil. \n\nAs we are not provided any other information besides the teacher and the pencil then he can't leave it at home because of a specific reason. \n\nTo answer this question we should only take the \"and\" as it does not change the sentence. \n\nThen we must check any of the options given.\n\nThey are:  \nA: stranger. It's already strange to not have things on the school bench.\nB: unnoticeable. The pencil is so common it might seem weird if he were to teach without it.\nC: impossible.

In order to find the right option, we need to eliminate possible options:\n2.1 Eliminating option A:  _believe in god_  - people may meet in some religious context, but it will require different actions, because usually people spend time with their fellows to have some interaction.\n2.2 Eliminating option B: _pay bills_ - it is not an activity people do together, they often do that in separate places or alone.\n3.  Now we are left with the four following options:\n4. First, we evaluate option C - _group together_, it does not tell us anything about people interacting with one another, therefore, it will be eliminated.\n5.  In the next analysis, we will evaluate the final choice - _enjoy themselves_, so let's look at what this means for people - it is what they do when they are together, which is the same action as in our question.

{"text": "In this context, \"listening\" is defined by one's ability to \"gain experience\", while it is a given that they must be attentive and pay attention to what the professor says in order to learn.\n\n### Reasoning:  A: gaining experience - gaining experience is an outcome because we only gain experience as we do and observe things. And listening is an activity, therefore it is not gaining experience.\n\n    B: taking notes - Taking notes is an outcome because it is necessary to write notes in order to use them as reference in the future.

Choices: 1 A: 3 B: 24 C: 6 D: 13 E: 24hrs \n\n### Response\n\n\nThe answer would most likely be A: 3.\n\nFor instance, if a person worked a standard 8-hour day, they might work for 3.25 of the 48 possible hours in a single week. Likewise, if a person worked for 1.25 of the possible 300 possible days in a year, they might work 1.5 weeks of the year, which only totals 2.5 weeks of work. In essence, this means that 365 days/year x 2.5 weeks = 91.25 weeks x 8 working hours/week = 740 hours, which is approximately 30/hours/year.\n\nInput: How many seconds are there in a week?

Some lakes are located in small, low-lying basins and others are located in high-lying glacial cirques. In both cases, they may be subject to periodic flooding by melting snow and ice.Lakes can be further classified as either natural or artificial. Most lakes are either naturally-occurring bodies of water, such as a lake or pond, or they are manmade.\n\n* Oceans: Salt water\n\n* Rivers: The river is the name given to that part of the river basin that drains into the ocean. The river basin extends to its outermost margin and includes all tributaries and their headwaters, which are sometimes called the \u201ccatchment\u201d. The maximum length of the river basin is about 1.0 km. The basin is usually formed by the coalescence of many smaller basins; each side of a tributary, or the edge of a small delta, is a distinct basin. Tributaries join the river from all directions and the river widens to account for the larger volume of water.\n\n* Swimming pools: A swimming pool is an enclosed body of water, usually in a swimming pool which usually contains water.\n\n* Lakes are classified as either natural lakes or artificial lakes.

A bay is a body of water or an indentation or recess in the side of a larger body of water such as a lake or ocean. There are a number of areas within an oceans that qualify as bays; however, \"a bay is always found\" somewhere. That'somewhere\" must be one of two choices: (1) lake or (2) ocean.\n\nChoice (A) 'lake' is too broad of an area to include a bay. This body of water can be large (Lake Superior, for example) yet it is not a bay. There are other bodies of water that are the same size (or larger, with Lake Michigan), and they would not contain a bay. The lakes that are located in the northern part of the US and Canada are not the location of bays, nor are many of the world's lakes that are located away from the northern part of the world. Bays do not occur in ponds.\n\nSimilar to (A) lake, choice (B) \"Manhattan\" is too narrow. There are a large number of bays. In the eastern US alone, there are several bodies of water that have a bay within them, which include the bays of Chesapeake, Raritan, and Delaware, to name a few. In addition to the US, there are a number of other bodies of water that contain bays. Bays can be found in the Bahamas, and in a number of other locations around the world. Bays are far too numerous to be limited to the Manhattan area.\n\nChoices (C), (D), and (E) are all geographical locations, and do not contain bays in them, even though those locations are in seas. For example, the Gulf of Mexico contains a bay in its shoreline, hence it is not a shoreline. There are numerous gulf-type bodies of water that do not qualify as having a shore line, including the Gulf of California, not located in LA. Choice (E) makes the assumption that bays are only found in LA, whereas bays are throughout the world.\n\nTherefore, option (B) 'Manhattan' is incorrect; likewise, (", "answer": "D: coastal area"}

However, it might have been broken or it might have been one of the many possible parts of the bus.\nChoice  C: The  engine quit \u2013 This was not possible since we don't know that the engine is connected to the axel, or even that an axel causes the engine to stop.\nChoice D: A gear snapped or a brake locked \u2013 This was most likely a false alarm.

{"text": "Your guess for this question was wrong. It is D: bad. \n\n### Explanation:\nYour guess for this was wrong. The explanation as to why:\n\nAnswer choice A: plain. The word plain is an adjective that would be used to describe the type of clouds in question. For example, a blanket of white clouds, which can be plain. Therefore this cannot be the correct answer choice. \n\nAnswer choice B: cold. The word cold can be used to describe the temperature or weather conditions of the clouds themselves, but it cannot be used to describe what would happen if you saw the clouds. It would be more accurate to say that if you saw beautiful clouds it would feel cold in general, but not because of seeing the clouds.\n\nAnswer choice C: dull. The word dull generally means something that is not bright, vivid, or attractive. It usually refers to a personality or character qualities. For example, someone who is dull is not very interesting, enthusiastic, or exciting. Since beauty cannot be described using the adjective dull, it cannot be the correct answer.\n\nAnswer choice D: bad. The word bad can mean something that is not good or pleasant, but it can also be used for bad weather or conditions. For example, you might say that the weather is bad if it is raining, cloudy, or cold. Therefore, if it is cloudy and sunny outside, seeing beautiful clouds could be described as bad in the sense that the weather conditions might not be ideal for enjoying the outdoors.\n\nAnswer choice E: wet.

They are:\n\nHe ate lunch, but he did not eat it slowly\nHe left the restaurant fast.\n\nBy analysing the situation using the key elements, we can determine that the correct answer must be a statement that will help answer the question.\nIn other words, based on the information available, it seems likely that he was eating quickly, which led to him feeling a need to hurry when he saw his watch.\n\nThat the answer is A is confirmed by considering the four potential answers.\n\nThe answer choice letter A is a good option because it describes a situation where the person tries to eat quickly and becomes full. Because he feels too full, he decides to hurry.\n\nWhile all the remaining answers are plausible, the others do not indicate the man eating so quickly that he feels the need to hurry when looking at his watch. \n\nThere is another possible answer that will be explained later. \n\n#### Rationale \n\nThe answer choice B and D, \"late for work\" and \"bad breath\" can also be correct answers, but they don't provide supporting information to show that the man feels so full that he rushes when he looks at his watch.\nIt is highly unlikely that the man is eating so quickly that they get full, because their bad taste or late for work can be caused by many other factors.\n\nTo further demonstrate this point, consider answer choice C \u2013 \"heartburn\".If the man had eaten so fast that he became full, there is no guarantee that his heartburn was due to rushing when he looked at his clock. There are many other causes of heartburn.\n\nTherefore, since the only remaining choice is \"gain weight\" and the answer is supported by information", "answer": "B: late for work"}

This is unlikely because a phone number will provide other numbers, but not provide detailed information on the weather.\n\nChoice B: internet. It's unlikely that internet will provide reliable information that can be trusted because it can be easily modified by anyone or be inaccurate. In addition, internet is not always reliable, so it is not the best option in this situation. \n\nChoice C is a satellite. Sending information via satellite is not commonly known for its reliability or availability since this technology is still experimental and expensive.\n\nChoice D: telegram. This is a form of communication that has almost been forgotten since the invention of computers and the internet. It seems like an unlikely choice in this situation.\n\nLastly choice E is the radio.

The following choices for the storage location can be chosen: The basement - the last location where we can store the material. If it is dirty we can put it in the basement. Warehouse - the last place we will have a collection to check out. The front of the storage room- the farmer would like to go last or the middle. If it is dirty, put it here. The back of the storage room- another place where the dirty one is placed. All the rooms - it is not important to the farmer where the things are located.\nReview: It seems like it's better to put the dirty things at the end of the farmer. The basement is at the bottom of the structure under the soil. Here is the last place that is not dirty. If we think dirty or clean, we think of the bottom. So that will be here. In fact, the basement here is where the farmer put down the dirty stuff. The farmer will not need to see it. The back room and garage are the last places for storage. Back Rooms will be the farthest away from the farmer and farthest from the door. So maybe the farmer wants to go last or middle. So back rooms are the best.\n\n### The farmer asked you to check your inventory. Where should you start looking?

A car cannot be called a bicycle, so it cannot be used in this situation.\nChoice B is 'a motorcycle'. This choice does not make sense here. Just like cars, motorcycles have been excluded.\nChoice C is an 'electric bicycle'. The choice is not very precise, since the wording suggests that it could be just any electric bicycle. All bikes are different, so using such a vague wording in this context is problematic.\nChoice D is a 'tricycle'. A tricycle could be a bicycle if the person owns only 3 of them. However, in this case there are 4 bicycles, which leads us to conclusion that this is not the best choice.\nThe only possible choice is 'E', which is a'mountain bike.' The given person owns 4 bicycles and this one type of bike will not over-full his 4-person capacity.

{"text": "As in the previous question, it is important to understand the specific question and what each choice really means. For my response, I am going to review each choice:\n\nChoice A is a \u2018pub\u2019. This is essentially a bar that serves food and drinks. While a bar would probably have some of the food items the person is interested in, this place likely wouldn\u2019t have it all, and there may even be rules about bringing food in from other establishments. A better choice would probably be somewhere where the food and beer are one and the same.\n\nChoice B is a \u2018plane\u2019. This is likely a reference to fried chicken wings or other fried foods since, for example, eating a beer and a sandwich would likely fall under pubs. However, in most cases, they\u2019d probably be better off visiting a bar.\n\nChoice C \u2018is beer\u2019. While this may be true and allude to beer being a choice for fried food, it\u2019s likely a reference to where one may consume beers, which would be a bar.\n\nLastly is choice D, \u2018store\u2019. This would be a good answer if the question was something more like, \u2018how do I find all of the alcohol stores in X location?\u2019, which it\u2019s not. It seems more suited for the first option, pub. Stores are good for fried food if they offer a full-service kitchen, but it is not a necessary option since we already know that places where people drink beer are usually places where fried foods are served as well.\n\nFinally is the option E, \u2018fraternity house\u2019, which would also be a great answer for the pub or beer choices, but it is unlikely to be included. These are not generally public houses, but instead private. Also, there is a possibility that this would refer to something like a frat party, and this seems to conflict with the goal of finding alcohol and fried. For these reasons, I would lean more toward an answer like \u2018frat party\u2019.\n\nOverall, my suggestion is that the best answer is \u2018bar\u2019.\n\nResponse: Bar\n\n### Input:\"Tell me all of your favorite books,\" the librarian insisted.

(To do so, please read our [Evaluating Choices](/README.md) article. Note: you may be asked to evaluate more than one choice).\n3. In this case there are only one sentence and one option. Therefore, let's examine each word carefully.\n4. Evaluate the question: John loves competing, so the question assumes that one must have loved competing to have enjoyed competing. Therefore, one must have competed, which means that the question asks about competitions, what type of competitions one must have enjoyed competing in.\n5. After that, we shall look through the answers.\n6. The first choice A: winners and losing. This is true (because winning and losing happens during a competition) but not necessary. The competition is about enjoying competing, not specifically about winning.\n7. The next choice is B: performed better. It cannot be the right answer because, in the context of this question, a competition is about fun, enjoyment and enjoyment.\n8. Next, choose C: might win. This is another possibility. But again, the person does not necessarily have to win in order to have enjoyed competing, because the competition has already happened.\n9. The last choice D: losses. It shows the person does not like to participate.\n10. Finally, the last possibility is to choose E: enemies. This would be weird because everyone might have enemies, even if they dislike each other, it would not mean that they don't like being divided by their category.\n11. The conclusion is that one must look through at all the choices again and make sure to answer correctly. There might be more than one suitable answer, but we will only focus on the following choices: winning, performing better and losing. At this point, we cannot be sure which one is the correct answer \u2013 A, B, C or E \u2013 so we must begin to break down each one.\n12. Analyze each choice.\n13.

Rather than leaving the question open-ended like the example did by saying, \u201cunderwater has many dangers.\u201d This makes it unclear what\u2019s being talked about, so even with the correct answer choice, we cannot determine what information is being conveyed. \n\nChoice C, meeting new people, may make sense if you\u2019re considering divers meeting new people underwater.

Therefore, one of the choices must be false.

It would also not be false to say, \u201cI don\u2019t understand\u201d, as that is simply a person not understanding what the person next to them is saying. \n\nHowever, the remaining choices \u2013 \u201cnoise\u201d and \u201cpeople singing\u201d \u2013 directly contradict the first man's statement. Therefore, choice A and choice E cannot be accurate statements about what was heard based on the words which the man uttered outside his hotel room.\nThis information eliminates choice A and choice E because they are untrue based on the first man's sentence.\n \nIn conclusion, there would either have to be a contradiction in the sentences from the first man, indicating that he did not hear a person singing, or there would need to be a contradiction between the man's initial sentence and the sentence from the second man, that indicates that there was arguing outside his hotel room.

This may occasionally occur as a tired animal does not want to be active, but it is not the most likely action an animal will take when tired.\n\nChoice C which says: \"Keep Alive\" is not a valid choice for the question asked, since the question asks for a behavior to be likely when an animal is tired, which does not include death. \n\nChoice D \"Needs to eat\" is out of context, since the animal is already sleeping. In this case, the animal no longer needs to eat.\n\nFinally, choice E \"Goes to sleep\", it is accurate answer that an animal when tired or not can go to sleep.\n\nTherefore, the answer is E: Goes To Sleep\n\nOutput:  Answer:Goes to sleep\n\n## Description:\n\nThe task is to provide a response based on the situation described in each instruction (a set of choices and a task, such as \"fill in the blank\"). \n\nThe response should be written in the form of a sentence. \n\n> Input: A scientist needed to find out the name of a plant species.

{"text": "D: mentally challenging.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. Begin by understanding what the question asks, which is what he does every morning just to pass time.\n2. Next, look at the choices.\n3. Choice A is \"you're bored\". While this could suggest that he might need something more active to do, this reason is too vague. He can also be bored in the case of doing something boring.\n4. Choise B is \"pass time\". This is another vague reason: he can pass time with things besides crossword puzzles, such as watching TV. Also, \"passing time\" is just a matter of time, while this choice says he \"likes to do this every morning just to pass the time\".\n5. Choise C is \"relax\". If anything, he spends time solving a crossword puzzle to keep his mind sharp, which doesn't really sound like a relaxing activity.\n6. Choise D is \"mentally challenged\". This option seems to indicate that the old man chooses crossword puzzles because they present him with a mental challenge. He chooses to do crossword puzzles every day so he can solve them.\n7. Choise E could be \"pass the time\", but while passing time isn't guaranteed to be done every day, solving crossword puzzles is because they present mental challenges. Furthermore, being \"challenged\" doesn't sound like he is bored in this situation, so by combining \"mentally challenging\" and \"just to pass time\", we can eliminate them from the possible choices.\n8. After reviewing the question and all the available choices, we can determine answer is D. Mentally challenged.\n- \"You're bored\" is incorrect \n- \"Pass time\" is wrong choice. \n- \"Relax\" is also incorrect.\n- \"Challenging\" is the perfect word, but it's not mentioned anywhere in the question.\n- \"Mentally challenged\" is the most appropriate answer.\nAnswer: D.

{"text": "Choice B. \"Showers\"\n### Input:Which of the following people is most likely to be on the phone? Choices:  - A: a man - B: a mother - C: a doctor - D: a dentist - E: a sister\nRationales: We know to remove possibilities that are not humans. We now understand that a phone would not be used by a man, a mother, a doctor, or a dentist, so these people are ruled out. This leaves us to choose between either a sister or a woman. \nThe word \"woman\" describes a female human, but \"sister\" describes one of two human females who are related. So, we can eliminate the word woman and know that we are left with choosing between two human females. Both of these options appear to fit the description of \"most likely\". We know that our target individual is female, so we can eliminate the word \"man', leaving us with only one possible answer, \"Sister\". The answer is \"Sister\".\n\n### Input:\"Mrs. Brown's mother is getting married, I'm excited for the wedding. So when will it happen?\"Choices: - A: next Friday - B: next to the manger - C: a week to Saturday - D: next to the gym - E: next to the week\n\n### Response:\"Ms. Brown's mum is getting married, I am excited about the wedding.

Choices:  A. 2 - Pharmacist B. 1 - Sister C.3 - Headache D.4 - Aspirins E.7 - Recommendations\nRationales: So the question asks about a headache that can be solved with 2 or 3 aspirins. The choices for 2 and 3 mean it should take 2 aspirins and then another one the next day for it to be solved. So it's either 2 aspirins or 3 aspirin. The last choice, 4 - Aspirins, could either be the same as 2 - Pharmcist or not. So the correct", "answer": "C: dress himself"}

{"text": "For the context of this scenario, \"accompanying meal\" is not a good answer. Neither is \"waitress\" as she will not be able to tell you that they serve milk or not. Similarly, \"cafeteria\" is not suitable as the question indicates a specific drink rather than a general food item. \"Home\" will not provide you with the information you need. The only choice left is \"menu\" which the server has access to and should be able to readily provide you with that information.\n\nRationales:\n\nIf the food item in question is bread, chicken or cheese, \"accompanying to meal\" would be the suitable answer and \"home\" because you are having dinner at home. However, the question is seeking information on a drink.\n\nAs you have stated only the menu can answer this question, you need to look at what each of the options on the menu might be. Since milk is a food item that accompanies a meal, it might be listed on the 'accompaniment to meal' section of the menu. However, if this item is not listed then this is not the place on the menu to look for this information. Similarly, 'waitress' can be a helpful point of contact to receive this information, but as the question states you want to ask the server directly, you should look at the'server'. 'Cafe' is not suitable as it implies a general food point rather than a specific drink you are looking to consume. Similarly, the 'home' may be a suitable answer if you are dining at home with family but cannot be used in the context of this situation.\n\nAnswer: D. menu.\n\n### Input\uff1aI was in a restaurant and we were to decide on dessert.

Choices: A: yes B: no C: maybe D: sometimes E: sometimes not \n\nRationales: We should analyse the provided choices, and see what makes them correct as solutions. \n1. Choice A: This is too broad. If we were told that the boy ran through the library as if \"he was running from someone or thing\" we would not be as concerned as if he \"ran like a frightened animal\".\n2. Choice B: This seems too dismissive, and the boy could have simply forgotten something important. \n3. Choice C states that we shouldn't be concerned \"sometimes\", so this seems the most plausible one. We can be concerned some of the time but should still give the boy the benefit of the doubt. He could be trying to find a book, or in search of a teacher, etc.\n4.

Choice B is castle which is a large and usually fortified man-made structure, not likely a place where small knights can be found.\n4. Choose C is middle ages which is a historical period beginning a 500, in ancient civilization, but not an object or place, so it isn't suitable for the given context.\n5. Choic D is chess board that is most likely a board with small knights which makes the choice incorrect since there is no such kind of object exists.\n6.

{"text": "In the context of the given problem, the answer with the best fit to the scenario is D. Winning/losing or argument. This is because the question refers to a situation in which two people are \"competing\", so it means that they want to achieve something (such as winning or losing) or they want to argue with each other. They could try to \"stress\" or \"debate\" each other, but the wording suggests that they are trying to achieve something specific, which these options do not fully encompass. Finally, they could be in \"tension\", but this does not mean that they are competing for something.\n\nAnswer: D: the argument\n\n### Input : How can you tell two people that are arguing are getting anywhere? Choices : A : One of the two people is winning B : Both people are on the same side and not arguing against the other C : Neither party is making any sense and the arguers are not listening to what the other is saying  D : Both people are agreeing with each other E : The arguers are calm and speaking with each other.\n\n#### Explanation: One thing to do when trying to understand a choice is to re-express the text in a more succinct way that does the same work as a choice, for example, for choice A: \"a side of an argument is winning,\" but for choice B: \"there is no arguing going on at all, two people are talking and not arguing,\" the latter being more succinct and easier to remember. \n\nFurthermore, since we are looking for a way to \"tell\" that two people are \"arguing\" is getting anywhere, we look for answers that provide the opportunity to identify what people are doing, not just who is winning/losing in the context of competition. For example, a way to tell if someone is getting anywhere in an argument is to determine if they are agreeing with the other person or not. To test this, we look for answers like C, where neither party makes sense and people are not listening to each other. The other answers are either false or ambiguous when it comes to understanding whether agreement or disagreement is happening.\n\n#### Answer: Choice B, There is no arguing going because they are both speaking in harmony", "answer": "C: argument"}

This is a plausible explanation when it comes to a workplace, but not for the front door of a house.\n\nWe can also dismiss choices C and B. This is because a suitcase and classroom are locations that aren't normally places you would expect a paper notice.\n\nThe remaining choices would be A. In front of the house and D.

{"text": "### Instructions:\nInput: The obsessive man was never washing hands, he used soap.\n\n### Explanation of the above:\n\n\nRationales: From the given information, the obsessive man was likely not washing his hands with soap. Therefore, the most likely choice is B- \"irritation\". However, the wording of the given information was a little unclear in this part, it should have been \"The obsessive man always washed his hands... it caused\" irritation. This suggests that the \"always\" and \"man\" could not apply to the soap, but instead the cleanliness itself which also could mean it was from the use of soap, washing hands too much or washing them uncleanly - which further points to a use of the term cleanliness instead of soap. \n\nI have given the answer as C, cleanliness in this case because if it was a choice for the obsessive man always using soap, it wouldn't have come down to thinking, wet towel ect. It is not specified but it is most like he used it as he wanted to achieve a certain level of cleanliness, if I had to guess I would say he was trying to purify before prayer. \n\nI believe this is the most sound answer because it is consistent with 3 of the possible options, which gives it a good chance to be correct. \n\nAnswer:\nC: cleanliness", "answer": "B: irritation"}

While the North and South Pole are not in Canada, Canada does have vast regions covered in snow throughout the year. \n\nChoice E is the surface of the Earth.

{"text": "### Rationale:\nThe correct answer is choice B, water, since the question describes that you have to keep track of the amount of oxygen available. \n\nThis is because oxygen is contained in water. Oxygen is present in the water as a dissolved gas (O\u2082).\n\nHuman activity has reduced the concentration of oxygen in Earth's atmosphere. The burning of fossil fuels for energy contributes to a large part (about 75%) of the growth in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) since 1750. The remaining 25% of the increase is due to natural sources or sinks that are roughly balanced through a process called the carbon cycle. \n\nThe most significant human-related release of carbon dioxide is from the use of fossil fuels from deep within the Earth such as oil, by burning it for energy, or from coal and gas by burning it for energy and other industrial purposes. The use of coal for the generation of power (by coal-fired power plants) and for metal refining (to make steel) is the largest source of CO2 production, accounting for about 40% of global emissions. Industrial processes account for another 20%, including the production of cement and the chemical industry, and the use of gasoline for transportation.\n\n### Input\nAn experiment was conducted at work to determine if the work environment of a certain group of employees affected their productivity.

{"text": "The correct answer to this question is choice E: achromatic. The color yellow is indeed associated with the opposite of fearlessness, or \"fear\". The antonym of fearless is fear and, in fact, that is what's being asked about - the antonym of fear. \n\n### Why:The question asks about the opposite of the characteristic and wants to know what the opposite is of fearlessness. The antonym of \"fearless\" is \"fear\". Therefore, choice A should be discarded: \"fearlessness\" does not mean lack of courage. That would be courageousness or courage. In fact, it is often the case that people with a lack of fear do NOT have courage.\n\nNow, let's analyze choice B - the question asks about the opposite to fearless and we are not given antonyms for courageousness. In fact courageousness can be a state, such as \"A fearless state of mind\". \n\nChoice C - Courageous is an antonym of fear but it is not the opposite of fearless, that would be fearlessness.\n\nChoice D - Brave does not seem to be an antonym for fear.

We then find the complementary color for yellow, by looking at the color wheel for yellows and reds, we get that it is blue. Therefore, blue is the antonym of yellow.\nAnswer:  E: achromatic (yellow is an opposite of achromatic)\n\n### Instructions:\n* Input: The boss was feeling great after the successful promotion of an employee.\n\n### Output: Choice E, The boss will be sad since an employee", "answer": "A: fearless"}

Examine the first choice, Ace. If the man has an ace, he doesn't need any other cards, right? The Ace has already been used, so this is an inapplicable answer choice.\n4. Choose the second choice, Jack. The Jack is considered both higher and lower than the four, so it's inconvenient to use it.\n5. Third option, King.

Lastly, the fifth and only choice, the card that fits the criteria, is Jack the man is holding, which is B: ten.

{"text": "The correct option is D.\n\n### Rationales\n\nWhen a person laughs spontaneously it is a kind of happy reaction.\n\n### Input\n\nI must work on my computer everyday, but I don't have enough money for a computer, where can I go to look for a computer with a cheap price? Choices: \n\n1. A: local store\n\n2. B: computer store\n\n3. C: electronics\n\n4. D: used\n\nE: secondhand\n\n### Analysis\n\nAccording to choice A, it means finding a cheap computer in a local store near me. While this is a possible explanation, it is a bit vague. The question asks specifically for a new computer, not a used one. Additionally, the wording of the choice suggests that you would need to visit an actual store, which is impractical.\n\nConsidering choice B, it would mean visiting a computer store. However, we know that computers are readily available in electronics stores and may be cheaper than what could be found at a specialized computer store.\n\nChoice C, \"electronics,\" is another broad option that doesn't really indicate what type of machine we should find or the amount of money we need to spend on it. Lastly, choice E could be an option since it's usually cheaper to buy a used computer or secondhand because you can often find a deal.\n\nFrom all of the above, the most likely answer would be D: E.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nChoice E, \"secondhand,\" is the best and most efficient option. \nIt's practical and feasible to use a computer from someone else. It's an affordable solution that provides you with a new machine at a cheaper price. \n\nThere are several ways to find a used computer. The first is to look in the classifieds, where people often advertise things they don't want anymore and are willing to sell. Alternatively, there are also websites like Craigslist or eBay that specialize in used items and often have good deals on things. Finally, you could also ask around among your friends, family members, or coworkers to see if they have an old laptop or desktop that they no longer need. \n\nBy using these strategies, you will have a much greater chance", "answer": "B: humor"}

Choice D was a big city, but even if this answer were true, it wouldn't make logical sense.

E: a credit balance\n\nRationales : The question asks where one can find the balance in a gift card account online.\n1. Begin by understanding what gift cards are. They are prepaid cards used to pay for certain goods or services, often used instead of cash.\n2. Choice A is a discount coupon which is another name given to a coupon, and it's not related to a gift card.\n3. Choice B is a promotional code. This code is given as a discount for a product or purchase, not for a gift card balance.\n4. In Choice C, we have a voucher code. Voucher is typically used for redeeming a discount coupon.

An account balance is the amount of money currently on deposit in an account, while a credit balance is an asset account which serves as a store for money that doesn't belong to the company or individual which maintains the account.\n6.

To be able to answer this question, I was provided with the following rationales:\n\nSadness: Sadness is the most likely answer, this is because sadness is usually the reaction of someone who has gotten hurt, and hurt people hurt other people. Sadness could be described as an emotion of regret or sadness, and if someone feels that when doing certain things, this could easily relate back to their actions causing other people to feel the same way.\n\nGlee: This is a feeling of happy and excitement, which is most likely not something that someone who causes trouble feels. Glee is associated with events that might not have caused trouble, and so it is most likely that the opposite of glee is sadness.\n\nEmpowerment: To feel empowered is to feel more confident, and it's not necessarily a feeling that you feel when you feel regret, so empowerment is probably the least likely answer.\n\nDespair: Despair is usually associated with a feeling of hopelessness, and is an emotion that is almost always associated with feeling like you have no control over your situation.

{"text": "As you may expect, there is more than one way to skin a cat and the problem can be solved a few different ways.  Let's look at a few different ways.\n\n### Way#1 - Solved this problem with no guessing\n\nFor the solution to this problem we can simply apply the elimination process.  We could eliminate choices A, B, and C because they are all places for humans, not animals.  We can then eliminate choice D, because this is a description of an area, not a place to go (parks aren't a place to avoid, they are places to go).  Lastly, we can eliminate choice E, because it's an entire continent, which does not apply to this question.  This leaves us with choice E.\n\n### Solution\n```\nInput: John loves animals and he HATES animal abuse.\n```\nLets rephrase this sentence to: John loves animals BUT hates animal abuse!\n```\nInput 2: John loves animals but he hates animal abuses!\n```\nBecause he hates animal abues, he will avoid all locations where he could be around animals (he might encounter them in a park).  So, he goes to locations that are specificly made for the animals.\n```\nThere is a problem to be solved here. (The clue is in the question)\n```\nThe answer is: E. Park.\n```\n\n### Way #2 - Solved this problem using guess\n\nLets see how this question can be solved with guessing.\n\n### Example\nInput: John likes to ride his motorcycle down to the woods in the summer. Which location was he likely going south from: A: parking lot B: park C: pet store D: woodland E: north America\n\n### Way 2's Solution\nFrom the provided answer choices, it is implied that John would have been going down south. Now, what would a place south have to be?  Well, it can't be parking lot, or pet store since we know that he is riding his motorcycle so you don't see him at a parking spot, nor you find a pet store inside the woods (it's a place north).  A park is a place you go north (if you are in a country).  That just leaves us", "answer": "A: pet store"}

I can see that the question asked about the people that they are being, from this I can deduce that I'm being asked what type of person they are hiring from.\n\n2. The first choice in the question is A (the smartest), while this is a trait people have, it does not tell you if the person doing it is diligent or not.\n\n3.

Choice D (the most diligent) is also a good choice because not being diligent, would mean that the person may goof off from time to time which will increase the workload for the other employees as well as reduce production. \n\n5. Choice E (the oldest) is also not the best choice here either because being the oldest doesn't mean that the person will be more responsible than the rest as there are people that don't care about age or respect it but they work hard so this isn't the most suitable choice as an answer.\n\n6. Finally choice F (the tallest) may seem like a good choice, but being tall doesn't mean they'll finish a projects on time or diligently as it is just some trait of theirs that they have.

The movie is not a bad movie, but it could use a bit more action.\n\n### Answer:\n\nI thought that the movie \"Titanic\" (2017) was a great rendition of James Cameron's 1997 original movie. I loved it because it was a great romance-drama about the Titanic, which tragically sank on a cold April night in 1912. The film has no slow starts, as the characters on ship have little time to enjoy the ship since most of the women are saved via lifeboat, there are no real characters because there are a lot of characters with different personalities in one location, and the movie is not boring because there is a lot to talk about due to the events that take place.

This is a city name, not a house name. For each choice, we must determine if it is the person's name of if it is a specific place.\n\nAll other choices include the person's name, so it makes the most sense to assume that answer D is incorrect. \n\nThere is only one choice in the entire list with a place rather than a name.

Choices:  C: local A: online store  F: market D: discount store E: high end store   \n\n### Response\n\nYou need to answer the question yourself.\n\nRational:\n\nAll the choices include person or place names. To determine answers, we must determine if the choices are names of persons or places.\n\nThe question asks where they purchased the carpeting. We will use that to determine the answer.\n\nIf the place they purchased the carpet is mentioned in the question text, they will need to select that choice.\n\nFor example, if the question text said \u201cWhich store did the man buy a new carpet from,\u201d choice C is the best answer because it is a local store where he bought it.\n\nIf the location they purchased the carpet from is not mentioned in the question text then the answer is \u201cA.\u201d\n\nThis is because a choice that contains the name of a person is correct if there is no mention of where they obtained anything. To be effective, carpeting needs money, and money is an important thing to spend, so \"I spent... 1000 dollars at\" is a better answer because we know that the guy saved money buying the less expensive carpet.\n\nAnswer: C: local A: local store D: local market F: local", "answer": "B: bedroom"}

We rule out choices A and B because they are in the \"wrong\" location.\n3. Looking for a schoolroom, choice C is very likely to be right based on the definition above. This is because a school contains classrooms for children but it is not a general library where anyone can study, therefore it should meet the criteria in this situation and it checks both boxes.\n\n4.

We can eliminate all the other choices. Concentrating on \"a highschool party\", \"a picnic\", and lastly \"a classy dance\". The classy dance makes the most sense. The picnic is an outdoor event, and the high school party is definitely not classy - no one takes high school parties to be that. The high school party also doesn't seem to fit what the prompt \"I'm trying to find my memory of what.\" suggests. And the other choices also make little sense. \n\nA: Highschool party \"A concert\" is out - the prompt is about remembering and a highschool party does not seem like something that is being tried to remembered. \n\nB: Birthday party \"a school dance\" is too unspecific - the question could refer to a quinceanera, a batmitzvah, or bar mitzvah - or anything like that. \n\nC: A birthday party is still too generic, and what is a \"classy\" birthday party?\n\nD: A classy dance is the best response, because it fits best and makes logical sense in this context. \n\n### Note Taker: This is the most informative paragraph.

Note that this only works if each action has a logical outcome since there may be other possible outcomes that are less likely. \n\nFirst, the question is asking about what happens when a child receives money from their parent who passed away. We might wonder if they would go to prison. It's clear that if a child were to get inheritance from their parent that they wouldn't go to prison, therefore, we can eliminate A as an answer. Next, we eliminate B, since even if the kid left the home, they may still get inheritance from an older child or relative. Also, the home may be left behind and sold to generate more money for the child. Finally, we can eliminate C because it could happen to some extent in some cases.\n\nThe question mentions that the child gets the inheritance, but this might not be the entire inheritance. There may be other inheritances, or the child may get part of the inheritance. Therefore, the only acceptable answer is D.\n\nAnswer: D. The kid gets the inheritance.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAt the end, all we do is eliminate choices that are impossible by default or through understanding the question and reasoning out the possibilities.\n\nAnswer:\nThe correct answer is D.

{"text": "Rationales: To correctly answer this question we must understand what \"lying\" is. \n\nIf we look at the definition of to \"lie\", we see that it means to \"say what is false\". So, what are common signs that someone is telling the truth? One can ask themselves a series of questions like: Is there a person talking to me? Are they saying things I believe? Do they seem to be knowledgeable about the topic? The answers to these questions can be checked to see if the speaker is telling the truth. \n\nNext, we look at what a \"liar\" is. A liar is a person who says things that are not true to another person. From this it becomes clearer what lies are, and liars are people who tell lies.\n\nThe problem with identifying a liar is that there are many traits that are common in liars, and not all liars share these traits. \n\nWe must also remember what \"lying\" means. If someone says something that is not true, that makes them a liar. However, it is also possible to give a misleading answer as opposed to saying something that is not true. A good example of this is making an ambiguous statement, then when asked further questions, giving different answers to the same question. This type of question has been known to be used by law enforcement to get different answers out of different people.\n\nThis question is asking for clues that someone will have if they believe a person is lying. In order to identify clues for someone else, we can look at what traits liars can have.\n\nOne of these clues is avoiding eye contact with the person during a conversation. According to Scientific study[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32005996), people tend to avoid eye contact when they are telling lies.\n\nAnother popular clue that shows that someone is lying is that they feel guilty about what they have said. In many people, if they have done something wrong, a feeling of guilt may arise. This is a common feeling in children, but can also be seen in adults.\n\nA lack of blushing is also said to be a sign of lying. In fact, a study was conducted to investigate how people can determine if someone was lying[2](https://www.papersys.net/j", "answer": "B: avoid eye contact"}

For example, they need to plan their honeymoon.\n\n(e) It is unlikely that after the bride and grooms' ceremony, they continue taking care of more proposals, given that it is unlikely that a single ceremony would have so many people to propose to and arrange the wedding for.

This seems to make me wonder - who are they, are they a robot, and where are they?\n\n### Possible response:\nThere are many different possibilities as to who or why a person may sit for long periods of time over a bowl of still water.\n\nTo explore this further, let's consider the following:\n\n1) If you're standing and the water is a certain height above the ground, you may need to bend down and get your head wet if you are planning on drinking. This might cause an accident or fall that could result in serious harm.\n\nIn this scenario, you are a human being standing over a glass of water. As the water is a certain distance from the ground, you would be forced to bend over to drink the water. Not only can this cause physical harm such as a spill or fall over, but the act of bending down could mean that you are in danger of knocking something over or hurting yourself.\n\n2) Another reason for sitting over a bowl of clean water is that there is no need for water. You could be drinking it in a cup or bottle.\n\n\nHere, you are sitting at a desk with a glass of clean water placed in front of you. As you are not standing, there is no need for a bowl of water.

According to what we already know, this choice is not a model, so the proper answer is \"becomes a model\". Thus there is no other possibility than Answer choice A \"becomes a model\"\n\n### In choice B, it does not explain what \"becomes a model\", it says it only appears beautiful, so the correct answer is B. In the sentence \"What usually happens to _______\" there is the word \"model\", which is being used in the sentence as a noun, and cannot be used with a possessive (an adjective) so it is not a verb.\n\n### In Choice C, the sentence already explains what usually happens to models, so the choice only makes more complicated to understand it. The word \"people\" in the choice means that it is not necessary to apply. For example when we say, \"people suffer pain\", it is not about models suffering pain. So there is no other answer choice but the correct one, which is Answer C.\n\n### Choice D only describes what models do and it is not the question word: \"What usually happens to models\", it does not fit.\n\n### The last option answer is the only one that fits the sentence after having eliminated each of the choices.

Read the passage and choose from the choices (Mark A, B or C) which option is the correct insertion for the missing facts.\n\nWhile at school, a child may experience a disability in a classroom that can not be met by a one-size-fits-all learning program. Different disabilities require a variety of methods to address the needs of all individuals. It is important to recognize the signs of a disability and to react quickly with the best program option. According to a report from Parents & Teachers Together of the Santa Monica-Malibu Education Foundation, children with disabilities have the same rights by law to attend school as do any other child. This group has found that it takes parents often months in some cases to get a disability services program approved for their children from the school district. It often takes longer to get the program approved and a parent must take it upon themselves to be prepared to discuss their children's situation in-depth with the school board and teachers. The law states that the parents of disabled children have the right to be part of their education program if they wish to be. This can help them to better communicate with the teachers and other students about their child's situation. In California, 20.4% of school-aged children and adults have a disability which accounts for nearly three million people. Of these, more than 60 percent are able to attend school in a standard classroom with extra help. However, the report notes, the district still experiences a shortage of disability teachers. This can make it necessary to use classroom aides to assist children with disabilities and this can cause more problems for them. It is important for parents and teachers to communicate clearly and work together to have the best outcome for children with a disability.\n\n- 1: Children with disabilities are able to attend school but teachers may fail to provide them the best method to learn successfully.\n- 2: The children are not given any learning methods at schools except teachers might provide inadequate support.\n- 3: The children with disabilities require different educational programs each to meet their requirements.\n- 4: Children with disabilities have the right to be educated in a", "answer": "C: with people"}

The answer is D - a gym.\n\nThis is mainly because park is not usually found in the word gym, as a gym is a facility for physical exercises, but a garden is not necessarily a facility. A garden is sometimes outdoors as in a city park, but it can also be a garden. So this does not make sense. It seems likely that the word \"garden\" refers to the garden or gardening that Johnny is relaxing in or with, which a gym does not provide or encourage. Similarly, the sentence \"a garden and a rest state\" also does not make logical. The word \"garden\" has no other meaning, so it is very unlikely it would refer to the word \"rest\" in a sentence. Rest or resting would only be if someone was resting on a bench, and this does not make sense either.\n\nFurthermore, the word \"bench\" is also rarely a place where people take breaks. Usually, people sit to sleep on the grass, on the ground, in the shade, sitting at a table in the rest area, or in the office.\n\nThe bus depot and garden have a very similar pronunciation and are more likely to have been found where somebody was relaxing.\n\nA gym, a bench, a bus depot and even a rest area are very unlikely, because they would either be boring activities or not very relaxing.  \n\nTherefore, the answer is D - a garden and a gym.\nAnswer: D.

{"text": "The answer to the question is choice B: open country. \n\n### Rationales: Let's begin by reading the sentence. It states, \"Where is a bald eagles safe?\" \nThe question asks where bald eagles feel safe, where they find sanctuary, or protection from danger.\n\nEagles need areas that provide the following:\n\n* a lot of trees and large branches to build their nests\n* plenty of water (rivers, streams, ponds, etc.) for hunting food\n* access to lots of food\n* privacy (avoid too many people around)\n\nIf any of these four things are missing an eagle may feel unsafe and in need of finding a new habitat!\n\nLet's dive into each of the five choices and eliminate what are not eagle-safe areas.\n\nChoice D mentions the \"Washington\" which is a state in the USA, but according to the question bald eagles are not located in Washington. Therefore, this can be eliminated.\n\nNext, we turn to choice C: wildlife refuge. Wildlife refuges can work for eagles who are not being pursued by hunters or poachers because of the protection that the refuge provides. However, wildlife refuges are not safe from people in which the eagles may not want privacy (because there are more people and potentially they need eagle viewing platforms) or a place to feel safe from animals, etc. Since bald eagles are at the top of their food chain there are no animals that are going to attack them, and it is a myth that eagles eat other eagles. They do eat a few small rodents and fish.\n\nChoice A: pine trees is not suitable. As stated before, bald eagles live in or around a few locations: water (rivers, ponds, lakes, streams) and the forest canopy. Trees cannot provide what a bald eagle needs because bald eagles don't build their nests in \"pine trees\" they build them in \"snags\" which are large, dead trees. \n\nChoice E: sky. Eagles don't live in the sky.\n\nWe have now determined that choice B: open country is safe for bald eagles because it meets the requirements necessary for bald eagles, as outlined", "answer": "D: wildlife refuge"}

{"text": "### Instruction Answer multiple choice questions. Choose the best answer.\n\n### Experimentation:\nAnswers are chosen based on the following logic.\n\nAnswer A = here implies that the sensor is triggered simply because that sensor is sensing the proximity of something else that is here.  This is not correct.\n\nAnswer B = Distance makes no sense as the context of the question does not mention any sort of distance measurement. Furthermore, if the sensor was triggered based on distance then the sensor would set off the alarm no matter how far away the target was, which is contradictory. \n\nAnswer C = closeness is used to describe something that is close to something else.  If in fact the sensor triggers when something is in a short distance (less than 2 meters) this would make no sense, as there would be no need to specify this as closeness or near.\n\nAnswer D = proximity implies that the sensor triggers as a result of an object's proximity to another object.  In order to make sense of this choice, the sensor would need to trigger as soon as the object and another are near each other.\n\nAs explained in the paragraphs above Choice D makes no sense since one trigger is enough to indicate it's working.\n\nFinally, choice E = this, clearly states that the sensor is triggered ONLY if something is in this specified location. It is possible to exclude the other choices since it's not mentioned in the paragraphs above or in the question. \n\nSince answer D makes no sense and answer E is the most sensible choice, Answer E has to be the best answer as it's the only right choice which makes sense according to the words given in the paragraphs (in proximity, triggers, proximity sensor) and in the context of the question (this sensor).\nAnswer: E: this", "answer": "D: proximity"}

Where could I find such a video? Choices: A: movie theater B: YouTube C: television D: Netflix E: social media\nRationales: When it comes to the source that stores the video, we can understand that it needs to be a digital format, such as a movie, Youtube, or Netflix. However, this does not tell us how it relates to the topic. Netflix typically stores more than just videos, and movie theaters can be quite expensive for all of those who would rather not do so. The main issue with both of these would be getting an answer to our question. But if we look at the question again, we find that our question was for a video that contained the answer to a quiz. This indicates that we would need to search for a video that contains questions, such as from Youtube or social media. We can eliminate television in the options and the choices for the question remain at 50/50. But there is one more thing we need to check before finding the correct one; to find a video where we need to search, the video must contain a search bar to type the answer in. Therefore, the only place where we could find a video with a search bar where we could type the answer is in YouTube. As YouTube allows search, it is easy to find videos where you can get information and answers to questions. Therefore, the correct answer is YouTube.\nAnswer: YouTube\n\n### Inputs:\nI was at the store and I was searching for a specific item, but I couldn\u2019t find what I needed.

Choices:  A. work with people B. ensure safety C. clean vehicle D. fuel up cars E. fill up with gas\n\n### Response\nGas station attendants are usually responsible for working with people. When someone goes into a gas station attendant's job, there will be two people standing there. \nThe first is at the pump. She will tell the driver how much she needs to put in the vehicle, and give advice for putting it in to avoid spilling it out. \nThe second person is in the gas station. He is responsible for ensuring that the people in there are feeling safe. It would be a bad thing if a person felt threatened while the people who were there were distracted, so they would notice if someone came in that did not feel safe. A gas station is generally a place where people go to spend their money, like when purchasing gas.\nThere are places for filling up cars by driving them in the back-end of the gas station. That would not be the person's primary responsibility, but they can do it to help people.  \nAfter doing the question itself, the answer is C. \nAnswer: C.

This choice is also not very specific; it could be referring to a website development or simply computer programs that are needed \n\nfor marketing.\n\nChoice D which is printing, would be a very specific place to allocate funds to develop a new marketing campaign, since printing is used for many \n\ndifferent forms of marketing methods, including print advertisements, business cards, and brochures.\n\nFinally, choice E, the internet, is very specific.

Choices: A: flower B: palm C: leaf D: herb E: succulent The answer's:  C: leaf The rationales: 1. Each choice is either an entire genre of plant, such as a flower or a stem, or a species, such as a palm or succulent; hence, the answer cannot be \"flower\" or \"herb.\" 2. In the second part of the question, \"has stems that do not a have true shape\" describes flowers in particular because they do not have a true stem shape. 3. The third and fourth parts of the question, \"leaf\u2026true shape\" suggests that the answer must be a member of the genus \"leaf\". 4. Palm is not genus \"tree\", but rather a separate type of tree so it cannot be right. 5. \"palm\" and \"succulent\" are only adjectives which describe their types: palm leaves and succulent stems.\n\nInput: In the beginning of the passage, I was confused.

Choices:  I: close the door II: open the door III: close the oven IV: turn on the oven V: turn off the oven VI: check the ingredients\nRationales:\n\n1. First, we'll focus on what the question asks: \"how should you put the pina in the oven\". We can see that the question does not specify what kind of pizza, the type of oven, how hot the oven should be, etc.\n2. We can't answer that question because it's too specific. We should eliminate choices I, II, and III, which are all the options for pizza itself (putting it in is all related to the pizza itself.)\n3. Choice IV is \"turn off the [oven]\", and choice V is \"turn on the oven\". But it's unnecessary just to turn on or off the oven.\n4. Choices VI and VII are both focused too much on the ingredients, rather than the process of putting the pizza in the kitchen, to be relevant to the problem.\n5. So, if we eliminate these options, we are left with:\n6. Choices I and II, which are about the oven itself.\n7. The rest of the choices focus on how to put the pizza in, but we already got rid of these choices, so there's no need or way to check them.

{"text": "During the opening night of a play, the actor on stage said, \"How many of you will stand up and tell me a story?\" Everyone stood up.\nRationales:\n\n1. Choice A says that, \"all the crowds would stand\u2026\".\n2. It doesn't make sense for \"standing\" to be followed by \"admiration\".\n3. Choice B mentions that, \"would stand and admiration\". This is incorrect because one admires somebody or something, but if all crowds would stand, there wouldn't be any admiration of any kind. Therefore, it cannot be the answer. \n4. Choice C mentions that, \"were admiring\". It's not likely that admirable things are admired, but it's more likely that people will stand and admire things. Therefore, it cannot explain that people who came to the play did not have any reservations. \n5. Choice D suggests, \"experience/would experience\". This is incorrect since every person already experienced the play.\n6. Choose E says that, \"all would stand and sleep\". Again, nobody would admire or experience a sleepy crowd. Therefore, \"sleep\" cannot be the correct answer.\nIn conclusion, the most plausible option would be.\n\n**\"Standing\" refers to the act, while \"sleep\" refers to the state/condition. Therefore the correct answer would be E. Sleep.**\n\nAnswer: E: sleep", "answer": "B: applaud"}

However, not all learning about science requires increased knowledge, and furthermore, the answer should not contain the plural \"knowledges\" as it is asking a declarative question.\n\n5.

{"text": "I was a bit surprised to see so many incorrect answers here. However, I noticed that many are missing one very important choice, so I will include that one as well. This is actually not an extremely simple task to do correctly. Here are the choices that are incorrect:\n\n#### Answer A: Go to Jail.\nThis choice makes absolutely no sense. A person who is guilty of a crime is usually not sentenced to \"Go To Jail.\" They are sentenced to a period of time in jail or, less commonly, the death sentence (death penalty). It is the death sentence that allows for the prisoner to go to the afterlife (also referred to as \"going to Heaven\"). Therefore, the choice of \"Go to Jail\" has absolutely nothing to do with the other choices, does not really fit as a valid option here, nor does it seem to be a valid choice for many of the other questions either.\n\n#### Answer C: Intercourse.\nIt is interesting to note that many people chose this as the correct answer. This is simply because of the last letter in the word, and because \"mandatory\" means \"Required\" when you put it before another word. However, it is very unlikely that two people would be sentenced to an act of intercourse (when we know that is wrong), just as it is unlikely that a person would be sentenced to simply \"mandator\".\n\nThe sentence should start with a verb, and would most likely be constructed correctly in the sentence in the original instruction if \"mandatory\" was used as the verbal phrase \"must\". It is also most likely that a sentence which includes a person being \"guilty\" will contain the correct sentence construction. Therefore, this is an unlikely answer.\n\n#### Answer D: Death.\nThe death sentence is the only sentence that would effectively execute a person after giving them the chance to live and be free. Therefore, choosing the sentence of \"Death\" would only make sense if the sentence includes the death penalty, or the execution of the person being judged.\n\nHowever, it is difficult to obtain information about what exactly is happening. The most common form of execution includes \"Leafling\". This method has the advantage that no one can see what is being done inside the execution facility, which in theory could lead to the sentence being reduced from the life to the death penalty.\n\nTherefore, answering death is only acceptable if we", "answer": "D: death"}

From the options, beef food is not provided, whereas dog food comes in many forms. Beef can be healthy, but not all beef is. Additionally, if an owner cannot guarantee that he or she will always provide 100% beef to their dog, it\u2019s possible that the dog will still need dog food. Even though beef is a natural food for dogs, dog food is a commercial product made for their needs.

Again, this cannot be considered when determining the answer.\n* Drawer - This could be any drawer, including the drawer in a bedside table, and it could be filled with various things. None of them are contraceptives, and therefore no answer can be given based on whether it is a drawer or not, so that option can be eliminated as well.\n* Medicine cabinet - This is a storage unit in the home that contains medicine and other small items.

If \"the Empire State Building\" is being described, the answer would most likely have to refer to this building. Therefore, the only choices of \"small, underground, high, huge, tall\" would seem unlikely considering that \"the Empire State Building is notoriously large and tall\". As such, the best answer choice would have to be one of the following:\n\nChoice B is underground. One of the unique features of the Empire State Building is that it has an Underground Observation Deck - the only one of its kind! This makes it an apt description for a building like the Empire State Building.\n\nChoice C represents height and would be apt if the question was about the height of the Empire State Building however in this case we do not know and the question does not suggest a specific attribute of the \"building like The Empire State Building\" in question.\n\nChoice E represents tallness. However, the Empire State Building is not known as being tall or of a high stature therefore it would not be a suitable answer choice because of these reasons.\n\nFinally, the remaining choices: A, D, and E seem to be far fetched simply because their attributes do not relate to the Empire State Building. The Empire State Building is unique in its own way and is, above all else, big and tall.\n\nChoice B is Underground Observation Decks.

{"text": "Input: What is likely to happen to one's speech after they drink too much? Choices: A: regret B: car accidents C: drinking and driving D: talking nondis E: talk intelligently. \n\nResponse: The given question asked to select an option that describes what is likely to happen to a person's speech after they've been drinking, so the correct answer is choice E - talking intelligently. Regret, car accidents, and drunk driving are less likely to happen before a person's speech. Talking nonsense is more likely, but it should only be a temporary symptom of someone's speech becoming erratic. \n\nAnswer: \"E: talk intelligently\".\n\n### Input What is likely to happen if you're at the store and need to take care of business? Choices:  (1) A: you must go home (2) B: you should buy snacks (3) C: it will be ok to go to the bathroom (4) D: you need to pay attention to the line (5) E: the line will be moved on your behalf\n\n### Response\nInput: What's likely to happen if you find yourself in a scenario where you need some sort of assistance, but you don't know if or where you can go? Choices: 1. A. you must go home 2. B. you should buy snacks 3. C. it will be ok to use the restroom 4. D. you have to notice the queue and 5. E the queue will move it on your behalf.\n\n### The given question asked if a person will need to leave immediately to attend to business. We can deduce that \"A: You Must Go Home\" and \"B: You buy snacks\" both imply that a person may have to leave to take care of their responsibilities. \n\nWe can also determine that \"C: it will be all right to go to the bath\" is not the correct answer because it is telling us it will be fine to go even if we do not need to go. \n\nFor the fourth option, we see that \"D: You pay attention to the line\" is describing a situation where one would have to leave immediately or risk missing their opportunity. \n\nLastly, option 5, E: \"The queue", "answer": "D: talking nonsense"}

It's not a match for the birth months.\n\nLooking at Choice 3, March is the right birth month which is not written in the calendar, so it is not the correct choice.\n\nFor choice 4, the month of May cannot be found in the calendar either, so it is also not the correct answer.\n\nLastly for choice 5, September is written in the calendar, but the birth month is February.

{"text": "Input: The question asks what reckless driving could lead to on a person. All the choices seem reasonable - accidents, injuries and tiredness.\n\nFirst, we should eliminate Choices A and C. Both of them are a result of reckless driving, but not on a person - Choice A refers to the damage done to property, and Choice C to the congestion.\n\nNow we should analyze Choices B and D. Choice B is traffic jams. While it does happen during reckless driving, traffic jams are usually a result, not a cause of the recklessness. That\u2019s why we choose Choice D as the only option.\n\nChoice D states that reckless driving could lead tiredness. This is a very plausible consequence, which is why we should choose it as our answer.\nThe other choices all seem very reasonable, but they all imply something happening to a person.

The question wants to know where the pink suit is.\n\n### Responses:\nThe first possible response is \"the pink suit\". But, this is a problem since the question states that the pink suit is rumored to belong to another woman. Therefore, the \"pink suit\" must not actually belong to that woman who is rumored to wear pink suits.\n\nTherefore, the pink suit is nowhere to be found where it is rumored to belong. The answer to the question \"where the pink suit is\" is \"not in the pink suit\".\n\n### Input Choices:  A B C D E Rationales:\nThe man is not in the pink suit since the pink suit is not rumored to belong to that woman.

That doesn't make sense for animals who couldn't have done the task that the question is referring to.\n\nChoice B: \"Bathe\" is probably what most people would get, but it really isn't a correct answer to the question. They animals wouldn't have been doing their tasks in the water, so bathing wouldn't even be a consideration.\n\nChoice C: \"Listening to each other\" refers to them \"communicating\" I would think. The question is asking why they weren't allowed to reproduce asexualy, so it wasn't because they weren't sharing thoughts with each other, that is an extra thought to be had.\n\nChoice D: \"Feel pleasure\" doesn't really apply here, the animals wouldn't have had the ability to \"enjoy swimming\", since they probably wouldn't have been able to do it.\n\nChoice E: In the passage, we don't really get any indication that they would have been able too reproduce sexually. It also doesn't seem like they have the ability of human thought, as we see in the passage that the animals would have to be watched carefully or they would go \"missing\".\n\nI finally ended up choosing \"Answer D: feel pleasure\", I thought for sure that it had to be something like \"Feel pleasure\" since sexual reproduction would be so much more exciting to \"feel pleasure\" from, which is why the task that they couldn't complete was \"reproduce asexually\".\n\nAnswer: D: feel pleasure", "answer": "A: pass water"}

A police officer who is tasked with directing traffic is not doing anything different than a police officer who is tasking at a station. Furthermore, police who arm themselves are not helping people, but instead preventing themselves from harm by other people.

The question provides a list of choices, one being a career in art and another choice being a list of restaurants. We know that we're looking for a career, not a list of restaurants, so we can eliminate two choices.\n2. Choice A is a career in art. While this may be helpful, it's not an end goal. Instead, we need to ask \"how do I begin a career in art?\" or \"how do I begin making art?\".\n3. Choice B is a good restaurant. This is an action that we do not do on purpose, so it cannot fulfil the goal of finding a career in art.\n4. Choices C & D are \"a way to lose weight\" and \"a way to buy the new car\". We're looking for a way to find a career, whereas these two choices refer to actions that involve changing our behaviour or making a purchase.\n5. Finally, choice E is \"a list of restaurants\". While it may be helpful to find a list of restaurants in an area, this is not related to finding a career in art, so it cannot be what we're asking.\nTherefore, based on the question and the information provided, choice E - a list of restaurants could not be what we're looking for.\nAnswer: E: a list of resturants\n\n### Input question:What was important about the new plan that had been made?

The question is: They took a break from all rides to have luch, while eating hurger they talked about how they would what on the next ride. In this question, the people talking about rides are the ones that would do something different or have more fun. \n\nChoices:\n\n1. Option A is 'hamburger'. That would not be possible. They talked about their ride, but they were not taking a break from the ride they would be doing in the next ride.\n\n2. Option B is 'gas'. This would be possible, but it would not be the same as the next ride. They were talking about gas, not how the gas would be used in the next ride. \n\n3. Option C is 'ride'. This would be possible. They were on a ride before eating lunch. However, this choice suggests that they would ride the rest of the ride.\n\n4. Choice D is 'having a lunch'. This is not what they would do on the next ride. They would not go back to a previous ride. \n\n5th and last option Choice E is 'food poisoning'. This choice is not possible since they did not have food poisoning when they were eating hamburger.

To determine which type of food the poison was, further evaluation is necessary.\nChoice C describes \"medicine,\" which is a possible explanation for Sarah's assumption. This seems like the best answer.\nOption D states that Sarah thought it was an \"antidote.\" However, this is an explanation for a different poison type, not the type presented in the question.\nThe final choice, E, offers \"nutrient.\" While this can sometimes be a type of food, it cannot apply in this scenario.

A medicine is a thing that helps a symptom or disease. Choice E is correct.\n6. A cure refers for most people to an absolute solution that heals a person from a disease, while in medicine its meaning is different and often relates to the relief of a symptom.

{"text": "In this scenario, the person is talking about parking spaces for customers who go shopping in a shopping mall, and they must park their car where they can easily reach their shopping bags while they are at home on the computer. This is important but the location needs to be appropriate, for example, the entrance to a mall is not likely at the side of a tall building. One needs to move their car to a parking garage with less height.\n\nThe question asks where is the closest shopping bags parking lot near the shopping mall. There are several different types of parking areas, such as a parking garage, parking space, and the lot. Each of these spaces has different benefits.\n\nA parking garage is a large building made of concrete that has several stories with lots of space for parking cars. A parking garage is not suitable for the task because it makes it less easy to reach the shopping bags.\n\nOne can use parking space to park their car, and this space provides a place to park a car, and it is usually available in front of or behind the mall. This option is good for shopping bags but not suitable for the task.\n\nThe last choice is a shopping mall because it has a lot of parking lots with many spaces, which will make it easier to park and easily reach to the shopping bags, but I don\u2019t expect to get all the shopping bags at one time.\n\nChoices A and C should be eliminated because they are not suitable for most vehicles.\n\nThen if we choose choice B, this will provide a good parking space in front of the mall, but it also has the benefit that they provide some security for the shopping bags that are inside the mall because of limited security cameras that watch for thieves.\n\nOverall the answer is that the best place to find a parking lot that allows shopping bags is in the shopping mall, which is a building with many spaces and security features.\nRationales:\n1) When I got the question, I went to analyze it.

You are afraid that these people will illegally sell their illegitimate product (drugs). You want to investigate the seller\u2019s identity.\n\n3. To complete the investigation, you ask the seller to submit their identity paper for your investigation.\n4. You don\u2019t approve the paper identity. You know that this person\u2019s identity is illegal and they are selling illegal products. You\u2019ll need to investigate their identity properly.\n5. You don\u2019t want them to sell their illegal products and you don\u2019t know how to find the right paper.\n\n### Rationale for \u201cauthenticity\u201c:\n1. You don't know what \u201ccertificate\u201d is, so you must investigate it properly.\n2. You want to prevent people from selling illegal drugs in your country.\n3. People may illegally sell their illegal products and sell them online. \n4. You don't approve these illegal products, and you must investigate and take the necessary actions.\n5. You investigate the seller\u2019's identity by requesting a paper identification", "answer": "C: authentic"}

A damp book may be outside of the house but the question asks specifically about exterior books and their exterior status, therefore this is not an appropriate choice. \n\nThere are two options in which the person could find a damp book outside; it could be raining which is choice B, outside of which would not make the book wet on the outside if it is not actually wet outside; the other possibility is that the book is wet on", "answer": "E: walking out of"}

We will ask them if they sleep making a loss of consciousness noise. \nWe will find out that this noise is not known among humans and their sleep. \nOur second step is to test the hypothesis by looking at other cases where people lose consciousness. For example, we can see if pilots make this type of noise when dozing off or if it\u2019s possible to do this in other dangerous activities. \nBecause this noise is not known neither among humans, nor among other forms of livings. \n\nOur third step is to decide whether our hypothesis is indeed false.

Choices: \n\na) cotton\nb) denim\nc) canvas\nd) plastic\ne) paper\n\n### Response\nThe question asks which material is suitable for making a strong bag. In this question, cotton is not suitable, because the bag needs to hold a lot of objects, and cotton is a soft material.\n\nDenim is not strong enough, because it is a soft cloth. Canvas is a strong material that also can be washed, but it's not suitable for carrying luggage to an unknown place, because it can't be washed often.\n\nPlastic is the main answer because it is a strong material with a wide range of colors and also is a material for carrying luggage. A plastic bag is also suitable for cleaning, we can wash it when it is dirty.\n\nAfter eliminating the other choices, the plastic bag is the best answer.

The answer is most likely something that contains the following characteristics:\n1. The answer contains people\u2019s contact information.\n2. The answer has something to do with a phone number. While we are not explicitly told to assume that the answer concerns a phone number, we still have to assume that this is somehow related to a phone number.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s eliminate answers that we know would not work.\n\nAnswer 1 is a phone book, these books are designed to contain contact information, they are a good start. However, these books are very large, and so we need a narrower search result.\n\nAnswer 2 is likely to also be a phone book, but we will have to be selective with our search.\n\nAnswer 3 is the same as answer 2, the question is not explicitly asking for a roster, but it does fit the answers we have so far.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is the context of the problem. This person has a name, so something more comprehensive that a roster or a phone book could be more practical.\n\nAnswer 4 could seem tempting because it seems to include a phone number. But, the context does not suggest that the context includes a phone or a fax number or anything like that. It simply includes a person\u2019s name. We know this from the context, the question has already narrowed down our search to find people with a specific name so we cannot assume that this involves contacting a person by phone and in general, the question specifically mentions a phone or a fractile number.

The people involved in the discussion are trying to get close to an agreement.\n2. The statement indicates that they were having a conversation rather than making a decision or moving forward toward an actionable item like suicide, or leaving the house for the rest of the evening. \n3. The only choices available are \"A\" and \"B\", but \"A\" makes the most sense as it matches the context given in the question. \"B\" is not possible given this information because they didn't decide to hash things out in hopes that it would result in alcohol use or depression.\n\n---\n\n### Input:\"What is the difference between this type of error and the other errors?\" Choices:  A) The first two have the same error message B) The second one is a different type of error C: The second one is undefined D: The second one is checked E: Both are checked\n\n#### 1) Explanations\n \nAnswers should be based on logical reasoning.\n \nIf something is defined, it means it is defined. A undefined error cannot be the same as a first two as a second error (and the first two are known), because if they are both defined, then there's nothing defined about how the error is caused (not being checked, being checked), therefore there shouldn't be the same error message. \n\n#### Rationais:\n \nIt may seem that the answer is D because checking is not the same condition as not checking, but as long as the second condition is being checked, it is okay to do so", "answer": "A: reach tentative agreement"}

Choice A can also be eliminated because \"reduce the heat\" is not an action that the cook can directly complete or is responsible for. This would be a choice for a different cook in the kitchen. Choice C can also be eliminated as \"cover the pan\" does not relate to preventing pan fires; a cook will still be able to prevent pan fires if they remove the pizza to reduce the temperature of the pan. Choices D and E cannot be eliminated because they do not suggest an action taken by a cook. The best action will likely be taken by a cook.

This is a person or thing that has a dejected or sullen look, but in a more specific sense of being \"dejected\". The word in the question \"gloomy\" already includes the word \"dejected\" so \"downcast\" does not make sense.\n\nChoice C \"angry\"? This seems to be a reasonable choice, but, if a scientist were being asked this question, then they probably are angry or gloomy.\n\nChoice D \"unhappy\"? Also not a good answer, since the question asks if you're \"gloomy\".\n\nChoice E is \"sorrowful\"? The person being asked seems to be someone who doesn't like their job, and if they are sorrowful, then they probably wouldn't like their job.

This is to be understood as meaning \"think of or wish for (something)\". However, the question does not explicitly ask for the person's opinion, but rather for their feelings. Thus, \"want\" does not seem to fit the given requirement, unless the answerer can provide additional information.\n### Choice B - \"Need\".

{"text": "> The most appropriate response to this prompt is either 'Throne Room' or 'Monarchy': to meet the king in his court would be to meet in his office or residence hall. To meet the king at a dinning room would be to eat with him. While the king might also have a throne room, he is most likely to be found there when he is engaged in a ceremonial function. The king may also have a large castle, but it is much more likely that the king would be found in the monarchy (i.e. where his people are living, governing from the people). \n\n### Response 2:\n\nI agree with the first response provided. To further elaborate on the first answer, there are two options more specific and/or viable than the others provided. \n\nIn the context of this question, the throne room would be the most appropriate answer.

{"text": "Analysis of the available information reveals that Choice A does not make any sense in this circumstance, as it is not about the person who has more kids but a compliment to the kids themselves. Similarly, Choice B cannot be considered as the person does not need to understand something about themselves; they need to understand something specific about their situation. \n\nChoices C and D both do not make sense in this question because they are personal choices that do not concern the individual asking the question, who may have just had more kids already. Choice E sounds good at first glance; however, since the question inquired about the needs of \"when the have more kids,\" it appears that a larger house in a specific circumstance is not necessary, and may even be undesirable. \n\nWhen comparing each of the choices, the most logical solution is Choice D: second chances. This option implies that the person asking the question needs to take a positive outlook on the situation.\n\n### Input The person who has been driving long needs more rest, when would it be appropriate to let the driver rest?

Choice 2: After A While does not make sense in this context. One could not rest after a short period of driving as doing so could put them in a very dangerous position. Choice 3 Sleep In The Morning is a similarly unviable option because it requires the driver to stop driving for an extended period of time, which could be risky and should only be done in safe conditions. \n\nChoice 4: Sleep on the Drive is impractical because it would make the driver drowsy, creating a hazardous situation, while Choice 5: They Couldn\u2019t Do It At All is not a reasonable choice. Drivers should be able to determine when they are able to rest, and it is unlikely that they will be unable to do so. \n\nThere are multiple correct answers to the provided question, though Choice 1: Ride A", "answer": "E: larger house"}

This means that an actual exercise machine, such as a treadmill, weight machine, exercise bike, or other is not an option.\n\nThe problem asks how you can get in shape (get in shape is an exercise activity, it would be more correct to ask \"How can I exercise without access to a gym\" or words to that effect.\n\nThe following questions will guide your answer:\n\nWhat physical activity can be done without needing a gym?\nWhat physical activity can you do without any equipment?\n\nGiven the information provided, you could not do a traditional exercise such as jogging or running. This is because you have to rely on the equipment, not your body alone. Also, using equipment such as weights will require a gym (or other space), and a bench or other to sit on. This brings us to the fact that a gym is needed for a lot of equipment.\n\nHowever, a treadmill, or elliptical machine do not require weights, benches, or a gym. In fact, you could take your treadmill anywhere you go. You could even walk on a treadmill outside while keeping an eye out for cars that could be coming at you. This leads us to option B and C, Jog and Exercise.\n\nOption D \"Work out\" doesn't even begin to answer the question, which is \"How can you get in Shape\" without access to a gymnasium.\n\nOption E, \"Rock Climb\" is a good answer if you want to get in shape. A rock climbing wall doesn't require a lot of equipment, it's just you and your body. You could do a lot of climbing outside on real mountains, or go to a bouldering gym.\n\nThe only problem is: The wording of the question is: \"How can can you get in shape, if there is no land near by\" which eliminates option E.\n\nNow that we have narrowed", "answer": "A: swim"}

Based on the definitions of the choices given, the best response is E: tally back, as this describes how to go back to a place that you've already been.

It's not to just make a client account but to make a client account.\n\nNext, we consider each choice\n\nChoice A: \"have the client use the account\". It is unlikely the student would have to do this. This appears to be more of a question of the student's job description.\n\nChoice B: \"make a copy of their contract\".

This may be the answer, but it isn't very satisfying.\n\nChoice D: \"request their job description\". This request just makes things even more challenging for the student.\n\nLastly Choice E: We have \"make the client's name the password\", which could be a solution, but it doesn't sound likely.\n\nUltimately, there is no straightforward answer, but there is a potential solution in choice C, as the student might request the client's account number, which the client would share as a passcode to activate their account.

While having an appointment can feel frustrating and tiring, it's not always the case that people who need to do the work have one. So it is not the correct option.\n\nChoice B is being late.

Based on these observations we can rule out choices B, C, and E.\n\nThis leaves us with three more possibilities; D (closet), C (trash), and A (attic). \n\nOf these three remaining choices, the attic is the most probable location to find holiday decorations as it is typically used to store things long-term and not just temporarily. Therefore, \"attic\" is the most likely location since it is the final and most obvious choice after discounting \"attic\" (B), \"crowd-trash\" (C) and \"herd-box\" (E).\n\nSo the most likely location would be an attic, therefore, the answer choice is A: attic.

Choices: \tA: tiny B: small C: huge E: gigantic D: extra small\nRationales:\n\n* Starting with question type. this is the only thing that helps us start looking for answer. Choice B: small is not the opposite of the choice of \"large\", and this choice is obvious so we can eliminate choice B immediately.\n\n* We can use the words that opposite each other to eliminate the choices, in such situations we normally use the choice we eliminate to eliminate other choices. Therefore we start first with the choice we can eliminate, which is C: huge. The choice \"huge\" has been used. So this choice can be used to eliminate other choices.\n\n* So we can eliminate the choices from C through E. Choice A is opposite of choice B. The choice C cannot be eliminated with the choice D immediately. So we can further eliminate the choice C. Choice D and E remain. The last choice D: extra small is an adjective, not an adverb, which is the opposite term of the choice \"large\" according to the question.\n\n```\nA B C   D E\n     1 2 3 4\n```\n\nTherefore the answer is choice A: tiny.\n```", "answer": "E: formal garden"}

This option suggests that you can ask United States questions if you're driving on a highway. However, the question asks about finding directions, not about the map.\n\n2. Choice B stands for the atlas. This option suggests that by taking an atlas when walking down a road one can use the atlas to find directions. However, the question refers to items made of paper that can be used to find ways while driving, so an atlas can't satisfy the need.\n\n3. Choice C stands for developed ground. This option suggests that if one is taking a trip on a highway he/she can refer to the developed land to identify the shortest way. However, the question doesn't ask about a road that is developing, nor does it suggest the need to use the developed land to find directions.\n\n4. Choice D stands for the park. This option suggests that using the park when navigating in a road can reduce travel distances. However, the question wants something that can be used to guide the travel to a destination.\n\n5.

This option suggests that roads that are being developed are not only made in the states so you could use the country side as another option when mapping your trip to a destination.

Watch TV\n\nOutput: After analyzing the question, we find that there are a wide range of options available to help someone with homework. \n\nThere are four important aspects to this question:\nThe friend's desire to have help on homework.\nThe need or the task to be completed.\nThe solution to the task (homework).\nAnd the option (to be helpful).\n\nGiving them a choice of four options can satisfy the first and second criteria, however, it can't fulfill both criteria - you can't help with the homework and watch TV at the same time.\n\nFirst, we consider each option to see if it matches with either criteria. \n\nGet help: You need to do more than be helpful in order to fulfill the solution.\n\nThen we move on to the next option: Studying with them will most likely be helpful, but won't contribute to the solution because they could still need help (if they need help with their homework, they will need help). \n\nNext, we see that Talking with them will be helpful and will fulfill the criterion - Talking to them is helpful, and talking to them will help them with completing their homework. \nLastly, Teaching them will fulfill the criterium: teaching them will help them with their homework.\nAdditionallly, you can't teach someone how to do their homework if you don't know how to help them with their home work. And Watching TV can possibly help someone with their homework, but if someone's homework is not complete, then it's a dead end.\nSo it seems that the most helpful and appropriate solution is Talk.", "answer": "A: shelf"}

Given this, the writer might be referring to many types of texts such as formal emails from work, emails to friends, emails for school work, or even text messages.\n\nAnalysis of choice A: \"avoid punctuation.\"\n\nIn informal text, using punctuation can change the meaning of the text and make it funnier or more serious. For example the sentence \"i had a bad time today\" has some different meanings depending on if there's a question mark after \"bad time\" or not.\n\nPunctuation like question marks, exclamation marks, periods, and semi-colons are commonly used in writing essays or emails, but not usually in casual texts.\n\nTherefore this choice is not the best way to ensure your message will be properly conveyed.\n\nAnalysis Choice B: \"ask questions.\" Using question marks", "answer": "E: elevator"}

And, to get what, we must \"get education\" or \"get a book\";\n\nThe context of this sentence: \"Reading a newspaper gives us \"get \" and \"a\", and we can find a new \"what\" using a different letter for \"what\". The meaning of each word is: \"reading a newspaper\" -> \"gets us a what\" -> \"get\" and \"a\", it doesn't mean \"get angry\".

Here, for each league, there will be 16 AAA teams and for each team, there will be 2 games against the same opponent.\n\nThus, the total AAA games in a season will be 32.\n\n### Rationale:\nFor each team(of a league), there will be 2 AAA games against the same opponents. Here, each league will have only 16 teams, so we will divide teams with AAA teams, and each player from the AAA team of these 16 teams will play 2 AAA games in total.

The morning paper is not delivered to our classroom because we do not live there and because the daily news is intended for general readers, not school children.\n4. Next, we examine choice B: Synagogue. The morning paper is rarely distributed in synagogues, as they are religious buildings. Therefore, it is unlikely that your paper is delivered to your synagogue.\n5. Similarly, choice C is \"bathroom\", which is unlikely as, again, the papers are intended to be distributed to the general public and are generally not delivered to private homes. \n6.

Rural areas generally comprise of outlying or less populated areas. They usually have fewer people. While a large village may inhabit a rural area, it may also inhabit smaller urban areas too. It is less likely to be found in suburbs. Thus, A, B, and C could all be reasonable answers to this question. Let's examine them in turn.\n\nThe first one, A, is a rural area. However, rural areas don't necessarily contain villages, as the population is too small. So, eliminating the option A.\n\nNext, let's check B \u2013 a big city. A big city could be part of a large village, so this is a possible answer to the question. If it is, this would be a perfect answer, given that a big city would likely to find itself as part of a village of over 1,000 people. However, in today's world, a big city is less likely to be a part of a village. Now let's examine C \u2013 a suburb. A suburb is generally considered as a residential area located immediately outside of a city. A village, on the other hand, is more likely to be located far from a city. Therefore, C is the less likely answer.\n\nLet's assume, that a village that we are looking for is situated in the Ohio state.

Instead, they prefer to live in specific bodies of water like freshwater lakes and marine waters. \n\nChoice C, under water (D), is most likely incorrect as well since it refers to locations where fishes tend to live instead of the actual place where they spend their time. \n\nChoice D, toilet (E), is also incorrect in that it does not provide a real answer to the question. \n\nBased on this, choice B, lake superior (C), is most likely the correct answer. Lake superior is a body of water where the fish resides throughout most of their time.\n\nAnswer: C: lake superior\n\n### Input 1: How much money is in the bank account?

In this case, \u2018house\u2019 is a synonym for \u2018to live in\u2019, so A, B and D can be eliminated.\n3. Choice C mentions \u2018home\u2019 and not \u2018to live in\u2019. While \u2018home\u2019 is a synonym of \u2018house\u2019, it is a different category.\n4. Choices B and E are out of synonym (or related words) category. \u2018United States\u2019 is not another word for \u2018France\u2019 and \u2018France\u2019 isn\u2019t another word for \u2018France house\u2019.\n5.

{"text": "We can see that all the options are some type of connectivity system. If the electrical equipment is not powering on, than it could mean one or more of these connections could be a problem. \n\n### Demo:\nLet's start with Choice C - airport.  Airports don't power anything except planes in their landing lanes.\n\nNext, let's start with Choices A and B. Company and Telephone Network. Some power comes from a company, therefore we can eliminate Choices A and B as invalid options.\n\nNext, Let's Start with Choices D and E. Wires and freeway. We have come across two possible connectivity options for this electrical equipment. Wires in the form of power cables, and a freeway where cars can turn on after charging at a charging station. However, all the power in an electrical system starts from a power plant, and is transported through the streets. \n\nWe have found that no matter how much we look for connections, we can not find any. Let's go back to Choice A, Company.  When we try to connect this to the other options, like Choices B - Telephone Network and Choice D - Wires, we find it does not make a logical connection to the other options. Therefore Choice A is the correct response as it makes a complete set of other 3 possible options.\n\nAnswer: A: company\n\n### Input The manager had the sales team prepare a list of clients who recently canceled or downgraded their service.\n\n### Demo\nThe demo answers for this are easy to solve.

{"text": "D is correct The question tells us, \"If you socialize by doing trivial conversations with people, it is called small talk.\" We can find this definition of small talk by finding the definition of \"to take part in small talk.\" \"To take part in small talk\" means to \"converse in an informal way rather than have a serious conversation.\" We can be sure that if we converse in an informal manner, it would be trivial. Therefore, choice D is correctly inferring the definition of small talk, but choices A and B have the wrong definitions of small talk. Choice C means \"to become friends.\" Choice E means \"to meet people.\" Thus no answer is correct.\n\n### Input:\"Which of the following will cause your blood pressure to drop? Choices: 1. High blood sugar 2. Low potassium levels 3. High blood pressure 4. High salt levels 5. High blood pressure 6. Low blood sugar\nRationales:\n\nWe can see the choices by looking at the following choices:\n\nThis question asks us about what will cause our blood pressure to drop, that is, cause it to be lower. Blood pressure is a physiological metric, meaning it involves the body. So, the answer cannot be 1 or 2, blood pressure can't cause these things to change. A change of blood glucose levels is called diabetes. Low potassium is the second symptom of diabetes. High blood pressure is not a symptom of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), it is an independent risk factor. High blood pressure will not lead to DKA as it is already present. Salt is a risk factor.\n\nSo we see that our four options don't really match our question. That leaves three options (3, 5, and 6). Our only choice is 6, blood sugar, since that is a symptom.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nWe find that many times in our lives, we are trying to make some inference of how one thing can affect another. In a logical argument, it is not sufficient to simply make an assertion. You need to prove your argument using evidence, either formal or from personal experience. For example, some people believe that eating junk food makes an athlete lazy, but that's something to argue over the merits of, not something that", "answer": "D: small talk"}

This is a common, popular place to buy grocery items and is easily found.\n\n5. Grocery stores usually sell cooking sauces, spices, and also water, so there is a chance that a grocery store would sell a particular type of soup.

It may be possible to travel one direction and then return the same way or to take a completely different route on the return.  \n\n## There are three modes of travel in this case: by land, by air and by sea.

Choices:  (1) red face up on top A: red then blue B: red then green C: red first then blue D: red then blue E: green first then blue\nRationales: To better understand the choices, start by looking for words in the question. There are four words. To \"deal\" cards, you will first \"draw\" cards for each player (player one first, then player two, etc.). Next, we will find out what order the cards will be \"dealt\" in (player 1's card goes first and is followed by player 2's card, etc.). And, finally, we should find out which cards will be \"dealed to\" the player (like the way it says \"Dealt to Player One\").\n\nThere are two ways to order the drawings of cards. \"Dealt to\" refers to the order in which the cards will be passed to each player and must come after the drawings (since the winner needs to collect the cards from the dealer's hand in the sequence they were drawn), thus making the answer D.\n\nInput: What type of animal eats food?

Cinema and theatre most commonly refer to a single specific place, such as the Cinecitta or the Roxy theatre, rather than to an overarching group of places like the word \"cinemas\". Both of these terms refer to the movies themselves rather than to places where people view them. Additionally, \"theater\" doesn't make sense in this context because the word \"theater\" usually refers to a type of building or to an activity, not a place where people watch films.\n\nChoice E: \"train station\" does not match the answer.

For example, we can cross off C: space shuttlee. It makes no sense to feel guilty for something having to a space shuttle. \n\nNext, try to come up with some plausible combinations of two choices that could make up the whole sentence\n\nFor examples, we can eliminate choice D. It is not appropriate or possible to damage something that is too big.

This appears to be the case however the question relates to koalas and pandas so it isn't the answer.\n\nThe final 2 choices, choices E and C are Australia and the Australian Outback.\n\nThe response is that choice C is correct and that we do find a stuffed Koala in the Australian Outback.", "answer": "B: bamboo grove"}

Read the question carefully and ask yourself if you understand what it is asking.\n2. Now evaluate the options to determine the best answer.\n3. Since A says I do not know, does the phrase \"I\" refer to you or someone else? No. There is no \"I\" in option A; we assume A means \"your girlfriend does not know\". Option A states that (we say it's referring to your girlfriend) your girlfriend does not know what you meant. \n4. Choice C says My boyfriend does not want to know. If a boyfriend (boyfriend is in C) did not know, then we can conclude that the choice is D.\n5. Now let us go to choice B: My girlfriend wants to know. From the choices, only girlfriend appears two times (girlfriend and girlfriend\u2019s). So, there is no option for \"My boyfriend...\". Therefore, we assume that the phrase \"My girlfriend\" refers to you. We can conclude that the correct answer is choice A. \n6. What this means is that C implies that it is talking about a boyfriend, which is wrong.\n7. Lastly, we can eliminate choice D because, in that case, the phrase \u201cmy parent\u201d does not appear anywhere in the text.\n8. Thus, choice D should be disregarded.\n9.

She is not the main subject of the question, only Billy is the main subject.\n\n1. Let's go to the first choice: toy store. This appears to be the best option after noting that \"toy\" is the name of the stuffed animal the child dropped, not its purpose. However it is important to note that the toy store would be the place where you would normally purchase toys. Therefor this is incorrect.\n\n2. The second choice is hallway. This is not the place where one would usually leave such items (if there was such a place, that is). This is incorrect.\n\n3. Option number three is bathroom. There are many common things that are left in the bathroom: keys, hair ties and sometimes wallets. However, leaving the stuffed animal in the bathroom would make no sense whatsoever. \n\n4. Choice number four is amusement park. It might seem like an appropriate location for the stuffed animal, but it's not. Amusement parks usually don't have kids' stuff lying around, especially their personal belongings. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n5. The last choice E fairgrounds are an outdoor area or park where people hold large events. Although the fairgrounds might be the correct location for leaving the stuffed animal, it wouldn't make much sense to leave it there. \n\nTherefor, the answer is B: toy store.

Choices:  A. order B. prescribe C. get a note D. refer E. give a report\nRationales:1) Begin by understanding the question we must first find if the doctors said she would have to prescribe a patient of a certain special kind, if she must order a patient to give them a note or refer to a specialist, etc. \n2) Next, begin by thinking about the word 'prescribe'. Prescribe means 'give as medicine', and it's unlikely the doctor would ask a patient to give them as medicine. \n\n3) Next, think about the word 'order'. Order means to make arrangements or instructions for something. It would be unlikely the doctor says'she would have to order a patient'. \n\n4) Consider the word 'get a note'. Get a note means to ask or tell someone for a note of something or to ask someone to write a note, for example a doctor might be referring the patient to another doctor to get a note for a special kind of patient. \n\n5) Think about the word'refer'.

I'm still just a glorious person. E\"I'll forgive you because I'm amazingly glorious and you just made my day.\n\n### Rationales: The context of the question suggests that the character is trying to convince the other person that they are truly glorious, even when the other person does not see it. Choice A, B, C & E are statements of agreement with the character's opinion. Choices D & E are also the opinions of others, but still disagree with the character. Choice D is very harsh and doesn't address any previous conversation or comments the character made about how glorious they are, so it's likely a bad answer.\n\nNext we address choice A. It is positive and describes the character as \"beautiful.\" While this is a kind word, it is not the same as being \"glorious\" or \"ugly.\" It should be clear to the reader that there is a difference between being beautiful and glorious. The only other remaining choice is answer choice C. If we read through it with the question, it would make little sense. It would be similar to saying, \"You are a beautiful person and you are happy to be beautiful, but I feel that I am better than you.\" Obviously, that would not describe a healthy or satisfying conversation.

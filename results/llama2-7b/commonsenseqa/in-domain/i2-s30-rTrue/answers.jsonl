Choices: 1. A: directories B: online search C: yellow pages D: advertisements E: phone book F: newspaper\nOutput: 1.) The first thing to realise in this question is that the writer means to distinguish between a yellow page and a phone book.\n2.) Yellow pages have a specific page allocation for each individual business, in contrast to a phonebook where businesses are listed alphabetically, therefore, it stands to reason that the yellow pages will provide more accurate information on each business and thus better information.\n3.) Advertisements and directories are irrelevant in this context because each business would pay to have its page in yellow pages or phone book as they contain more information on each business than they would in an advertisement.

Look at the choice options closely.\n5. One needs to analyze each choice to see how well it meets the requirement of the verb'slower'.\n6. Option A stands out because it's a verb that can be used to mean slower.\n7. Moreover, the subject matter is communicating and it makes sense that the communication got slower.\n8. That would slow the progress of an activity and that makes sense too.\n9. Hence, the logical answer is A: Slower\n\n\n1. Read the complete scenario of Question A.\n2. Identification of the verb, the action is 'understand' which is the main objective of the question.\n3. Identification of the choice options.\n4. We need to determine if their understanding of the problem slowed down the project.\n5. Firstly, we need to analyze whether the option A'slowed' makes sense according to the sentence.\n6. When we look at'science project' and'slowed down', it makes sense, as we know that it slows things down to understand things, or in other words, it is slowing down to understand better and that means that their slow understanding actually slowed down the project progress.\n7. The second choice B 'proliferated' does not make sense at all, because it does not fit the context of the sentence.\n8. It's a good option, but it doesn't fit the sentence structure and choice D E 'progressed' is meaningless and has no relevance whatsoever to the given sentence because progress cannot be slowed as it progresses continuously.\n9.

The man cares if this group of people have a different political view than him but it doesn't bother him.\n5) \"Ignoring\" is the answer because if the man's opinion about the group of people political view doesn't bother him, then it means he must ignore their opinion.

For'rest', we know that at least one possibility is that she is resting in bed, that is, she did not leave her bed for any reason, including a medical one like a bed sore, because a person with bed sores will likely not be able to leave their bed and would have to stay off it.\n4.Next, consider the difference between'sleep' and'sleep more'. 'Sleep' implies that she's sleeping normally at a reasonable rate, maybe going to sleep early because of the event.\n5.However, if she's sleeping more, this is not necessarily a good thing, it can mean that she is sleeping heavily, which may be due to insomnia, which is due to stress arising from an event, or it could relate to something else, for instance, the illness.\n6.We realize then that the missing part of the question is an actual cause of'sleeping' or'missing' or 'comfort', so the question is trying to understand what the sick person actually does in the circumstances.\n7.At this point, if bed sores was mentioned, we could have been very certain that she was either sick in bed or not able to move due to bed sores. However, if the illness is not specified,'missing' and 'comfort' should be further ruled out.\n8.Since sleep was answered, we can conclude that she is not missing out or sleeping comfortably.\n9.Next, if a'sleep sore' was provided along with'resting', that would make sense, but without'sleep', the word'sore' doesn't really make sense, leaving us only with'resting' and 'comfort'.\n10.If the illness was 'comfort', then we would know that she is sick, resting and comfortable, which may be due, for instance, to having already recovered from a disease or just being in a condition of complete relaxation.\n11.However, since we only have'resting' as an answer, and not 'comfort', we can conclude that it isn't comfort that she's feeling but'sick' that she's feeling", "answer": "D: missing out"}

Choices: A: our B: my C: there D: your E: its\nOutput: 1: Start with the assumption that we are the 'you' which is being addressed in the sentence.\n4. The subject, in this case, is 'you', so the rest of the sentence is describing the food that it is picking at.\n5. If the object were a pigeon, then the pigeon would simply be eating the food.\n6.

Elimination of options: \"due to\" is not used in this way, so it is not a suitable answer.\n4. \"Getting somewhere/getting somewhere, is unrelated to the cause, and therefore is incorrect.\n5. \"Meeting new people\" doesn't make sense when it's in relation to low visibility causing this problem.\n6.

Among the remaining choices'wedding' is most specific as it relates to foot wear specifically for a wedding.\n4. The 'closet' relates to foot wear as well but it could relate to other personal items as well. There is too much ambiguity for a particular foot ware, as you could just keep shoes and other related items in your closet.\n5. The choice of 'left foot' could actually be acceptable, given the context. But 'house' could be a valid selection as well, given that the person is walking around the house.\n6. So all in all, 'wedding' is the most specific. Hence, the answer by elimination is 'wedding'.\n\nSo the final answer was A: wedding\n\n\n\n### Instruction:Answer the multiple choice question.\nInput: Someone should get a certificate when they work hard for an extended period of time, and that certificate should be: Choices: A: golden B: silver \ud83c\ude35  C: bronze \ud83c\ude36  D: wooden\nOutput: 1). First read the question carefully to understand exactly what the question is asking for.\n2. Realize that the word 'certificate' is plural, so the answer choices should contain three words.\n3. All the choices except for'silver certificate' are plural in nature. However,'silver certificate' ends in's' so it should be regarded either as a singular or plural choice.\n4. Now check one word that can be used to describe 'A' and one word that could describe 'C', and so on to all four words for each answer choice. This will help eliminate some of the answer choices.\n5. Compare each answer option with its opposing number. For example, all other answer options except for the first one (i.e.,'silver certificate') end with either'silver' or'sliver' (i.e., B, D, and E).

Next, look at each remaining choice:\n     * B: gaining knowledge is not mentioned in the text of the question and is a difficult term to identify in the context of the situation. Hence, it is not a plausible choice.\n     * E: pondering is a term that is rarely used in normal english and has no relationship to the context of this question. \n3. This leaves us with A: tired feet, C: back pain, and D: being bored as plausible answers. \n4. Think about the context of the scenario and come up with a logical explanation:\n     * A: tired feet does not make any sense as the word 'visiting' would indicate that John was already there walking around. John is not a slacker, so he would not be 'behind' on his duties.\n     * D: being bored seems to indicate that John was not studying the exhibits. However a bored person would not go out of their way to stay longer, which means John was not bored.\n     * Finally, C: back pain is the most plausible answer to this question because it is what John wanted. It makes sense in the context of the other terms mentioned.\nSo the final and logical answer is C: back pain\n\nInput:The doctor asked, \"Have you had a recent injury or illness?\" \"I've had a cold for the past few days\", the patient replied.

Then, read the remaining options and eliminate any that do not make sense. For example, \"bronchitis\" and \"malaria\", since they are not mentioned in the question and do not have any relationship to \"illness\".\n3. Finally, think about the word itself and its usage: the context of the sentence suggests that \"flu\" is a type of illness.\nSo the final correct answer is B: flu", "answer": "B: gaining knowledge"}

'Home' does not make any sense, as you wouldn't go play a board game at home alone, nor would you go 'board' gaming at home at all, so the option is ruled out.\n3. If someone played at school with a student, they could play the board game with friends, so the student is unlikely to play.\n4. 'Toy shop' sounds like a shop which sells board games toy but it does not necessarily sell board games, so it is eliminated.\n5.

Choices:  a) shelf b) cover c) bookd) toy\nOutput: 1,'shelf' is clearly the best choice as it makes the most logical and plausable sense.\n2. The next best answer would be cover, which can be used to store a book because it is flat unlike the other choices. However,'shelves' are flat surfaces, so it could easily be used as well.\n3. Next, a book can not be stored in a 'toy' because there is no possibility of storing it because a toy's sole purpose is to play with and not to be stored.\n4. A book can be stored in a 'book', but it is a bad choice because a book would be something you'd have lying around in a house and would not be something you'd put in a cupbaord.\n5. Finally the other remaining choice 'cover' is not used frequently to store a book, but it can also probably be used. However, 'cover' can also be used to store other things, making it less specific.\n6.

{"text": "1) The correct option is C.  It is based on the logic that the boom or microphone does recordings.\n2. There are four other options that are irrelevant and need to be eliminated\n3. First, the radio station is not suitable because it is irrelevant to the question - the question asks specifically about an album, and not about a radio station\n4. Next, recording studios are also irrelevant.  It makes sense that they use a boom or microphone to record an album. However, that is not the point they wish to convey.  They just asked about booming of an album, and all other questions are irrelevant.\n5. Now, the concert option is also irrelevant - this option also refers to an event where there are speakers and microphones, not on an album.  Also, they are irrelevant to the question in general.\n6. Finally, the last option (New York) does not have anything to do with recording an album.  It refers to a city, not an event.  Hence, option D is the correct answer. The final answer is C: a concert\n\nInput:  Where may you typically find a list of things you can and cannot take through airport security?

Terms a and b do not seem to fit into the sentence either grammatically or contextually as they have nothing to do with a \"list of things you can and can't take through airport security\".\n3. Next, c and d do not sound right as \"terminal\" is not a noun, but a place, while checkpoint(s) is a commonly used term to refer to security check.

{"text": "1, read the question and understand the keywords. This question asks about finding out the specific characteristic of a certain object.  \n2. Examine the options carefully to eliminate those that are not realistic. In this case, we eliminated options B and C because'special' and'shiny' don't seem like accurate terms to indicate an object's rarity.  \n3. To identify the right choice, make a general comparison between options A and D. 'Personal' is a specific term that is only used to denote something rare or exclusive to a certain group of people, but it does not indicate rarity. Hence, 'personal' is eliminated.  \n4. 'Rare' refers to an object being very uncommon and only occurring rarely, but it doesn't mean something is worth a lot.  \n5. Finally, 'Rare' is not a term widely associated with Pokemon cards, so it is also deleted from the list.  \n6. The answer that fits the question the most, considering the wordlist is 'irregular'. 'irregular' is a word describing something that is unusual, so it makes sense to indicate that Pokemon cards are 'irregular' in that they are more common than one would think.  \n7. Therefore, 'irregular' is the correct answer, and the final answer is irregular.\n\nInput: How did I find out that a cow was eating at a certain place, during a certain hour, on a certain day?

We know that all the choices start with different letters - this isn't helpful to us.\n4) Let's analyze the options further. 'Accompaniment to meal' is the definition of a complement and is unrelated to the task of finding out whether a restaurant serves milk - eliminating this option.\n5) Next, 'Waitress' is a person who works in restaurants. This is very specific but it's not giving us the information we want, so this choice will be eliminated.\n6) Cafeteria is a place or room where food is served, but it may not always be a restaurant. Hence, this is another option that needs to be discarded.\n7) Finally, there's the choice 'Home', meaning to drink milk at home from a refrigerator or glass - this is even less helpful to our case. 'Home' is another option that can be eliminated.\n8) We're left with 'Menu' as our most suitable answer, because this is the name of a selection of food and drinks, which may be useful in identifying if the restaurant provides milk as an option.\n9) The menu can be seen as an accompanying list of food and drinks offered at a place.\n10) Therefore, the best-suited answer to the question 'How do I find out if a restaurant offers milk?' is Menu.\nSo the final and most suited answer is Menu.", "answer": "E: menu"}

Therefore, the correct answer can be drawn from the remaining options and the context of the question. These have a logical explanation when compared to the other options.\n6. The answer E means 'early riser' is the same as 'night owl' as night owl comes at sunset and night and early riser comes at sunrise, and 'early riser is the same as a night owl', as the night owl, by definition, stays up throughout the night and the early riser wakes up in the morning.\n7. Therefore, the final answer is E 'early riser'. This makes sense as night owls are staying up while early risers are getting up.\n\n```python\nimport re\ndef solve(self, choices,output):\n        options = choices[:]\n        for item in choices:\n            if re.search(r'\"\\'[^\\s\\n]*\\3\\'[^\\s\\(]\"', item):\n                item = item[:item[-2:-11]]\n                item = item.replace(\"'\",\"\")\n                item = item[1:-3]\n                for i in item.split(\"; \"):\n                    if \"<\", \">\", or \"=\" in i[0]:\n                        options.remove(i)\n    answer = \"None!\"\n    count = 0\n    while count < len (options):\n        choice = options.pop()\n        if choice in answer:\n            options.remove(choice)\n            count+=1\n        else:\n            answer.append(choice)\n            print choice\n    if self._verify(answer):\n        print(self.solution", "answer": "C: lark"}
{"text": "1) The first step in solving this question is to carefully re-read the question and try to understand exactly what the question is asking.\n2) We realize that the question is asking about the location of a'small knight'.\n3) There are a few choices given. Read each choice in order to select the correct one.\n4) In this case, we think the small knight would probably be found in 'fairytale'.\n5) A 'fairytale' contains a lot of knights. The small knight is definitely less than the others in size.\n6) 'Fairytale' is what the small knight is most likely to be found in.\n7) Therefore, the answer to this question is C: 'fairytale.\nSo the final answers is C: fairytale\n\nInput: What should you expect to find inside a castle? Choices:  castle C: library B: chapel D: chapel A: armory\nOutput: 1.) In order to answer this question, firstly read carefully the question and try to extract the key information required to answer such a question.\n2.) The question is asking us to find a particular type of building or room called a 'castle'.\n3.) The choices are A: armory, B: chapel, C: library, and D: the chapel.\n4.) Armory doesn't sound like a specific type of building or room. A chapel is a place of worship. A library doesn't seem to be an actual building.\n5.) Therefore, the answer will probably be B: chapel.\n6.) So the answer is B: chapel  \n\nInput: Where would you most likely find people singing? Choices:  C: chapel B: church D: nightclub A: choir\nOutput: 1: Firstly, you must understand the question which asks where we can find people singing.\n2: A choir is a gathering of people who come together and sing, so in this case one would most likely find people singing in a choir.\n3: However, people are not necessarily always found singing in a choir, so the answer will not be A: choir.\n4: Thus, the most suitable answer which answers the question will most likely be B: church.\nSo the final is B: church  \n\nInput: What does", "answer": "D: chess board"}
{"text": "1.\" Competing  \" could be a general term referring to any type of competition, which means there are various responses, such as \"stress\".\n2. \"Two people\" indicates that the two parties are both competing, so \"two people competing get into\" indicates \"stress\", \"debate\", \"argument\" or \"tension\".\n3. To eliminate \"stress\" and \"tension\", since they are undesirable outcomes from the competition, we use our common sense to make the logical prediction that a more positive, beneficial outcome will come from the competition. This could be \"winning or losing\".\n4. Check the eliminated response and notice its usage. Notice that \"competing\" and \"winning or losing\" both have the \"two parties\" in them.\n5. This means the logic is sound so far, and our next step should be to combine the words to get a response that could represent what two people competing get in to.\n6. In this case, the two parties \"two people\" compete, \"competing\" should be replaced with \"two people competing\", and \"winning or\" needs to be replaced as well with \"when two people compete\".\n7. \"When two people compete they ________ win.\"\n8. In this context, if \"two people competing\" refer to both sides of the competition, then the logical conclusion of this statement should mean that whoever competes, wins.\n9.

At first glance, the answer choice that only has the correct terms would be a logical answer, but after doing a close reading and noticing the other type of movies listed in the question along with the teacher's request to identify the missing genre, it is found that the missing genre is actually horror movies.\n3.

{"text": "1 Start by answering the question as follows: The question asks about the location of a paper notice.\n2. The possible choices are: front door, conference, classroom, refrigerator, and suitcase.\n3. The notice may be left somewhere where there is a specific purpose or opportunity to be contacted.\n4. A suitcase is not a typical place where someone would see a paper notice, although they may be left there temporarily.\n5. 'Refrigerator' is a specific place where the notice would be left. Hence, this is the answer choice that makes most sense in this context.\n6. However, when checking the other answer choices, we could eliminate'suitcase' and 'front door' because they are specific choices.\n7. Also, 'classroom' and 'conference' seem to be appropriate. But eliminating 'front door' also eliminates 'conference' because a conference could be anywhere, including the front door.\n8. Therefore, since it is impossible to eliminate all the answer choices from the list,'refrigerator' and 'classroom' are both valid answers since they seem to fit in the given context; the final answer is D and E.\nSo the final correct answer is D and E: refrigerator or classroom", "answer": "A: front door"}

Notice that all the options but one makes sense and would be true for an obsessive person and therefore it's not hard to identify which one is not the right answer.\n5. The only unusual one is option E: wet towel, which would not fit a reasonable character as it would have been a completely irrational action (or at least not one related to the action of washing the hands).\n6. The only right answer to the question is A: use soap.\nSo the final answear is A: use soap\n\nInput: I was not interested in going out, I had better stay with what? Choices: A: boredom B: mood C: time D: family E: house\nOutput: 1 Read the question carefully and think about the options that may fit the context as possible answers.\n2. The given options are A: boredom, B: mood, C: time, D: family and E: house\n3. Think about the possibilities: could staying in the house be more interesting than going out?\n4. This option would be possible only if you were at home and decided to simply stay there due to your uninterest in going out.\n5. Thus, we can conclude that E: house is the incorrect answer because it is a wrong conclusion to think about staying inside the house when you could have also stayed at home.\n6. Therefore, if you eliminate that option, then you get the most plausible answer C: time.\n7. This is plausible because time is the same thing as staying inside.\n8. Thus, the answer to the question is C: time.\nSo the final question is C: time\n\nInput: What is the opposite of a question?

We then find the answer to the word \"sim\" - similar, which is \"sim\" and we can break it down into two smaller letters \"si\" and \"m\".\n4. Our combined prefix and suffix are \"si\" but we know they come from \"similar\" and \"ment\" respectively.\n5. However, not all prefixes and suffixes follow this pattern, so it is important to understand what the word \"m\" mean in terms of prefixes and suffixes.\n6. The word \"m\" means \"the final consonant of a word from which we take a prefix and suffix\" for example m in math.\n7. Therefore the word \"identical\" means \"final consonant\" and we can also infer that \"id\" means \"we can take a prefix and suffix\".\n8. We can therefore conclude that the word \"identical \" means \"the final cononant of a word from where we take a prefix and a suffix\". \n9, Next, try to find a word that means \"somewhat similar\" with the given prefix of \"sa\".\n10.

The options are as follows: slender, free flowing, sparse, unacquainted and diet.\n5. Consider each option carefully while thinking about if it makes sense or not.\n6. Slender does not relate to thickness or size, and so it cannot be the correct answer. It sounds wrong when comparing the option 'free-flowing' and the question where it asks: 'What might someone want to become if he or she is _______?' The first thought is that a slender person is tall and not thick.\n7. An acquaintance may be thin or thick, but in the question it asks about someone who is physically thick.\n8. The terms 'unacquainted' and 'diets' relate to one trying to become slender or thin.\n9. 'Diet' in this context refers to a person making deliberate changes to eat specific foods.\n\n10. When analysing the options, it becomes evident that 'free-flowing','sparse' and 'unacquaint' are more plausible options.\n11. 'Sparse' refers to something which is not present in great amount. 'Free flowing' and 'unacquiant' are close to the answer but 'free flowing' does not refer to thickness, and the term 'unacquiant\" lacks specificity.\n12.

Where should I look? Chocies:  A: drawers B: cupboard C: safe D: storage unit E: room\nOutput: 1.) Start by evaluating all these given choices.\n2.) We begin by checking that safe, drawer, and storage units are unsuitable as these don't contain cheques.\n3.) Next, check cupboards that hold a variety of information, like bills, receipts, and letters but may also hold other items. Cupboards are also not where someone may look for cheques.\n4.) Lastly, check that rooms are large and private. They could be where to keep cheques.\n5.) However, since cheques are getting closer to the end of the customer's bill cycle, he may not want to go through the trouble of opening a new room to store them.\n6.) Now we can eliminate rooms, so we are left with cupboards. \n7.) A cupboard might not be the best place to keep valuable items like cheques.\n8.) Next, check drawers that hold a variety of items, like bills, pay stubs, and receipts.\n9.) Drawer is also not where someone may check for cheques.\n10.)

We can easily eliminate'retain' because it doesn't make sense that 'the enemy' would retain something from Bill.\n4) Next, consider the remaining answers. 'Embracing' doesn't seem to be related to this situation as Bill did not 'embrace' anything.\n5) The remaining answers are 'Engage', 'Engage' and 'Smile'.

The most important clue to finding the correct answer is observing that the word 'liquid' is used in the question instead of merely saying 'water'.\n3. Looking at the choices, it is evident that choices A and C don't make any sense, because \"people gathered in a workplace near water\" would be impossible to be found.\n4. It is also evident that choices B and D are too general to form a reasonable answer, because they would include many different types of events that aren't related to this question.\n5. Therefore, to get the correct answer, we should focus on the remaining two choices: A: water cooler and E: beach, which both contain the word \"water.\"\n6. Now, we have eliminated everything that is irrelevant to the answer.\n7. We have to use reasoning by eliminating and choosing the option that is most specific.\n8. We can be sure that the water cooler cannot be the right choice, because the water cooler would contain water but it would not contain \"people gathered near it\".\n9. We can also be sure that the beach cannot be the answer, because the beach would contain water but it is not located in a workplace.\n10.

However, 'The great outdoors' may seem to have some possibility, but we need to remember that the foxes were being referred to earlier and that foxes would find themselves in forest, far away from the great outdoors!\n7. So 'Great outdoors' doesn't give us the answer we are looking for.\n8. From 'England', the idea is that foxes are there in open areas, but since an open area is also a forest, the answer must be a different specific location.\n9. Therefore, the answer is E.\nSo the final is E:England\n\nInput:Which of the following is a 3 letter word ending in A?

'Chinese' or 'French cuisines' do not have anything to do with 'eating small dogs.'\n5. The option 'Good hands cuisines' make sense because it is a 'joke' and it does have some relation with 'eating small dog'.\n6.

It is square because of the power source, the nuclear engine, the central and most powerful, was designed when there was no practical way to rotate such an engine and turn it sideways in the centre to work most efficiently...\". (Source:Wikipedia) We can see from the above two sources that the control room of the Tardis doesn't remain in a usual square shape. In fact, according to the series, the control room is always in the shape of a cube/cuboid or sphere (See images below).\n3. Let's have a look at the choices. One of the choices, \"center\" makes sense in relation to the cube that we see in the tv series \"Doctor Who\". As the cube (the control room) is a part of the bigger cuboid, so we can say that the control room is positioned in the center of the cuboid. However, the other choice, \"bowels of the ship\" isn't logical which implies a place where things are being processed, as it is a part of the ship. Also, it is not mentioned anywhere that the control room is in a sphere like structure. Hence, we must choose option C.\n4. Therefore, the correct option is C: Basement\nSo the final answer should be C: basement\n\nInput:If you want to sell your car you should contact a licensed dealer, is this true or false?

A platform would traditionally be a raised section of land which would have been used as a raised platform on which a person would stand in public.\n2. Start by eliminating as choices that are clearly inappropriate choices. In this question, D: Concert hall, E: Museum, B: Building and A: Arena are not suitable answers because the question specifically requires a raised platform for public use and not a raised section of land.\n3. Next, start eliminating choices that do not fit the use for this in public. A platform is traditionally used as a platform where people can stand and address an audience. BUILDING is for a regular land property.\n4. Therefore, this means the final answer has to be from C or D. However the question specifically states that a raised platform in public is required, which has only been mentioned for C: Dock, therefore the final answer is C: Dock\nSo the final answer becomes C: dock\n\nInput: We met on this beautiful day, our conversation lasted for many hours, we walked many miles together, we discussed things of great substance, where were we? Choices:  a: in a cafe b: on a beach c: outside on a bench d: on a trail e: in a restaurant\nOutput:1. Start by reading, understanding and re-reading the question carefully.\n2. We have eliminated the options of A: Cafe and B: Beach because these are locations, not actions.\n3. Next we can combine the options on the left and on the right.\n4. The first statement is specific about walking many miles, and is vague about talking about things of great substance.\n5. Therefore, the person must have been on a trail as it is only a trail where you walk many miles.\n6. The person cannot have been in a restaurant, as talking on a trail does not fit into this option.\n7. The second statement, on a bench, is vague but we can combine this with talking for many hours. Therefore, the person could be on a bench talking for many hours.\n8. Next, we can determine what benches and trails have in common and both options have a lot of walking involved.\n9. Therefore it\u2019s very logical that they could be on or near a trail.\n10. Therefore, the", "answer": "A: arena"}

Now compare the remaining options 'grocery store', birthday party', and'sky' as they are closest in meaning to the given context of 'a baloon'.\n5. 'Grocery stores' do sell balloons, but the question here is which type of party requires balloons, so eliminate answer A: 'birthday party' which makes no sense.\n6. 'Child's hand' does not sound appropriate here, so also eliminate the answer B: 'child's hand'.\n7. Hence the answer must be either answer D: 'Sky' or answer C: 'Sky'. However, the term'sky' can be used to describe any event where you can see the sky.\n8. Therefore, we must search for other types of parties where balloons are not needed, which led us to the answer C:'sky' since sky is the only answer that makes sense within the given question's context.\n9. Therefore, the final answer is C: sky.\nSkipped\n\nInput:The scientist thought that the research was going well, which meant what?

{"text": "1: Aside from the question itself, one needs to read the directions carefully to understand what the question expects from the user.\n\n2. If you were to ask any person about the color yellow, most would attribute the color with bravery or courageousness. This is why the keyword 'opposite' is relevant. In this circumstance, 'brave' would then be a reasonable answer.\n3. Check given choices:  a. The attribute courageousness in English is spelled courageous. However, the word chosen by the makers is courageous. The makers have deliberately substituted the English word courageous for the word courageous.\nb. The keyword 'carrier' is uncommon as a noun. Therefore, one can discard the option.\nc. The keyword 'achromatic' is uncommon as an attribute or personality. A better word choice for that would have been'heterochromatism'. But the keyword 'yellow' is associated with bravery or courage which contradicts the word 'achromatic'.\nd. The attribute 'brave' is closest to being correct when it comes to describing a person who is bravery or has courageousness. The word 'brave' also denotes heroic and it is often used to describe people who have had courage.\n\nSo the final answer: is D:BRAVE\n\ninput: Which of the following animals has a poisonous bite or sting?

{"text": "1 The man is looking for cotton in the specific context of medicine. Therefore, the answer depends on the medication that requires cotton.\n2. Options B and D do not refer to cotton in a specific way, so they are irrelevant and can be rejected.\n3. The phrase 'pocket' can have a meaning more than one level of abstraction down, such as referring to a wallet, which would be a wrong answer.\n\nInput: I wanted to contact several people in my class, where should I look for their contact information? Choices:  a: directory b: list c: book d: certificate e: roster\nOutput: 1 Start by reading the question.\n2. The words used in the context of this question are 'people in my class'. \nSo the possible candidates are roster, list and book and are given in an increasing order as below.\n3. The roster has 'people in my class' as its subset but contains other details such as membership, address, date of joining etc. So it is not a candidate in our attempt.\n4. A list contains an unspecified number of names. If so this list should include names of those who are in our class. As there are many names in the class, a list would not help here. So this option is eliminated too.\n5. The word 'book' is being used for 'binder book' or 'directory' but cannot be assumed as the word 'book' in its normal sense.\n6. As option given in the question is 'contact information' of 'people in our class', option 'Certificate' is not a choice to begin with.\n7. 'Book' can be a binder book or directory too. Hence it is left to the user to eliminate the option. The word directory in the given question refers to a binder and therefore this option is eliminated.\n8.

{"text": "1) Start analysis by reading and understanding the question.\n2. The literal representation of the problem is that, in order to eat the fruit, a person crosses a red bridge. We are asked where the person can eat fruit that is on the red bridge.\n3. If we ask what fruit can you eat on the red bridge? It means where can you eat a red fruit if you are crossing the red bridge? Or in other words, 'Crossing a red bridge, is the red fruit eatable on a red bridge, or is the red fruit crossable only on a red bridge?'\n4. All the four answers except 'A: Refrigerator\n' are all plausible and logical. In that case, the key difference is the tone of the answers.\n5. For instance, 'San Francisco' is a place in San Francisco, California and this place is neither red nor includes a bridge, or fruit or anything that relates to the question.\n6. Hence, 'San Francisco' does not pertain to the context of the problem and is not relevant to the question.\n7. The other possible responses such as 'Riper', 'Red', 'Dryer' all suggest that someone is trying to eat the fruit but it just gets drier or a red one or a ripener. Although, such answers might seem viable, none of them have the required context to pertain to the question.\n8. Similarly, 'Crossable' is not very specific and even though it is a fruit, this fruit might not be crossable on the red bridge. Hence, 'Crossable'.\n9. For such reasoning problems, we don't have to search for the exact match of the exact problem but we can relate and connect certain concepts.\n10. Therefore, the most plausible option is 'B: Engineering School' as we can consider 'School' as a fruit that can be crossable on the bridge.\nSo the final  answer is B: Engineering School.\n\n\nInput: Do you want to watch the movie?

Further, 'over eating' is excluded because it is not synonymous with 'addiction'.\n4. Going through the remaining options - 'over eating' and 'fatigue' are also not the right answer because the question is asking about what is causing David's suffering and not his addiction.\n5.

Once again, it is obvious that the movie is not a recorded playlist because it is customized to an individual taste and it is an original work.\nNapster: A music sharing platform, implying a lack of originality.

What causes the speaker to swim better while they have one eye closed?\n5. This could be because the eye may be different compared to the swimmer's other eye.\n6. Check through all of the choices and eliminate those that don't make sense or don't have a valid logical explanation.\n7. The choices are a,b,c,d,e and f.\n8. Choice b makes no sense since each eye should cover the entire horizon, not just a small part of it.\n9. Choices d and e aren't relevant since one eye doesn't directly cause another eye to function any differently.\n10. Choice a is likely causing the speaker to feel better while swimming with one closed eye and could cause them to swim with one eye closed.

Choice 'play' may have been a correct answer, if the question had indicated that the cat's daily routine was to play. However, the question makes no indication as to that specific activity, so the option that best corresponds to a common routine and is most likely to disrupt that routine is none of the options but 'need food'.\n7.

Similarly, 'leg cramps' is related to legs, but'sweating' is related to being outdoors. Both can be eliminated. 3. The option'restlessness' implies that taking a shower after getting out of a run will make one agitated and restless. This seems illogical to the question, so this option can be eliminated.  \n4. Thus, there are only two choices left in the statement.\n5. Consider the choices between'refreshing' and'sweating'. While'refreshed' fits with the idea of taking a shower,'sweating' doesn't seem to be related to a shower at all. 6. However, the option'sweating' could work logically from another perspective. It suggests that one sweats after being under the sun while being outdoors for a run, and this causes one to become refreshed.\n7. Therefore the most logical answer is 'becoming refreshed,' because'sweating' makes sense.\n8.

It implies that, the main character in the story is cold and seeking warmth.\n2) Look at the context of the other options and check for things that may make sense, that the main character would do in order to get comfortable.\n3) Remember that the options are the possible outcomes of the action of curling up under a blanket, to seek warmth. There are also logical clues to help narrow down the options.\nFor example, the option of sleep is out because she is not sleeping, she is seeking rest, warmth and comfort. \n4) Also, the option'sweat' doesn't make sense since it is not a natural reponse by a person who is feeling cold, to seek warmth and comfort.\n5) Finally, the option of 'cuddle' doesn't make any sense, since cuddling someone to get closer involves physical contact and warmth.\nTherefore, all the other options except 'cuddle', make sense, leaving us with the options; 'feel more comfortable', 'blush' and 'cuddle'.\n6) The action of feeling more comfortable makes more sense for the context of curling up under the blanket, to seek comfort and warmth. It leaves one wondering about what she could feel. It could be warmth, she might even be feeling more relaxed. However, it is not known what she is exactly feeling.\nAnother problem occurs when one has to figure out whether she would blush from feeling what exactly. A possible hint is in the context of the situation. The main character is probably cold because she isn't wearing warm clothing. Therefore, she might be embarrassed about being cold and her blanket behaviour might be a way of compensating for the embarrassment. There might be a conflict of what she would do to feel comfortable, if she wants to feel comfortable or embarrassed.\nHowever, a person feeling more comfortable, will also lead to other emotions arising such as embarrassment and then more embarrassment, when one is thinking about what kind of clothes to wear or feeling warm. Therefore, this leaves B as the option; \"she felt more comfortable.\"\n\n7) Final Conclusion, \"She curled up under the blanket to get warm and felt more comfortable\".", "answer": "B: feel more comfortable"}

Choices:  B: c D: f E: g F: h\nOutput: The statement is given in a certain order, so there is no point in trying to reorder it as it is already written and stated in a proper order.\n2. The letter X appears to be an irregular letter.\n3. Now, we get to look at other letters.\n4. The letter B is a regular letter, if it is replaced with C or D, it would not work as that letter can play in more positions than the replaced letter.\n5. Therefore, B would not work.\n6. Similarly, F cannot follow immediately after C and work if C is replaced with the letter H.\n7. Therefore F cannot be the answer.\n8. Therefore, C, D, H or F cannot replace U.\n9. We can discard C, D or H.\n10. Therefore, we are left only with F, which does not satisfy the criteria.\n11. Therefore the final answer is F: letter h.\n\nInput: I like to listen to a good variety of different songs. But I don\u2019t mind hearing some of my favorites over and over again too.

{"text": "1: Examine the question carefully to understand the context and the situation.\n2. Realize that the question implies that the person who answered this question has attended at least one opera.\n3. The answer options are 'fall asleep','sick', 'headache', 'boredom', and'relaxation'.\n4. Eliminate unsuitable or inappropriate answers such as 'fall asleep' as this cannot be done by someone who went to an opera.\n5. Another reason to disregard'sick' is that the question asks for something a person FEELS when they go to the opera.\n6. It is not very likely that a person would have the 'headache feeling' immediately after the performance, but it is likely a person would feel it a few hours after a concert.\n7. The answer 'boredom' will sound logical in such a scenario, but in fact, anyone watching a good performance will surely feel the exact opposite.\n8. Hence, the most sensible answer is E: relaxation.'\nSo the final answer would be E: relaxation", "answer": "D: relaxation"}

What should you notice? Choices:  a) An outdoor restroom b) Some garbage cans c) An abandoned tool shed d) A tall building e) A bicycle\nOutput: 1 The shortcut through an alley is a new context we haven't encountered yet. 2 We are to notice \"a tall building\". The question is not about garbage cans, outdoor restrooms, abandoned tool sheds, bicycles, or anything else except a tall building.\nSo the final answers is B: A tall building\n\nInput:Which of the following is a fruit that has many seeds inside the fruit? Choices:  apples apricots oranges pears lemons\nOutput: 1 Read the question carefully to make sure you are familiar with the meaning of each of the words. 2 The seeds are only found in fruits that contain seeds (not all fruits do contain seeds), so the question is asking us to find a fruit that does contain seeds.\n3 There are four choices and one of them contains seeds: oranges. We can eliminate \"lemons\" since it is a fruit that contains seeds inside, but it is not a fruit that has many'many' seeds inside.\n4 The term \"oranges\" applies to \"oranges\", \"orange\", \"oranges\" and so on, but since there is only one \"oranges\", it is the correct answer.\nSo the final choice is A: Oranges\n\nInput: What did the detective say to the killer?

What's one obvious _place_ people might go to celebratr\"\n2) Start by taking a look at the \"obvious place\" options, namely parks, a state park, a carnival, Disneyland, and an Opera.\n3. A park is a more obvious candidate than any of the remaining options. One of the most popular celebratory destinations is the amusement park.\n4. A state park is more of a nature or activity park than an amusement park, so it is not really \"obvious place\" that people would celebrate.\n5. Disneyland is, perhaps, a suitable choice for amusement park, but is too vague a term, \n6. as it is not clearly implied that 'Disneyland' should be understood as an amusement park.\n7. A Carnival may be a place for carnivals or fairs, but it may not be the type of place that people go to celebrate something.\n8. Finally, an opera may be a part of celebrating, but what is the context of the festival? Does it refer to any specific opera? This is not clear. Therefore, we can eliminate all the options except 'park'. So the final answer is A: park", "answer": "C: disneyland"}

Lawyers help you understand what you have to do when you want to divorce. So Divorce itself is not paid to lawyers.\n3. It is the other party who pays lawyers to get divorced.\n4. Now the question clearly specifies that lawyers and their fees go up astronomically.\n5. The second part is just an additional information. There is no question here.\n6. Now the options: A/B/C are not appropriate as they do not relate to the fees. So we can eliminate them.\n7. The option D does not provide any information which can help us answer the question.

The phrase 'when people do not have enough food' suggests that they do not have enough nutrition because of which they may also lack energy.\n5. The phrase \"they steal\" means that they cannot steal anything because they can not even move due to lack of energy. Logically, people cannot talk to each other as well if they are starved.

An occupation like a writer allows to write.\n5.) This is similar to creative writing. \n6.) A singer also can sing and dance.\n7.) An option like 'create art' is too vague. It is true that an artist can create art, but it can also be true that a non-artist can create art.\n8.) Since a dancer can also dance and a singer can also sing, the correct answer must refer to one which has not been mentioned before. It must be one that is an unusual occupation to be doing creative things.\n9.) A writer and a singer can perform creative things. However, a dancer and an artist cannot perform any creative things, because to be an artist you must already be creative.\n10.) Therefore the correct answer must refer only to a singer or writer who earns a living by making art.

Exhaustion is the adjective form of the word exhaustion. The subject and predicate will change in order for the choice to be a correct one.  The sentence is 'The man was exhausted.' The sentence 'The man was exhaustrion.' is wrong.\n2. The options 'He entered the room for the fist time in his life' and 'He was exhausti on' have changed the subject and predicate.

The final options left are B, C and D.\n9. Option B, \u2018garment\u2019, is eliminated because it doesn\u2019t make logical sense to fall on a garment and not fall on the body because the garment is a covering only.\n10. Finally, option D, \u2018body\u2019 is also eliminated because it isn\u2019t possible for a person to fall and hit his body.

If a student makes a mistake, then it is because you miscommunicated or misread the question, and not because of the student's ability.\n5. For this question the answer that stands out as being irrelevant is A: \"Laugh\".  Nobody would be laughing as this is the activity that is being performed at play.  Only a child who has a particular problem or abnormality of any kind would be laughing at the playground.\n6. A: \"Sitting\" is also not a good answer since sitting would be only for a short period of time before playing.\n7. C: \"Happiness\" is also not correct since the child will not be happy all the time.  The child will enjoy playing but this is not happiness all the time.\n8. Therefore correct the answers to D: \"Being Entertained\" is the most correct option here since it makes the most sense in the context of the question.\nSo the final answers are D: Being Entertained\n\nInput: Which is longer, the red rope or the blue rope?

{"text": "1: Start by trying to understand the question carefully.\n2. Examine each of the given options.\n3. Notice for example that church does not make sense since church is a religious building and wine is an alcoholic drink.\n4. Option bar and wine does not seem appropriate as bars are usually open and wine is an alcohic drink.\n5. Option art show is obviously inappropriate since it is unrelated to wine storage.\n6. Option basement is probably the most appropriate choice as it means that you store wine in a room beneath the house (aka basement).\n7.

Think logically about what types of people might keep plastic things in each of their places, and which can they have the most of.\n3. The most likely place for a person with children, that is most likely to contain many plastic things, is their own home. \n4. A garbag dump is obviously no place for a person to have many plastic things. This is also not the right answer because the other people would not likely have them.\n5. A cupboard can be a good place to keep and store things, but plastic things might just need to fit in a drawer or container.\n6. A cabinet, like a cupboard, can be used for storing things but would it be the best for keeping plastic things?\n7.

So, the way to find out where to put the red stamps would involve analysis of the choices. \n4. To eliminate the incorrect choices, we can compare the choices that are right with the question.\n5. 'under' makes no sense because there is no 'top' or 'on' in the question.\n6. Therefore, this could be eliminated.\n7. 'between' does not make sense, because the question does not specify whether the stamps have to be placed in between each other, there are many other places a red stamp could go to.\n8. In the end, only 'on' could possibly be the right answer.\n9. The logical and clear cut question was: 'A lot of", "answer": "C: own home"}

A 'glove' is used to protect a man from heat, therefore, it is not possible for a glove to be full of water. Hence, option 'A: Michigan' does not make sense.\n5) The term nursery refers to place where new plants are started. Therefore, this cannot be the answer. Hence 'Nursery' is eliminated.\n6) 'Tide pool' is a small pool formed between rocks along the edge of the shore. Anemones tend to grow on the walls of a tide pool and thrive in shallow water where low tides occur.\n7) The largest tide pools on Earth are found in the Atlantic Ocean.  Hence, the answer is Atlantic Ocean.\nSo the final answe is C: tide pool\n\nInput:I had just finished reading a book that the teacher had assigned an essay on, what should I write?

The only possible logical explanation is given in option D: sent to the police station. 6. So, D: crime scene is not the answer. If this were the case, then the investigator would not be looking at the evidence of a particular piece of crime scene.\n7. Another possible logical explanation is that B: back to its rightful owner is not the answer because that would only make sense if the investigator were not examining it as evidence but rather was giving it back to its owner.\n8.

Additionally, the ocean is known for being clear and containing marine life.\n\n**South Pacific:** The South Pacific would have no clear tunnel and would most certainly not be safe or clear enough for one to view sharks. Additionally, this part of the globe is not known for being rich with marine life to view.  \n\n**Sea World:** Sea World may have a tunnel through which one could view sharks. However, this would be unsafe and not located in the Pacific Ocean, making the choice an unsuitable answer.\n\n**Indian Ocean:** The Indian Ocean does not have the Pacific Ocean's cleanliness and is not well-known for containing marine life.

Fear, free and problem seem like viable options to choose from. However, according to the question, the word \u201cgo\u201d is an adverb and it indicates that \"God\" is a verb. We also notice that God is capitalized in the question. Therefore, the meaning or intent of the whole sentence is to go to God. This is because \"go\" is an infinitive and it means to perform any action.\n4) Thus the correct answer is: (A)", "answer": "A: guilty conscience"}

For each one, assess the given options: 'Field' is a plausibly natural choice but it has an ambiguity as it can mean either a large space of land or a sporting field. Check whether there other suitable synonyms for 'a large field'\n3. Eliminating choices: 'Alone' and'small group' are suitable choices but they are not relevant to what the options are describing. Eliminate them from consideration.\n4. The options'solitude' and alone' have the same meaning as they both signify the absence of others. \n5. 'Solitary' is in fact a synonym for 'alone', but its position as the first choice would make it sound inappropriate.\n6. Hence, the answer must be one of the remaining choices.  \n7. Of the remaining choices,'small group' is too specific to be relevant to the question, and 'field' sounds repetitive because it has already been eliminated.\n8. The synonymity of'solitude' and solitary' makes it unnecessary to include two options with the same meaning so the most likely choice is'small group'.\n9.

We can eliminate these choices from the problem.\n8. The remaining choices, which need to be considered are: D: have friends and E: see people.\n9. The two choices are relatively similar because a person in general can do both - have friends and see people.\n10. It can be said that these two choices are not very dissimilar.\n11. Thereby, as they are similar in nature and are choices that don't make any sense, they can be further compared.  \n12. So, firstly, examine if choosing to talk with people is possible for them.\n13. Both 'D: have friends' and 'E: see people' are acceptable because these actions of talking with other people can indeed be an activity of a person.\n14. Thus, we have eliminated the 'B: mix' and 'have friends' from the question.\n15. Now consider the remaining candidates:\n16. The remaining candidates will be further analyzed based on their meaning in order to distinguish them or their similarities.\n17. The more specific meaning will be more suitable to answer.\n18. Let's start with 'have friends' which is a very simple action and very straightforward and straight-forward.\n19. It may, however, still be confusing to us because the action of having friends does not appear to be something that is done when we talk with other people.\n20. Therefore, this action doesn't provide enough details that may help in determining it as an option to choose.\n21. Next, consider the choice that is'see people'. The choice of'see people' isn't too clear as to what does this connote, either seeing a person, a place, or something unknown/hidden.\n22.

{"text": "1) Firstly, read the question carefully and try extracting the meaning of the words 'absorb extra ink' and 'fountain pen'.\n2) A fountain pen is a particular kind of pen with ink stored in a reservoir of the pen itself. In the past, pens could be refilled by dipping the tip in an inkwell for replenishing.\n3) When an inkwell becomes full, ink will overflow due to gravity on to other things nearby, hence not spilling all over the place.\n4) But ink from a faucet is more finely dispersed, which then means the ink does not overflow but stays in the pen.\n5) To prevent the ink that overflows from the fountain pen from staining clothes and spreading, a solution to the problem was to soak a shirt into an inkwell so that the extra ink can be absorbed and contained within the shirt.\n6) Ink is then stored in a bottle, not a well.\n7) Another way to get rid of excess ink in a fountain pen is to soak a blotter, which is made of wood pulp, and place it atop the paper.\n8) Then ink absorbs into the wood pulp and can then be picked up by the side of the blotter.\n9) If an inkwell and a blotter cannot be found to prevent ink from overflowing and spreading, another place to store the extra ink would be in the pocket of a calligrapher' s hand.\n10) The pocket would be made from a fabric that is finer than those of shirts and blotters as to allow ink to dry.\n11) Finally, ink is dried when not in use, and so does not need extra storage space.\n12) 'Desk Drawer' is irrelevant, and 'Calligrapher's Hand' doesn't make sense at all.", "answer": "E: blotter"}

This option is closer, but it implies that fatigue is the natural outcome of playing soccer for a duration of time.\n5. However, this should not be the case, because a person can keep playing soccer for a significant amount of time without becoming fatigued because some people are physically stronger than others. But, in reality, fatigue occurs after a short while of intense physical exercise.\n6. Thus the option B: fatigue should not be the answer, because it is incorrect.\n7. \n8. The correct answer that fits the question of a long term effect of playing soccer is C: anger, and this is because a person can get angry with a rival player and thus become angry at the game and thus play more fiercely.\nSo the final result is C: anger and the answer is C: anger\n\nInput: At a certain time in New York City's past, was the city a bigger settlement than it is at present?

A jail is usually not the same as a prison because a jail is a holding place for criminals that are awaiting trial or sentencing, while a prison is a place where criminals are actually housed.\n2.

It is clear that 'people' can refer to ordinary civilians or perhaps soldiers. It is equally clear that performing 'jumping jicks' is a type of exercise-related activity.\n2. Next, identify and discard the choices that don't fit in the specifications of the answer. A military base, for example, is not an appropriate setting because jumping jacks are generally a type of exercise that civilians do.\nSimilarly, an opera or church are out-of-scope answers because they are not settings where any type of athletic performances would take place.\n3. Next compare the remaining choices and narrow down the list to the most appropriate answer, which is D: bus stop. The setting of a bus stop makes the most sense, out of the other choices, because this is a place where civilians and ordinary people usually congregate in a group, which is the condition given: \"some people.\"\nFurthermore, bus stop locations often allow for opportunities to perform physical activities to relieve stress during the rush of traveling to or from daily destinations.\nTherefore, the answer is D: bus stop\n\nInput: How has the use of GPS technology changed how people get from place to place?

Eliminate options that do not make sense such as'store' or 'classroom' because the student is going to look for the pencils in his backpack, not at some store or in class.\n3. Next, compare choices 'cabinet', 'backpack', and 'teacher'.\n4. 'Cabinet' sounds like a place to store kitchen utensils but is not related to the action of the student getting some new pencils. Thus, this option is unreasonable.\n5. We can eliminate 'teacher' because teachers don't carry pencils so they don't have a teacher's office just for pencils.\n6. A student typically has a backpack to carry things, so the most reasonable answer is option 'backpack'.\nSo the final answer\nis B: backpack.\n\nInput: I had three quarters and two dimes, what is my total? Choices: 1. First, under each option, write the name of the choice and make a quick calculation for each, showing how many quarters and dimes there are.\n2. If the options are in one of these two categories (quarter or dime) or if the sum of the total is reasonable, check the answer choices for that category, by using the quick calculations.\n3. The numbers need to add up to a reasonable amount. If any choice does not add up to a reasonable sum, eliminate/elucidate that choice from further consideration.\n4. If each choice in one of the categories is reasonable, we can then check which choice is the most reasonable for that category, to complete the question.\n5. If both categories add up to a reasonable total, the two most reasonable answers based on the quick calculations, should be considered for the final verdict.\n6.

{"text": "The meaning of the sentence is to identify whom to call on when someone is in need.\n \n \n \n\n\n\nThe question asks us, 'Whom should I call when I need a favour?' or 'Who can I turn to when I am having some issues in my life?'\n\nTo give an in-depth analysis, the question poses the need for caring. In our lives, some people in our life care about us, and some do not.\n\nSo, in this question, by caring, what does it mean? Let's look at the various options.\n\n'Artichoke' is an animal that you eat. It is not caring. You can't call it to help you. So, we exclude it from the answer.\n\nNext possible choices to look at are'species' or 'all mammals'. We look at different species.\n\nSpecies is defined as the group of animals that can produce offsprings. One could imagine that a particular species may or may not exhibit caring behaviour towards the other species. Therefore, we exclude it.\n\nNow, all mammals refers to animals of the same physical structure, as defined by anatomy, that produce milk and breasts to feed their young.\n\nThe question has an intent of showing caring towards other members of the society. So, although all mammals share the physical traits, they may not necessarily have emotions like caring as part of their physical trait.\n\nNow to simplify things, let's make one assumption to see how useful it is.\n\nLet's assume that all mammals do not exhibit caring characteristics. If this is the case, then clearly, we cannot call any mammals to help.\n\nSo, it means we can exclude'species' and 'all mammals' from the answer.\nTherefore, the options to be considered in the answer are 'person' and 'all live animals'.\n\nNext, we observe 'artichokes'. We find that the main difference is the live animals and artichokes.\n\nAs explained earlier, both 'persons' and 'all live mammals' are rejected because of logical reason.\n\nThus, the only option that remains is 'all live animals'. So the correct answer is 'E: all live animals'.\n\n## 8. A pizzer", "answer": "A: person"}

Then, think about the choices D 'itches'. 'Itches'can refer to the human skin.\n7. Therefore this is the correct answer.\n\nInput : What is a good way to stop a heart from beating? Choices : A: slow motion B: faster motion C: fast motion D: slow motion.\nOutput : 1. Analyse the choices carefully to understand what they mean.\n2. The choices in the question may seem confusing but we can eliminate choices which sound more scientific and sound more complicated.\n3. For example, the choice A'slow motion' can sound a bit scientific and can be hard to understand.\n4. On the other hand, the choices seem more scientific and hard to understand are D'slow motion', and C 'fast motion'.\n5. Now, the remaining choice D'slow motion could also seem scientific and hard to understand.  \n6. So one needs to break down the word'slow' and analyse what it means.\n7. 'Slow' means the same as'slowly' or 'in a slow way' or 'at a slow speed'.\n8. Also,'stop' means to end or not continue an action so it means stop something from being done.\n9. Therefore, 'to stop a heart from beathing means to stop it from beating'.\n10. The remaining choice B 'faster motion' is grammatically incorrect.\n11. Hence, the logical answer to the question is A 'to slow down the heart'.", "answer": "B: feel pressure"}

The choices are 'burlap sack', 'hot country', 'purse', 'pet shops' and 'deep grass'.\n4. The term'snake' is not used in the body of this sentence, so ignore this term in your analysis.  \n5. The phrase 'deep grass' could be said for an actual snake, but 'deep in the grass' could be used to refer to a'smoke screen'.\n6. Therefore, these two options are not a suitable fit.\n7. Next, analyze 'burlap sack'. Although 'burlap' is a material, its use is limited to sacks because it's a fabric.\n8. 'Hot country', although a fitting description for a snake, is not what a'smart alec' would call a place where he'd hidden a snake. \n9. The phrase 'purse' refers to a hand bag.  \n10. The phrase 'pet shops' does not make any logical sense and has no relation to the context.\n11.

'Get back to what?' is the second part of the question.\n5. 'Get back to' is ambiguous so can mean 'to return to something that was previously used for a purpose' as in'return to your work routine'\n6. 'Your work routine' is a phrase that does not sound like it has anything to do with boredom.\n7. Therefore look for an answer that can be used in response to when you tell your boss you're bored and it sounds related to a response to boredom.\n8.

So reject the option'siting down'.\n7: Therefore, the most appropriate answer is'refusing'.\nSo the final answer C: refusing\n\nInput:I wanted to talk about a specific subject, but I couldn't figure out whether it would be an appropriate topic of conversation. Choices:  A. Fiction B. Family C. Celebrity D. Friends E. Religion\nOutput: 1.. Understand that the question implies a choice between two options, which are 'appropriate' and 'inappropriate'.\n2.. The question requires us to decide between 'A' and 'B'.\n3. 'A' must be replaced by 'inappropriate' and we need its opposite: 'appropriate'. So the question states:\n\n4. 'I wanted to talk about [inappropriate] but I couldn't determine whether it would be an [appropriate] topic for conversation'\n\n5. 'B' must be replaced by a description which implies that it is 'appropriate'. Hence, 'B' must correspond to 'appropriate' because if 'B' were 'inappropriate', 'appropriate' would be the opposite of 'inappropriate.'\n\n6. So the answer is 'B', that is, appropriate,\nSo the final answer B: appropriate\n\nInput:This question requires you to choose one of the answer choices that will best suit the situation and make logical sense.

Look at the rest of the question for details:\n   \u2022 'was there nearby' - what could this mean?\n     - This shows that a product from a tree in Ohio would be considered a local product, where the USA could acquire their apples grown in the USA\n5. Read the remaining statements carefully:\n   \u2022 'imported product' - this tells us what type of product the answer must be.\n   \u2022 'USA' - this would indicate that it must be a product that would be imported to the USA.\n  \u2022 'apple' - this indicates that it's an apple.\n6. Combine all these details to make your decision:\n   \u2022 'USA': this would indicate that it is a product that would be acquired by the USA,\n  \u2022 'imported': this would indicate that the product is not grown locally and\n7. Now, think about the choices:\n   \u2022 Does Washington state actually border Canada? If not, the only way this is possible would be if a person smuggles it in somehow, but this would fall under criminal activity.\n   \u2022 Could Alaska actually not have apples or could there be apples that are not in the tree variety (like a hybrid of an apple variety)? This information would be a little too specific.\n   \u2022 Could Ohio actually not have any apples? This is possible and the information is specific, but the term 'nearby' indicates that there is a close area to source products.\n8. The answer must be specific, and also the other parts are not possible as there is enough information to be shown that these are unlikely facts.\n9. There is a lot of information to be read and interpreted, so it helps to keep track of information as discussed, instead of attempting to absorb it in one go", "answer": "D: canada"}
{"text": "1. Start by reading and understanding the full question before answering it. This includes learning the various terms used and their true meanings to the problem.\n2. Determine the possible answer choices using the context and the given information provided. Eliminate choices that do not directly relate to the meaning of the question.\n3. The question is asking us to determine if grooming pet's does not cause INJURY. It's asking you about what does happen as a result of properly grooming your pet's nails.\n4. The other choices are: Training, Satisfaction, Beauty, and Late. You can easily see they are all things that do not mean injury.\n5. Choice E is also not correct because grooming pet's means it occurs BEFORE the late. Choice D does not mean injury so do not eliminate it for this reason either, it also does not mean pet's nails are done incorrectly so, it is still an option.\n6. This leaves choices A and C. A can be eliminated for the same reason D is still kept as a choice because A does not necessarily mean injury. Now just compare C to the given information.\n7. Choice C is clearly correct because according to the question, grooming pet's with nails properly groomed is less likely to result in injury. Therefore, the correct answer is Choice C.\nSo the final sentence is C: Less Likely.", "answer": "C: injury"}

Next, to simplify the problem and gain understanding, analyze the remaining choices: (a). If you don't spoon anything on your bed you can't feel pleasure or pain. BUT Eating Breakfast is a Pain, not to be confused with Vomiting or Pain.\n3. (b). If you don' t spill anything your mess-less but that's not why you eat it in Bed. (c).

The term 'bond jail' might fit in place of the first word of the sentence (passed a) but then the rest of the sentence wouldn't make sense. \n\n4. Option 'C' refers to sexual practice - intercourse. Which does not make sense in the context of the sentence.  \n5. Option D refers to the term \"Death sentence\", which can be related to the sentence given to prisoners who are facing the death penalty.

{"text": "1) Start by reading the question and understand the information it asks about.\n2) Understand that the question is asking about what the person felt after getting a massage on vacation, probably because she felt better or more relaxed after the massage.\n3) Analyze the given answer choices: 1. She doesn't feel anything when she remembers good times, so she doesn't choose A\n2.She does feel a certain emotion, but is it the emotion that she wishes to have brought by the massage? Choose C if yes, if not, Choose E.\n3.While lying in the hospital, would she like to be happier and in a more positive mood? Choose D to prove this.\n4. Now that you know the 3rd correct answer, you can narrow down your choices to D: pleasure and E: nostalgia.\n5. The person's thought process may have been something like this: 'while in the hospital, I tried to recall the good things that happened to me and one of those things was the massage that I got during my vacation. I was happy after the massage, since it was relaxing and I felt happier before the vacation. Therefore, the emotions that I had at that time are nostalgic ones'.\n6. Nostalgia is the feeling that you get to experience when you recall happy memories of something in the past.\n7. Therefore the most suitable and specific option would be E: nostalgia, which is the reason why she was feeling better after the massage.  \n8. So, the final answer is E) nostalgia\n\nInput: The scientists found out that those who exercise get what?

First, read through the question and try to analyse exactly what it is asking based on the sentence structure and verb use.\n2). Notice that the question has a compound subject consisting of those who exercise, so the answer choices should have subject and verb agreements with the compound subject.\n3). Also notice that the question is asking which of the answer choices, are suitable for a specific adjective, which is 'better'.\n4).

A 'table' is not a room or a place where children play, it is something that you play on. There may be a children's table or playroom in the room where the children play, but it is not a table. A 'casino' does not provide the right answer either in the sense where children would want to go and play games. Remember that the question states it is more of a playing game than a 'gambling' place.\n\n13) The 'B' answer is also unlikely to be a good choice, as it refers to a place where we can buy toys for children, again a place where children play is not where children are buying toys. \n\n14) In this case, we will try and see if", "answer": "E: family room"}

Which of these is true about beaches? Choices:  C. They have water, sand, and waves.\nD. People go there to have fun.\nA. People often rent chairs there.\n\nOutput: 1) First, carefully read through the question and identify what it is asking. In this case, we are asked about features of a beach.\n2) The only choices that make logical sense are C and D.\n3) The answer for D is evident once we recognize what 'go there to have fun' means. However, the answer for C is still a bit obscure. This was because the given choices didn't give direct clues to the given features of the beach we were specifically looking for. \n4) The answer could be 'people' because they frequent the beach to 'have fun'. However, people 'go' to a location that 'has water, sand, and a wave'. Therefore, it is implied that 'people' refers to those specifically looking to 'have fun'.\n5) Furthermore, the answer for C can be further reinforced once you consider the last phrase in this question: 'to have fun'.\n6) A person'renting a chair' would most likely be 'going to the beach to have fun'.\n7) This shows the answer is B: People often rent chairs at the beach.

It's clear that he's not worried about rejection or getting less sleep from applying for a job.\n4. The sentence also mentions that he is anxious about \"what is to come\"  which could be a bad omen that the company has rejected him.\n5. Also, knowing that he has experience, it is unlikely that he is worrying about acceptance.\n6. Now, think about the qualifications they're asking for and what they mean to him.\n7. He's worrying about not having all the qualifications that the company is asking for.\n8. The most plausible choices that could follow from the text are:\n9.

If he scores either >1.5 * standard or <0.5 * standard. The probability of these types of scores is simply 0.5. So there is a 1/2 (50%) chance that the student will score lower than the standard cutoff. The remaining 1/2 (25%) is the chance that he will score neither higher nor lower than the standard cut.  This probability is given by:  C = 0.5 + 0.25 =  0.75\n\nInput: How much does the following number need to be added or subtracted to make it divisible by 12?

So, it boils down to two options 'at home and not at home', where 'at home' is the only logical choice.\n11. Therefore, the most sensible answer is A: at home.\n12. Hence, the final answer is A: at/home.\n\nInput: In order to solve it, we've got to find what two things we add and multiply the result by five?

This is why the answer is C: 1, 5 \nSo the final answer.", "answer": "C: at home"}
{"text": "1. In order to know answer, we can start by understanding the question.\n2. The context can be ignored because to begin with, the question is about common actions. Therefore we can start by eliminating extreme options, especially ones which might not exist, such as the doctor's office.\n3. Next, cross out the options which are not relevant to the question, which would be the bookstore or the library.\n4. Next consider the remaining four options- home, table, and bookshelf.\n5. The option 'home' is a plausibly answer as it can be assumed that in most people's houses there must be a place to store books or magazines.\n6. However, we can also eliminate the answer 'table' because one usually cannot place books or magazines on a table.\n7. We can further reduce the choices to 'home' or 'bookshelf', because in these two locations, it is clear where the magazines will have a higher probability of being placed.\n8. The final answer is 'B': home.\nSo the final choice is B: home.\n\nInput: I forgot to pick up bread on the way home. Where should I stop?

Check and eliminate 'brother' because a prostitute is a woman(s).\n4. Check and eliminate 'whorehouse' because prostitution is illegal in many countries, and 'whorehouse' implies illegal activity.\n\n5. Therefore, the options remaining are 'new york', 'corner of two streets', and'street corner'.\n6. 'new york' and 'corner of 2 streets' are both geographical places, but not sure that they refer to where there are prostitutes and what makes a prostitute.\n7.'street corner' does not explain how to find prostitutes, but as the question already stated 'likely', so perhaps there are street corners where prostitution has been going on for so long.\n8. Therefore, 'likelier' than other places is street corners.\n9. Although not so sure, 'Prostitutes' are likely to congregate at a street corner to solicit for customers\n10. Therefore, likely candidate is option Street corner\n11.

{"text": "Start by reading the question completely and analysing what it is asking.  Look at which word does not make sense.\n1. Understand that being paid and losing money are opposite concepts, therefore being paid is not a suitable choice.\n2. Similarly, we decide that being paid is not related to working with wood.\n3. The word 'frustration' is an emotion associated with something that does not go well, and therefore does not belong in a question about working with wood.\n4. Look at the words that belong in a sentence such as being paid, losing money and frustration.\n5. The word that contradicts the other words has to be work with wood. This makes sense in the context of the word combination 'working with wood', so we conclude that the word not working with wood does not make sense. Therefore the correct answer is E: money.\nSo the final choice is E: money \n\nInput: What kind of music is typically heard at a nightclub?

The two remaining answers are \"perform surgery\" and \"study medicine.\" (Both of them are connected to the treatment of the patient, but they are not the answer, and this method is the solution to the problem, so what you are looking for is the answer.)\n5. From the choice \"study medicine\", the meaning of this answer is that the doctor is studying medicine in order to understand its field well, in order to help the patient.\n6.

{"text": "Answer: 1. Look out for the words 'what to do' and 'pushing farther'.\n2. 'What to do' is a clue to suggest that the choices will most likely be related to choices that one may make after a situation of uncertainty.\n3. Realize that 'pushing farther' could also be used interchangeably with 'doing something', which suggests that the choices could be related to actions that 'James' had taken, and may have to take.\n4. Read the given choices carefully and try to figure which of the options makes sense in context.\n5. Read each choice again if it was something to do with actions taken or considered, then cross out the ones that won't make any sense.\n6. 'Destroy' and 'produce' seem like they don't make any sense, as 'produce' has more to do with something tangible and 'destroy' has more to do the opposite.\n7. 'Found', however, is a real-life scenario that could have befallen 'James' at some point in time, and could refer to the fact that he may have gotten into a romantic relationship with a certain lady that he had met.\n8. 'Construct' and 'fix', on the other hand, are more suitable choices because they seem to make more contextual sense with the given information and the previous cross-outs.\n9. Therefore, the appropriate choice for the question is C: 'construct'  \nSo the final answer to the question is C: construct", "answer": "E: produce"}

Next, analyze and examine the choices given for the kind of music performed, such as B: Orchestras, D: Rock band, A Music store, C: Jazz band, and E: music studio\n3. Check to see whether the instrument is a clarinet or not. If it is, it makes more sense to choose a more prominent orchestra as your first choice rather than a music store, Jazz band, or rock band.\n4. Option A: music store has a limited type of music in it as it only comprises of instruments such as pianos, drums, and other instruments. It doesn't usually have an orchestra section in it.\n5. Options D: Rock band and B: orchestra are the most suitable choices. Since 'rock band' isn't specific as it could be jazz or pop or rock style, rock band gives it a broader definition and can work with any genre.\n6. While 'orchestra' defines the composition of an orchestra, which is the only option that fits with this question and its answer choice, the choices given as A: music stores, B: orchestra, C: jazz band, or D: rock band.\n7. Therefore the correct answer is B. Orchestra\nSo the final answer for this question is B: Orchestra \n\nInput: A person with a very good memory is likely to be able to remember what?

Firstly, read the five options carefully and note the possible types of mountains that they could be, for example Denali is a volcano in Alaska.\n3.) To answer which mountain is the tallest, we need to be aware whether the choices give us the information on the mountain's altitude to reach such height or the information is in terms of its base. We also need to bear in mind the units, for example'meters'.\n4. For example, if one of the answers is 'Metropolis mountain' with a height of 4015 meters, the altitude information is in meters and it would be clear that the mountain is 'Metropolis'.\n5. However, if the same answer of Metropolis is given as the number 23, we probably need to ask for more information to answer this question.\n6. Next, take a closer look at the five options given:\na) Denali\n(Denali means 'the tall one' and this is a common name for tall snowy mountains)\nb) Misti\n(this is a name for the volcano 'Coropuna' in Peru)\nc) Roraima\n(a table top mountain in the 'Guayana highlands' in Venezuela)\nd) K2\n(K2 is the name of a second highest peak of Mt.

So we need to narrow down the available options based on the context of the phrase 'in habitat india'.\n4. We can eliminate 'hole' as this is not the habitat where native Lemurs reside.\n5. We can eliminate 'cage' as native Lemurs would not require housing in cages.\n6. 'Habitat' may refer to the area of residence of a native lemur, in this case - India.\n7.

Read through the choices slowly, analyzing the spelling and grammar of the choices as well as the specificity of the information.\n3. Elimination process: First eliminate answers that are specific to an individual European country. The choices 2-8 must be removed.\n4.  Then, consider the type of specificity present in the answer; a list of European countries, or an answer that is more specific.\n5.  In this context the correct answer is 3. A 'Country' is more likely to be a larger mass of land/region/region than an individual state or individual country. By 4th grade standard, the United States is considered one country, not several countries. Since the answer does not specifically refer to a state, or county, the choice of state or county is also incorrect.\n6.  The choice of 'Idaho' could be the specificity desired, but it is a region in the Western (North-Western) United States. According to 4th grade standard and the information given in the question,  Idaho must be ruled out.\n7.  Therefore, the possible choices are between 'New Hampshire', 'Root Cellar' or 'Casserole'.\n8.  'New Hampshire' is a noun/adjective that describes a particular region in the Northeastern (North-Eastern) United States.\n9.

In other words, the question expects a particular answer and will not accept a vague answer. \n3. Read the answer choices to notice that some of them are too specific and not inclusive enough (ex: drunk driving).\n4. Analyse whether each answer choice is suitable for a person that is 'inebriated'.\n5. For example, drunk driving or talking nonsense are actions of a person that is inebriated, but they could have occurred under any circumstance, not necessarily after a certain person getting drunk. \n6. Inebriation can have a broad range of effects on a person's abilities, and a person might drive drunk, or they might forget about drinking and drive anyway.\n7. Similarly, a person with a speech impediment will likely not suddenly talk normally after getting drunk.\n8. Consequently, some answers are specific to the effects of inebriated speech and others are not, and an answer can be ruled out as non-suitable for this question.\n9. So, the answer that would be suitable here is that'someone's speech will likely be likely to talk intelligently'.\n10. Therefore, the most likely answer is C: Speech will likely be better\nSo the final answer: B --> C\n\nInput: How should one dress in a funeral procession?

However, when two teams are competing against each other, the spectators are not envious of the other team. Therefore, the option \"envy\" does not make sense and is wrong.\n6) This leaves only four choices remaining.\n7) Next, evaluate each of the remaining options.\n8) \"Resentment\" is a strong emotion of feeling anger, unhappiness or annoyance towards someone else. However, when two people compete against each other, the outcome of the match should be fair and determined by the strength and skills of each player. Therefore, \"resentment\" does not apply to spectators in a sporting event either.\n9) The term \"winning or losing\" is not applicable, because spectators don't care about who wins or loses the event.\n10) Lastly, the term \"one winner\" is not correct either, because they would have to determine which of the teams would be the \"one winner\" and that would not make sense.\n11) Therefore, the option which does not make any sense is A: envy and the correct answer is C: winning or losing.\nSo the final the answer is C: winning and losing\n\nInput: If you want to see all the results of the election, which of the following is a good place to visit?

First eliminate 'who is going to help me?', since it asks who and not what. The remaining sentences are correct so there are three options left for the question.\n3. Next, note that 'If it would rain today' is correct because English sentences need either the singular 'will' or the plural 'would' to be correct, so this sentence is correct.\n4. 'the most beautiful man is always' includes the incorrect usage of 'is', which must be 'are' to be grammatically correct. So it's B.\n5.

Therefore look at the other given options, 'government', 'people', 'city','sun' and 'trouble'.\n4. 'Government', 'people' and 'city' do not make any sense as a government does not require to have any control over its people or citizens and a 'city' does not require controlling anything.\n5. The word'sun' is also not a suitable answer as sun and stars may not be controlled by humans but may follow their own paths.\n6. Next, look at the term 'trouble'. Does it mean trouble created by the government or caused by the people? The meaning of this phrase implies that it is troubling for the government because the citizens are creating difficulty for the government, which means that the citizens are a cause for the government to seek an alternative solution, so the government requires 'control' over the people as opposed to the people controlling the government or the sun.\n7. Therefore the most suitable answer is C: control.\nSo the final solution is C: control\n\nInput:\"Tell it on the Mountain\", from the song by the group __________\nOutput: A: The Brothers Four    B: The Shirelles    C: The Beatles    D: The Four Tops  E: The Blues Brothers\nSo the final solution for \"Tell it on the mountain\" is B: The Shirellz", "answer": "E: control"}

A laboratory should generally include a test tube holder, a crucible (for heating metals), a gas burner (for heating reactions with gases), and a condenser (for cooling reactions). Other equipment may include stirrers, balances, scales, beakers, and funnels.\n\n4) These equipment mentioned above can be of any type (such as tube, vacuum, test, etc).

{"text": "1: Firstly, recognize a plausible meaning or context for the word \"job\" in this question. To be specific, \"job\" could refer to employment, work or salary to be gained. Therefore the two contexts we should be thinking about are \"gain\" job versus \"find\" job.\n2. Look at all the given choices in this context to identify the one which is most appropriate in meaning and also the one, which would be understood by the person asking the question (the interviewer). To decide this, consider both the meaning of the words and what they convey.\n3. Remember that each word or phrase must be considered in the full context of the question (i.e. in the same way a reader might read it).\n4. Since we are choosing the appropriate word for someone asking, \"what do you want to provide yourself with when applying for jobs?\", and the most appropriate way for someone to answer this question, \"I want to provide myself with hope (of gaining a job)\", then we can quickly realize that the most appropriate option would be to answer \"offer\" since it provides the most direct and specific answer to what the interviewer requested.\n5.

There may be another answer choice that contains the word kill, but it can be eliminated because James's goal could not involve harming others.\n3.) The answers containing the word lunch, (A: body armor, B: ungulate, and C: bomber) may not be suitable, since James may not be actually aiming for lunch, so the word lunch can be eliminated and the choices can be filtered to: B: ungulate and C: bomber\n4.) The answer choice containing the word bomb, (B: ungulate) can be eliminated because a bomb can not only not protect James from bullets but can also harm others, so B: ungulate can be eliminated. \n5.) Now if choose the right answer, C: bomber, what does it mean that the choice is right?\n6.) James is trying to shoot a bomb (or the bomb) with this cannon. If the choice C: bomber is eliminated, that means that the answer cannot be C: bomber, right? \n7.) Hence James trying to shoot a bomb means that his cannon will be overkill, as he will be shooting something other than the bomber that can shield him. The correct answer choice is E: animal, since James is not trying to shoot the bomb, which is an object, but instead, he is trying to shoot something, which is an animal that can protect him from the bullets.\nSo the final answers are E: animal.\n\nInput: Why do I need to put the keys in the ignition? Choices: 1. There is a reason when someone asks a question like this one, so it is better to look beyond the obvious word answers.\n2. Look at the full question text to determine the context and tone.\n3. The word ignition is the focus of this question, and the other options are merely synonyms of ignition.\n4. The tone of the sentence suggests no frustration and no confusion, which eliminates the option keys, the vehicle, and the action.\n5. The other remaining option, ignition, suggests that the person is not looking for another word or for the reason when they ask this question.\n6", "answer": "B: ungulate"}

Analysing the choices: Tie shoelace is not the correct answer since tripping is a result of running and not a cause as it is not related to running shoes.\n4. Rest is not the correct answer as it doesn't apply directly to running.\n\n5. Tiredness is the most likely culprit since it has the word running in it.\n6. Thus, the answer is most likely to be F: tiredness.\n\n\nInput: I wanted to cook something for my dad for father's day, what should I cook? Choices: 1. A: salmon 2. B: steak 3. C: chicken \nOutput: 1Start by analyzing each option one by one, which you can do by placing each word or phrase on its own note.\n2. Read through each choice and the meaning behind each word or phrase.\n3. As to the words and phrases, they are not words from a dictionary but rather, are words and phrases which you are likely to see in a cooking guide, such as in recipe books or online websites.\n4. Compare each choice and check for the most likely to be the choice given the context.\n5. Comparing Choices A and B: salmon is one kind of meat whereas steak is the other. They are meat types, but there are many kinds of meat.\n6. Comparing Choices B and C: steak is a meat type whereas chicken is another. There is nothing in common between these two words other than they are both meats.\n7. Comparing Choices C and A: salmon is another kind of meat whereas steaks are meats too. Comparing the options, A and C have more similarity.\n8. However, salmon is a sea animal and not a meat, so it cannot be cooked to eat.\n9. In conclusion, the more logical option is Choice B, or steak.\n10.

Therefor, the choices that are not specific to creatures (environment, people, actions) should be eliminated, like happiness.\n6. The options \"butterflies\" and \"birds\" might be a reasonable guess, but the correct answer \"butterflies\", will be determined with more context.\n7.

{"text": "1: Start by reading and understanding the question, as well as its context. The context will shed light on the options and what each option could mean. \n2. In the context of standing in line, the terms 'order' and 'queueing up', used to indicate that persons have a particular chronological order in which they are waiting or in line.\n3. The term 'wait turn' is a bit ambiguous because it could mean that one is waiting for it to be their turn in one of several situations, but usually, if there is a turn at all, there is only one queue.\n4. In a situation of chronological waiting in line, there is no need for a queue or turn or waiting your turn, since one person naturally goes to the front of the line, and no anger is indicated. \n5. The option 'wait turn' is incorrect. \n6. The term 'fatigue' refers to tiredness or weariness and is not applicable to the context of standing in a line in a shopping queue.\n7. The idea of standing in line is that you are in a single queue, waiting for a particular outcome as a group.\n8. Therefore, anger is definitely excluded since it's not a reasonable outcome of standing in a queue for something, in this case, a particular item.\n9. The wording of each of the other three options is unclear as it could either mean chronological line queueing (line and queue) or chronologically chronical queueing.\n10. However, 'chronologically' could refer to any time period. \n11. In the context of the sentence, the answer might refer to any person and the chronological order in which he or she stood in line.\n12. There is no way of knowing what the options stand for, so 'questionable' is also an available option instead of 'order'.\n13. Therefore, the context gives us some clues, but the answer cannot simply be determined, so we must guess, which could be either B 'queueing up', D 'wait turn', or E 'fatigue' or any other option that could be deemed appropriate as well.\n14. Since all the other options require further explanation, C would be a plausible answer, meaning standing in line, which requires no further clarification.\nSo the final option is B: queueing up", "answer": "E: anger"}
{"text": "1: Start by reading the question, make sure you completely understand what the question asks you and make note of the given choices.\n2. The clue the question gives is \"store\" and since \"home\" generally implies that the objects are intended to be kept at the place mentioned, it makes more sense to store the dirt at a place within the home, rather than somewhere elsewhere.\n3. Then, start by analyzing all the choices:\n      Fingernails: this does not make any sense, as it is not a place to \"store\" anything and, if anything, it is a place where dirt accumulates, rather than a repository for it.\n      Garden: If the question was worded \"If I wanted to take dirt outside my home, where could i put it?\", the answer will be an outdoor garden plot. However, for the question \"If I wanted to store the dirt in my home\" this choice fails to be adequate because a garden could be anywhere outside of one's home (be it in a park, on a lawn, in a balcony, etc.) and therefore does not directly answer the question at hand.\n      Corner: The corner would be a logical place, but it is not a place people usually put or store things.\n      Computer: The computer is not a place intended for storage of dirt or anything else related to the question asked.\n      Closet: People usually store or place clothes within their closet; and the question does not ask for a place for storing clothes, so the closet is not a viable answer.\n      Thus, the only logical answer from the given choices is E: closet.\n\nSo the final answer  is C: closet", "answer": "E: closet"}

Choices: \n A: customers B: co-workers C: friends D: managers E: family\nOutput: The first step is to read the question carefully and understand the intended meaning.\nThe answer to the question is co-workers. \nThere are two options, co-workers and managers. Managers are very different from co-workers, so they could not be the people you see often, communicate with, or talk to regularly. Even though it might be easy to pick managers because you interact with them regularly, that interaction is probably different than the interactions you would have with co-workers. Some examples of interactions with co-workers are: discuss work-related issues like policies and procedures, share experiences with other co-workers, and have social conversations at the coffee machine..\nIn the case of managers, you may talk to them in a work-related context like meetings, but it is not something you do on a regular basis for the sake of having conversations with them.\nTherefore, the most logical answer is C: co-workers.\nSo the final and the right answer is co-workers", "answer": "C: shop"}

Choices:  Strange A: Bizarre B: Perplexed C: Unusual D: Conforming E: Bizarre\nOutput: 1. First, read the question carefully to determine the meaning of the word strange and how it is used to describe the lady next door.\n2. Compare the different meanings of the words'strange' and 'bizarre.\n3. Check the context and answer choices to determine which word best fits the situation described in the prompt and which one is the main characteristic of the lady next door (i.e. what makes her or her behaviour strange?).\n4. The word'strange' means unusual or not typical; it can refer to characteristics of a person that are not typically seen or expected; or something that is unfamiliar.\n5. On the other hand,'bizarre' means 'unusual' or 'odd. It also means 'wierd'.\n6. Look at the answer choices:'Bizarre'can be eliminated because the context of the prompt does not suggest that the lady next door's behaviour is unusual or odd.\n7. 'Unusual' may be able to fit the description, but the word is not as strong to describe the lady (either it is simply a fact or it is not used often enough). Also,'unusual'is too ambiguous to tell whether the behaviour (and not the lady) is unusual or", "answer": "C: authentic"}

There are six choices in all, hence choose only six from the remaining choices.\n6. For the first choice, the choice 'CPU processor' seems reasonable, as it is a computer hardware component, but the correct option is 'central processing unit' because 'processor' refers to the CPU and 'Central Processing Unit' is the proper term for the CPU in general and is a well-known term.\n7. 'Screen' is another term for the display, which is not necessary, and in addition, most screens are computer monitors and hence the correct choice is 2.Cathode Ray Tube\n8. We do not need the disk drives, as they are one of the things that are", "answer": "D: underground"}

The person will feel abandoned after leaving a spouse or divorce the spouse,\n4. Eliminate the emotion 'grief' because no person actually leaves the world of spouse\n5. Eliminate the answer'solo' because a person can't feel a state of emotion if they've been abandoned by the person who's supposed to be left alone.\n6. The answer 'pleasure' is also eliminated since pleasure involves a person experiencing or undergoing something, not doing it to themselves with an action.\n7. This means the person should feel sad because of the divorce, but not 'happiness' because divorce doesn't make people happy.\n8. Therefore, choosing'sadness' as the most likely emotion for a person will make the person feel like they've been abandoned is option C: sadness.", "answer": "C: isolation"}

Although, one can be talented at many things, this question is specifically referring to a specific aspect of entertianing that she has. Hence the answer is B: talent.\n4) Similarly, the choice \u2018learn about\u2019 does not match because this refers to learning about something that someone else entertains with, rather than one\u2019s own ability.\n5) \u2018Intelligence\u2019 can be defined as someone\u2019s ability to learn or understand.

The question asks what she will be doing to prepare for the inclement weather.\n3. The choices of washing and bathing make little sense when applied literally to weather preparations.\n4. The answer could be in the context of cooking, but the sentence is ambiguous as the word \"an hour\" could mean a long or a short period of time, depending upon whether more than or less than an hour has elapsed since she observed the weather conditions.\n5. The answer could also relate to a task that involves hanging clothes, but here it's ambiguous as to that whether an action of preparation or the result of preparation.\n6. The only option with a clear and distinct context is drying. The option refers to \"hanging and drying her clothes\", a relevant context for preparing for weather conditions that require drying clothes.\n7.

A more rational process would be to exclude the choices that do not make sense and try to infer the most probable answer from the remaining choices. \n5. It is unlikely that a person would go to a hospital to look at a couple of zebras and vice-versa, so we can eliminate choice options C (Hospital).\n6.

Choices: A: lift up B: hold C: hold onto D: reach up E: keep still\nOutput: 1) Read the question and understand the content.\n2) Eliminate the words that do not match with the meaning of the sentence for example in the above question hold onto.\n3) Understand what the scientist had to \"to win\" is the only relevant option.\n4) Reach up is incorrect because the scientist has extended his arm to reach the object which cannot mean he has to drop the object, which is wrong.\n5) If you are still confuse, look back the question and look for the key words. the key words in the above question are: Competition and 'last one', if you can connect these keywords with the task the scientist had to perform then you can easily understand that the scientist had to'reach' the object.\nSo therefore, the answer is 'A- Reach up'.\n\n\nInput:In this question, the scientist had 'to find", "answer": "A: holding"}

School.\n\nInstruction:Answer the following question.\n\nThis is a multiple choice comprehension passage for STEM: School of Code 2017. The STEM school focuses on a variety of subjects in STEM education for a variety of subjects, such as physics, mathematics and programming.\n\nIn mathematics, we deal with numbers a lot. For example, when we talk about distance, it is usually in the form of metres, kilometres or other numerical units.\nBut the distance could also be in the form of a fraction. When we are measuring two points, usually the distance between the two points in the form of a ratio.\nFor example: one end of a ruler is 25 centimetres long and the other end is 30 centimeters long. Therefore, from the given ratio, the distance is equal to 50 centimetres.\nTherefore, an example of a mathematical ratio in real life could be when an eggplant or vegetable costs 40 cents each. The ratio could be 50 to 40.\nThis means that for every 50 cents spent, you can get 50 cents worth of products.\nIn real life ratios also play an important role in many things including budgeting, baking and cooking.\nIt is often used in business when calculating taxes, as well as other important financial documents.", "answer": "D: city centre"}

Analyze the given choices by eliminating those that are irrelevant to the question, in this case: thrift store, bed and shelf.\n3. When considering the option C: Home. It is important to note that 'Home' does not contain 'Bear'.\n4. Eliminate the option 'Thrift Store' because it is too specific in terms of items one can purchase there and is likely not in the mind of someone wondering where to find a Teddy Bear.\n5. Next, eliminate the option 'Bed' because a teddy bear is too large to be placed in the bed.\n6. Eliminate 'Shelf' because a teddy bears are not often found on a shelf.\n7. There are two remaining options, 'toy store' and 'home'. 'toy' shares similarity with 'teddy', both having the word 'toy' in their names. So, both options are plausible.\n8. But, 'Home' is the correct answer, because it is very specific.\nMoreover, there can be many options for acquiring a teddy bear, for example, purchasing one in a store, receiving one as a gift or making one at home.  This question asks about a store that is primarily known for selling toys, so 'Home' fits this context.\nSo the final answe is E: Home", "answer": "E: toy store"}

You could 'tighten' loose papers together to make them less loose, but that means nothing as it doesn't refer to the action of binding or holding the pages together.\n5) 'Faithful' does not make much sense as an answer as it does not really have anything to do with papers or binding.\n6) However, 'bound', 'packaged' and 'compact' are good options because they relate to the binding, packaging and compacting of paper.  \n7) After comparing the two remaining options, you will realize that 'compact' is vague and can mean various things to different people, while 'bound' is very specific and can be seen as the correct answer.\n8) Therefore, in the end, the answer is C: bound.\nSo the final correct answer is C:bound.\n\nInput: How could you solve a problem if it involved no money?

However it clearly said that the key to good soup is to add all of the ingredients together simultaneously. So I went ahead and made the soup. While I was reading the instructions, I did see that it was only once where this did not yield a good soup.\nOutput: 1.)The text in bold typeface and the word \"key\" are both found in the first paragraph of the text.\n2. Therefore, this is a signal phrase which contains a signal word that may be found in the text.\n3. The second question is based on this signal phrase and begins with a question mark.\n4. This question is about the information found after the signal phrase and contains information from the text.\n5. This information is in the third paragraph which focuses on the key to a good broth.\n6.

Therefore, it does not seem like the right word to complete the sentence.\n5) Similarly, for choice B) the 'Large Room' is a nondescript place without an identity.\n6) We move onto Choice C) the \"restaurant.\"  However, it is also an inanimate object, which does not seem to fit the description given.\n7) Choice D) seems to be the most specific word of describing the location. Country club could be a reference to a specific country club in particular in regards to a reception. However, the phrase seems to use it as an umbrella term to talk about any country club. Therefore it is not an appropriate choice. 8) The last and the most specific choice is 'the lobby'.  It is a place with a specific identity with a reception area; it is a place that holds the characteristics of a hall where people would attend reception like events.

{"text": "1) The following information can be gleaned from the question:\n- There is at least one house with several rooms, the question does not mention the rooms.\n- The question mentions what the rooms are named, but does not specify if they have a number or a letter associated with them.\n- The question asks about only one of these rooms.\n- It could be asked about any one of these rooms. \n2) The sentence 'it is his favorite' could mean that he likes it the best out of the many other ones he could choose from or that he likes it more than he likes each of the others; we cannot conclude which one he prefers.\n3) The answer 'basement' is unlikely as 'in a house', 'basement', and 'favorite' do not go together and it would not be his favorite basement.\n4) He cannot be referring to the room numbered '1' because that room could be in any random house or location.\n5) The word 'always' in 'always drew him to the' would indicate that he must like the particular room and keep going to it.\n6) Finally he would keep going to that room in preference to any of the others.\n7) As 'kitchen' means where food is cooked and 'dinner' means food, the term 'cooked' in 'cooked dinner' could refer to any food; therefore the answer 'kitchen' can be eliminated.\n8) He could love food so much that he eats it every single day and therefore be asking about a restaurant. The answer 'living room' does not make sense as he would not be able to eat at any random tables in that room.\n9) In addition, the answer 'garden' as 'garden' does not imply food.\nTherefore, logically the term closest in meaning to 'favorite' when considering the use of 'cook' is 'dinner', therefore the answer B is 'dinner'!\nSo the final answer B is: dinner.", "answer": "C: kitchen"}

Eliminate choices that do not fit this context, such as D: food court and E: capital cities.\n3.) From the remaining choices, make comparisons and choose the best answer.\n4.) The given context suggests that the pizzeria would only be found in an area with a high population of Italians. D as compared to B and A could be possible locations for an Italian population. But a \"Little Italy\" is usually an area of a major city (like Toronto, Montreal or New-York where Italians predominate ). In such cases the name \"Little Italy\" indicates the area is a part of that city, not a country in itself. Therefore C is the most likely answer here.\n5.) B does not fit in the context at all as there is no Italian population that is known.\n6.)

Underline and eliminate the given choices that do not make logical sense. For example, if we are sharing files between computers, it would not be possible to have either a freeway or wires; the radio is used to broadcast content, not to receive it. So eliminating those three we are left with computer network, electrical circuit, and freeway.\n4. Ask the question: what am I trying to share? Is it files or something else? The answer is files.\n5. The question asks for a network that I can share my files with. A computer network is not enough.\n6. The answer is electrical circuit since I can upload my files on the electrical circuit and then it can be shared among different electrical circuits. I can upload my file to a computer network's server and then that network would share the data with the whole network. \n\n\nInput: Where do you get to from Barker Street? Choices: 1.

With red flower-s the plural verb (\"come together\") is incorrect. Therefore, there is a syntax error in the compound sentence and the choice must be (A) because it makes sense.\nSo the final choice is the answer is A: trash can\n\nInput: Who is the director?

First check what the given choices are for that task: (A) Tom Hanks, (B) Steve Jobs, (C) George Clooney, (D) Richard Branson (E) Leonardo Di Caprio and (F) Tim Allen.\n5. Choice (F) has \"Tim Allen\" which sounds correct and it makes sense in the question when you figure out what it's actually saying.

We know that the city is demolishing a garden, which could possibly mean the land has something that can be reused and turned into something valuable.\n4. Therefore, the appropriate answer is that the place will be turned into a \u2018parking lot\u2019 as cars need a parking space.\n5.

For example, people can be sorrowful for a particular reason without being ill.\n9) Thus, these options are either out of scope or ambiguous.\n10) Although option D: unhappy is specific to the question, we cannot discard the other incorrect options as well.\n11) This is to ensure that the question is still answered correctly if the answer to the specific question is not the answer.\n12) In the following question, there are a total of 3 wrong answers and 2 correct answers (A: Depressed + E: Unhappy), so the answer is E: Unhappy.\nSo the final answers are (since they are the same) D: Unhappy", "answer": "A: depressed"}

Moving on to choice:  A: unites states, but this does not make sense, as the question is specific about collecting pollen and also it is not a location known for gathering pollen.\nChoice: C: court is not an appropriate choice because a court does not consist of pollen-gathering locations.

Another option which is possible is 'tardiness' which is the opposite of him showing up early for a job interview.\n4. It can be observed that the remaining options do not require men to portray any specific behaviour, as these things are a norm of any person going for a job interview. \n5. Therefore, we can eliminate these options from the answer options.\n6. There is no option which clearly states he is trying to portray handsomeness through grooming, since there is no indication that grooming needs to be done specifically for looking good, but can be done for any reason.\n7. Finally, the only remaining option D: handsomeness, which specifically mentions grooming as a tool to portray handsomenes may be the most logical answer to the question, as the man may look good due to any reason or none.

If everyone has a different slice then people with a bigger slice then someone else would have more pizza than the other person.\n\n2: It doesn't really make sense because putting a slice by two with one half on the outside means that some people will always get two slices while others will always only have one slice\n\n3: This answer can be done by", "answer": "C: garage"}

The second choice A: towed is a correct answer because if one does not obey the parking rules/time restrictions their car may be towed or towed away.\n8. The third choice B: accidents is incorrect because one can be fined/get a ticket/penalty for not moving their car during the required time but it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be an accident that occurs.\n9.

Eliminate options which do not make logical sense or have no relevance in the context, such as 'buying' and 'purchase'.\n4. Next, analyze the relation between the remaining options 'usually, overpriced and way to much'.\n5. The given option 'usually' means that we must determine whether 'overpriced and ways to much' are logical choices in this scenario, because the 'game' may not always be overpriced.\n6. Hence, it is logical to eliminate 'overpriced' 'way to much' because they may not be relevant or true in the given scenario.\n7. Next, consider the meaning of 'expensive'.\n8. 'expensive' means that the object is more expensive compared to other objects or circumstances.\n9. Hence, the game will be expensive only if the game is compared with some other object or circumstance, but is not compared with itself. Hence, the answer must be 'expensive', because it does not violate this condition, since it was on sale, and was purchased then by the person.\nSo the final and appropriate answer is C: expensive.", "answer": "E: expensive"}

Start by eliminating the options which do not make sense, such as 'present' and 'available.' In these two options, John is not concerned with the job, but rather the location, meaning that they are not relevant to his desired job.\n4. Next you can choose between the remaining options.\n5. Check the location associated with John's job and whether that would be closer to his family:  \"His family.\"\n6. \"Closer\" does not make sense in this context; it might mean \"near,\" but in this case \"far away\" or \"distant\" would make more sense since he is moving from his family.\n7. It is unlikely that 'Closer' is the correct answer because John does need the job, but the type of work that John needs is actually not present or available in his family's location.\n8. Finally, you have only one choice left, \"stay here.\"\n9. \"Stay here\" indicates that John has to work to support his family, so, he is concerned with his job because he has to support his family.\n10.

There is also a possibility to buy apples here. \n3. As we can see, there is no direct connection between 'Indiana' and 'Apple Tree'. 'Farmer's market' seems like an irrelevant option to the question. \n4. Similarly with 'Woods', there is a connection between 'New York' and 'Apple Trees' but not with Indiana or Farmer's Market.  \n5. Based on the given options, we can conclude that 'Indiana' and New York are located somewhere on either the same side or the other side of Lake Michigan. So we must look for an option with 'Midwest' and 'Farmer' market since both of them connect to the 'Apple Tree'.\n6. Since 'Illinois' is a place that can be accessed by \"Midwestern\" traffic, it is the only logical answer.\nSo the final option is A: Illinois.\n\nInput:The two bakers from the bakery were trying to create a recipe for a new bread.

In this case, consider that 'kitchen', 'toy store', 'hand' and'soccer game' are not referencing places that sell balls.\n2. Eliminate any option that does not make sense, given the context of the question. This rule eliminates'street' because it does not make any sense at all.\n3. Elimiante option 'toy store' because it does not specify a concrete place and makes reference to a vague term. Also consider that this choice would be misleading because there might be more than one 'toy store'. \n4. Finally, consider the remaining options, starting with 'Child's hand', which is the only choice to be eliminated. The reason is that the question is asking for the name of a place, not a person.\nThis leaves us with two options, namely 'kitchen' and'store'. But given that this question is contextual, it is more plausible to conclude that the question is looking for a place where one could buy a ball. \nConsider then'store', not 'kitchen', as the answer since it makes more sense. \nFinally'soccer game' is not really a place where one could get a ball and it does not really make sense to say this to the question. \nSo the final answer would be'store', for'store'.\n\nInput:Which one of these is a word used to describe someone who behaves well?

'House' is an artificial environment and there is no guarantee that those who have stayed there recently only exhaled a few times. And exhaled air in an artificial environment will not last long to be the same as the last exhaled air.\n8. 'Train station' is the best option. Passengers who have been on a long railway journey often suffer from headaches or dizziness, thus it is not certain of what their breath condition is.\n9. 'Cricket stadium' is a place for mass gathering, thus it is not assured that the crowd who go there only exhale a few times.\n10.

I started studying the choices available to me, and noticed that only the words \"bee hive\" and \"deck of cards\" don\u2019t have queens in them.\n3. I then considered bee hives, because they usually don\u2019t have a queen and they are a place.\n4. However, I found out that bee hives are not the answer to the question.\n5. I then took a look at the word \"castle.\" It is similar to a bee hive as they both are places that wouldn\u2019t have a queen.\n6. I reasoned that this can't be the answer to the question either because a castle can always have a king, like if the king dies it could have another king.\n7. I saw an option called \"deck of cards\" and knew immediately that it had to be an answer to the question. 8. I re-read the question and saw it said that it could not be always have, so I knew the word \"always\" had to be the right option. I knew that \"always\" had to mean \"at all times\" or all of the time. So I looked closely at the card word next to it and realized that \"queen\" doesn\u2019t make any sense to be part of the word \"deck\" because it is usually replaced by another card that would be a joker.

The option 'Express love' isn't logical as we can't have an emotional statement between'sun' and 'beach', 'the person is thinking about things' isn't a logical interpretation of situation, even the literal one since he is on the beach.\n6. 'to Race against time' makes a logical connection between beach as a place to rest which is contrary to the idea of having an urgent activity like running.\n7. The logical and remaining choice is 'express love' which is a logical possibility, however, the given context and information does not support this because of its opposite meaning.\n8. The correct answer is C: Race against time\nSo the final answer: C: Race against time", "answer": "A: sun himself"}

Realize that the options 'beer', 'play around', 'vising friends' and 'hug' might not always represent how teenagers seek entertainment or enjoyment.\n4. The options 'being understood' and 'playing around' are appropriate for most teenagers but aren't specifically what the question asks.\n5. Therefore the best option is B: being understood because the wording of the answer is more specific.\nSo the final option is B: being understand", "answer": "A: being understood"}
{"text": "1. The first step, as with all reasoning questions, is to read the question carefully and try understand the core meaning of the problem.\n2. Here, the question is asking about the type of behaviour that the little girl exhibited as a result of her attitude, but the meaning of behaviour and attitude are left ambiguous in order to trap the respondent.\n3. Next, to fully comprehend the meaning of the problem it helps to define what is meant by'she did what'. Here, 'doing what' could refer to performing an action, carrying out an idea or taking an attitudes regarding the subject.\n4. As, the options that are left are 'crack' (antipathy), 'being mean' (behaviour), 'disinterest' (behavior) and 'unfeeling' (antiquated attitude).\n5. We can eliminate the last 2 because they're irrelevant to understanding what the child was doing.\n6. We can eliminate 'being mean' because it refers to a child's behaviour and the question is about the'selfish' attitude.\n7. So, we have either 'crack' in the meaning of 'an idea' or 'disinterest' in the meaning of being indifferent towards something. Which means the options are 'antipathy' and 'disinterest'.\n8. So, the correct answer to the statement, 'The little girl was raised _(antiquated_ or _indifferent_ attitude) (behaviour or _idea)_ _(being mean or disinterested.)_'\n\nInput: What is the best way for me to find a lost item at home? Choices:  a) Call someone to help  b) Look on the couch  c) Search the house  d) Look under the bed  e) Use a flashlight\nOutput: 1: The first step is to read the question accurately and analyse what it's asking us.\n2. Now that the question has been analysed, the next logical step is to eliminate choices which are incorrect. In this case, the incorrect choices are 'Use a flashlight' and 'Search the house'. Both choices are inaccurate, because we are searching for an individual item such as a watch or house keys, and flashlights and searches of an entire house do not help us locate a specific item.", "answer": "C: being mean"}

Although we can't know for certain that the type of food will cause food poisoning, the context suggests that this is the most likely scenario.\n5) Therefore, the answer is B: gain weight.\nSo the final Answer is B: gain weight", "answer": "E: food poisoning"}

The 'fresh air' refers to the surroundings the character is in, therefore, 'breathe...'\n\ndoesn't make logical sense, because there is nothing to breathe in.\n\n6. Eliminate options that are unnecessary.\n7. The meaning of 'look around' is different from the context, so this is also a wrong choice.\n8. From the remaining three options, eliminate 'hyperventilate' from your list, because breathing is a very normal part of life that doesn't require someone to hyperventilate.\n9. The other two options left in the list are related to activities, which can be done freely only in a state of happiness.\n10 Therefore, according to the context, the most appropriate answer from what's left is 'feeling good' or to put it colloquially, 'feeling high'.\nSo the final answer(s) is/are C: Feeling good", "answer": "E: breathe deeply"}

If you had one of the four choices above you would be done or at least have 2/3 or 5/5 correct.\n5 Eliminate one answer choice, because it'll be left blank, that leaves you with 3 choices.\n6 Eliminate choice B as it is not a complete logical sentence and therefore doesn't make any sense.\n7 Eliminate choice C because it wouldn't make any sense to be happy about getting a ticket and playing.\n8 Eliminate choice D as it is logically not consistent with the sentence 'if you want to win a lottery from a game'.\n9 Therefore, choice A is the only viable answer.  \nSo the final answer after eliminations is: A.

The third choice, to'sleep', is also too vague and impractical as a person might doze off, but still might not be calmer.\n3. Choice \"listen to music\" means this subject is no longer listening to the passengers screaming at each other, but would he use a headphone for this purpose, instead of a hearing aid? Probably not, since a hearing aid is not a normal piece of equipment for listening to music.\n4. Next is \"stretch out\" which could mean literally stretching out (on the floor) and relaxing, but again you might not feel any better.\n5. Finally, the answer option which seems most appropriate is \"stop worrying\", because the paragraph states the passengers are screaming at each\n6. other on the bus, causing stress and anxiety for both parties.\nSo the final option is E: stop worrying and the answer is E: stop worry", "answer": "C: listen to music"}

When analyzing each sentence, we can discover that the first sentence is lacking the verb \"to see\", it should have \"saw\" instead.\n6.) When analyzing the second sentence, we can determine that the correct usage of \"mice\" is plural, so it should have \"mice\" instead of \"mouse\u201d.\n7.) Lastly, the sentence is missing a capital letter on the first word; therefore the answer choice \"D: Neither\" should be highlighted.\n8.)

The sentence \"...A gentleman is very wealth and flaunts it..\" is an important clue to understanding the question because it hints that all the possible answers given are specific and relevant to a gentleman who is wealthy and therefore, possibly the information needed must also be for this type of person.\n3. The answer choices are Europe, Big house, Tuxedo, Palace and men's room.\n4. Check each choice individually and decide that 'Europe' and 'Big house' are not specific enough for the gentleman and 'Palace' is obviously not required for him.\n5. Men's room is an obviously and incorrect answer choice because 'Palace' already was eliminated, but what is the significance of a'men's room' and how could the answer choice relate to a gentleman?\n6. This question may be difficult for someone who is not well-versed or familiar with tuxedos. However, a gentleman may have a tuxedo tailor-made specifically for him and this could mean that the tuxedo fits him nicely and perfectly. \n \n7. In conclusion, the answer to this question is A: Europe.\nSo the final and most logical answer is A: Europe. \n\nInput: A woman, 100 years old, died one day. How many birthdays has she had?

The second part of the question is determine the even number of birthday you have had in a 100 year old period. \n3. The question hints at the answer 'an even number'. To figure this out, you need to determine how many years in 100 years. There are exactly 20 years in 10 decades, so take the number of years 20 and add this to the age of the woman, 10 years, to find out her total birthdays. \n4. The question hints strongly to 'half of", "answer": "B: big house"}

Similarly, the option E: impatience is wrong because `waiting for the doctor does not require impatience.\n`\n5. Next, compare the remaining choices:\n6. The option A: having appointments is a wrong answer because `people who need to do some works are not expected or able to make their own appointments to see the doctor.\n7.

The question is asking from which tool to make holes in objects, so eliminate the \"master carpenter\" from the choices because he wouldn't have to use the tools.\n4. The object that the carpinter is supposed to make holes in is an \"object\", which can be any kind of object.\n5. This can be a piece of art, a tool, a chair, a person, a computer, or anything else.\n6. The carpinter could also be using other objects, that is why they're called \"tools\".\n7. \"Drill\" is a tool that can be used for opening and closing holes when drilling.\n8. \"Learn\" is a form of learning, which is not related to the actions of a master carpenter.\n9. \"Require obedience\" is a term used to show a strong attitude and means to have a lot of force or power.\n10. \"Understand\" refers to possessing good intelligence and means having a clear idea about something.\n11. \"Spoon\" is an object that can be used as a spoon, but it can also be used in other ways, just like any other object.\n12.

(Too specific)\n4) Drugstore is a noun, so you cannot buy anything in it.\n5) Hand lotion is also a noun that you cannot buy. (Too specific, and also a noun)\n6) Water is a noun which can be bought but is impractical to use as a moisturizer.

Accent + te + ate - so: accentuate= accent + te + aute (aute is a suffix of a word)\n3. Accent + en + te + at e - accent + en + te at e = accentuate = accent + en + tea + at e - this word is a little ambiguous, and seems more like a combination.\nSo, the only possible solution is (a): accent + en + tua + te + ate = accentuate", "answer": "C: drug store"}

{"text": "Given that the question asks about a peaceful transition in society.\n1. A non-violent solution is the only logical answer.\n2. Eliminate options that aren't related to a peaceful transition.\n3. Choices that include demonstrations, votes, and revolutions must be rejected, because they don't indicate a desire for non-violent change.\n4. Options that seem to mention violence for solving problems, like 'action' and 'understanding' require more context and explanation to determine whether they truly imply non- violent or not.\n5. 'Revolution' might be a way to change society without violence, but it is not immediately clear if it is a non-violent one.\n6. Therefore, 'vote' requires more context and explanation to discard it, as voting could be a passive way to change society.\n7. Since a logical conclusion cannot be reached about 'action' or 'understanding', these two options are removed from consideration.\n8. Lastly, the only remaining option is 'demonstration', since it indicates that people are actively and peacefully engaging in protests for their cause, which is the intended action.\nSo the final and logical answer to the question is B: demonstration.\n\nInput: What is the difference between a 'hero' who saves lives and a 'villain' who kills?

Check the synonyms and antonyms of the term 'determine/determination' from a dictionary.\n8. The remaining option'relax' does not make sense when used in response to'something coming true'. \n9.

'Ohio and countryside' are also plausible choices because these words are also related to villages and rural areas.\n5. 'City' and 'Big City' do not necessarily mean in the same way as a village for example big city with a population of over 200000 is less likely to contain villages.\n6. 'Big City' and 'Ohio' also do not contain the word rural.\n7. So we can eliminate options A and F.\n8. From what we learned, the most likely answer may be either rural or the countryside.\n9. However rural can include small towns and villages in the cities so we know the village must be in the countryside or the rural area.\n10.

The main part of the sentence that needs to be looked at, is the underlined words 'at'. Why was it 'at' and not 'for'?\n5. \"Shane was\" would mean the action he did for his father, so the funeral can't be at, but \"for his fathers funeral\", that would imply that shane was there for the funeral.\n6. Another sentence would read \"did shane attend for his fathers funeral\".\n7. But again the words at are used in the opposite sense so the question is \"Did Shane attend at his father's funeral?\".\n8. Then the sentence, \"Shane was supposed to attend his father's funere\" would mean the action or intention of shane, not the funeral.\n9. So the choice that makes sense here would be \"Did shane was suppose(d) to attend his father\"s funeral\".\n10. Choices B and D can't work as the sentence ends with funeral, whereas choices A, E and C don't make sense and are the wrong word combinations to include. \n11.

The answer could be any of the given choices, so the question is reduced to a matter of deduction, i.e. we start from the choice that makes the most sense based on the context of the question, and eliminate the options that do not make sense according to the context.\n4. Here, the answer is quite clear; it is A: hardware store. Why?\n5. The question does not specify that a tool or something else is needed to be collected.\n6. There are no other rooms given, and the question has already told us that the person went downstairs to get something, therefore, the room we have to eliminate options for based on the context has to be the basement, garage or library.\n7. The word'repair' in the choice B: basement does not make sense because the question says 'to get a tool', whereas in the context of a repair shop,'repair' could make sense either as the work of repair is being done in the store or the tool itself is being repaired.\n8. The word 'hardware' in C: garage is the only word that makes sense based on our context, as the question does not say anything other than what rooms the person had to walk in to access the tool.\n9. The word 'library' does not make sense here at all, so this option should be eliminated.\n10. The option B: basement sounds too similar to the choice C: garage and this means either one of these could be the answer, which is not the case as the context points to basement being used here.\n11. The option D: repair shop does not make sense, as the question specifies that the person had to go downstairs and the repair shop would make more sense if its upstairs was used.\n12. Therefore, the correct answer is A: hardware store, as basement is the correct answer here both because it makes sense based on the context and because options B: basement and C: garage are unfit based on their context.\nSo the final answers are A: hardware store", "answer": "B: basement"}

Considering the given options: university, college class, classroom (the second word in this choice is misspelled), classroom, library\n3. Think about what each of the above options would mean. The university is the highest degree-awarding institution in the country. A college (which is not mentioned explicitly in the given options) would be another institution for the awarding of a college degree. And a library would be a place where you can go to store books and information.\n4. Realise that if the student had a report to submit tomorrow then he/she would not be spending more of their time today in either a university or a college class. After all, their only focus would be on completing the report.\n5. The only option still relevant after eliminating the two above choices, would be the class room since it can be referred to as a place where you can get educated.\n6. However, the given wording that can also mean 'the location of a class\" implies that one can also spend their time in a classroom, regardless of being in a class.

{"text": "1) Realise that the key to the problem is to look for the words in the question that are associated with the word 'utensils'.\n2) The given choices do not contain any clue to the usage of utensils.\n3) From the words 'backpack' and 'drawer', we can infer that the answer is not dinner.\n4) From the words 'closet' and 'cupboard', we can infer that  the answer is not dinner either.\n5) Now, we need to analyze the remaining choices of 'B' and 'C'.\n6) 'B' is obviously the backpack, so we can rule out 'B'.\n7) The word 'closet' contains some information about the usage of utensil.\n8) However it does not make sense.\n9) 'C', which is also 'drawer' is obviously a correct answer, and the clue is thus 'drawer'.\nSo the final answer was C: Drawer.\n\nInput: At what store would you find a bakery, a grocery store, and a gas station? Choices:  C: supermarket  B: food court  A: convenience store  D: market  E: shopping mall\nOutput: 1.)  At first look there doesn't seem to be any context from which we can know the answer.\n2.)

{"text": "1) It's easier to reason the answer choices in this question.\n2. A: friendship and B: aggression do not make sense because it is not something one would use as a good way to work friendship or aggression; it should be either a distraction or competition.\n3. However, C and D: win and losing definitely make sense as a good way to improve one\u2019s performance, so we can easily eliminate choices C and D.\n4. Therefore, the only remaining choice we need to examine is E: sweat. It can be inferred that they like challenging and competing against one another by sweating because it means they are putting in effort to improve their performance or are working their way into winning.\n5. Therefore, the answer is E sweating.\nSo the final question answer is sweating\n\nInput: The students were all happy and wanted to thank their teacher for this, what should they do? Choices: 1. Throw eggs 2. Tighten their belt 3. Take a photo 4. Ask for autograph 5. Thank her\nOutput: The question is asking about what the students want to do so they can express their gratitude to their teacher.\n1. The answer is A: Take a photo. We can infer this because it shows that they are happy and they want to be happy. This means they will do anything to be happy.\n2. Tighten your belt doesn't make any sense as this is just a choice and is unrelated to the context of the question.\n3. The answer of asking for an autograph is not suitable because it is not necessary for them to ask for an autograph for them to be happy.\n4. We don't need to think for this choice as it is given in the choices.\n5. As they are all happy, they should take a photo of it.\nSo the final choice is the answer is A: Take photos with the teacher.\n\nInput: On a recent trip, the couple had an amazing experience and had a better understand of what?

The answer would help us when asked about the type of water transportation and the answer would be 'A: human powered.'\n3. Start by crossing out B and E since these terms do not describe water transportation.\n4. Then we cross out C since to'sleep' does not refer to the action of being powered by a human.\n5.

Analyze the remaining choice'socialize', it's plausible but still insufficient in terms of specificity.\n6. Now'meet friend' makes logical sense because loneliness causes many people to become isolated and the'solution' to loneliness is to meet friends.\n7. Analyze the final choice'make someone laugh', this doesn't make any sense, it is too vague.\n8. It doesn't make sense to make people laugh when they are alone, especially since the context of the question relates to loneliness.\n9.

A bookshelf is definitely not a place where someone would store their clothes, and although it is not explicitly mentioned in the question, one could argue that the type of clothing referred to here is casual wear.\n4. A washing machine is not the right answer because this type of machine is used in cleaning clothes, not in keeping them.\n5.

What people are traveling and what is their goal? I will use knowledge of these two facts to answer the choice C : Learn from each other: This option is a little vague. It could mean that they will have the travel experience together and learn from some people while traveling, but it could also mean learning from their experiences after coming back home.\n4. B: Airplane: This choice is a bit too obvious because it gives Sam an answer too. Also, he can use it to get away from the people he does not like.\n5. Next, evaluate the remaining choices A: Come home and B: Airplane.\n6. Come home will not benefit in the same way as Sam will be traveling with those people that are disturbs him. Therefore, we can eliminate choice A.\n7. Thus, the question is not whether or not to learn something from those annoying people on the trip, but rather, whether it would be better to get away from those people by boarding a plane or coming home.

Use inductive reasoning to decide whether \"Keep it\" is the action of an agent or an object.\n6. Thinking: Keep it as an action implies that there is a \"them\" when \"it\" is an object.\n7.

Lastly, symphony, which is a large ensemble of different musical instruments, which include a viola is more common than string quartet, and is not mistaken with orchestras or a band which use different instruments.\n8.

'Kill' is also a strange option, since war entails more than just killing the enemy. Therefore, eliminate these three options.\n\n4.

{"text": "1. Look at the sentence to find out the context of the activity.\n2. A person is not simply 'putting on makeup', but is 'putting on make up to look attractive'.\n3. Therefore, the person is 'putting on their makeup to look attractive'. This implies that they are seeking to appeal to the senses of others.\n4. 'Appeal to the senses' leads to a certain result and is therefore synonymous with'seeking to make people feel pleasure'.\n5. Moreover, when making decisions the brain makes decisions based on feelings and emotions more than logic, which is why we choose 'feel pleasure' as the answer.\n6. Since logically a person would want to 'look attractive' and'receive compliments' but the context of their goal states that it is more of an emotional decision as their makeup-seeking goal is to achieve 'pleasure'.\n7. Similarly, since we have 'compliments' in our question we can choose 'interesting experiences' as a possible answer but considering that it will probably not be the only thing they receive from performing the actions, the only answer that logically falls under the category of what a person will experience when trying to achieve their goal is 'feel pleasure'.\n8. However, we can still choose both 'feel pleasure' and'receive attention' as they are both feelings and emotions of a person, but once again, 'pleasure' is the most possible choice because it is a feeling. Considering, that we are looking for our choice to be the most obvious, possible, likely and direct answer.\nSo the final answers are A: feel pleasure\n\nInput: How did the scientist feel after the analysing the lab results?

The noun phrase'place of work' may refer to any place where James works. For example 'home office' or 'corporate office'.\n4. Therefore consider the other choices'school', 'desk','school supply store' and 'office supply store'. They are all too specific to the context where these words are used.\n\n5. 'Shelve' and 'Desk' are nouns that are not relevant to this question.\n6. Similarly, 'office supply store' is too vague as this may refer to any such store that contains office supplies or perhaps just a random retailer.\n7. 'Shelf' is most relevant among options as it involves a flat structure which James could possibly use to store a clipboard. \n8. Eliminate the other options and check for context clues that indicate whether the answer would be singular or plural.\n9. For shelf the singular form would be appropriate as the sentence is already plural, so check if there is a plural form of shelf and if there is, eliminate the possibilities.\n10. Check if the answer is singular or plural and note that even if the answer is plural, only one answer is correct out of two.\n11.

Excluded for unclear reasons, such as 'Wood' is not stated in the sentence 'the bean bag chair sit on' and 'family room' does not indicate the type of furniture where the bean bag chair should be seated.\n5.

The meaning of the phrase \"to be adult\" is usually to be responsible (like handling a lot of responsibilities, such as shaving or taking care about oneself) and be mature (like handling some stress).\n5. Smoking is not a stress-handling-skill nor is it the best choice or a need in handling a lot of responsbilities, hence B is incorrect. Although E (talking to each other) can be used as a stress-handling technique (or used as an excuse for talking to people for a long time), it is not used in handling responsibilities, whereas C (paying), D (smoking) and E (talking) are part of handling the responsibilities itself.\n6. As they are similar, both C and D could be considered as a part of being adult, but C (paying) is not a stress-relieving activity, unlike D (smoking), whereas these are not related to handling responsibilities.\n7.

Then compare parent and school child, as they mean exactly the same thing, but more detailed. They are both parents and children; parent and children together.\n5. Reasoning: The government takes money from parents who give money to their children, and their children are helped by the government with school. Parents and their children get money from the government. Reasoning: Children are also helped or parented by parents when they are in school, but by government policy, not the government.\n6. Now, use what you know about the relationships between parents and children, parents and the government, schools and children, and schools and the government.\n7. Finally, the last remaining two choices'require to pay taxes' and 'be parents' appear to be contradictory in meaning as they both indicate to'require'.\n8.

The answer is no, because there is no D and there is no O.\n3) Consider the second string and see if it has the substring. Again, the answer is no, because the second string starts in the middle of the substrings of the first string.\n4) Continue like this for the whole string 40,14. In order to complete the problem, you have to find the minimum and the maximum of the numbers in the brackets. The minimum string length is 14 (from 40,13), the maximum is 400 (14,29,14,53..96)\n5) To convert the length of the \"dog\", you have to subtract the substring from the whole string. For example, you subtract the first string from the whole string.\n6) The minimum length of the substring is 40,16-14=30. The minimum length of the 'dog' is 30,14-14=16. The maximum length of the substring is the end of the whole string: 400,14-40=356. The maximum length is 356,14", "answer": "C: architect"}

Understand that \"Gaining Weight\" only happens after eating in the tastings and not before as the main idea of eating in the taster menu is to taste a variety of food on one menu.\n7. Realise that \"Getting Full\" as a choice can be interpreted to mean that there is extra space in one's tummy after eating in the menu but it should be noted that what is important in eating in a menu is tasting different meals and not how full one gets.\n8. This option cannot be considered as an answer for the question being asked as one can't answer a question when you don't know the choice that is given.\n9.

Therefore, it can be eliminated that the choices are not correct.\n7: The question doesn't refer to a particular city, however, the person is looking for a house that would need to be gated off from areas around it.\n8: So this makes it clear that this option isn't correct and the question doesn' t directly relate to it.\n9: Subdivisions are usually places that are surrounded by open spaces rather than closed spaces, such as houses.\n10: It is also not mentioned whether the individual is looking for an exclusive single-family home or a single-house unit in an area filled with several single houses.\n11: Similarly, houses in a neighborhood are not necessarily gated off, unless they are located behind another gated area, usually owned by a public organization or the government.\n12: As there has already been evidence gathered that the answer doesn't align with the question, it is time to eliminate the remaining choices in relation to the question, including suburbs, and E: Street as this choice is too general and vague.\n13: The final answer that makes the most sense and makes a logical response to the question is A: neighborhood.\nSo the final choice answers the question logically as it's the most suitable choice among the choices given.\n\n### Next section: 2", "answer": "B: subdivision"}

We can eliminate the answer option 'brains problems' because headaches can occur due to many reasons such as due to laziness, overeating etc.\n5. We can then eliminate the answer option 'get fat' as its not part of problem.\n6. The answer options 'laziness' and 'headache' both describe a headache as the side effect but they differ in their cause while the given choice words mention 'watching tv'.\n7. It is logical that 'headaches' can be caused by bending forward. There is no way 'headache' can be caused by laziness, therefore the answer option is D: headache.\n8.

Due to lack of affection B. Because couples have children C. Due to different viewpoints on parenting D. As marriage is still very expensive E. Because men and women do not make good communicators.\n\nOutput: There are quite a few important factors that lead to divorce but the most important are children and communication. Couples who have children are more likely to divorce because it's just much more difficult for couples to find a balance between their own lives and those of their children. Many people have kids because they think it's going to be easy and fun but when the reality sets in, they find they have too little time or energy left for themselves at the end of the day.\n\nThe second most important factor is communication. In most cases, couples lack communication skills that are needed in a healthy marriage. This problem can be addressed by taking marriage classes while you are dating or after you are married. This will help you learn how to resolve conflicts in a way that doesn't lead to divorce.", "answer": "C: stomach ache"}

'A master of your own destiny' can be understood as someone who is self-sufficient and has control over their life, like a master of their own house or country.\n5. Hence, the first definition of being a'master of your craft' refers to a great student learning to become a master of their craft.\n6. 'Most vile' implies that 'commit' is indeed'murder', and hence committed murder.\n7. A 'barge master' is someone who manages a large ship.\n8.

After understanding the question, carefully and analytically review the choices.\n3. Realize that an attic is usually found in old houses, but not necessarily in every old house.\nSo we can eliminate option C.\n4. Furthermore, 'victorian houses' are old houses which are known for their high peaked and steep roofs, which can be narrow and difficult to access.\n5. As for 'top of home', this refers to the roof where a house has a gabled roof, but this term typically doesn't mean the attic is filled with items from the past.\n6. The term 'own home' refers to one's property and this means that one lives in one's own house.\n7. If the attic had historical items, the owner of the house can be a family or a museum which has historical items.\n8. If the household has a museum, it could be a home which has historical items in the attic, but this can be possible in any household, not just 'old houses'.\n9. As for the choice D, it can be eliminated because it is insufficient.\n10. Consider the term: material and think about a typical property owner who is a member in a club called material makers.\n11. The house which belongs to him will have historical items in the attics because such a property maker collects materials relevant to his club.\n12. Therefore the most likely answer is that an attic filled with items from the material club is in older houses, but not necessarily 'old houses' and not a home per se.\nSo the final option is Answer B: Older House.\n\nInput: What is it called when a bird is in a cage?

First, it is pertinent to understand that an obtuse is generally defined as being 'broadly curved, rounded.'\n\n3. So, the options that could be considered are 'pointed', 'easy', 'clear', and 'acute angled'.\n\n4. 'Pointed' refers to a specific shape and has no direct relation here to the meaning of 'obtuse'.\n\n\n5. 'Easy' cannot be considered for either meaning.\n\n    6. 'Clear', which may refer to either meaning, is the best fit for the meaning 'lacking in complexity or subtlety of expression.'\n\n7. When looking at 'acute angled', it could refer to either meaning, which means it is less defined and precise in the context of the question.\n\n8. A clear choice exists between two remaining options, 'Easy' and 'Clear'. Easy cannot be the correct answer because there is no way to know if the document is obtuse because it is not pointy, but possibly \"obtuse\" because it is not easy to read.   \n9. However, the definition of 'acute angled' fits \"lacking in complexity or simple expression\".  \n10.

You may make note of them by using an asterisk ( * ) at the beginning of the bold portion.\n3. To narrow down the answer, first look at a choice marked as 'copy'. This option means following someone else's actions or beliefs. It cannot mean copying someone else's knowledge. However, to copy someone else's knowledge exactly, you need to be able to understand what they know. This implies that you need to be intelligent to be able to understand. Therefore, the option marked as 'intelligent' is suitable to be eliminated. Make a note of this, as marked with an asterisk: '*' (* ).\n4. You may skip other steps or even stop at this point to get the answer if you are confident.\n5. Now consider choices marked as 'improved performance'. \n6. The first one marked as 'empowering' implies that you will acquire more knowledge or be more intelligent while improving performance. This option may only require you to be improved. A * has also been marked at the end of 'empowering' to remind you of what is already eliminated.\n7. The next choice marked as 'have more knowledge' requires that you must have more knowledge or better results for performance improvement. The asterisks will remind you of what options have already been eliminated. So, the answer is a combination of the remaining choices marked as 'inquisitive' and 'empowering'.

Since there is a maximum of 2 steps allowed to be taken from the initial floor, thus, it means there is no way an elevator could go to the next floor if all the slots were already taken.\n2. Therefore, if there are no free slots on an elevator, or no extra slots available, then it will not be able to go to the next floor.\n3. Then we can assume that whenever the elevator starts its trip, no slots are available.\n4. Then all we can do is to determine in how many times the elevator can make a full circle if all the slots are taken.\n5.

The instruction has highlighted the word 'too', which indicates that there is an aggressive level of play when not overdoing it.\n3. What then, is the opposite of aggressive play?\n4. Option A 'getting hungry' seems like a good thing, because you can use this to motivate the person to not play aggressively.\n5. But on further examination, it seems unlikely that this will stop aggressive play, because being hungry often makes people more aggressive.\n6. Eliminate the remaining options C and D as they do not specify the consequences of playing too aggressively nor do they explain the impact of its opposite (playing less aggressively).\n7. The only remaining option is E: happy.\n8. Therefore, happy is the most suitable answer given the context\nSo the final answer for this question is E: happy. \n\nInput: If we could choose any language, what would you most like to learn?

Chooses:  A: maps B: online C: atlas D: internet E: app\nOutput: 1.) Read the question thoroughly to determine the intended meaning of the phrase 'on roads' as used in the question. The phrase 'on roads' may refer to all roads, meaning that the path must be on all kinds of roads. However, this is the most specific, logical context in which this phrase could be used. Therefore, we will be making the assumption that paths described by 'on roads' must be on all kinds, including all major highways. As this may have a significant impact on our answer, we must carefully determine the intended meaning of 'on roads'.\n2.) Check the available options: A or B. Maps and and the Internet are both ways to find paths. However, an 'Internet' does not have to be used for finding paths of varying specificity. Hence, 'at maps' and 'online' must be narrowed down to the least broad options to match paths that were intended to be considered.\n3.) A and E. The option 'A' maps is the most specific for what we want, as all of these are maps, but they all are online resources that can be used for finding paths.

{"text": "1) Look at the options and take note of which options are uninformative by nature.\n2) You need to buy something. Do not try to solve or guess, just think logically about it.\n3) Remember that the goal is to determine which of the given 5 options is the best choice for the question.\n4) The question is asking you what one needs to have before buying something, hence one can safely eliminate answers like 'time' and'spending money' as they have no relevance to what is being asked.\n5) Now note how the answer options are presented by asking if you need them before or after.\n6) 'Before' refers to needs. For example you need a roof over your mind before you buy anything from a roofing supplier.\n7) 'After' refers to desires, wants and money.\n8) If you buy something you want you don't need to pay for it, you just go to a shop and buy it.\n9) You might need something to get money or desires, but don't try to go against the flow of logic:\n10) All your needs must come before a desire. You can't be desire-less, you can be need-less, but you can't be desire less.\n11) There's no desire before anything, so if you want anything you need to already have something.\n12) 'Money' is a type of desire, but it comes after desire as you need to make it to begin with to get the desire, so it is after desire in this logic.\n13) 'Money' comes after the other 4 options, so that's why it's there.\n14) 'Needs' come before desires, so it's in option 'C', hence the final answer is C: 'Need'.\nSo the final answer to this question is C: 'Needs'.\n\n### Instruction:Your name is listed in the phonebook because of:\n\nInput: Your full name is listed in the telephone directory.

{"text": "1) Read the question carefully to gain a clearer and deeper understanding of the context and meaning of the words used.\n2) Consider the word 'A large container was a (dime) a dozen.' We see that the word 'dime' has been marked as in the sentence's underlined part, but is not shown in the choices. This indicates that the answer should not include this word. Moreover, we know that dime means 'one cent' because we have the information in the sentence. This would mean that the container is a cent that is sold at least a dozen times, which indicates that there is a lot of them around because each container is worth only a cent.\n3) From this, we can see that the container is worth only a 'dime a dozen', which means it is cheap and many can be bought for this price. This makes us think of cheap places like stores that sell things for low prices.\n4) Next, we read about 'there were hundreds of rows of (the) giant (container(s)).' This explains that the container is a cheap item that you can buy multiple times at low prices. This leads us to think that the container is sold at a number of places.\n5) Finally, the question asks about the containers' location, not their price. Since the word 'pry' is marked out, it can be eliminated as an answer. It is also not logical to say that the container is a large supermarket because the word is not marked. Besides, this place has containers, not supermarkets, in a different contextual meaning, namely, shelves. However, we can eliminate 'garage' and 'warehouse' because the sentence says 'hundreds of rows', indicating that the place is large enough that this phrase would be inaccurate for such a setting.\n6) As a result, the answer has to do with a 'large' and 'giant' store with lots of containers and containers that sell for cheaper as this is why there are so many of them. These choices lead us to believe that'supermarket' is a suitable and correct answer.\nSo the final answers is Supermarket\n\nInput: It seemed like it would rain later on that day, what did he see in the sky to clue him in to that?

In addition, the second choice given is a computer which is another type of hardware rather than a physical location.   \n4) Option three, i.e. the \"opera\" given choice is a type of performance. Similarly to the first choice of a theater it is not referring to the performers in an opera, but to the opera building. The fourth option given is a television. It may be a television program, and thus fit the given context, but TVs are not a physical location the user can go to. The opera and theater, therefore, are both incorrect.   \n5) So the remaining choices are: (a) \"concert\" which may be a musical performance or a physical location where there is a concert, and (b) \"computer\" which may be used to search for a concert program. These are also incorrect as they may refer to a computer program or a concert held on a computer, but it is not a physical location.   6) The only remaining option, therefore, is the computer, but this is not a physical location but rather a program used to search for a program.   \n7) The answer is therefore the \"computer\" as this is the only item remaining that fits the given context, and therefore is the correct option, as other parts of the program, opera and theater are not appropriate or logical.", "answer": "C: opera"}

James can sleep at this point because the balls are 'inactive'.  \n5) 'Wakefulness', which means 'in a state of alertness and readiness for activity' will not occur 'at any point as the balls were always in motion'.  \n6) Next, 'At this point, they were upside down', a result of rolling at rest for the whole time.  \n7) Lastly, 'Then he put them in what state?', which clearly indicates the question will ask you about 'James\u2019  bouncing rubber ball'.\n8) The above-mentioned explanations make the options D: wakeful, A: active, and E: resthold unnecessary.  \n9) 'Active' means showing to be doing something, at least once.

Consider the phrase 'twice are not safe way': this is gramatically incorrect and should be avoided but it indicates that all the other options are safe alternatives for transporting jewelry.\n4. Option A is a suitcase, which is not safe because it can be stolen.\n5. Option B is a department store, which is not a viable transportation option because a jewelry store is generally less likely to be robbed by thieves than a department store.\n6. Option D is to keep the jewelery in a safe deposit box, which is a safe location for jewelery and is only a good choice if in a private bank.\n7. Option E is a lady's boudoiur, which may look safe and secure to the general public, but a lady's bouddoir is in fact a safe location for jemery, because it is not visible and hard to enter by thieves.\n8.

The first three options,'surrender','defence','retreat' are not possible to add to the sentence as they do not match the first word'surprise' in what it means.\n4.

As a joke requires a human, I ruled out \"Produce eggs\" and \"Lay eggs\" because chickens are unable to write jokes.\n4) \"Is a hen\" refers to a hen being a chicken.\n5) \"Is a hen a chicken\" - This question can be rephrased to \"Is a hen, a chicken.\"\n6) I eliminated the options in error, such as \"Becomes food\".\n7) The answer that remained was \"Looks for cars\".\n8) The rationale for selecting this answer was that a chicken \"crosses the road\" or moves to the middle of the road because it is afraid of cars. If the question asked \"What does a chick in a joke do while it crosses the road\", the answer would be \"Look for cars\" which makes sense because the chicken wants to go to the road in front. \n9) Finally, the correct answer is \"Find cars\".\nSo the final answer was Choices: F: Find Cars\n\n## Example Inputs: I needed to find a housekeeper to help in the house while I was away on a holiday.

Based on this, we must evaluate, eliminate, or choose the answer that best applies and describes the meaning of the highlighted words \"careful\". These words might have a different context.\n3. The question gives us the option'verdict'. It is false and does not make sense because the goal of pig judging is to determine which pig should win a prize for being the best or prettiest pig.\n4. The other option 'pig judging responsibilities' is also not correct because the word'responsibility' means that judges are in charge of taking care of a certain thing. Here, judging pigs at the state fair does not contain any responsibilities whatsoever, so it is not related to careful judging.\n5. The word 'prejudiced' may seem to be a potential answer, but it could mean that judges must make quick decisions based on their personal preferences and not on scientific data. However, there is no scientific data that determines which pig is the best, only what the judges like and perceive.\n6.

{"text": "1: first, we need to understand the question, which asks about the actions that are performed by people who are speech therapy.\n2. Read the questions and pick a choice option to analyse to determine their suitability.\n3. Here, the answer choices are'make music', 'believe in god', 'complete sentences', 'build houses', and 'give speeches'.\n4. We know that a speech therapist is a person who deals with disorders of human speech and language.\n5. Now lets look at the answer choices given.\n6. Option'make music' doesn't make sense as it is not something a speech therapist would normally do.\n7. Option 'believe in god' is excluded since the question is specifically mentioning therapists (plural) and not god.\n8. Option 'give speeches' can be discarded as they do not make sense based on our assumptions.\n9. Option 'build houses' is also eliminated because it is also not related to speech therapy. So the answer is 'complete sentences'.\nSo the final answer to the question is E: complete sentences\n\nInput: What is the job of a forensic scientist? Choices: 1. gather bloods. 2. identify suspects. 3. use fingerprint identification method. 4. perform autopsies\nOutput: 1)Start with the sentence, which asks about the job of any person who is a 'forensic scientist'.\n2. The answer choices are: 'gather bloods', 'identify suspects', 'use fingerprint identification method', and 'perform autopsies'.\n3. Identifying suspects definitely requires the use of fingerprints, but that isn't enough.\n4. One needs all the evidence available to identify the suspect, which could be a forensic scientists job, but that isn'm mentioned directly.\n5. Performing autopsies only requires a dead body, which is only part of the job of a forefinc scientist.\n6. So the answer is choice 3: use fingerprint identification method\nSo the final answer the question is D: use fingerprint identification.\n\nInput: Where can I find my friends?

In the above context, the options'school, room, and church' are incorrect because they refer to places rather than what is inside an a room.\n4.

Examples of being 'put' include in a trash can, trash, and a dumpster.\n5. It is possible to put a 'rug' near the entrance to one's house, but can we think of a place that it would be appropriate to place a 'table'?\n6. If 'foot ball' grounds are places to play football, it could also mean that they are not places to 'keep' or 'put' things.\n7. Examine the question carefully. It states 'in your house', but does not specify any specific location in the house.\n8. This indicates that all of the locations are valid answers to this question.\n9.

The sun was out and the weather was changing rapidly so that would have to bring a jacket, because it could really be freezing.\n3. The question asks what was really beginning to happen and could have been interpreted many ways.\n4. After eliminating the obvious wrong choices 'heating up' and 'cooling down' we are left with the 2 choices 'dropping' and 'dropping quickly'.\n5. The words 'dropping' and their negative versions in the choices suggest  downward movement to the reader and that would be interpreted as a cooling of the temperature.\n6. There would be no downward movement if it began to 'heat up' or 'drop quickly.' Therefore the final answer is D. The sun was beginng to drop quickly.\nSo the final option is D\n\nInput:Why don't we go out for lunch, there are too many choices and restaurants where you can\u2019t choose? Choices: \tA: food, B: menus, C: chefs, D: cheaper, E: less\nOutput: 1.) First read the question and think of what the answer could be.\n2.) Here we can use the elimination principle where we eliminate choices that don't make sense together with the statement 'There are too many choices'\n3.) The first four choices (food, menus, chefs, cheaper) can all be found in restaurants however the statement 'too many' suggests there are too many restaurants and not too many dishes or chefs.\n4.) Similarly, choice E (less) would be incorrect. From the statement 'too much choices,' less choices would suggest 'too little' choices.\n5.) Answer choices do not make any sense when they are mixed together.\n6.) Since there are too many restaurand 'too many restaurants' and 'too many dishes' makes sense together,\ntherefore answer choice A (too many choices) would be incorrect.\n7.) The final answer would be the remaining choice of C (Chefs).\n\nInput: How long was the book, it couldn't be just a few pages? Choices:  a: 700 b: 90 c: over 30 d: 3", "answer": "E: heat up"}

Then, we should compare them and make a list of which ones are most likely to be the right answer and which ones are the most unlikely.\n3.) However, there is one additional step that must be kept in mind which is that all of the answers given in the question must be plausible, possible, and logical at the same time.\n4.) Therefore, it becomes easier to solve the question if we look for ways to eliminate any of the choice options immediately that seem to be unacceptable.\n5.) In this case, we can eliminate one option after reading it.\n6.) Thus, we need to determine if option 'B' makes sense.\n7.) Option 'B' is very unlikely for a few reasons.\nFirstly, we can be sure that a person would not look in their nightstand first for missing deodorant because a nightstand is too high for a person to physically access.\nTherefore, option 'B' is eliminated.\n8.) Next, we look at option 'C' to see if there is an issue with it.\nWe can tell that option 'C' is not acceptable because there is no reason to suppose\nthat a person's wife would ask him to look for missing deodorant in his armpit.\n9.) However, there is something to be learned by studying the choices that seem more likely to be the right one.\nTherefore, the most logical answer is option 'A,'\nthe rest can be eliminated.\n\nSo the final answer for this question is A: grocery Store\n\nInput:What does the word decoct mean?

{"text": "1) Read the question and the given choices carefully in order to identify the most suitable answer.\n2) The question asks about what action should be taken in order to change society.\n3) The options provided are: riots, vote, social activism, and change clothes.\n4) Firstly, it should be noted that the vote given here is a vote in order to elect the people/government in charge. This has nothing to do with the action 'voting', which would actually be a vote on a specific issue or legislation that the community is supporting/not supporting. In addition, voting is not usually done individually, but in order to elect the government or a representative of the community.\n5) So the three options remaining are: riots, change yourself, and social activism.\n6) The options regarding riots can either be related to the activity of rioting oneself or encouraging others around one to riot. The action of rioting itself won't bring about a change in the society. It is, however, useful for revealing that people have disagreements with something and want to make a change in it in order to better their lives. Thus, riots would not result in a good change and they should be avoided.\n7) The option change yourself can be related to a change in values. Nevertheless, this option does not talk about the action of doing or achieving this, only about the result, which is a change in one's values. This option will be unsuitable and ignored from here onwards.\n8) The option social activism suggests activity that might involve some form of political involvement as well. But it is unclear whether this refers to any action such as protesting. This answer will be ignored as well.\n9) Hence, we are left with the remaining choice (which hasn't been written down here), which states that to do something that results to change society one has to start from within. This option is the best choice available and it is the answer to the question.\n\nHence, the final answer is E) Start from within.\n\n### Solution:\nInput: The experiment showed that the more we experience something, the better we are at doing it, for example people who are good at swimming, this is because they have swam...? \nAnswer: C) they practiced often", "answer": "C: change yourself"}

The first choice (pepper jack), is at the end of the string of choices.\nThis means that the first option is most common.\nPepper jack is a variety of cheese.

At the end, you will find that the only word which comes to your mind after reading the entire sentence is \"need for rest\". It completely fits into the sentence and it is also the meaning of fun. But this is not available in the choices and we already ruled out everything except \"a massive bear\". But it doesn't fit at all.\n7.) The answer is \"A wild ride\" and it is the only one choice which is missing from the given choices.\n8.)

It's a reasoning question. You must first read the sentence, then start looking for the choices. So, let's begin the process of elimination.\nStart from choosing the unreasonable ones, such as A: it. As for the others, let's start examining what kind of choices do we have.\nThe choice that is missing from the choices is D: none.\nThe missing one has to have a complete answer, not just a small fragment.

{"text": "A: strongwoman makes no sense. A bowel movement is something that you produce, so the correct answer would have had the word \"produce\" in it. B: cake makes no sense. A laxative, by definition, helps the bowel expel more easily so the word \"loose\" isn't correct. C: regular is correct. D: weak makes no sense as the question is asking what kind of bowel movement. E: fragile makes no sense as the bowel movements produced are not fragile in any respect. Therefore, B: regular is correct.\nSo the final solution is B: regular", "answer": "C: regular"}

The word happy confuses the meaning since it can be referring to any person and not just the one across the room.\n5. The word 'feel' also sounds ambiguous.\n6. The choice B: shout at makes sense but does not require any explanation as shouting at a person can surely get their attention.\n7. The choice A: board ship may be an option but it's not specified enough.\n8. The choice C: smile at may be an option, but it may have unintended consequences on the recipiency of the persons.\n9.

The choice that best describes the card players playing is C: shallow waters because they were just playing cards in a place that happens to have fish which had a shark swimming past them.\n3. Choices: A and E don't make sense because it would not say that they were playing \"shallow water\" if they were playing games at sea world or if they were playing \"card sharks\" if they were playing poker. Hence eliminates choices: B, D, and E.\n4. Now there are 3 final answer choices left to choose between: C, A, D.\n5. The choice that best explains the card players playing is: C, shallow waters. They were just playing cards but the place where they were at happened to be in an aquarium that contained fish.\n6. It was stated earlier that there was a shark in the aquarium, meaning that there was a shallow area.\n7.

A: The answer cannot be 'food court' because the deli is the only kosher one in the area.\n6. An answer option that is too general, 'Jerusalem' cannot be the answer since the context of the question is about kosher food and a deli located in a certain area, and not a large country.\n7. A 'New York City' is too far removed from the given context, so the answer cannot be C: NEW YORK CITY.\n8. D: 'Jewish community' is too vague so the answer cannot be D: 'Jewsh Community'.\n9.

As it states \u201cI knew who I wanted to\u201d which means the question is about choosing a source to get the address. Calling a telephone company for the address will not assist as there will not be a map with the address already on it.\n2: Do not choose this either. As it states that the user has a \u201cnew and better directory\u201d in their possession, which means even if the user has an old directory there is an option of finding a better one, which can be used to help solve the question.\n3: Use this option in the answer.

The question now becomes: \"What activity relates to singing and not joining?\" this will help you eliminate \"practice\".\n4. To understand this, you may wish to think about what rehearsal entails: it is a time when a choir prepares to perform together in a song.

The choice 'control model' is incorrect because the question clearly states he's using a computer and it does not have a 'control model'.\n3. The choices 'run programs', 'play games', and'reason exists' do not make sense when coupled with the context of the question. These options are general and non sequitur to the previous sentence, so can be eliminated.\n4. The remaining choices are 'Powered down' and 'Office nearing an end'.\n5. 'Office nearing an End' makes no sense and could not be the correct answer since there's nothing in the context to suggest that he finishes his work by closing down the office, but instead by leaving.\n6. The other choice, 'powered down', is most logically the correct answer.

The answer is'subtract', as the students will subtract their own answer from the answer that is in the context provided and then add them up.\n4. It could be confusing in context, or if a new choice is introduced by the examiner.\nSo the final choice is C: Subtract\nInput:  My mom made some potato salad yesterday and she added what?

The options could be, one or more of the following: (A): A cinema hall, (B): A mall, (C): A department store, (D): A closet and (E): A shop.\n5. The sentence states that the clothing is expensive as compared to the other places, and that the most precise answer should be deduced from the given options.\n6. However, 'A closet', obviously, is not a place where shopping is done, so we can eliminate \"A closet\" as an option.\n7. This leaves 3 other options that are (B): A malls, (C): A Department store and (E): A store.\n8. If the clothing sold in a mall or a department store happens to be the most expensive variety, that is likely to be the most preferred option.\n9. The option which states that the clothing was acquired in the store, is the most specific and accurate answer.\n10. A shop is, by default, supposed to be a place that sells small appliances, groceries and such accessories, so that, logically, the clothing which is stated to be extremely expensive cannot have been bought in a shop.\n11.

The different choices given are A: television, B: dumpster, C: landfill, D: fox news, and E: trashcan.\n5. Eliminate choices A: television as the first word is Garbage not TV.\n6. Choice B: dumpster is correct but a dumpster is not used to watch garbage so this is not a good answer.\n7. Choice C: landfill would be accurate if it were used to watch garbage but it is most commonly used for the disposal of waste, so this is the wrong answer.\n8. Choice D: fox news is irrelevant to the question and would not be used to watch garbage.\n9. Choice E: trashcan is correct as it is commonly associated with trash being thrown in the garbage whereas a landfill is used to dispose of waste and a television is used to watch material.\nSo the final answers are E: trashcan, and trash is a good synonym for rubbish.\n\nInput: Which of the following are examples of a 'living organism'?

Check the available responses, noticing that while'sum' and 'likeness' might describe sums of quantities or similarities of features, the term 'equal' doesn't seem to mean either of these things. 'Sameness' might be confused for 'equal', but it actually refers to a single trait, and therefore would not be applicable in a case where there is no restriction on the things being added or related. The word 'difference' is not there, so 'like' cannot be applied here as a relationship term.\n4. As it stands, what will 'ALL' the 'differences' equal?

{"text": "1 The given instructions ask about the specific action the robot performed after having read all the books.\n2. As stated in the prompt, the robot is actually the one who bought all of the books and is thus the one who is reading them.\n3. Eliminiating irrelevant options such as 'choose' and 'learn to read' doesn't make sense because these options don't refer to the reading of book.\n4. Examining the remaining options 'got comfy' and 'open up', one can safely conclude that the robot did both at the same time, by sitting on the books and therefore opening them to read.\n5. Moreover, by using the term'shockingly', the prompt suggests that this action was unexpected.\n6. Hence the logical answer is D: open up.\nSo the final option is D: open up\n\nInput: How many different kinds of pencils were available in John\u2019s school?

In addition, the number \u201821\u2019 can be calculated using the information provided.\n6) '15' and '20' are not mentioned in the statements made.\n7) It is possible that more kinds of pencils exist if we consider all of the various models available, as well as different brands of each model. Since John's school only had one type of pencil in each brand, such additional categories would not apply.\n8) The option '13' is also eliminated because it refers to a number that doesn't exist in the information stated.\n9) Hence, the only answer that is plausible is \u2018D' for '21', as it", "answer": "D: learn to read"}

The answer should include a verb which is capable of expressing the man's inability to move.\n3. The given choices include the following verbs:\nA: stand B: go C: walk D: stand still\nE: walk slowly\n4. There is some ambiguity since the word'stand' could mean either standing up or being or staying in a particular location.\n5. As a listener, rule out the choices which cannot be used to describe the action of the man, so eliminate choices: A: stand, B: go quickly, D: stand still and E: walk slowly.\n6. The remaining choices'walk' and 'walk slowly' are still possible choices, but it may be logical to eliminate them as they are already present in the sentence.\n7. Realize that there could be a need to describe the location to make the movement logical.\n8. In the sentence, the man walks somewhere quickly but cannot stand, which is the location he could walk quickly to.\n9. Next, compare the remaining choices: walk quickly and walk slowly\n10. Compare: walk quickly and it is logical to eliminate choice 'walk quickly'as he is already walking.\n11.

{"text": "1) Read the question carefully and identify what exactly the question wants the reader to do.\n2) Look carefully at the word \"dispose of\"\n3) Eliminate possibilities of answers that don\u2019t make any logical sense\n4) For example, \"junk yard\" will not fit in the context and \"in the graveyard\" is out of context as well, since it doesn't make any logical sense, so those answers can be eliminated immediately as they are irrelevant to the action of disposing of.\n5) Next, look carefully at the answer options that you're left with: \"antique store\", \"ice\", \"icebox\", and \"kitchen\". \n6) Consider the word \"icebox\", is it used as in, \"the icebox at the kitchen is broken\". \n7) Consider the word \"antique\", where would you sell an antique. Consider also that \"ice\" doesn't make any sense at all when connected to a \"kitchen\"\n8) The most viable option is probably the last one \"to the ice\" i.e. the icebox.\n9) However, if you can infer that \"ice\" is in reference to \"icebox\", then the final answer would be \"antique store\".\n10) Since you answered the question using \"dispose of\" you'll notice that the correct word is \"to dispose of\" (i.e. \"to antique store\" rather than \"to dispose\" to \"to antique store\"), this is a type of error known as a \"homonym\". Now it's time to look at the right answer for the given problem.\n11) Homonyms are words that are spelled the same way, but pronounced different ways and have different meanings. To \"dispose of a thing\" means to get rid of it; dispose \"of\" means in connection with or attached to a thing. The word antique fits perfectly with the context of \"dispose of a broken icebox\".\n12) Thus the final answer is \"to antique store\".\n\nInput: How is a dog and horse different?

Bad cannot happen because the question is talking about clouds.\nE. Wet cannot happen because we are seeing the clouds from above.\n3) After that, think about all the options and consider their meaning and whether they make logical sense.\n4) Based on that, eliminate the options that make you think it is not logical that if you would see the cloud from above then the bad or dull or plain or wet things could happen to you.\n5) The rest, you must consider if they make logical sense. If they are all making sense then you are good but if you still think the answer doesn't make sense, then try to think about the alternative.\n6) After eliminating all the options think if you can make a more logical option, if you think so then go and make it; otherwise, try to reconsider if you have any other options left.\n7) After that, you should be able to answer the question.\n8) I will tell you what logical option does not exist because that is not logical and I think it could help you.\n9) The logical choice is that some bad can happen to you or else the question would be weird because the point being asked is that we usually think the cloud is good but it can make us feel bad.\nSo your final answer is D:Bad\n\nInput:If someone falls off a skyscraper onto a trampoline, can trampoline absorb the landing?

If you ate too much of any food, no matter what time, you will likely feel tired or exhausted.\n2. If you eat too many carbohydrates, your blood sugar will go too high. When this happens, your body goes into overdrive and tries to return your blood sugar to normal. This process forces your body to produce insulin. Over time, a high level of insulin in the body can lead to health problems such as diabetes and heart disease.\n3. If you continue to eat too much for too long, it will cause constipation and bloating. It can also cause heartburn and acid reflux or heart attack.

The phrase \"before they can what\" refers to the construction of the new barn, which is an action that cannot happen until the old barn is removed.

The phrase \"build hay\" would be an unnatural alternative to \"build\" in this context.

The context is about giving your son a gift that he will like and remember. There are several options to fulfil this goal, however, one of them might have been a car. Since the car is not an everyday object, you can rule out the first answer A- Book. The second answer B- Computer Game is a common object, so you can rule it out as well. The last four options include kite, bicycle, or a car (E) that is more expensive. You are looking for the least expensive option. Option D stands out. The only reason why option C would be preferable is if the car was an antique.\nThis is an example of logical reasoning and critical reading.

{"text": "A person might feel good about having good grades. However, simply feeling good will not magically improve the grades. Instead, it is essential to have a plan of action that will allow you to improve your grades, which means trying to learn. If you want to increase in all areas of your life, you must invest time and effort into improving your skills and knowledge. By working to understand complex topics, challenging yourself to test your current ability, and working with others, you are more likely to make significant progress. Reading is a great way to get information and gain knowledge but it does not ensure good grades on its own. For example, you might read about various strategies or approaches to learning, but just reading by itself does not guarantee good grades. You must think critically about what you read and use your understanding of the material to improve your grades.

Choices: \tA: water service provider B: plumber C: maintenance service D: plumbing technician E: plumbing inspector\n### Respones: B: plumber \n### Example: You come home and find water all over your floor in the kitchen. So you call a plumber, whose services are needed to fix the broken plumbing. \n### Respone: C: maintenance \t\n### Example: A home appliance is broken and needs to be serviced. The homeowner contacts the maintenance service and has a technician visit and repair the broken appliance. \n### In a plumbing context, the answer to the question is B: plumber. This is because plumbers are well aware of maintenance procedures and will have the knowledge and skills required to service a broken plumbing system.

{"text": "The word \"fragile\" in the statement of the question is a clue that it is likely a misprint, as fragile usually refers to a breakable item. Other similar words to consider to replace this word would be easily broken or flimsy.\n\n### Rationales: 1: A strong laxative would cause a strongwoman to have large, strong bowel movements. \n2: A cake would have no effect on a person's bowel movements. There is nothing in a cake that would cause or affect the bowel movements of a person. \n3: A regular would be a standard or an average when it comes to bowel movements. A regular person would generally have no preference in regards to the consistency or firmness of their bowel movements. A cake or a fragile item would not cause or change regular bowel movements. 4: A weak person's bowel movement would not be strong. The word \"weak\" in a context of a persons' strength only describes their ability to exert physical force, hence it does not refer to strength or firmness of their stools or feces. 5: A weak item would be likely a breakable item and could not be used to describe bowel movements. 6: A strong laxatic will cause the formation of strong and firm bowel movements. Thus, a bowel movement would be firm and strong. The bowel movement would be fragile in nature if the person was consuming something that is weak, like a cake, fragile would be a better adjective to refer to the bowel movement. \n\nAmoung the options given, B: cake and C: regular do not refer to bowel movements. Thus the answer should be A.", "answer": "C: regular"}

One such classification is white meat that includes chicken. So, option E: pantry is suggested.\n\n### \n\nInput: On a hot summer day, you would likely go to a what to stay cool? Choices: 1. A: pool 2. B: gym 3. C: ice cream van 4. D: beach 5. E: park\nRationales: A hot summer day would be a typical scenario for people to go to a beach and stay cool. \nAmong the choices available, beach is an option where people can enjoy the coolness of the water. A pool, however, does not provide a natural source of cool temperatures and only functions to keep the individual from overheating. \nIce cream has the word \"cold\" in its title making it a good contender for an answer. However, it is a frozen dessert and there is not an option that implies staying at a freezer. Gyms are not suggested because they can get uncomfortably warm which is not a cooling environment. Similarly, parks would be too hot for staying cool. Therefore, of the choices given, beach is the most viable answer. \n\n### 2.

Choices:  B: 25 hours 7 days in one week C: 12 hours 3 days \nD: 100 miles E: 7 days in a week A: 50 miles 7 days \nRationales: a trip may or may not be a long trip. The question, however, indicates that the trip is at most 3 days long. \nThere are no other relevant information for this question. \n\nBy process of deduction, we can assume that the trip is about 50 miles long.

Choices: B: true or false 3 C: which one is correct 4 D: more options\nRationale: A statement is something that is true or false and can be presented as a fact or as an opinion. That is, a statement can either be true or false. However, a fact is a correct statement that can either be true or correct. A fact can also exist when something has happened or is still present, whereas a statement does not represent reality. Finally, an opinion is the judgment or belief that something is a fact and has not been proven to be so. Because all the above definitions are true, they cannot be used as a statement but rather as facts. That is, they are not true but rather facts that are true. As an example, imagine you're at the grocery store and have to get to the checkout counter. As you get near the counter, you see two cashier options with a lady and a man. As you get closer, you find that the counter is also attended to by another person. You may come to the conclusion that the cashier is busy because he or she is helping another cashier. In other words, you have assumed based on your knowledge of the situation that the person is helping another casher-the fact. But you may also hold an opinion about the situation-for example, it can also be the case that the person is not even helping another worker because they are on a break.\nYou should not put C: Why programmers because it doesn't include the key phrase \"in the course.\" Furthermore, the question states which of the following states.

Some of the smaller lakes in Michigan may not even have ice fishing all winter in northern Michigan.

Choices: A : work for free B: get paid C: keep up with others D: slowing down E: taking a break\n\n### Response(suggested)\n> You were taking a break\n\n# Suggestions\n* It's much better to give detailed instructions to students as opposed to very general ones. It allows students to focus more on the actual task at hand and gives them more options to work with. Ex. \"Find three numbers that add up to 14, one of the three comes first.\" vs. \"Use what you know about addition to solve the problem.\" (The latter makes it more difficult for students to solve the problem since they might know they need to use the addition facts they learned, but they don't know what exactly to do.)\n* For those with students at a Beginner level, providing instructions in a very precise manner can take a lot of unnecessary time. When instructing students on complex tasks, it is okay to give them a more or less general suggestion for how to tackle it. Ex: \"I need you to work on the same problem you faced in class two periods ago.\" \n\n# Feedback\n* The instructions in each question should be written in a separate line. \n* There were times when the text that the student wrote didn't answer the question.  \n* There were also times when the student answered the question directly, but the answer was inaccurate or didn't make sense.\n* In a few questions there were times when the answer was correct, but there was a lot of unnecessary explanation.\n\n# Question 3\nWhat do", "answer": "C: health"}

Choices: 1: elementary 2: high school 3: college 4: private school 5: public school\nRationales: Bussing would most likely be provided for students who attend public schools rather than private schools. This is because, unlike private schools, public schools are often funded by the government. This funding is typically not given to private schools since they are not under the government. To provide bussing for every home game day for a single public school could get very expensive. To help reduce the costs of bussing and avoid unnecessary transportation costs, public schools often reduce or eliminate bussing.

D: We were not thinking clearly. E: We should consider other choices before making any decision.\nRationales: Given the context, we know that the given sentence means that if we could go back in time to the choice we made, we are wishing we'd make a different decision. In doing so, we are saying that we wish to reconsider the choice we made, meaning that we don't think this choice was our best choice. This can also be seen using the given sentence \"So now when I see something I don't like, I usually choose to stop.\" This means that we usually make the choice to stop and do not like the choice we made before. But in this case, we don't make that choice again, suggesting that we were not happy with that choice or that we made a poor decision.

However, other than that, driving a car can involve car crash, getting tired and backache, and eye strain. Here are a detailed explanation of my answer choices. \n\nB: A car crash refers to an unwanted occurrence where one's vehicle collides with other vehicles, pedestrians, and buildings. Such a scenario can involve injuries or other painful experiences.\n\nC: When focusing on the road for hours, one's eyes can become strained, leading to painful experiences. \n\nD: When driving for prolonged hours, one's back can start to ache, leading to painful sensations.\n\nE: If you drive long hours without taking breaks, the exhaustion could make you feel painful.\n\nAmong all of these causes, only two fit the request.

{"text": "- The statement describes a location that is crowded, where many people are waiting and lining up for something.\n- However, it does not specify the exact item that is causing this, nor does it describe specific details about the place itself. \n- Choice A: Bus stop: this could apply to a bus or a van, but this wording does not give any further information. This also doesn't follow the grammar of the statement. \n- Choices B and C: Street corner and city, respectively, are broadly defined locations. It is not clear as to why they were excluded in the description given. This suggests that they may not be the accurate answer choices.\n- Choice D: Fast food drive-thru: refers to the vehicle in which customers are lined up and waiting to enter. It does not explain any further details or context about where they are waiting. \n- Choose E: Roadblock: refers to the obstruction of a person's movement towards their destination, which could be caused by any number of reasons, not necessarily associated with a place. \n\nThe answer is between E and D.\n\n### Deliberation:\nAmong the given options, choices D and E seem like they could be the correct answer. While the wording of choice D is not clear enough to determine the context, choice E's wording suggests they are near a city. \n\nAn analysis of context:\n\nThe phrase \"Some people lined up\" implies that there is a set of people waiting to do something. This could mean people lined up to enter or wait for something (in which case choice E would likely be the correct answer). \nor the other could be waiting to get a spot for where they are currently at. \nIt is unclear as to why the person is specifically referred to as \"next to it,\" as to why choosing D \"fast food drive-thru\" does not provide any further insight. \n\n### Conclusion:\nAfter deliberations, the two options of choice D and choice E are the most likely answer, given the contextual clues. Choice D would be most likely as a place for a drive-through, which would have people waiting in line. Choice E is possible as a location that describes a city that also has some people lined up in this context.\n\nThus, the correct answer is between D and", "answer": "A: bus stop"}

The phrase \"a variety of music that dad liked\" indicate that other genres are also acceptable.\n3.  While Jazz music can also be considered a variety of music, and it was a genre favored by dad, Rap music is specifically mentioned as a part of the music dad liked.\n4. Further, the text highlights that Jazz might not be the best choice since \"...I enjoyed jazz, but I think the saxaphone was too loud.\" (This is supported by the fact that saxaphone is under Jazz Music and not Rap Music.)\n5. The text emphasizes that dad liked Rap music better than Jazz music: \"Dad preferred to listen to Rap...\".  \n6.

Choices: A: getting confused B: having a sense of competition C: being busy D: having a bad mood E: distracted from the teacher\nRationales:1.  The teacher did not like correcting homework in class since some of the students became confused and distressed when the teacher corrected their work. This is evidenced by the phrase \"disturbing,\" which suggests that such a thing upset some of the students and caused them to become uncomfortable and/or unhappy.\n2.

As an emergency room, you can think of an emergency room as a hospital that caters to sudden, unexpected, or serious health issues. An emergency room is not only for serious health circumstances, they are also open 24 hours a day to provide services to patients. Hence, an emergency room would be appropriate for contraceptives if you don\u2019t have one.\n2. The choices given suggest the places where you can get a contraceptive.\n3. A vagina would not be an appropriate choice as it is not a place where you can get a medical device, but rather a body part.\n4. A drawer is also not suitable as it does not offer contraceptives to users. Additionally, it is not an appropriate place for a contraceptive since it is a room or container not associated with serious health conditions.\n5. A medicine cabinet would be suitable, but it is a place in a house where you can store over-the-counter medication. \n6. It would not be a suitable place to store a contraceptive, as it is not a medical device or an appropriate place for a serious health matter.

Given this context, we can deduce that the woman's hope would be to find a man who is indestructible. The given answers don't seem to make much sense, and option E looks like it doesn't fit with the previous information given. I think that the most logical answer would therefore be option B1: \"indestructible\".\n\nAnswer: I think B.1 is best because it fits with the given context.\n\n### Rationales:\n\nAfter analyzing the given answer choices, we can see that option C, \"durable\", may seem like it fits in context, but it actually doesn't. Option D, \"unbreakable\", may work initially, but it can be further analyzed and seen that it doesn't really fit in the movie.  This is because the woman is not fragile in the sense that she cannot survive crashes in the movies. She's just prone to accidentally crashing things and causing destruction to other cars as a result. Thus, option E is a bit of a stretch to work within the context and, given the other options, it can be safely ruled out. This leaves us with just 2 options. Option B, \"indestructible\" works well as a candidate and it clearly fits the context of the question.

{"text": "The author implies that Jill was not appreciated by many and this may have resulted in a lack of respect. The author shows how people reacted to her in a negative way through the words \"ignoring\" and \"uncertainty,\" and it is most likely that she faced all of these. Contumely is not a word that should fit the provided context. On the other hand, disparagement is related to contumely, but it may also be viewed as offensive or derogatory behavior. In summary, we must rule out contumely and disparagement from the list of options. \"Disrespect\" is a suitable choice in these circumstances because it encompasses \"being rude\" and \"ignoring\" the person.\n\n1.

{"text": "What the question states indicates that a lover is looking to fall in love and not build family, go into distance, or build family. But rather a lover looks to have a love relationship. The choices are too broad to cover all scenarios. C: Make love, D: Complete, and E: Distance themselves are too difficult to relate to the context the question states. The choices should be a bit more specific. For example, a lover may want to complete a task or go into distance. \n\n### Analysis\nA: Build Family\nIt does not describe the situation where the lover seeks to fall in love. Build family could easily lead to a love relationship between people, however the question does not speak to this specific situation the lover is in to choose build family.\nD: Distance\nIt does not describe a situation where the lover wants to have a relationship. Distance is the act of doing nothing (or little) together physically, emotionally, or mentally. It does not relate to the context that the question asks, which is what do lovers seek to do to each other? To \"distance\" themselves with someone may actually have a bad connotation as it means to \"keep away from someone or apart from others.\" \n\n### Answer: A: make love\n\n### Input : What do you call an area where something is forbidden or not allowed to happen? Choices: 1 :  A: Area, 2:  B: Zone, 3: C: Territory, 4: D: Region, 5: E: District\n\n\n\n\n### Analysis (1): \nA: A location is a place or area. Zones, territories, and regions encompass areas of space, in which an area can also fit in. These terms describe geographic areas, \n\nAnalysis (2):\n\nA:  Area is a synonym of \"piece of land\" used to describe space without geographic implications. Thus, areas do not fall under the description of something that is forbidden or not allow to happen. \n\nB:  Zone refers to a location or region but does not have similar specificity. Territory denotes a region of control or authority with a geographic implication. However, the question asks us to determine what do we call a place where something is not allowed to happen. Therefore, region does not fit", "answer": "C: make love"}

The word \"who\" is used to replace the word \"which\" and is therefore used as a pronoun.\n3. Using \"prolific\" in this sentence, the main clause of the sentence is the word \"who\" since the rest of the sentence describes \"prolific\", an adjective. \n4. The sentence \"__________\" is formed by the verb \"wrote\" in the main clause and the pronoun \"who\" as the object of the verb.  \n5. The predicate refers to the phrase \"had novels published\" in sentence 2, which states that the person wrote a number of novels. \n6. This sentence presents us with the possibility to fill in the pronoun who. \n7. The options are given that can directly substitute the pronoun \"who\". \n8.

If a team wins its match, it will advance to the next round.

{"text": "- A: The answer depends on what \"they launch a surprise attack\" means. A surprise attack is an attack that catches the enemy unprepared. \n\n- Defence/Defend - If we are referring to defence from the attack, we have to pick one of them. Cease fire has no meaning and doesn't have any fit to the description.\n\n- Retreat - If we are referring a retreat from the attack, we know that surprise attack is a surprise attack, meaning the attacker is more likely defending against an attack. But if we assume that the attacker is already attacked, there's no need to defend anymore. This option does not fit in as well.\n- Surrender - This is referring to giving up a battle or a position that has been attacked. It doesn't fit in the context as there is no mentioning of a battle or a position.\n- Cease fire - If we look at the context, \"surprise\" attack implies a battle.

While on speakerphone, it can be challenging to understand each other if the caller and the translator do not understand each other well. In this situation, put the caller on speakerphone and ask a fluent speaker, like a friend or a family member who knows their native language, to help translate, and put the caller on speaker for a smoother call.\nB: Asking someone to translate is more time-consuming than one might realize because you must either seek out someone or ask the caller, which may be challenging due to poor internet connection while on speakerphone. Hence, try to understand the language as best as possible without using translator technology.\nC: If you don't understand or are not able to understand the foreign language fully, there is no point in continuing the conversation because you won't be able to understand the speaker effectively. Better to hang up or put the person on speakerphone to help you understand more.\nD: Bluetooth is useful for communicating only with people you already know or have a relationship with, not for translating language.\nE: An app can be useful for understanding the speaker's language, which is also faster and more efficient than translating. Thus, put the person on speaker and use a translation app to have a smooth conversation.\nIf you get a phone call in an unfamiliar language, and you do not speak the language, then hang up the phone.

A speciality store could also be a gift shop, so we should try to eliminate that answer first. We can eliminate the option of B) Frazier fur because a fur is a specific material where a department store would contain many products from different manufacturours.

Thus, the answer to the question is \"determine and assign roles.\" The first step for establishing a government was to have a purpose for it and define what it is. In the textbook the citizens did not have a role nor any responsibilities yet; they were still determining what their role was as a group. The author was referring to the governmental government, as in having a chief and a council. The people then decided on what roles were needed which was deciding the leader and the rest of the council members. \n\nAnswer:\nDetermine and assign roles\n\n### Input answer choices:\n\nChoices A and B are incorrect because they are related to defining responsibilities and not determining roles.\nAnswer C is incorrect since it states that the government's goal is to maintain their current laws, and it does not indicate if that was the people's goal.\nAnswer D is incorrect since it provides no context clues for the author's intended goal and wording.\nAnswer E is incorrect since it mentions that the people of the new government will have equal authority; in contrast, 44.3(b) explains that it is the Chief and the Council that will have this authority.\n\n###\n\nIn this exercise, identify the main point and counterpoint the text presents for 2-3 body paragraphs and explain how these points contribute to the overall topic and argument.\n\n### Topic: \nThe topic could be described as how the government in the colonies was developed and how people's roles eventually evolve from the start of the process to the end. \n\n### Argument:\nThe argument indicates how the people decided to form their government and then how their roles have evolved over time as a result of the establishment of the government.\n\n### Evidence/Main Point:\nThe evidence provided in the text supports both the argument and topic.

The last line of the sentence implies that the boss is also part of the group, but the sentence doesn't make sense. \n\n\"After the meal, [the group] decided to watch a movie together when the boss drove into the parking lot.\"\n\nThe rewrite must use the same \"After the meal\" phrase. The group of people decided to go to an IMAX theatre together to watch a movie when the boss drove in. \n\nWe know that the boss has joined in based on the structure of the sentence. The boss also seems to be part of the group, so the rewrite has to refer to both the group and the boss together.\n\nThus the answer is C: decided to go to an [IMAX theatre] together when the boss [drove in].\n\n### DID YOU KNOW THE LATEST SEARCH ENGINE UPGRADE SEARCH BOT TO FIND OUT MORE, PLEASE CLICK ON THE", "answer": "A: trunk"}

This kind of activity is likely to cause the child emotional stress, and some children with anxiety may even have meltdowns or start crying. Furthermore, some childern may be upset as they realize they are unable to evade the other childer who pursue them.

Choices: A: the number of products that the company makes B: how many people visit each location in a given year C: how much product they sold that month D: how many companies were interested in expanding E: how much profit the business made\n\nRationales: In this scenario, the students are asked to choose a choice from a group of six statements that best completes a sentence. Out of the six choices, the question only asks for a single choice to complete the sentence. Thus, we need to identify which of the options, based on the context of the question, makes the best sense and therefore is the correct choice for the question.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nA: The question describes the relationship between two variables: the number of products and the number of customers. However, while this choice describes one of the variables, it does not make sense in a sentence because the number of products is not the only variable that the business could be considering. For example, the business could be interested in expanding despite having a low number of products. The number of customers, in a similar scenario, could also be low despite the company offering a high number of products. Therefore, this option does not make sense and A: The number of products that the business makes cannot be the correct choice for this question.\n\nB: This choice describes the relationships between the number of products and how many people visit each branch in a given year. From the context of all the other choices for this question, it makes the most sense to describe the relationship between the number products and how many people visited each outlet. Furthermore, this answer is also supported by the context of the question as it asks us to identify the relationship between the number. The company is trying to sell their products and the number of people visiting each outlet. In contrast, the other options, such as B: how much profit the company made and E: how much product they were selling that month, are much more relevant for the context of a business. So, based on this the number of people visit each branch in each year is a reasonable explanation of the relationship between the number customers and the number of products. In light of this, C: how many customers visited each location in a given month can be the correct response for this question. \n\nC: To support this choice", "answer": "D: agony"}

For example, you must want to do something to do it or want to be a part of the favor or grace of God to participate. \n\n##### Choice: A is wrong since you cannot be a partaker of what is not grace unless you have grace of yourself. Since you need the divine grace, you must be willing to accept and be a part of the divine grace so you can get that grace. It is a paradoxical statement to make, but to be willing is to accept grace and have the desire to partake in that divine grace. \n\n###### Choice B: is incorrect because you can\u2019t desire what is not the Lord\u2019s grace and favor. This means even if you are willing there is no way to be a partaker without the Lord\u2019s grace. As long as you are willing, then  you will be accepting of divine grace and that will make for the best option as choice.\n\n##### Choices C: would say you must desire to be a participant in the Lord\u2019s favor. This would suggest that you want to be a participant and that you would choose to be one. Since desire to be a part would choose you to be one, then you want to be a one with divine grace from God. Choice D: would suggest that you don\u2019t have to be wanting to be a part of divine grace. This would say since you are willing to participate that you don't have to want be a part and have the grace be able to participate in the favor of the Lord.

Choices: 1. 2.  3. 4.  5. Answer C\n\n### Instructor Direction:The first thing we do is we get our answer correct:\n### 1. We know it's a mixed division problem so we know there is a non zero whole number divided by a mixed number.\n### 2. We recognize the division by a mixed number is actually division by a fraction since 17/2 is equal to 8.5 so as long as we have the whole number, that's good.\n### 3. We recognize the number 5 is a whole number so we just take the remainder and carry it over.\n### 4. We recognize the 39 is a whole number so if we're looking at 8.5 and 21 what we know is the two 2's are going to be two.\n### 5. We know we're bringing down the quotient and the remainder so we can't just divide that 2 by the 2 because it tells us the value of that last digit should be 0.\n### 6. If we were to remove.5 from our original expression, we know the result would just be the value of 0 because the remainder is 0 so if we want to get to 85 we add 85 to the remainder bringing us to 1 and we can divide the remainder of remainder by.5 bringing the remainder to 2.5.\n### 7.

Coastal states are states that have \u201can inlet, the open sea, the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, or the Pacific Ocean to the state.\u201d The Mississippi River borders Arkansas and is the state's only border.

First of all, I know that Martians from the popular fiction would probably find the Indian Ocean quite far away from their world. \n\nSecond of all, they would have the option to look up the Indian Ocean on a globe. (This would require the knowledge to be able to read a globe to know where to look.) However, it is likely that the majority (or even all) of Martians lack the ability to read or would need to acquire that skill first. \n\nAs an alternative, they could look on a map or a satellite image. (There are already satellite images that we can view on a computer. These images are often labeled with the names of continents and oceans. However, the Martians might not be able to access these maps since they lack the technology.) \n\nIn conclusion, the best option for a Martian to be able to find the Indian Ocean would be to study a globe with the help of someone who can tell them how to navigate it.

Since this is referring to a daydream of what he is going to do after the bus ride - the new responsibilities which come with the new job are not an issue and the benefits of the promotion are hardly ever felt or anticipated. They certainly won't be felt once he has started the daydream.\n\nThe same applies to the other choices as well. As in, none of them seems to fit the context.

So, the answer to this question is B: orchestra. However, if it were a woodwind clarinet, the answer would be the music store.

However, it can also take direct object. And objectives of the sentence is to show something different with preposition \"to\" than normal. The normal use of to which is subject of the sentence is different from the objective of the \"to\" as the phrase \"to someone other than you\".\n\n### Response2: The preposition \u201cfor\u201d is used to connect the clause with its subject.

{"text": "The answer is B: Cargo ship\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe sentence is talking about containers of goods brought ashore after a long journey at sea.\n\nGiven the context this means that the journey was either by sea or by air and that it involved cargo. The answer is therefore a cargo ship.\n\n### 1st Answer: B: Cargo ship:A cargo ship is a large ship specially designed for transporting cargo. A cargo ship typically has a hull designed to minimize sloshing or rolling of cargo, and several cranes for loading and unloading the ship. Cargo ships are known as a bulk carrier or tramp ship. Cargo ships come in three types: container ships, bulk carriers, and general purpose cargo carriers.\n\n### Why this response is wrong:\nThis answer is incorrect because it does not describe how the question is answered. Answering the question simply requires to determine where the containers of goods are unloaded after the long sea journey.\n\nThe second sentence is not an explanation of how the answer was arrived at, making the response inappropriate.\n\n### Second answer: \nThe question is talking about containers of good unloaded from a sea journey.The word cargo is in the question and the container has to be unloaded. This means that the ship is most-likely a cargo ship.The question does not say that the ship is a passenger ship, so it could have been a cargo ship.\nThis is a very reasonable conclusion based on what the question says. The answer is there.\n\n### Input:[A lot of passengers were killed when their train crashed, this caused much panic and chaos Choices:  A train ride B a long haul C public travel E local transport]\n\n### Response : The most reasonable response is C public travel.The question asks about passengers who are not local but travel elsewhere. The most common form of travel between cities is by train and this answers the question.A train ride is possible but it can also be travel by other form of transportation.It is reasonable that the passengers are injured and the question refers to the entire train and not just one passenger. Public transport also includes any form of bus, underground or boat.\n\n### Rationales:\n\nThe word 'train' is a single object noun, and hence should be singular.

{"text": "<pre>James felt that the alternative might be too religious.</pre>\n\n### Rationale: \n* When \"HIS CHOICE\" is being used, it is a general term which is being said in an offhand way that doesn't require much elaboration. The speaker is emphasizing the fact that it is _his_ choice and that it was a choice made by _James_. Because of this, saying that \"James felt that the alternative _might be_ the better choice\" is sufficient. Using'might' when referring to the future does not affect the meaning of the sentence, as the alternative is being framed as too whatever in the future with \"too [religious]\" being an example of something that could be too whatever in the future. \n\n### Input : He is a highly creative person but tends to be disorganized. \n\n## Output: He doesn't always follow instructions carefully in what activities? Choice: A: social  B: military C: athletic D: artistic E: manual\n\n### Rationales\n* This question is a double-negative question, asking if the person is organized in all of the mentioned activities or not organized.\n* Therefore, the correct answer will be a choice that contains both words _organized_ and _not_.\n* The person is likely organized when it comes to artistic activities and disorganized when it comes to manual activities.\n* Therefore, we can deduce that the person is not organized when it comes to manual activity.\n* Thus, the answer will be D: manual. \n\n## Input: In addition to his studies, he worked in a few short-term jobs to earn some money for himself.

I do not know how much of it is worth saving, but I copy it now to give you some idea of my early literary history--and if it bores you it bored me, you remember.   The title is _The Story of a Bad Boy_.  I do not know how to tell you how we got the idea. We used to be on a farm and I am sure no boy would care to take that farm as a model. It was a fine place, I assure you.  I think it was in one of my books you were told that we lived in a beautiful little country home, where the apple trees were loaded with luscious fruit, and where our mother always provided the best strawberry shortcake at noon, and the finest candy and ice cream at night, but this is not true, and I think my sister and I would have been ashamed of it if it had really been told. But there were beautiful walks about the place, where the buttercups and the violets grew in spring, and pretty flowers of every kind, and wild plum trees, where we spent hours every summer day.  We always had a little row-boat, and a bridge for wading and fishing, and Jessie has never forgotten one night when she crept from under our blanket to take her place on the bridge, and a big red fish, that had never seen Jessie before, opened its huge mouth just under her nose, and she felt almost sure he would engulf her, and she crept back under the blanket. Then we thought of catching the biggest fish we could, and of taking him home and giving him to our father.

Increase implies that the bonus' increase more per employee at year-end than usual. \n\nAnalysing the options: \n1. Increasing means that the year-end bonus increases more per employee than usual. However, year-end bonus is not about employees per se but about the number of employees and their productivity. 2. As the company increases its rate of production by hiring more employees, its profitability increases. It is unlikely that employees are the reason for the increase, so the option A: Increase does not fit. \n2. This context indicates that the company has to keep up with other competitors. \n3.

The answer should match the context; thus, \"boredom\" does not fit.\n4. He fantasied about promotion \"while\" driving to work.

A: garage B: closet C: warehouse D: tailor E: clothing store \n\n### Response \n\nThe question implies that buying clothes can be done outside shopping malls or stores at other places, with garage, closet, and warehouse being some of the options. \n\nBased on the other statement about buying jeans in the previous question, shopping mall and clothing store are ruled out. \n\nSo that leaves three remaining places, garage, closet and warehouse, to choose from. \n\nThe closet, is a place where the man can get his jeans but it is a private residential area, therefore, it is not a viable location to shop in a public place. \n\nThe warehouse is also a residential area and that can cause issues for purchasing garments that may be required such as jeans in such a crowded and public space. \n\nSo we are left with only the garage. \n\nThe garage is likely to have space for parking and also a workspace where tools are stored. \n\nTherefore, although it could store the jeans it would not be an ideal place to shop. \n\nSo I think the answer is garage.", "answer": "C: clothing store"}

Choices:  a) more productivity b) faster development  c) greater flexibility  d) increased innovation\n\n### Response 2:\n\nWhat is an advantage of self-managed teams?\n\nAccording to this website,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_team, \"Self-organizing teams have greater flexibility to respond to changing business conditions, such as market demand and competition, because team members have the authority to make decisions that affect their own work. This contrasts with traditional project management, in which one or several people have the authority to make organizational decisions and enforce the project's policies\". This article says a self-managed team is not the best choice for every project, but it can be a useful tool at times. A self-directed or self-managed project team can have a number of advantages. The first benefit is increased productivity because team members can work autonomously. Another benefit is fewer management costs. By reducing the number of managers or administrators who must be paid, this type of team saves a company money. A self-managed group is also more flexible and responsive because team members make decisions about their workflow. The final benefit is increased innovation. Teams are more creative and innovative when they are given the freedom to try new things and experiment.\n\n\n### Codility assessment 6046695707180561\n\n<img src=\"03%20-%20Codility%20-%2520Instruction.png\" width=\"700\" height=\"493\" alt=\" \" />\n\n<img src='04%20-%26nbsp%3BInstruction.png' width=\"700\"/>\n<img src='1", "answer": "D: more funding"}

The word \"practical\" indicates that the options have to be the same as shopping. Credit: The question says \"buying products\", so it should be linked to the buying part. However, credit is specifically linked to purchasing on credit (which does not match \"buying products\" in the sentence) thus it is eliminated, and the word \"impractical\" is used to indicate that the chosen one shouldn't be linked to buying products.

Answer: He disliked her sister because she was a gold digger.\n\n### Response:-\nHe knew her sister before the gold digger got married. After Mary knew that her sister got married to a guy, who lived lavish life, she asked him to give her a monthly allowance. However, he didn\u2019t know that her sister was a gold digger and declined her proposition. After a short period, she started calling him on daily basis. Therefore, it\u2019s clear he wanted him to give her a hefty amount, otherwise, it means she was only interested in a rich man like her husband. This scenario shows that he disliked her because her sister lied about her intentions and was actually a gold digger. This justifies Mary\u2019s claims that her sister was a liar and a gold digger, hence, the answer is B.\nAnswer: B.\n\n### Input- What is the relationship between B and A?

{"text": "This is an example of a metaphor in which the speaker is using the simile device to describe a state of mind. The correct answer is 'B: anger'.\n\n### Instructions:\nThe following are four excerpts from a book by one of your favorite authors. Read each passage and identify the statement that best summarizes the author's main idea.\n1. A:  You've heard a lot about how bad smoking is for your health. Well, have you heard just how bad eating too much sugar is for you? Excessive sugar is more harmful than cigarette smoke. Scientific research on the harmful effects of sugar has grown since the 1970s. Today sugar has been added to almost every food on the grocery store shelf. If you like the sweet taste, it will get easier and easier to eat just about everything this way. Soon you will be eating even sugar that is not sweet to start off with. For example, adding sugar to baked beans makes them taste sweet; it is a way that the cereal and snack food makers fool you into thinking you are eating a meal rather than a snack. Scientists have begun to study just how bad eating sugar every day can be for you. Sugar causes cavities to form, heart disease and even diabetes. And this is before talking about how much of it makes you fat just from eating.\n2. B:  Do you feel the need for a tighter definition of the word \u201csocial development\u201d? What do we mean when we say this? What factors should a definition include? I think we need to be careful in defining this term because social development can mean a lot of things. In some cases, it is good that we have a lot of definitions. A single definition can miss a lot of good things about people. But in other cases, a single definition is what is needed. Maybe the need for a simpler definition comes from a problem with a single definition. Maybe we need to look at our multiple definitions to find the best way to think about social development. For instance, an expert on human development, Peter Kahn (2001) has identified four types of social development as follows: \u201cincreasing interpersonal and intrapersonal cohesion.\u201d (Kahn, 2001 p. 4).

Bickering (Choice 2.) and arguing (Choice 2.) is not synonymous (which means they differ) and thus are not similar ( which means they share some similar traits). Therefore, they do not mean the same.\n\nFailing to communicate or being disruptive to senior management (Choice 4.) can be both positive and negative. Communicating with the senior can be positive or negative as well as refusing to do it.\n\nDisagreeing about company decisions (Choice 5.) can either mean disagreeing positively or negatively for example when team members agree with the decisions or when they do not.\n\n\n#### Choosing the best answer from Choices 1-5\n\n##### Step 1: Using the options, determine the difference between Choices 1 and Choices 2.\n\nChoices:\n* The phrase \"lacking respect\" indicates that there is a difference between the two\n* The two phrases are opposite in meaning\n\nThe above suggests Choice 1 (lacking respect).\n\n##### Step1: Using the options to determine what Chouices 2 shares with Choice 1.\n\nChoices 1 and 2:\n* The phrases are the same\n* Both lack respect between two parties\n\nThe above implies that Choice 2 shares similarities with Choice 1 (which is negatively charged).\n\n#### Step 2: Using the", "answer": "C: bridge"}

This is because in the question it is stated that many addicts turn to exercising in order to deal with their addiction. However, the question does not present the context of exercise in order to deal with addictions, but rather explains that exercise is a healthy way as whole. If we were to apply this logic to a certain option, such as option E: weigh, then we could find out that the exercise is only a healthy way to weigh things. Furthermore, option B: expend energy is incorrect because the sentence is not about the exercise being used to deal with the addictions, but it is about the exercise itself being healthy for its own purpose. Option D: stretch is incorrect for the same reason option B is incorrect. \n\nIf we analyze all the given options and determine the context they fit in the most, we can find that the exercise is healthy because it involves laughing. This option is stated by the author, if the answer is different from laughing, then the question would be worded differently, or some other evidence would be provided.

In 2012, there were reportedly 5,179 cardiovascular surgery-related deaths, accounting for 2.3% of all deaths due to surgery. This indicates the seriousness of the medical procedure.\n  * As a rare medical condition, we can consider the possibility of a person experiencing a hemodialysis (HD) failure, which is a serious side effect that occurs in less than 10% of patients undergoing dialysis treatments.

{"text": "The sentence states that \"moving cars entail\" a few given outcomes which are either positive or negative. \n\nAs for \"driving,\" it is simply the action of moving a car. It may involve risks and rewards such as accidents, but it is not directly associated with moving cars unless the car is being driven (which, in this case, would mean a new meaning for moving cars).\n\nRoad is simply a surface for vehicles to move on. It may carry risks and rewards but it is not directly related to moving cars. \n\nSo, among the choices, only \"getting tired,\" \"accidents,\" and \"ticket\" are suitable results to the question. \n\nOut of these results, \"accidents\" is the most suitable to the question. Driving cars do lead to accidents, and while risks may result to various outcomes, getting tired and ticket are likely among the least relevant to the question.  Since accidents are closely related to the question, the answer is C: Accidents. \n\nAnswer: C: Accidents\n\n### Input:\"He lost his phone and got a new one.

The first sentence states \"Kyle's 6 a.m. workout\" is what.\n2. Here, \"what\" refers to his daily physical activity.\n3. Workouts could be tedious, tiring, difficult, boring, or exhausting.\n4. Given this context, A: tedious and B: tiring seem more appropriate.\n5. This is because both words indicate that wearisome or tiring activity, and this is the type of activity that Kyle engages in daily.\n6. So, the answer is B tiring. \n\nReasons: 1. The first sentence reads \"Jeremy did not understand the subject.\" 2. The context mentions not understanding the subject (math). 3. Therefore, the answer should be E: Math.\n\nReasons:1. The question asks which is the \"best\" choice, and the answer that is best is the only one that makes sense as the correct answer.\n2. The only word that has anything to do with the subject (biology) is \"biology.\"\n3. Biology is the correct answer since the person in question made the statement.\n4. Hence, the answer must be D: Biology.\n\nReasons for \"A\":1. The question reads \"I do, but my roommate does not.\", indicating that the roommate does not do homework. 2. However, this statement is a negative and therefore it excludes the possibility of a roommate that does do homework.\n3.  There is no other viable choice as none of the other options have anything to do with the context of the sentence.\n\nReasons1.

{"text": "The sentence's context provides the following clues: school and church do not make sense options due to the words \"many\" and \"theater.\" The same goes for the words \"populated\" and \"base,\" which suggest that these locations would be populated. \n\nAnother clue can be seen with the use of the English word theater. Theaters are places that are used to host many performances, making it the only logical answer. \n\nThe closest answers to the correct answer would be Opera, because theaters are a place to see performances, and Church, because they are places where performances can be held. \n\nAn answer that requires a combination of the given words does not answer the question asked. \n\n\n### Input :I was amazed when he performed a ______ at church and everyone got into it. Choices:  A. magic trick B. dance C. rap D. sermon E. song\n\n### Answer:\nThe sentence' \"_____\" in this sentence should be a noun, since it is preceded by the word \"when\" and separated from the rest of the sentence by a comma. \n\nExamining the given choices provides some information. \"Magic trick, dance, or sermon\" would not make sense in this sentence. \n\nThis leaves \"rap\" and \"song\" as reasonable choices due to their context. When someone does a rap or song, it is often a performance that the audience gets into. \"Magic trick\" does not make sense because no one would get into a magic trick.

Choices:  A) a Thai dish B) a salad C) a sandwich D) a soup E) I was in the mall\n\n### Explanation\nWe are required to identify the answer choices based on the context of the question given by the statement. The phrase \"on the day of the party\" implies that it might not be the day of the party (e.g. it's the night before the party, after the party, etc.). This is why we can exclude answer choice C (the sandwich).\n\nThe sentence also contains 2 important words: _meal_ and _best_. The first word (meal) is a noun which is a food prepared as a complete dish that we can eat. The word \"best\" is an adjective, so it describes \"meal\" as the food we eat as the \"best\" meal, and the noun (a dish) is the thing I want to be best. \"I was in the mood\" for this food but a) it's not Italian food. b) it's neither spaghetti, pizza, or something else. c) It's not a baked good, so a cake or something similar cannot be the best meal I can eat.\n\n### Answer\nWe can eliminate all three answers. Let's take a look at the remaining three sentences.\n\nWe can exclude answer choice A (\"a Thai dish\") since Thai is not Italian food.\n\nWe can eliminate answer choice B (\"a salad\") since salad is a cold dish and not a meal as defined in the sentence.

In general, rural areas tend to be defined by the following features: a lack of densely populated development, with some exceptions such as farmland, forests, or other undeveloped land. A rural area is typically less developed than a city, in terms of industry, commerce, business, and economics. It usually covers a larger geographic area than cities and suburbs. Rural areas are found in mountainous regions, in regions with long coasts, and in arid desert areas. It is also found along rivers, lakes, and oceans. Sometimes, a rural area is defined as any place that is not within the political boundary of an urban area. Rural areas often have different natural features, such as farmland and forests. A rural area in a developing country may be less developed than a rural area in a developed country. \n\n#### Option B: Ohio:\nIt is a state located in the eastern Midwest.

The program then iterates for `n` times, increases d by 1 and prints the number each time. After entering the user's input, the value of n is calculated by the user.

{"text": "A person would probably feel special after receiving a gift that was rare or uncommon. \n\n### Why? \nThis is because receiving a special, rare, or uncommon gift indicates that the giver has gone out of his or her way to select an extra special present for the receiver. By doing so, the giver is making a conscious effort to give something that is not common and instead something that is rare or uncommon. Giving something that is rare or unique in some way would make the person feel special as they would appreciate that extra attention and effort put in by the giver.

Thus, sitting too close to TV \"can cause\" strain, blurred vision, and/or a headache.\nTherefore, sitting too close to a TV could cause a strain, blurried vision, and/or an headache, according to the question.\nA strain could refer to a result of laziness, as they are generally associated with inactivity and lack of exercise, which means sitting too close to the tv for a prolonged period would result in strain, since one would not be moving at all while watching tv.\nBlurry vision and headache would not occur due to laziness, but that does not mean that the pain wouldn't occur as a result of lazyness. All of these factors can be caused by sitting too close to a tv, and the question states that either of those pains would occur as a result, so the choice that fits the context is \"A: brain problems B: getting fat C: headache E: laugher.\"\nA: brain problems \n\nInput: The story was too scary when the man was looking at the picture in the magazine he was reading it was too scary to sleep in the same room for that week.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: vegetable.\nAnswer: D: vegetable\n\nInput:If you work the soil under a tree you are usually trying to plant what type of garden? Choices:  _A:_ a flower _B:_ a vine _C:_ a vegetable _D:_ an herb _E:_ a bush\n\n### Response 2:\nRationales :\n1. The question states the answer option should be given, but we just have to figure out what it is by reading the information given.\n2. The question states that we are \"trying to\" plant our vegetables.\n3. A bush is a type of plant that grows in small shrubs with many flowers, and one cannot plant these flowers in a garden. \n4. An herb is a smaller type of plant used for medicine and seasoning, which does not refer to what we are looking to plant in a garden. 5. A vine is not an item plant that one plants in a garden but is a climbing plant that wraps around trees and fences.\n6. A flower may be a plant, but there is no mention about planting flowers, so it can be eliminated.\n7. The correct answer is the C: veggie plant.\n\nAnswer: C: veggie plant", "answer": "D: vegetable"}

It implies kids play with a regular ball instead of a tennis ball or an inflatable volleyball.\n4. The options given indicate where kids play soccer or other games such as baseball or frisbee.\n\nFurthermore, we infer that the answer is not in a game since a game requires some rules or equipment.

She may also be planning on going back to her hometown over the holiday breaks, which may mean that she needs to go to the college dorms a bit before classes start. \n\n## Input 2\n\nAmy is looking forward to her winter vacation. When her vacation starts she wants to do lots of things and she knows that her mom is planning a dinner with her entire family. What should Amy do first? \n## Rationales\nAmy probably does lots of preparation before going on a vacation for a few days. She definitely checks what the weather will be like so she can pack accordingly so she will not be cold when she is planning on doing outdoor activities like skiing or skating on the ice at a lake. She will probably also plan her other activities for that vacation depending on what kind of vacation it is. She may also need to book travel arrangements for the trip, as well as book hotels, plan transportation to and from places, etc. \nAfter she has done all those things, she definitely needs to prepare to spend time with her family.

The options provided by the question are a school building, office building, house, hotel, and centre.\n3. Given a choice between a school building and a house, a house is most likely to have multiple floors. Also, the phrasing of \"it was on the _second_ floor..\" points to it being either the first or second floor. The second floor, therefore, fits the most with the question.\n4.

{"text": "The statement suggests that the farmers make use of toothpicks.\n\n### Rationales:The first sentence of the statement indicates that farmers make use of something and that something is the reason why they are not using it in a given context. Since toothpicks are a very thin kind of stick, farmers would find them useful for picking anything they pick on their farm. This could vary from fruits to meat. Toothpicks could also be used as tools or crafting material. Farms generally consist of tools, and farming also has its own traditions. Farmer's use toothpicks to hold them while constructing the farms. The shed is a building or structure where farmers store the tools they use for farm work. They put toothpicks in that space since they don't need to use toothpicks on the farm. \n\nAnalysis of the provided Choices:  \nA: The correct answer is B: grocery stores. Farmers keep toothpicks in the grocery store, and that is precisely why farmers are not using toothpicks when farming.\nB: Farmer's do need toothpaste, but that is not what the question is talking about. \nC: This answer is incorrect, as farmers do not typically spend their time building models. \nD: A farmer's shed does not have toothpicks in it. \nE: Farmers do not use boxes. There are no boxes in the picture that was provided, and the farmers are using the toothpicks in a way that indicates that they are not using them in the farm at all. \n\n\n### Solution 1:\n\nThe first element of the sentence, \"where,\" indicates place. To understand that the question is a location question, which gives us a clue to search for \"box\" in the given images. \nAns: The box is the only place that can contain all the given names together (mouth, grocery store, constructing models, and shed). A box is also called a container; toothpicks could be any type of stick but they should be thin. Therefore, the correct answer is \"box\"\n\n### Solution2:\n\nFrom the pictures, we can see that the second element of the sentence, what, is about toothpicks. To", "answer": "A: mouth"}

Adjectives modify nouns whereas adverbs modify verbs. To answer this question, you need to find an adjective that corresponds best to the action verb \"saw\". Therefore, all choices that describe nouns cannot be the answer. You can find the answer if you look from the other direction: adjectives that are similar to the verb \"freaked out\". So, you want to find a verb that's similar to the noun \"freaked out\". You could consider the following:\n- A: panic: it's a verb that fits that context, but the word \"shock\" would also fit the context as it is similar to \"fear\".\n- B: fretted: it's a past participle form of a verb \"freak out\" and it would fit the context.

To find these, we can write down the given options and exclude the ones that do not have that word in them. First, we have the words arena and dock, which do not have performer in them, so both of these will be removed. Then, we have building, which does have performer in it, so this will be kept.

Choices:  B: 12:00 AM B: 6:00 PM A: 1:00 AM D: 9:00 PM E: 11:00 AM\n\n### Demostration Explanation: Coffee causes dehydration and may increase the risk of heart failure, heart attacks, stroke, and high blood pressure. According to a study by the American Heart Association (AHA), drinking coffee or tea before midnight reduces heart disease by 22%. Another study found that higher consumption of caffeine around 6 p.m. may lead to lower blood pressure and a 28 percent reduction in the risk of mortality. However, drinking coffee in the morning may not provide the same benefits. For example, a research study conducted in 2016 suggested that drinking coffee or tea late at night may enhance blood pressure recovery during the day, resulting in lower blood pressure during the day. Additionally, research supported the fact that drinking coffee is associated with a reduced risk of diabetes, especially if the drink is consumed before the blood sugar levels increase. \n\nAmoung the choices, A: 1:31 PM has the correct answer. Research has shown that drinking deos at a time is better for health than consuming it in the morning. \n\n### Input : What did she carry on her handbag?

Moreover, in the given options, the bathroom is a personal place so only the owner knows they keep their curling iron at their bathroom. \n5.

There are people who are eager to explore their imagination, there are open-minded people who will help you figure out what to do and make your life easier.\n\n- There are students who will help with what they can and how they can.

Because when you start to get into these topics, it's difficult to remember them as they've never been introduced to you. At the same time, the teachers here are not afraid to ask questions. They will always ask for the best answer, they will not do it in a manner that will hurt one's feelings. They will make sure everyone understands and understands what is meant by that answer!\n\n#### I have seen countless posts from students who have started to get into topics such as the topic of their teacher using \"fake\" data. Because the teacher had never explained what this meant, there were many students who did not understand what it meant or how it could be true.\n\n#### Another great part of my school choice is that they give a lot of good programs and opportunities for students.

B: Everybody would be there. D: It's where you'd get a good view. B: That's the best one.\nAnswer: It's where one would build a house\nThe best answer choice would be that he thought \"everybody would be there\" because he was describing an event or gathering of some sort. To better describe the event further, he believed in the phrase \"it's where one would get a good view\". This suggests that he believed it was a good place to hold such a gathering or event.\n\nSo, we can determine 'everybody would be there' is the best answer the context of the question. This is because the phrase implies it is a common place to hold events and gatherings.", "answer": "B: wristwatch"}

Choices: A: a big office space B: a small office space C: a personal office space D: a good credit history E: a good reputation \n\n### Response\nThe best alternative for an office with a limited budget would be a small office space. This is the best choice because it leaves extra money for other necessities. A big office space would require more resources, and a personal office space would come with more limitations. Having a good credit history does not necessarily mean you have financial resources, and a good reputation is more about what the office is known for than how much they can contribute financially.\n\n### Input \nWhy did the woman refuse the man\u2019s proposal for the third time?

A bookcase would most likely contain books and other paper materials but not binders.\n3. Office supply stores sell school supplies including binders.\n4. School offices would likely hold lots of office-related items but not homework assignments, which the binder probably contains.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The statement presents a scenario of two parties being involved in a disagreement, where Party A has a point but the other party simply doesn't see it.\n2. Although \"see\" here doesn't have to refer to a visual sense, this phrase is primarily used to refer to visual perception, as in \"he saw her point but still disagreed\".\n3.

{"text": "Soon after I read the instruction, and after I thought of several different answers and possibilities, I realized that the instruction was wrong in two fundamental ways.\n\nThe first and most important lesson is the ability to think critically and the ability to reason out problems. Thinking critically means the ability to analyze and assess critically or in other words, the ability to consider or assess information, arguments, ideas, beliefs, concepts, theories, principles, methods, or processes critically. The phrase critically means with or showing thorough or careful consideration or judgment. When I am thinking critically, I use all of my senses, including my perception, to reason out a solution. For many years, I have used the acronym \"C.O.A.B.L.E\" which stands for \"Clean my ears\" as I see others who are speaking. Clean my ears to me means to make sure I not only listen carefully but I think about what is being said with as many different perspectives as possible. The phrase\"think outside the box\" for me has always meant to take the traditional or conventional approach to solving or trying to address an issue and use all available resources to find a new solution to address the issue. Most important in my mind is the need for balance. I always approach an issue from three key perspectives. The traditional view, which includes historical, current and trending ideas and the potential pros and cons of each. The innovative view, which includes new ideas, concepts, and technologies and their potential pros and cons and the societal view which includes the potential pros and cons for each based on the societal consequences and impact of the issue. When I think critically, I am always considering all three perspectives.\n\nSecondly, I learned an important life lesson here. Sometimes writing instruction can be wrong. We write every day and for some people like me, it's their full time job. Even if a person writes every single day, it is very easy for us to fall for bad instructions. I used to take the instructions below literally and write down my answers. Over the years, I have realized that many things don't necessarily mean what they say.

However, it is likely that a person in need of a radio would go to a shop.\n3. A shop is the obvious option for buying devices.\n4. A bedroom, like a house, is a place where you do other activities. Thus, the answer should be B. \n\n### A: station:  station is not likely the solution for buying a radio since it does not sell radio.\n\n### D: bedroom: a bedroom does not sell radio.

So option B is definitely not the right answer.\n\nOptions D: The man did not eat when he was making a decision rather he made a choice after thinking about the option. So \"ate\" is not the option that is required in the context.\n\nOptions C: Same as the D, the choice is not made by the man by speaking but by weighing the pros and cons of various options.

Thus, the question can be rephrased into \"What do humans and living organisms need to do to be able to exist together in society?\" \n\nIf a society is defined as \"[the] interactive process of the social relationships which are established among people by their mutual recognition of a common value, purpose, goal, or activity that leads to their existence and welfare\" (Oxford), \"society\" is formed when humans and other living organism establish an \"interactive process of the social relationships\" with each other. It follows the interactions, or relationship, would have to happen first before individuals are able to form \"common values, purpose, goal, [and] activity\". \n\nTherefore, individuals would need to form a form of relationships (i.e. interactions) before society can exist. \n\nSociety can only exist if humans form relationships with each other.

{"text": "- Answer: \n\n### Rationale given:\n\nThe answer given includes the information that the evidence in the investigation is a  gun and he does not consider whether this gun is the actual weapon used to commit the crime or not.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nTo find the correct answer, we compare the three answers given.\n1. The crime scene is the place where the crime was committed. There is no mention of receiving evidence. Raised here means the crime scene.\n2. Back to its owner is where the evidence gets taken back to its owner. It was not mentioned before which owner is this.\n3. Police station is where the evidence is forwarded to the police.\n\nThe option that can be considered to be correct out from the choices given are:\n1. A: The gun evidence was sent to the drawer. This means the answer is a.\n2. B: The gun evidence was not meant to be back to its owner. This means crime scene will be the answer.\n3. D: Crimes are investigated first in the crime scene, after which, they are forwarded to the police station from there on. If that has taken place, the crime scene will no longer be the crime scene. Hence, the answer will be crime scene.\n4. E: A gun holster is different from a drawer and is definitely different from the crime scene. There is a high possibility that the gun is not in the holster and also unlikely to be lying in the drawer (as this does nothing related to the evidence in this context). Finally, since it is not mentioned that the crime scene remains the same, the crime scene is the answer.\n\nFinally, we have to pick the answer, which is option 4, which is the crime scene.

Here, choice C is marked wrong since the other passenger is not mentioned.\n\n### Answer : The key phrase in the question is \"you would not be able to perform your job effectively or efficiently. There are two reasons why the answer for question number three is A. One is the presence of the phrase 'you would not be able\" and another is from the definition of the word \"efficient\" \"The word efficient indicates that someone or something will be performing at the best possible level; will be doing something in the best possible way to achieve the desired result. The phrase \"you would not be.\" states that the person cannot perform their jobs as they should. The second reason for the answer is the definition of the word effectively.  \"The word effective indicates that the person will be performing at the required level to achieve the desired result.\" The phrase \"would not be.\" also states that they person cannot perform their jobs.

It is sufficient to mention both books and plays.\n2.

{"text": "Exercising is a form of physical activity that engages the skeletal muscles and cardiovascular system and can result in improved physical health and well-being, increased strength and endurance, and enhanced energy levels. Exercise can have both immediate and long-term effects, influencing how we feel both physically and mentally. In the short term, as a person engages in physical activity, they may start to feel tired, hot, and breathless, but these symptoms generally decrease as they continue to exercise. This process of increased fatigue followed by improved fatigue following relaxation is a common experience for many people who regularly exercise.\n\nPhysical activity also activates the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system, which is responsible for promoting relaxation and reducing stress. When we are sedentary, our bodies are held in a sympathetic state, which causes muscles to remain tense, and blood pressure and heart rate to remain elevated. Exercise is an excellent way to relieve stress and anxiety, as it promotes relaxation and improves mental health. Additionally, exercise releases endorphins in the brain, which also have analgesic and mood-enhancing effects.\n\nIn the long term, exercise has been shown to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. This is because exercise increases muscle mass, decreases body fat, and improves insulin sensitivity, which may help to control blood sugar levels.\n\nFinally, exercise requires an expenditure of energy and provides an opportunity to practice self-control, allowing the individual to learn how to manage situations that require moderation and self-control.\n\nIn summary, exercise can lead to immediate fatigue as physical and mental energy is depleted. However, it also has long-term benefits, such as reducing the risk of chronic disease, improving insulin sensitivity and mental health, and promoting self-control by demanding dedication and perseverance.\n\n### Conclusion: How does this story support the claims below?\n\n### Conclusions: This claim shows how this story helps support the claim above.

Instead, a 'hall' is generally found in an office or school building.\n\n### Analysis:\nThe choice B: motel is considered because a reception area usually connects to the lobby area. The lobby includes a check-in area, which would require guests to wait until their room is ready to check-in and it would be unreasonable to think they would be waiting in the hall.

However, it does not give much information about whether they are a fashion-sense or not.\n5. \"Clothing\" could mean \"clothing\" or \"clothes\". However, the question does not mention anything about the types of clothing. \n6. \"Jewelry\" would not be a good fit here since the question is about a quilt that is made of velvet. \n7. The question also specifically uses the phrase \"velvet\". The only places where velvet is common are fabric stores and jewellery shops.\n8. \"fabric store\" does not contain the word \"velvet\".\n9. \"clothes\" does not contain the phrase \"velvet\" or \"clothing\".\n10. Among all the options, \"jewelry store\" comes the closest to containing the words \"velvet\" and \"clothing\". It can also be seen that only this one contains the phrase \"velvet clothing\".\n11.

You should keep the account book at your office so that it is always accessible and up-to-date.\n\n### Input 2:\nInput: Where is money spent the most in a startup? Expense tracking is very important for any business, but especially in a startup, where budgets are often tight and every dollar counts. Here are some tips on where to spend money in a startup:  A: the business itself B: supplies C: employees D: marketing E: miscellaneous expenses\n\n\nAnswer: Input:\n\n>Where is money spent the most by a startup?\n\n> Money is spent the most on marketing, supplies, employees, and miscellaneous expenses.\n\nFor the last two questions, I made sure I asked for an \"Instruction\" before I went ahead to answer the question.\n\n\n\nFor the questions in the input, I would include the following in my response:\n\n1. Expense tracking is vital for any business, but it is particularly essential in a startup because budgets are often limited, and every dollar counts for the company's growth.\n2. It is essential to note that different phases of a startup involve different expense patterns, and the business must plan its expenses accordingly. 3. This is where marketing comes into play as it is the primary tool for driving sales and growth in a startup. It is crucial to allocate resources and budget correctly to ensure you get the best ROI by investing in the right marketing areas.\n4. While marketing makes or breaks the brand perception in the eyes of the potential customer, it should not be the sole targeted expense. 5. The next important step is focusing on sales through supply management by tracking invoice orders, maintaining proper inventory, and ordering supplies on time. This area should have a well-established supplier and vendor relationship to optimize ROI.\n6. A startup needs skilled employees who can handle the company's needs and assist in decision-making, and finding the right talent can be challenging but crucial for the startup's growth.\n7. Finally, allocating money for miscellaneous expenses like office supplies, rentals, and utilities is essential for a startup's", "answer": "C: desk drawer"}

Choices:  The 25-foot drop; The long walk upstream; The narrow path; The difficult climb\nRationales: In this scenario, there is a 25-foot cliff. The cliff has a 25-inch drop, or a 25-person drop. If there was only a drop of 25 inches, it would not stop 25 children. Moreover, the cliff is an obstacle that deters children from passing over it and it requires them to travel at least 25 feet to circumvent it, which could require them to take a 25-second detour. \nThe cliff is also an obstacle that detends them from entering a small waterway because the children have to pass the cliff before they can get down to the water. The kids would have to go 25 feet from where they left off to get to the river and they would have to take a 26-foot detour if they were to walk back to where they left off, which works out to a 9-second detour.  \nThe cliff is not the only obstacle for the kids to overcome, though. There is another long way to go in the stream itself. It must be hiked from one end to the other. There is also a narrow path, which could prove difficult, and a steep climb to reach the last checkpoint. There are other obstacles other than the cliff itself, like the distance and the terrain. The cliff may be the biggest obstacle, but it certainly isn\u2019t the only one. \n\n### Input : Who is the girlfriend of a man who is the father of a child whose mother is the wife of a person who is the husband of a woman who is the mother of a woman who is married to a man who is the brother of a brother of a man who is a brother of a son of a mother of the", "answer": "D: distress"}

{"text": "The correct answer is D: bus stop. \n\n### Reason:\nThe question begins by providing a scenario where a man is driving himself to the airpot to catch a flight. \nThe text continues by saying \"When he arrived, he was tired, so he checked his car, the airport was full of people\".\nBased on this context and the following information, all the other options mentioned in this question do not make sense.\n\n### - For instance:\nClothes closet: Clothes closets are usually in homes and not in public spaces like airports. The question does not mention he arrives at his home, therefore we can eliminate the option.\n\nHotel: Hotels, where people stay to rest, do not provide luggage storage areas and do not allow people to leave their luggage unattended. The question ends with the man claiming that the airport is full of people, therefore the luggage is not within a confined area.\n\nSidewalk: Sidewalks are commonly found outside homes and in public places where people walk, not inside the airport. The description states that the airport is fully populated with people. So it is not reasonable to assume that he would be able to leave his luggage unattending on the sidewalk.\n\nBus stop: Bus stops are confined areas where buses typically stop, but they do not have closed space. The statement ends with the man checking out his car. Therefore it does not make sense to imply he would be able to keep his luggage at the bus stop.\nTrunk: The trunk is a locked space under the hood of the car, which does not have windows nor doors through which the owner of the luggage can pass. \n\nGiven the description and the previous deductions, the only reasonable answer that fits into the scenario is the luggage put on a bus station, otherwise known as the bus stop. Therefore, the answer to this is: D: bus stop.\n\nInput:The man was lost in his own thoughts and was daydreaming in the park, suddenly a dog snatched his leash but it returned it, he was what?

This means that it is a day with a wind force index greater than zero at the wind direction that is not a zero wind direction.  In other words, the wind force index is greater than zero in some direction.  The direction that produces this greater than zero wind force index may be any wind direction, but it is unlikely that wind force index is greater in each of two independent (from one another) nonzero wind directions.  It is likely that one is greater than zero and the other is less than zero.  It is possible that both are greater than zero; however, this condition is unlikely.  It is also possible that the wind force index is  exactly equal to zero in such cases as a quiet room or the room of a still day with little or no wind present.

One on the left, one on the right.<n>* In some cases when the question is complex, there will be more than 2 answer choices. (E.g.: A,B, and C instead of A or B)<n>* Look at the options that are incorrect, for example: When two answer choices are not on the opposite sides of the answer key, or if one of the incorrect answers stands out and you can't figure why it's incorrect.<n>*  When solving a problem there is no substitution. For instance, you cannot solve a = 1. If there exists ambiguity (i.e. when it gives the choice between an answer key and a sentence) then try and solve a simplified version of the equation. <n><n>#### Other Resources<n>* [Algorithm_Solving_Question](https://github.com/sarvam15/Python_Algorithm_Maker/blob/master/solving_question.py)<n>* [How I Write Instructions Questions](https://github.input-output.info/Historical-Problem-Solving)<n><n>##### Source code<n>[solving_question.docx](https://github.sarvam1.github.io/Python_Algorithm-Solving-Question/solving_question/docs/solving_question_sarvam.docx)<n>[solving_instructions](https://github.io/sarvam4/solving_instruc)<n><n>##### Python Version<n>[Python Version](https://github.output-output.info/Python-Program-Solving-Question)<n>

A: good at cooking B: smart C: musical D: intelligent E: dumb<n><n>Answer:<n>The correct choice is C)<n><n>If the man enjoys listening to the music of Mozart, he is smart. It would be incorrect to state that the man is a musician or composer. Mozart's music was genius, but he did not compose anything. The genius composer's brain was like a musical database that he called on by means of his intuition and inspiration. There have been numerous studies on Mozart's music and his gift has been explained by the fact that his musical brain held such great amounts of data that he could simply choose the right sound from anywhere in the database and make up a song, sonata, or opera on the spot and instantly the piece was a musical masterpiece! If the brain of Mozart, Beethoven, and the many other composers of the past centuries could access musical patterns from anywhere, it's quite conceivable that our brains can also access any data we want. By listening to music or studying piano or any other instruments, the mind can access the music and song database of the brain.<n><n>It is amazing to me that many who have spent a lifetime studying music to become great classical and jazz musicians never achieve such music composition greatness simply on the basis that their musical brains were not trained to be music databases! Many who desire to learn piano also never achieve Mozart's musical greatness because they weren't trained to do so. It is the same with learning languages or mathematics. Mozart was very young when he composed and he also wrote many operas with libretto of his own composition.<n>His musical brain had been trained well and he did learn various language well but that was not his talent.

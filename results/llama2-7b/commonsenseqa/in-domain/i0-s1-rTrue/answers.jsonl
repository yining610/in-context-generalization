At this point, she reached in her suitcase with her hand in the middle and grabbed the bag. The handler was confused and stopped her in mid-grab and made her put her hand back into the X-ray as well to be rechecked. The handler told her that she was forbidden to pull out objects at will and return them.\nNow the problem you are facing comes from the statement:\"The only baggage th woman checked was a drawsting bag.where was she heading with it \nThe only baggerh she checked was a g\"\nThe first and the second statement shows a difference of punctuation.\nThe first statement should be\"The only baggage she's checked was a drawstring\", then you will know the airport it was heading to.In other words,the second statement should be\"the place where she is heading\".\n\n\n\n## Time complexity O(N) space complexity O(1)", "answer": "E: airport"}

Well, some of the water will get hot and some will remain cold.  (This is called a \"heat transfer\" by physical laws.)  So some of the water will be vaporized, it will evaporate, and the water will become a gas and move along with the hot water.\n\nEvaporative heat transfer means that warm water cools off.  Cold water stays cold.\n\nNow since some of the ice cube (water) has vaporized, it (the vapor) goes into contact with the air.  The air particles are cold; they absorb some of the energy from the vapor and become vaporized themselves!\n\nThis is called a \"vapor cycle\".  In this case, the vapor of water is a solution, where a drop of ice cubes gets hotter and hotter until it melts.\n\nIf you look closely, you will find that water is hotter than ice cubes and ice cubes are hotter than water.", "answer": "B: satisfaction"}

If both of them matches then true is printed or else false.\n\n- When we run the `main` function, it takes the `They were full of joy` as a question and `'A'` as Choice.\n- This question has 'Happyness' answer, hence the program prints `True`.\n- Since, `isMatched` prints the result of a true conditional statement; hence, `answers` will always be updated to its new value.\n- If you would like to print something different, then you need to change the `output` variable in the function.\n- The default one is `True` which indicates that isMatched is returning a true or false result based on the question and the choice.\n\n---  Solution: \n\n\n\n## Instruction:Answer the question which is given below.\n\n\n\nInstruction:Answer the question in the paragraph which is exactly the same as the one above.", "answer": "B: happiness"}

{"text": "C\n\n\n### Explanation:\n\n\nThe question asks: Where did the person have to go to get the tool? They might go to the hardware store, go to the basement, go to the garage, go to a repair shop, or go to the library.  The answer choice that best answers this question is the only one that can't be the answer to the question (Choice D). The question was, where did he have to go? He didn't have to go to  the library.\n\n\n### Solution:\n\n1. For one variable \"a\" in \"a < b\", you need to use \"a <= b\", \"a <=\" b can also satisfy the condition but more compact\n\n2. If you have to input variable A and variable B, \"a <= b\" is not very compact, we need a more compact way\n\n3. The above two solutions are to replace \"a < b\" with \"a <= b\", in our case, we replace \"a < b  <=2\" with the one mentioned in the \"instruction\" and the above three solutions. \n\n\n\n\n### Example:\n\n\nInput:The boy was 3.1 inches tall and he grew an inch. By how much did he grow? Choices:  Grew 1 inch Grew 2 inches Grew more than 2.1 inches.\nOutput:Grew 2 inches\n\n\n\n\n\n1. If \"a\">=\"b\", \">=\" is short for \"a>=b and a<=b\"\n2. If the question asked for the exact amount by which you gain and you add \"exact\" at the end, then to make it shorter, you firstly convert the \"=\" and the \">\" into \"<\" through the \"!=\" and the \"=\" operations, and then input both sides of the equality. For example:The amount the boy gained did not become larger than 2.1, it became smaller.\n\n\n## 2. Compared to the first round, you get some additional instructions.\n\n### Instruction:\n\n\nThe answer to this question was based on another question,  If this is true, the answer to the other question is false, and if this is false, the answer to the second question is true.

{"text": "A\n\n### Solution for Exercise 1:\n\n\n\n### Instruction:Answer the below question.\n\n\nLet's say you are searching for a hotel. You decide on a hotel where every room has a window. You want the best rooms in the hotel but you are not fussy about the view. So let's say the first floor has the best rooms in the entire hotel. But they are all along the short wall. The second floor doesn't have as good a room as the first, but they are all on the long wall. You only want the room that is the best of the two. How do you proceed in this algorithm?\nWrite a pseudocode that will find the room and find the best room in the hotel for you. You can assume that you know what floor the room is on.\n\n    Input: The first floor has the best room in the entire hotel.\n    \n    Output: The best room in the hotel is the room in the first floor.\n    \n### Solution to Exercise 2:\nThe algorithm is pseudocode:\n\n```\n    start\n    for i from 1 to n, \n        for j from 1 to n\n           bestroom=bestroom +1;\n           if i > j and bestroom=bestroom in \n                if(i%2==0 and j%2==0)\n                    bestroom=bestroom - 1;\n            else if(i%2!=0 and j%2!=0)\n                bestroom=bestroom+1;\n            else\n                bestroom= bestroom+1;\n```", "answer": "B: hotel"}

{"text": "The correct answer is (D).\n\n\nWe have been focusing on a problem called \u201cclustering.\u201d Clustering identifies clusters of data points that have similar values, thus classifying them together.

That is, the number of input values, the number of output clusters, and the types of the input data.\n\nIn any dataset there will be two types of data: continuous input and discrete input. For example, consider the numbers of students who had lunch at the cafeteria.\n\nA continuous input might be the number of slices of pizza consumed, whereas a discrete input might be 'Apples,' 'Bananas,' and 'Oranges' as choices for breakfast. When the input space is a discrete set of categories, use the k-nearest neighbor algorithm. \n\nInput:The number of students who ate lunch at the cacheteria.  Input:The number of inputs is small.  Input:There were a lot of students.\nOutput:(C). If the number of inputs is small, then k-nearest neighbor is sufficient.\n\nThe problem we will work on is a special case of clustering where the clusters are defined by category.\n\nFor example, in a phone book, category A might contain all the people named _Jones_, and category B might contain everybody else. The task for the phone book is to find those clusters and then find a mapping from the category to a real number.\n\nInput:Where does Bob live? Choices: 1: 1115 North Ave. 2: 1116 North Ave. 3: 1117 North Ave. 4: 1118 North Ave. 5: 1119 North Ave. 6: Bob's house is in the numbered street.\nOutput:The correct choice is (B).\n\nIn this case the input data is a dictionary in disguise; category B contains everyone except Bob.\n\nThe algorithm we will need is a simple modification of k-nearest neighbor, the nearest neighbor algorithm. We have seen the nearest neighbor algorithm defined for all values of k, so it may seem like this problem can be solved without modification", "answer": "A: bookstore"}

{"text": "Choices B and D.\n\n\n\n### Instruction:Code to detect the output.\n\n\n\nExplanation of Code:Here is a code to detect the output. The idea here is basically to find out all options then if any of the option is \"Relaxed\", it has to print \"B\" and \"D\". Otherwise if anyone of \"Happiness\", \"CreateMusic\", \"Sadness\" or \"Loud Noises\" was printed, it has to print it as \"A\", \"C\" \"E\" or \"B\" respectively\n\n```c++\n//Code\n#include<iostream>\n#include<vector>\n#include<string>\nusing namespace std;\nvoid process()\n{\n    string choice;\n    cin>>choice;\n    if(choice==\"Relaxed\" || choice==\"Happy\")\n    {\n    cout<<\"B\"<<endl;\n    }\n    else\n    if(choice == \"CreateMusic\" || choice==\"Sadness\")\n    {\n        cout<<\"D\"<<endl;\n     }\n    else\n        cout<<\"A\"<<endl;\n}\nint main()\n{\n    process();\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n##  Instruction:Modify the code that follows in such a way that every option will be provided with space.\n\n## Solutions\n\n\n\n## Explanation of Code:here are the solution for second question. The idea is basically to first write a new vector and store the characters that we have in our sentence in the vector. Then we start with the first character and store its index in a stack. As we do this for every character, we check if the current character is matched in the stack. If matched, we remove it from the stack, if it is not matched, we append the index of the character to our string. Do this until you get any unmatched string. and then print the characters in this string. This should work if there are no spaces. If there is a space, there is some problem but we can try to modify the code.\n\n```c++ \n\n#include<iostream >\n#include<vector >\n#include<string >\nusing namespace std; \nvoid process()\n\n{\n    vector<char> v(2); //create vector v with characters", "answer": "D: sadness"}

They are impossible to open a computer or put it on another computer.  \n\nA.\n\nIt is impossible to open a laptop in exactly 5 minutes.\nA laptop is a computer that has a very similar function, but is portable - it can be moved from one place to another. You can't open a computer in 1 minute. You can't do any useful things in 1 minute, that's all. \n\nB.\n\nYou couldn't put a laptop onto another laptop. They aren't the same thing. \n\nD is incorrect because two computers can be connected to allow data or information to be transfered between the two. \n\nC - We couldn't think of any more reasons why these lines are wrong.\n\n\n### Another exlanation: \"Duhhhh....\"\n\n\n\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question using this statement \n\nWe have four pencils left in Shaun's office because we donated five pencils.

If there are 20 people in your class divide all their sleepiness by 20. This is the sleepiness of your class. You now multiply your sleepiness by the age of your class. This is the sleepiest class with a population of 14.\n\n### Part B: Repeat Part A for each class you teach. When finished, add the sleepiness for each class together. If the total sleepiness of all the classes exceeds 1,000 then the answer is 1; otherwise 0.\n\n### Instruction:Answer the instructions.\n\nInstructions for part II:\n\nFind the sleepiness for each of your class from most sleep to less sleepy. Subtract all the sleepiness from the most sleepy person of your class to that of the person with the least sleepy. Once you have done this, you have their sleepiness. Divide it by the number of students in the class. This is the average sleepiness of that class.\n\nYou can now multiply this average sleepiness by the age the class. There is a list of each of the classes and the number of people in each class for you to look at.\n\nNow if the total sleepiness of the classes is less than 1,001 then the answer is 0 or if they are greater than 1,020 then the answer is one.", "answer": "D: drink coffee"}

The word amusement does not have a special meaning in the English language. It is used to describe the joy a person experiences.\n\nThere are numerous possibilities for amusing something. The word charmed is used to mean having a feeling of being fascinated or intrigued.

The word is used to describe a state of happiness.\n\n### What is the difference between the two words?\nIn terms of definition, the purpose of entertaining something or another thing is to amuse, whereas enjoyment and amazement are both used to describe how someone experiences something.

What tool should I use? Choices: A: rake B: spatula C: hoe D: shovel E: scoop\n\nOutput: C\n\n\n### What should be done to fix the mud?\n\nFirst you need to scrape and loosen the top layer, which is the hardest. \nThis is why you need a shovel! For the deeper or smaller patches of mud, a hoe is used to dig out all the hard surface. Once you get the hard surface removed, add fertilizer and water to soften the soil. \nIt can be easier and faster to do the latter actions first. The soil will be softer, making it easier to cut through dirt in small patches. Then the rake can come in to scrape it up.\n\nFor larger patches, you should use a shovel to lift it up and haul away.

There are four type of animals since there are four types.\n\n### Problem Analysis\n\n#### Example 1\n\nGiven the below string\n```java\n cat goat horse chicken\n```\nThe type would be 14321.\n\n> Time complexity is constant, since it only needs to calculate one string. Since string length can be less than 10, the string could be as like `chicken cat goat` and that it is possible to be as large as 10.\n\n\n\n#### Example 2\n\n> Since the solution in Example 2 is using the string length as variable, the complexity is in constant time.\n\n```java\ncat cow goat horse chicken lion tiger bear\n```\n\nNow to classify animals, the string is split by space, and each type is a digit, so that after we split by space we have number1, number1,number1number2....\n\n\n\n#### Time Complexity \n**The best way to solve it:** using one loop, and iterate through string and check if current char is the same with any types, if it is, then sum the types.\n\nFor example: `10.10.08.97.10.11.10.10`.The solution is like this: `1 5135-", "answer": "C: red barn"}

{"text": "A:\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe word 'it' is singular so the noun it refers to needs to be singular as well. The choice of'school' is correct as it is a singular noun. Choices B, C, D and E are plural nouns (a house, office building, hotel and a centre are all plural nouns respectively).\n\nIf a sentence has more that one noun, it is important to look for the correct form of a noun which best agrees with the subject of the sentence.\n\nWe can see an example of sentence where the subject is singular: \"The room on his schedule had a hard time finding \"\n\nWe can see that 'the room' is singular. When we want to talk about an object, we put the article before the noun or adjective (a word that names or describes something) that we are referring to. A sentence that has a pronoun as a subject is usually singular: \n\nI like to read books, but I don't care to go to a cinema.\n\nThe pronoun \"I\" is singular, so when we want to talk about what I like, we use the singular.\n\n\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question and explain your answer.\n\n### Exemplar Solution:\n\n### Output:A:", "answer": "A: school"}

We spend more than 1 trillion USD every year on treating diseases, many of which wouldn't occur without people\nputting on too much weight. A simple, cheap, and effective way to help people lose weight is to create a calorie deficit, that is, to burn more calories than\none takes in. Exercise is commonly used to create a calorie surplus, but exercise requires a lot of effort, which means many people would prefer not to exercise.\n\nLet's suppose that there is a place where people can go and burn a number of calories. On average, people are able to use an existing swimming pool to run\na calorie deficit of 1 cal/minute, and all people must buy a swimming pool access pass with X passes, where X is number of passes and X > 0. The amount of\ncalories burned depends on factors such as age, weight and intensity as well as duration of the swim. \n\nWhat is the best plan to ensure that a certain person on average burns the most (on all days) calories per second for each pass purchased? \n\nFor example, if X = 100, the average person can get average 75% of full strength swim burn of 100 cal/minute in 1 minute for each pass purchased. \n```\n\n\nInput:Pass number=5, Pass number=12, Pass number=17, Total = 34\nOutput:Pass number=1,  Pass number=7,  Pass number=13,  Total number=40.\n\n### Instructions:\n\nGiven a list of persons, some of whom prefer red wine and some of whom prefer white.

Then slowly, by a slow process of elevation of land areas, the sea waters were receding and new lands were coming up. These land areas were formed within a framework called continents which were already being formed in deep, remote oceans. In course of time, new lands came up on the earth surface forming land area above sea level but joined by land connecting areas. This created a chain of islands which developed and became peninsulas and then islands and then continents. So a chain of islands started forming the continents, the greatest group of islands that ever existed on the earth surface. In spite of all this expansion, land still continues to move downwards into the sea, a process known as subsidence. Subsidence is a result of uplift of land area. An uplift or recession of land area causes new land to appear, but land subsidence goes to the bottom of the sea, forming basins which are filled up with water. Thus an island formed in sea begins to subsist and as it sinks into the sea it creates the deeps of the sea. Subsidence is the process causing formations of island basins. The whole process from continent to islands to continents is what we know as geomorphology. We know", "answer": "D: earth"}

{"text": "The most correct answer is Answer choice letter E: murder\n\n\n### Instruction\nInput a string representing a line from a story (\"This means war!\"). The rest of the test cases will be single characters. You may assume that all input strings and the resulting strings do not contain symbols other than numbers and letters.\nYou may assume that no two elements in input strings are equal. You may also assume that no character is repeated in any test case.\nFor example:\n\nLine = \"This means war!\"\nIncorrect = \"This means\"\nCorrect = \"This meaIncorrect = \"This meThis me\nCorrect = \"True\"\n#### Instruction\nYou will run the test case for each input provided (1 to 3), you will return the letter that will be the most correct. You will use the line as the input variable, and the line will be passed as input.\nIf a line contains several strings, we recommend you consider each string and treat them as separate lines. If a line is an empty string or contains no strings, your answer may be \"None\" or \"NONE\", whichever choice you prefer.\nThe number of strings in each line is guaranteed to be strictly less than 1000, as well as the longest string in each line.\n\nYou may ignore the order of the elements in your array, and always use the lowest index element (index 0) to represent the answer (the least possible).\nThe correct output has length 1, it indicates which of the characters you will find in the end\nThe test will be executed for each character as a unit.", "answer": "C: mass hysteria"}

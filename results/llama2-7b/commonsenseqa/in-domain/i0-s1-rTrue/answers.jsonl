As tests pass a developer\u2019s implementation, the unit tests are being used to write specifications. These specifications, which are written by an outside party (in most cases a client), form the basis of the program that they wrote. Writing the tests before writing the code helps to eliminate the risk of writing code that is incomplete and does not meet the client\u2019s expectations.\n\n### Why Write New Code Before Writing Tests?\n\nBy writing code before the tests, it makes it easier for a developer who is unfamiliar with the code to create the tests against an existing implementation. Since tests are created before writing the code, there is much more information in the tests to help the developer to be successful in writing the code. The failure of the tests is used to identify where changes need to be made in the new implementation.\n\n### Running Tests\n\nAt the end of each testing cycle, code tests are run automatically in most integrated development environments. While these automated tests are an indication of the current health of the application code, the main function of the test is to act as a specific specification that gives developers a clear idea of how their implementation was tested and by whom.\n\n### Benefits of TDD\n\nThere are several benefits that come with writing tests before a developer writes code. The primary purpose of writing tests is to create specifications for how to write the code. In this way, the tests act as a template for code, guiding the developer towards the implementation desired by the client.\n\n### Drawbacks of TDD\n\nThe primary drawback of TDD is that a", "answer": "D: movie"}

{"text": "Answer Choice C\n\n### Justification: Answer Choice C is correct because the person wrote the check with the intention of paying the company the same way they received the check at the clerk's desk drawer. After the clerk's cash register, the clerk receives a check from someone. The next step is for the clerk to bring a new check to give to the second person, because they will also pay the second person.\n\n### Extra Response: This is a wrong answer. After a clerk receives a check, the clerk needs to get a receipt. After getting a receipt, we need to put the receipt in a register so that we can get money from the cash drawer, so we will be able to do that for the clerk.\n\n### Clarification: When you receive a check, you need to give the clerk a receipt for payment. The next step is to record the payment in a register so that you can get the money from the cash register and so that the person who gave the payment can be notified.", "answer": "A: cash register"}

{"text": "The correct answer was D.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n\n\n### Hint:\n\nDuring meal eating everything on the menu,  One may have to feel full.\n\n### Test-driven development\n\n### When I read the input 'full stomach' it immediately makes me think about feeling full, and how that could impact eating more food. This is probably my natural reaction to seeing that string of words, but it seems like it would just be normal to feel that way. A. Full Stomach\n\n### In the second sentence, we say things like \"One tends to _____\". So if One is having the feeling of being full to eat more food, what emotion would they feel if they have not ate everything on the menu? \n\nD. I might feel sick or sad or like I might vomit, since I know I ate enough for the time.\n\n### If you knew you were feeling sick, wouldn't you want to go outside and get rid of the contents of your stomach? D. Sickness\n\n### So since we would be sick from eating too much already, what would we be able to do with the food? Try out other recipes from the menu or if it was too much food, we could probably throw out or eat something else.\n\nSince they would be sick, they might not think of getting food and trying other recipes. B. Getting Full\n\n### If they were full, I would wonder if I should take something else even though I already ate everything on the list. Even though if you thought about it, it would not matter, because I would never be able to eat more in those circumstances.\n\nBecause when you eat food, you should always finish everything on the menu because you do not know how big the portions are. \n\n### C.\n\n### I do not think that someone who has everything on the menu is over-eating at this point. Unless this was like a taco stand or something else simple and unhealthy, they should not be throwing up or feeling sick. In addition to this, even when one is full, they are going to feel satisfied. After a while, if one is still feeling full they would want to stop eating because they can not handle more food.\n\n\n###", "answer": "B: getting full"}

It seems like the program statement was valid by my knowledge of programming and the ANSI C language.\n - I thought about the question since it used the term what would the machines do instead of which did the computer teach. I began to think that the word what would just mean what they were supposed to teach even if it was not true.\n - By reviewing similar multiple choice logic I found out that there was a possibility of picking what the computer could or what something could do instead of which it is or did happen.\n - So I began to think of all of the possibilities for the problem then I found a solution for both parts of the question.", "answer": "C: do work"}

It should return the shortest distance between those points.\n\n### Example:\n\nSuppose `src = (2,0)` and `dest = (0,1)` Then, the shortest distance is `sqrt((0-2)*(0-1)+1)`.\n\n### Notes\n\nThis is one of the classic examples of the Fibonacci sequence. You should think of the distance between two points as the sum of squares.\n\n---\n\n## Instructions for Part 3 of Part 2:\n\nCreate a new function `distancePairs()` that takes an nxn matrix of points and returns an nxn matrix `array2D` where the elements of the row correspond to the distance from the points of corresponding position in a new array.\n\nThe distance between a point `pointOne` and `pointTwo` is the distance between the two points as described in the answer above.\n\n### Notes:\n\nThe answer will be in the form of an array so it needs to be in a different \nmatrix.\n\n### Improvement:\n\nWhen you are finished write a test that will test your code. You will not know the answer, but you should run through your code with the points to make sure it generates the answer.\n\n### Output\n\nThe function in the previous paragraphs will return a square matrix 2x2 where the top left `array1` row will have points and the bottom right `array2` will return will contain the distances.", "answer": "A: airplane"}

{"text": "B \n\n### Explanation:\n\n**A:** This is a type of business that has a high number of phone to make calls from a phone, \nit's because a gas station needs to communicate with its owner if something happens and to talk to customers and ask for them to buy the type of fuel that they have at their station and also they need phones to communicate with their supplier if they don't have a kind of fuel to keep them their business running smoothly and when customers call and ask if they sell a particular type of fuel and to tell them that it's unavailable.\n\n**B:** The business that has a high numbers of telephone booths is a city business for example in london there are a lot of telephone booth in any spot, why? Because when it's a city the more buildings there are more people passing by and a lot of offices and buildings are using a lot of telephones to communicate with customers and people, a city is a big and busy place that doesn't have time to go to phone a place and wait for it to pick it up and call someone, you can see a lot of offices that has its own telephone booths to avoid this problem and that's why cities have a high number of phone booths.\n\n**C:** There are more telephone in london because when you walk around the city you can see the telephone poles everywhere, and a lot of telephone number in those telephone poles. It's because london is a very big city with a lot of big buildings and businesses and they need to have a telephone to communicate with other big businesses inside the telephone poles and a lot of telephonic lines to communicate with other businesses and people in the telephonic lines because london is the biggest city in the world so you need to have a lot of telephone lines.\n\n**D:** There are more phone boxes in a train station because there are a lot of people passing by and they can use it to call to someone in case of emergency or an urgen situation. When in a train it's hard to talk to someone on the phone when there's not a good connection in a train and train stations have special phone call lines to communicate to them stations.\n\n\n### Output:Answer the following multiple-choice question:", "answer": "B: city"}

{"text": "If A, then A is the right answer. Where will a bullet projectile most likely to be found during a war is the battlefield. The battlefield is where the battle occurs. Bullet projectiles are meant to break apart, fragment, and explode with force. As a reminder, a bullet is an item that is launched towards a target with the intent to hit. When a bullet has made contact with an alien or enemy and has broken, it is usually a dead body. There is a saying that goes, \"the more a bullet has been exposed to the elements, the sharper it becomes.\" That saying pertains to the breakdown of a bullet that has seen so much time on the battlefield. Bullets on museum walls are extremely rare items. They were used to hunt large animals and are now used as collectibles. Bullet projectiles would likely end up in a weapon if they were given the chance to. There is nothing for them to fight against if they didn't have a specific target. Bullets do not know to go to a specific location. They are used as a way to hunt, protect, and keep people safe. Lastly, bullets are launched and do know where they are going to end up. They don't have minds of their own. So, this is my response to this question.\n\n## Solution:See below \n\n![Alt Text](https://github.com/AHerring423/Herrings-Project/blob/master/assets/Demonstration%201.png?raw=true)", "answer": "A: battle field"}

For instance, if we have the string C and it contains the character A, this means that we've gotten a hit in the counting, so the character A has been compared with the characters from C and we got a hit. For every possible input, however, if we were to count how many times we get a comparison with the character sequence from UserInput and the character A, this is what we would get:\n\n```\nOutput 1\nChoices:   B: concert\n```\n\nBecause we have already seen that if we replace in every given sequence the character A with B we obtain the same result with only one difference, since B is the one that appears less in the sequence C and it's  the one used in the output, this is why the output says that the character B is present more times in the sequence C.\n\n### Expected Output 2\n\n```\nAnswers should\ncorrespond to\n A and not the other\nones.\n```\n\n## Expected Input\nThe input for this problem is the frequency distribution of the characters A or B, since", "answer": "A: new york"}

You should respond with text, but also keep in mind that code is a language too, so you ought to write your response as if it were working. Here \"working\" is a bit of a relative term, it could mean either working like a program, which means that it is executable, or it could mean working, which you should think of as the \"functional\" level. For instance, in the instructions you could have the user prompted with \"What happens to cats?\" or \"what do you do for a living?\" or \"what do we think about the weather these days?\" And you could appropriately respond like so:\n\n\n```\n\n  # cat\n  Open the door.\n```\n\nBut you wouldn't write it like so:\n\n```\n\n    #!/usr/bin/python\n    cat = open(\"the/door\")\n```\n \n \n \n\n\n### Questions:\n\n - Did you get the right answer for the task?\n - Can you explain why you got the right response?\n - What parts of the question did you have to think about?\n - How does the question relate to programming?\n - What if you got the wrong answer?

But, sometimes we don\u2019t take the necessary steps to try to protect our bodies. It is much easier to recover from a non-painful accident than it is to endure the trauma associated with a major accident.\n\nWhen we take a blow to the body, we need to decide whether we should stand up tall to protect our body from being hurt even more or should we curl. We should protect our bodies from any injury that may occur because sometimes we don\u2019t know our actual injuries and the more we think about it, our injuries may become more.

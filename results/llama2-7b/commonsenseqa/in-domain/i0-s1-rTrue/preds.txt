At this point, she reached in her suitcase with her hand in the middle and grabbed the bag. The handler was confused and stopped her in mid-grab and made her put her hand back into the X-ray as well to be rechecked. The handler told her that she was forbidden to pull out objects at will and return them.<n>Now the problem you are facing comes from the statement:"The only baggage th woman checked was a drawsting bag.where was she heading with it <n>The only baggerh she checked was a g"<n>The first and the second statement shows a difference of punctuation.<n>The first statement should be"The only baggage she's checked was a drawstring", then you will know the airport it was heading to.In other words,the second statement should be"the place where she is heading".<n><n><n><n>## Time complexity O(N) space complexity O(1)

Well, some of the water will get hot and some will remain cold.  (This is called a "heat transfer" by physical laws.)  So some of the water will be vaporized, it will evaporate, and the water will become a gas and move along with the hot water.<n><n>Evaporative heat transfer means that warm water cools off.  Cold water stays cold.<n><n>Now since some of the ice cube (water) has vaporized, it (the vapor) goes into contact with the air.  The air particles are cold; they absorb some of the energy from the vapor and become vaporized themselves!<n><n>This is called a "vapor cycle".  In this case, the vapor of water is a solution, where a drop of ice cubes gets hotter and hotter until it melts.<n><n>If you look closely, you will find that water is hotter than ice cubes and ice cubes are hotter than water.<n><n>

Choices:  A: hardware store B: basement C: garage D: repair shop E: the library.<n>Output:		C<n><n><n>### Explanation:<n><n><n>The question asks: Where did the person have to go to get the tool? They might go to the hardware store, go to the basement, go to the garage, go to a repair shop, or go to the library.  The answer choice that best answers this question is the only one that can't be the answer to the question (Choice D). The question was, where did he have to go? He didn't have to go to  the library.<n><n><n>### Solution:<n><n>1. For one variable "a" in "a < b", you need to use "a <= b", "a <=" b can also satisfy the condition but more compact<n><n>2. If you have to input variable A and variable B, "a <= b" is not very compact, we need a more compact way<n><n>3. The above two solutions are to replace "a < b" with "a <= b", in our case, we replace "a < b  <=2" with the one mentioned in the "instruction" and the above three solutions. <n><n><n><n><n>### Example:<n><n><n>Input:The boy was 3.1 inches tall and he grew an inch.

Choices:  A: town B: at hotel C: mall D: business sector E: yellow pages<n>Output:		the choice that's more likely<n><n>### Solution:<n><n>In this program, the first step is to take each input and generate the list shown below. Then determine if the first choice is the answer the question.<n>```python<n>choiceList = ["at hotel", "town", "mall", "business sector", "Yellow Pages"]<n>```<n><n>Next determine if the first choice on the list is the most likely to be the correct location based on the question text.<n>```python<n>if choiceList[0] == "at hotel":<n>    choice= 1<n>else:<n>    choice= 0<n>```<n>Then for each choice in the list, determine the choice is the correct location based on if each is or isnt the given location. Then use the variable from above, either equal to 1 or not equal to 1, and display the correct answer. The below shows how to update the variable choice and then display.<n>``` python<n>if choiceList[1] == "town":<n>    choice = 1<n>else: <n>    choice= 2<n>if choiceList[2] == "mall":<n>    choice =2<n>else: <n><n>    choice= 3<n><n>if choiceList[3] == "business sector":<n>    choice=3<n>else: <n>if choiceList[4] == "Yellow Pages":<n>    choice=4<n>else:<n><n>    print(choiceList[0] == 1, "is the answer")<n>else:<n>    print(choice == 1, "was not the answer")<n><n>```<n><n>## 10.What is the name of this restaurant?

There are three ways to do this. The first way is to compare each element in the list to the given restaurant name. Next, if one matches return the index, otherwise return -1. If the -1 is found, this means none of the choices match the name. The last option, which I choose to use

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n><n><n>Input:Jamie wanted to reduce her waist size, but all of her efforts failed miserably.  She continued to do what? Choices:  A: gain weight B: augment C: dispare D: make larger E: expand<n>Output:		She continued to gain Weight<n><n>## Solution:<n><n><n>### Examine the choices one by one.<n><n><n><n>- "A: gain weight" is obviously inaccurate. A person is either gaining weight or losing weight. Hence not valid.<n>- "B: augment" is also an incorrect option<n>- "C: dispare" is again an inaccurate choice<n>- "D: make larger" is also incorrect as it implies she lost weight.<n>- "E: expand" is correct and is not mentioned in the options. Hence the right answer.<n><n><n>### Additional hints:<n><n>1. There are no "false" choices, just as there were no "wrong" answers on the math test.  (The question is asking you to choose the _best_ response.)<n>2. A great way to decide whether your answer is correct is to read your answer out loud.  If you choose "gain weight", then yes _you are_ gaining weight but _she_ isn’t.  Hence the answer is not correct.  If you were unsure whether your answer was correct, feel free to read it aloud and you will see how to spot inaccuracies by doing so.  (A less obvious reason to read answers aloud is to get confirmation that you really are choosing the best answer.)

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n><n><n>Input:Where is a notebook often purchased? Choices:  A: bookstore B: backpack C: abraham lincoln's grave D: desktop E: classroom<n>Output:		The correct answer is (D).<n><n><n>We have been focusing on a problem called “clustering.” Clustering identifies clusters of data points that have similar values, thus classifying them together. For example, we can cluster words into a dictionary.<n><n>We will not discuss the details, but the best algorithm for clustering depends only on the distribution of your data. That is, the number of input values, the number of output clusters, and the types of the input data.<n><n>In any dataset there will be two types of data: continuous input and discrete input. For example, consider the numbers of students who had lunch at the cafeteria.<n><n>A continuous input might be the number of slices of pizza consumed, whereas a discrete input might be 'Apples,' 'Bananas,' and 'Oranges' as choices for breakfast. When the input space is a discrete set of categories, use the k-nearest neighbor algorithm. <n><n>Input:The number of students who ate lunch at the cacheteria.  Input:The number of inputs is small.  Input:There were a lot of students.<n>Output:(C). If the number of inputs is small, then k-nearest neighbor is sufficient.<n><n>The problem we will work on is a special case of clustering where the clusters are defined by category.<n><n>For example, in a phone book, category A might contain all the people named _Jones_, and category B might contain everybody else. The task for the phone book is to find those clusters and then find a mapping from the category to a real number.<n><n>Input:Where does Bob live? Choices: 1: 1115 North Ave. 2: 1116 North Ave. 3: 1117 North Ave. 4: 1118 North Ave. 5: 1119 North Ave. 6: Bob's house is in the numbered street.<n>Output:The correct choice is (B).<n><n>In this case the input data is a dictionary in disguise; category B contains everyone except Bob.<n><n>The algorithm we will need is a simple modification of k-nearest neighbor, the nearest neighbor algorithm. We have seen the nearest neighbor algorithm defined for all values of k, so it may seem like this problem can be solved without modification

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n><n><n>Input:Where would you put a computer other than a desk? Choices:  A: apartment B: table C: school D: office E: house<n>Output:		Where would you put your computer?<n><n>#### Answer:C  <br><n>In short, the sentence in bold is the "key sentence", because it holds the keywords of this question.<n><n>When you see any such word 'other' or 'otherwise' it helps you choose options from 'A' to 'E' since the word 'otherwise' in an 'otherwise' answer can be anything other. But when such key sentence is not present, you can not choose the answer that holds 'anything' as keywords - that is the correct answer for this question. Note: In the case of the question, there is a small ambiguity as the sentence also mentions'school' as one of the places where the computer is present, but we have made our position above clear.

Choices:  A: happiness B: relaxation C: create music D: sadness E: loud noises<n>Output:		Choices B and D.<n><n><n><n>### Instruction:Code to detect the output.<n><n><n><n>Explanation of Code:Here is a code to detect the output. The idea here is basically to find out all options then if any of the option is "Relaxed", it has to print "B" and "D". Otherwise if anyone of "Happiness", "CreateMusic", "Sadness" or "Loud Noises" was printed, it has to print it as "A", "C" "E" or "B" respectively<n><n>```c++<n>//Code<n>#include<iostream><n>#include<vector><n>#include<string><n>using namespace std;<n>void process()<n>{<n>    string choice;<n>    cin>>choice;<n>    if(choice=="Relaxed" || choice=="Happy")<n>    {<n>    cout<<"B"<<endl;<n>    }<n>    else<n>    if(choice == "CreateMusic" || choice=="Sadness")<n>    {<n>        cout<<"D"<<endl;<n>     }<n>    else<n>        cout<<"A"<<endl;<n>}<n>int main()<n>{<n>    process();<n>    return 0;<n>}<n>```<n><n>##  Instruction:Modify the code that follows in such a way that every option will be provided with space.<n><n>## Solutions<n><n><n><n>## Explanation of Code:here are the solution for second question. The idea is basically to first write a new vector and store the characters that we have in our sentence in the vector. Then we start with the first character and store its index in a stack. As we do this for every character, we check if the current character is matched in the stack. If matched, we remove it from the stack, if it is not matched, we append the index of the character to our string. Do this until you get any unmatched string. and then print the characters in this string. This should work if there are no spaces. If there is a space, there is some problem but we can try to modify the code.<n><n>```c++ <n><n>#include<iostream ><n>#include<vector ><n>#include<string ><n>using namespace std; <n>void process()<n><n>{<n>    vector<char> v(2); //create vector v with characters<n>

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n><n><n>Input:Where would someone likely bring an attache case? Choices:  A: overhead compartment B: chair C: hospital D: in shirt E: business meeting<n>Output:		<n><n><n><n>In the following paragraph, some words are used in the same context as they are defined in a dictionary. Identify the word in the paragraph that is used out of context?<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>The answer is "chair". In a dictionary, chair is a noun that means "a saddle for riding and an article of furniture upon which one sits." In the paragraph, the word has the same function but the dictionary definition of the word is missing. It might be used to carry a book, but it is often a saddle for riding. <n><n>Note: This answer seems somewhat forced on the input as a dictionary won't necessarily define the word in the context in which it is used. Also, the word may not necessarily be taken out of context.<n><n>### Another explanation:<n><n><n><n>Which of these lines are true about a computer?<n><n>A: It is impossible to open a computer in 5 minutes<n><n>B: It is impossible to put a computer in another 10<n><n>C: We can't think of any reason why these lines are true<n><n>D: E: Both  A and B<n>    <n>### Explanations:<n><n>The answer choice choices can only be "A" or "D".

You can't open a computer in 1 minute. You can't do any useful things in 1 minute, that's all. <n><n>B.<n><n>You couldn't put a laptop onto another laptop. They aren't the same thing. <n><n>D is incorrect because two computers can be connected to allow data or information to be transfered between the two. <n><n>C - We couldn't think of any more reasons why these lines are wrong.<n><n><n>### Another exlanation: "Duhhhh...."<n><n><n><n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question using this statement <n><n>We have four pencils left in Shaun's office because we donated five pencils.

The method that uses the `class` keyword, `self` method to make `is_alive` and `age` class methods using class decorator `property`<n>   ``` python<n>   def __init__(self):<n>       # initialize private variables and their type<n>       self._is_alive = True // default value False.<n>       self._age = 12<n><n>   def age (self):<n>       return  // return self._age, the default value<n><n>   @property<n>   def is_alive (self):<n>       """Checks if animal is still alive"""<n>       if not self._is_alived:<n>           return False<n>       else:<n>           return True<n>    ```<n>    Now if we use the method:<n>    ``` python<n>    is_alive = self.is_alive() #call the method<n>    ```<n>we will get:<n>``` python<n>if self._is_alives == False:<n>    self._has_died == True<n>```<n><n>2.

Choices:  A: meat grinder B: stable C: red barn D: gate E: green field<n>Output:		Which animal would stand firm if a lion or tiger or bear came down the road? A: Cows B: Sheeps C: Pigs D: Chickens<n>----------------<n>> # [1227. Animal Shelter](https://leetcode.com/problems/animal-shelter)<n><n>![](../public/figure1.png)<n><n>Given a row of animals which animal would stand firm if approached by a lion or tige or bear?<n><n>### Problem Summary (Easy)<n>#### Time Complexity<n><n>Time is in O(n) where n is the length of the string. For example, animals and animal order is string of length 5.<n><n>In this example, the order of animals is the string "cat goat horse chicken". Each animal is associated with a type. "cat" "goat" "horse" "chicken" are four types. If the animal order is an integer, then the type is 1. There are four type of animals since there are four types.<n><n>### Problem Analysis<n><n>#### Example 1<n><n>Given the below string<n>```java<n> cat goat horse chicken<n>```<n>The type would be 14321.<n><n>> Time complexity is constant, since it only needs to calculate one string. Since string length can be less than 10, the string could be as like `chicken cat goat` and that it is possible to be as large as 10.<n><n><n><n>#### Example 2<n><n>> Since the solution in Example 2 is using the string length as variable, the complexity is in constant time.<n><n>```java<n>cat cow goat horse chicken lion tiger bear<n>```<n><n>Now to classify animals, the string is split by space, and each type is a digit, so that after we split by space we have number1, number1,number1number2....<n><n><n><n>#### Time Complexity <n>**The best way to solve it:** using one loop, and iterate through string and check if current char is the same with any types, if it is, then sum the types.<n><n>For example: `10.10.08.97.10.11.10.10`.The solution is like this: `1 5135-

A simple, cheap, and effective way to help people lose weight is to create a calorie deficit, that is, to burn more calories than<n>one takes in. Exercise is commonly used to create a calorie surplus, but exercise requires a lot of effort, which means many people would prefer not to exercise.<n><n>Let's suppose that there is a place where people can go and burn a number of calories. On average, people are able to use an existing swimming pool to run<n>a calorie deficit of 1 cal/minute, and all people must buy a swimming pool access pass with X passes, where X is number of passes and X > 0.

Then slowly, by a slow process of elevation of land areas, the sea waters were receding and new lands were coming up. These land areas were formed within a framework called continents which were already being formed in deep, remote oceans. In course of time, new lands came up on the earth surface forming land area above sea level but joined by land connecting areas. This created a chain of islands which developed and became peninsulas and then islands and then continents. So a chain of islands started forming the continents, the greatest group of islands that ever existed on the earth surface. In spite of all this expansion, land still continues to move downwards into the sea, a process known as subsidence. Subsidence is a result of uplift of land area. An uplift or recession of land area causes new land to appear, but land subsidence goes to the bottom of the sea, forming basins which are filled up with water.

I remember that a couple of weeks prior, I had received a little gift of his which I thought was too cute and I thought was the kind of thing that I had wanted to buy for myself, only I hadn't for the simple reason that my wallet did not allow for \"extra credit.\" I tried to show to the little boy that I could indeed afford a gift if only I would choose to spend my \"extra-credit budget\" on him. As he could not imagine that I might have saved money for him, I imagined that he thought I was just being mean and unappreciative. I thought that the two of us might even stop being friends. Then, after he gave me the gift that was so close to what I had liked to give him, I figured it over and I realized that I hadn't been fair. So, I went and bought him a present that had nothing to do with what he loved - I felt it was so much better. He didn't think so because he was not expecting a gift for which I'd already made my little contribution. I was silly; I wish I could have remembered his reaction before being so thoughtless.\n\n\n## Question 3.\n```\n## What did", "answer": "B: fort knox"}

They are in the form of \"golden tests.\" Here is a brief description of the method, the test, and how you are supposed to use them to create code.\nThe purpose of this first exercise is to familiarise you with the unit testing framework described earlier.\nThis exercise is meant to be a simple introduction to the testing framework. You don't _have_ to use it, but it will probably be easier for you to see if the code is doing what you were expecting (if you were expecting it to do something, that is).\n\nTest your code by executing the tests in the `tests` directory.\n\nIn your `src` directory, create a method called `sayHi()` or something similar.\nImplement your method in a way that satisfies these requirements:\n\n1. It should display a greeting that tells me who they are and where they're saying hello from, with additional information about who and/or what their name was (these requirements can be satisfied through a single method).\n\n2. It should also be possible for me to ask it who is saying hello. This is important because it represents the one part of the method that is \"public,\" and therefore, is the point of contact for the system, so to speak. This means that your method should also provide an object that identifies the say-hi system.\n3. The other piece of your method that is public is a value that identifies who is saying hello.\n4. What I see when I look inside the method is what the method returns (the value we expect to return when the method is run). What is returned should be true for a specific subset of potential users. This means you should return a value of \"practical\" (True or false) for the users in your domain.\n5. You should not return anything else for the users in your \"domain.\" That is, one of the values should indicate who is saying hello and one of the values should tell me where they are saying hello from.\n\n6.

The percentages represent the number of plants eaten by the animal compared to the total number of plants the animal eats. The data represents how often the various kinds of plant eaters eat, say, oak trees; pine trees, or yucca plants, for example. What is the mean annual number of plants eaten (out of a possible 10) for an animal that ate 50% oak, 25% pine, and 25% yucca?\n\n- The key is to calculate the mean (the middle value) between the mean of the number of plants on that food and then add up all the plants that had the mean. Then divide the result by the amount of animals that ate those plants.\n\n### Solution:\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport math\n\n# The percentages represent the relative number of plants eaten. \n# So, to get the amount of plants eaten out of 100%, we multiply the percetages of each plant by 100% and divide that by the total number of plants. So, if something ate a mean of 50%", "answer": "C: space shuttle"}

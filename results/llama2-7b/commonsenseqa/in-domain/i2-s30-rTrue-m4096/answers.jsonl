The term \"make it important\" only appears in that phrase \"make it so that in my eyes it,\" so we can eliminate that part of the question and focus solely on the theme of the research project.\n4. Now the question makes more sense and becomes \"What must I do to make it an important theme?\" This is in the present, but could've also been \"What must I do so that it becomes an important theme?\"\n5.

In this case, we must identify what someone who gets angry after drinking alcohol is likely to take part in.\n2) In this reasoning question, we need to compare and eliminate the options that do not make any sense or does not belong to the question. For this, we apply the method of elimination, here we have options A,D,A and B,D,B; it's clear that the options which do not make sense are not options (A,B), so they are eliminated. Therefore, we are left with A,D,B, and E - the only options which may fit.\n3) Then, it is important to read it again and see the logical connections between the remaining options. \nSince, \"When someone gets angry after getting drunck he usually is a violent person.\" So, \"When someone gets violent, he is likely to throw something.\"\nTherefore, B and E are eliminated since they make sense but don't fit.

Remember that a folding chair is a chair that you can fold and unfold, not a chair that is already folded.\n4. The question is asking where to store a folding chair.\n5. Since the chair has to be stored from being used, it should not be opened for use.\n6. Next ask yourself why it should be stored. Remember that there are various options to store objects such as shelves, wardrobes, cupboards, etc.\n7. If the folding chair will not be used for a long time, it should not be stored with these objects, as that would reduce accessibility.\n8. Therefore, a suitable choice might be the 'garage'.\n9. The 'garage' is located at the side of your house and is generally not as crowded and therefore not obstructed by furniture. This makes it easier to access the chair and use it when required. Hence, the answer to this problem is \u2610C: Garage, hence this is the answer of part A question\n\n10. Next part B, where again you might want to check all the choices to decide what to do with the other folding chairs. 11.

{"idx": 132, "text": "1: Start by reading and analyzing the wording of the question very carefully.\n2. Next, note that the question is about what can result from committing perjury. Based on the question's wording, it is clear that the question is not asking specifically what can happen when a person commits perjury, but more about the likely consequences of lying while giving testimony under oath.\n3. Go through the various given options and eliminate any that are not in line with the context of the question or their relevance to the subject matter.\n4. Remember that committing perjury is lying under oath and an offence punishable by law.\n5. Next, carefully analyze the remaining options: 'Shame', 'Arrest', 'Embarrassment', 'Go to jail', and 'Tension'\n6. The word 'Shame' is a strong and negative emotion, but its meaning in this context may not be relevant if not taken literally, ie it is unlikely that committing perjery results in the recipient feeling shame.\n7. Similarly, the words 'Arrest' and 'Embarrassment' are negative in meaning and related to the criminal context of committing a serious crime like perjury. However, in the context of the question it might not be clear whether the recipient is arrested, or they are simply made to feel embarrassed or ashamed after their perjury is caught and proven, and even if they are arrested for their crime, their punishment might be just a fine or jail term depending upon the seriousness of their offence.\n8. The words 'Go to jail' doesn't mean that this is the only consequence of committing perjury, the criminal law itself might have other consequences like fines.\n9. Therefore it is most logical and precise to eliminate A: shame B: Arrest and C: embarrassment\n10. Similarly, the words D: go to jai is also not enough to provide a complete answer as it does not relate to the question and the action of committing perjery.\n11. Finally, the word Tension is the only correct and complete option as it states the obvious about criminal cases and trials.\nSo the final Answer is E: tension\n\nInput: She had trouble getting to sleep at night because she had an insomnia which forced her to lie in", "answer": "B: arrest"}

In this case, the question asks about the one unique ability of a person that's included in the sentence choices.\n2) Begin by eliminating unnecessary options (C, D). This is because being able to speak two languages and further education does not apply to the question in the sentence.\n3) Next, make a comparison to the two remaining options (A, B), and choose'stand upright'.\n4) The sentence has limited word options, and no other option is as fitting as'stand upright' in the context of the question. \n\nIn contrast, choice C'speak spanish' doesn't fit the context, which means it's unrelated to the question that requires an ability unique to a person; choice D'stand upright', while grammatically correct, is simply not relevant.\n\nSo the final answer to this choice is A: stand upright\n\nInput: I bought a box of eggs and got a flat 10% discount.

Firstly, read the whole question carefully to grasp the information completely and then read the choices to further clarify if they are relevant to the situation.\n2.) In this case, it is possible to use the information on discount and cost to eliminate the options which are clearly incorrect (b).\n3.) By comparing the cost of each choice (A, B) with the discount (10%), choice (a) with the correct cost is A, while choice (b) does not contain the correct cost, which means it is simply incorrect.\n4.)

There are three statements that describe the book, namely:\n3.) -\tThe book has over 800 (or more than 800) pages\n4.) -\tThe book is large and hard.\n5.) -\tThe book's size is under a definite limit\n6.) The book is not an electronic book or e-book\n7.) The book is not a pamphlet.\n8.) The book is not smaller than standard size. This statement is incorrect because books smaller in terms of pages can still be over 800 - they just have less pages; therefore, it is important to consider the number of pages only. Similarly, the book is not over 200 pages because less than 800 pages of a book doesn't make it over 200.  \n9.) So, the book has over 890 (or more than) 899 pages and is not smaller than the standard of 387 pages.\n10.)

Analyze these details to understand the question thoroughly.\n3. Check if the choices provided cover the range of possible places.\n4. Here, C: bakery and D: grocery stores could both be answered as an option to go if one does not feel like baking a single cake but many, as the person wants to bake many different cakes for guests and needs to go to a place that has the capacity to bake many cakes.\n5. However, C: bakering shop is the most specific and clear answer as bakery shops normally produce multiple baked goods such as cookies and birthday cakes.\nSo the final choice is C: bakery \n\nInput: What is the only place to put your clothes after having done the laundry?, Choices:  A) Cave  B) Drawers  C) Bedroom  D) Wardrobe  E) Laundry bin\nOutput: 1: Firstly, read carefully to know what the options mean in the context of the question.\n2: Analyze each option to rule out ones that do not make sense.\n3: Compare the rest of the options and eliminate those that don't seem relevant.\n4: Here, E: Laundry bin is a plausible choice as laundry is an activity that involves clothing, and 'Laundry Bin' as the answer choice could be considered as a place specifically relevant to laundry.\n5: However, the other options can be ruled out such as B : Drawers, as it could mean that drawers can hold clothes as well as clothes being held inside of drawers would not be 'done' or 'folded' and therefore not related to the context of the question, which is about clothes that have been 'done' or 'done' with the wash.\n6: A: Cave is a possible choice but it doesn't fit the context of the question since we know that the clothes in question here aren't going to be in a cave", "answer": "C: bakery"}

Eliminate the choices 'improved performance' and 'empowering' because the question does not ask about what one needs to do to learn hard concepts, but what one needs to be, implying they are not the thing to be required to learn.\n5. It is also possible to eliminate the choice 'copy' because not only is it not correct; it is not the correct answer.\n6. The answer can also be eliminated by understanding what a hard concept is.\n7. Realize that the answer must be related to 'learning hard concepts', i.e. it should enhance, improve, or better a learner's ability to learn them.\n8. Thus, 'intelligent' does not make much sense since intelligence itself is hardly an enhancement to, or improvement of a learner's capability to learn hard concepts.\n9. The answer 'Having more knowledge' is also not correct because the definition of hard concepts is that they involve a lot of knowledge, so the question assumes that all the answer choices don't qualify.\n10.

Notice that the question has different words, in particular: what, people, like, bagels, terms, rich.\n3. Rich is an adjective that means \u2018having a lot of money\u2019, and this relates to bagels because rich people are said to be 'bagel people'.\n4. A bagel is a particular form of bread, with a hole in the centre and boiled rather than baked. In many Western countries especially the United States people consider bagels a delicacy.\n5. Bagel people are very often upper-class and wealthy, making them a different and specific group from others. \n6. Therefore, the choice D: needy refers to people who are poor and needy and is therefore incorrect.\n7. Furthermore, the choice E: poor makes no sense, as poor people do not like \u2018term\u2019, but rather like money (B).\n8. Similarly, the choice C: sleepy has no relevance to the question, as bagel people do not sleep and are thus too active for this option to apply (A).\n9. The choice B: ordinary is also inappropriate as rich people are not ordinary, but unique (F).\n10.

The remaining choices are in fact ways of punishment. A boss may criticise a person for doing a poor job or fire them. The remaining choices are not relevant to our context.\n6.

There are no clues in the question as to who the \"you\" of the \"you went swimming in the...\" is. So, we have to make a reasonable guess and go back and reread the question in the context of our guesses.\n2. We analyze the situation and go through each of the choices.\n3. We see that we are at a beach, we are swimming at sea, the water was beautiful and clear.\n4. Based on this, the most likely action the \"you\" has taken is \"You fell into the ocean\" because this makes the most sense contextually as well as logically.\n5.

A public place is not possible because Space is an out-of-this-world place.\n5. A space car cannot be an answer because 'Spacecraft' must transport space workers from Earth to the Space and back.\n6.

The question is asking for something that tells us you are awake. The opposite of that is being sleepy, but the key word in the question is 'likely'.\n5. This means that we need to search for something that is somewhat related to wakefullness yet makes sense.\n6. This narrows our search to the rest of the options: 'alert' and 'conscious'.\n7. Both of these options make some sense and could be indicative of wakefulness.\n8. The logical choice is B: Alert because, even though being alert does not necessarily mean that you are awake, it is more specific and has a better chance of being related to you being awake.\n9.

After going through the choices, we can eliminate the possibilities that are not relevant.\n4. For example, choices A: solidifying, B: melting, and C: getting cold.\n5. These choices do not make sense in the scenario of water being poured onto the soil, and there is a possibility of rain/water on the soil being solid or melted, and the ground getting colder.\n6. The next steps involve making comparisons between the remaining choices D: feeling cold and E: skin rash.\n7. A feeling of cold or chills may be more common and easily related to the conditions of wetness and cold as water droplets can make the skin feel colder by increasing the surface area of the skin exposed to the air. \n8. On the other hand, skin rashes are not very frequently associated with being wet, chilled, or exposed to dampness.\n9. Therefore, of the two answers remaining, the most appropriate answer is E: skin rash, which represents a less frequent occurrence in such a scenario.\n10. It is possible for the questioner to have asked the question in such a way that skin rashes could be possible.

We can eliminate the following choices: a) Theft - There does not seem to be any theft involved. The senior citizen did not steal something. b) Dishonesty - There doesn't seem any dishonesty at play. The senior citizen was simply not paying for the soap.

In this case, there is no theft or shoplifting involved. We can remove choices b, c, d and e). e) petty thievery - The senior citizen was chargwed with petty thievery.

{"idx": 396, "text": "1: Start by studying the question carefully and try grasping the essence of the wording, where a key hint in the question is in the option 'running away' which indicates that it relates to a form of movement and escape.\n2: Realize that this question is looking for motivating goals or objectives for exercises such as jogging, especially those that would motivate individuals to pursue such activities.\n3: Eliminate options 'heavy breathing', as this would be a side effect of exercising and not the primary goal.\n4: The next elimination step is to compare the remaining options: feeling proud, losing weight, running away.\n5: The first of these, feeling proud, is unlikely the desired outcome of doing jogging since it is an end result, rather than a process.\n6: Next, consider the option of losing weight. While losing weight is a possible positive result of exercises or jogging, it should be considered the by-product, rather than a process one would want to experience while doing so, given that losing weight could be an arduous process with many side effects (which doesn't necessarily mean negative ones, as it could make one feel good and happy about changing for the better).\n7: The final elimination step is to look at  running away, which is a direct result of one's actions while doing exercises which might seem like the opposite of the desired result of exercising. Furthermore, the use of the word 'away' indicates a state of disappearance, and not movement, which is a conflicting statement as running is a mode of movement.\n8: Therefore, the correct answer choice must be a goal or process that one would want to pursue while doing exercising because it would encourage engagement in exercise.\n9: The answer choices are now reduced to feeling pride and losing weight.  Since losing weight is too abstract and cannot be considered an experience of a process, the choice that must be selected is feeling proud.\n10: Therefore, the most suitable answer choice for a question asking for the primary motivation for exercises is feeling proud.\nSo the final  answer is E: feel proud\n\nInput: You know you have to take your kid to the dentist but don't feel like going, what excuses can you make?

{"idx": 464, "text": "1) Start by reading and understanding what the question is asking. Since we have a lot of options, we need to go in chronological order with our reasoning based on some logical thinking.\n2) We first need to eliminate the options that make no sense. For example:\n\n- The word'sale' doesn't make any sense as it is an adverb and needs a noun to go along.   \n- Second, eliminate the options that do not make logical sense. For \nexample:\n\n- we cannot find large pieces of paper inside a cabinet/suitcase (as their sizes do not match).\n- Additionally, the word'sale' does not make any sense as it can't be found in any of the given choices.\n- We can also eliminate 'office supply store' as the word'sale'does not make sense, and'suitcase' and 'cabinet' do not make sense as a place to find large pieces of paper.\n- This leaves us with only two options, namely, 'artist's studio' or 'computer printer'. The word'studio' stands for a place where an artist works. Since the writer talks about large pieces of paper, which can only be bought in bundles hence they are not meant for sale.\n- So the most logical answer is 'Artist's studio', as it refers to a place (in this case an artist's studio) where one can find large \nnon-saleable pieces of paper.  \nSo the final answer here is E: artist's studios.\n\nInput:Where would an artist find large non-saleable pieces? Choices: \n\nA: artist's studio B: computer printer C : cabinet D: office supply store  \n\n\nOutput:1. Firstly, consider the question. If something is non-saleable, then it means it is not for sale at all, and if it is not for sale, then it's not in sale, right? So firstly eliminate 'computer printers'.\n\n2. Now that we know an artist's studio is the best option, the only place where an artist can find papers, which are not sold.

Since the central ideas are:\n- \"avoiding embarrassment\" and \"avoiding the hassle.\"\n4) A) Taking a risk is out of the consideration. Because \"taking a risk\" is not related to the meaning of the \"avoiding embarrasesment.\" In the other hand, \"avoiding embarrasment is associated to the situation where the roommate puts down the towel in front of other people because it is the best alternative because some people may say that is an uncomfortable situation to hear something bad about them (for example: he didn\u2019t find the washroom).", "answer": "D: injuries"}

Idle can refer to various things, but it doesn't seem to be relevant in this context.  This leaves us with three choices 'go where?

While both of these options are grammatically correct and make sense, 'these two' is ambiguous, as it could be referring to any two jewelry carrying methods.\n6.

We know that the choices B, D, and E do not fit because those places do not store anything related to shopping bags or shopping.\n3. The term'seats' in the sentence suggests that the car has seats, and it is not very likely that they are empty. So the choice for D does not fit either.\n4. In a retail store, the shopping bags would be taken care of by someone else, not by the shopper, and thus choice A is also eliminated.\n5. Therefore, the only choice that fits is choice E, where we store things at home.\n6. So the final answer is E Store it at home.\n\n### This is all for the first part of the mock test.", "answer": "C: car trunk"}
{"idx": 592, "text": "1) Start by reading the question. Notice that it is asking 'When you are expressing...', this means that you are to give an action.\n2) Identify the context: it says that you are expressing yourself, this can lead us to reason what a person might express about. A possible answer could be \"I am hurt\" or \"I am angry\". However, these answers are not consistent with the context of getting a bruise.\n3) The given answers seem to be suitable as they match the general tone of the question. Examine them by giving them a closer look.\n4) 'Self-pity' seems like something that a bruised person might express.\n5) In fact, there are many things that you could do that would express self-pity such as: \"I don't want to live\", \"I wish I hadn't gotten a bruise\"\n6) 'Communication' also fits.\n7) A possible answer could be: '\"I think the bruise will start to lighten tomorrow so that is something to look forward to.\"'. These reasons are sufficient to express both communication and self-pity.\n8) You can also examine the two given answers by asking yourself: would an injured person who is expressing himself say this?\n    \n9) So, the answer to the question is: ___ A: Self-pity\n10) If you think this is not the best answer, you can try another answer. However, it is possible that the best answer is A: Self-pitu.\nSo there is the final answer is A: self-pity\n\nInput:Why does the king of England wear a crown at coronation?

A king would not wear a hat every day, the crown looks fancy and is unique. E. His favorite hat is what?", "answer": "D: pain"}
{"idx": 596, "text": "1 start by trying to understand what all the different choices really mean and if they could apply to speech therapists.\n2. When analysing all the choices above, it seems that all but the final two are not able to be applied to speech therapists, so that means the choices will be eliminated.\n3. Now, what we're left with to analyse is believe in god and give speeches.\n4. Believe in god does not seem to be related to therapists, whereas giving speeches does. \n5. This one of the final choices therefore seems more suitable for the answer. \n6. Since our answer is already narrowed down to give speeches, we can look again at the other choices and see if there is anything else that we could deduce from them to form better the answer. \n7. When looking at the other remaining choice given, we notice that complete sentences and build houses have a relation with giving speeches and this could lead us to the correct answer as the answer could be D: GIVE SPEECHES that completes the sentence\n8. Therefore, when all these factors are taken into consideration, we form the correct answer according to the provided information.\nSo the final sentence is GIVE SPEE\n\nInput: He was trying to learn more about the human body, which resource would be suitable for him?

Comparing the option 'learn' with the other choices, where we can see that 'learn' doesn't make sense as walking into a business is only the beginning of learning in the eyes of the business.\n5. Therefore, 'learn' is not suitable, hence, it needs not be considered further.\n6. Next, do the same to 'hope for peace', because it's irrelevant to the action and also doesn't make sense in this context.\n7.

To fix a chipped tooth, the tooth has to be fixed with a filling. \n5. So the final answer would be D: filling.\nSo the final choice would be D: filling\n\nInput: There was some good feedback from people who ate the apple, what did they write in their diary? Choices: A : they didn't write anything B: they filled in the diary C: they left the apple D: they ate the apple E: they threw the apple away\nOutput: 1: Check out the given choices and eliminate options the don't make any logical sense.\n2. Consider people who eat the apple and feel bad about the apple and then throw it away, then there are 3 options left.\n3. The action of making diary fills could not be related to the action of throwing away the apple at all.\n4. Option 'throw it away' can not happen before a people write anything in the diary, because they throw the apple first.

The choices'restaurant', 'casserole', 'root cellar', and 'pantry' have nothing to do with potatoes.\n3. A potato has to be cooked, so 'casserole' won't work either.\n4. We have to find out if there are any other places where you might find a potato.\n5. When looking for a potato, James is in his apartment kitchen and the only other places are his pockets or a pantry but pockets don't make sense because he can get his pockets from the supermarket, and the question doesn't say that James went to a supermarket.\n6. The only place left is the pantry because James is cooking a stew in his kitchen, and the pantry where he might have potato is his own pantry.\n7. Therefore the most suitable choice is E: pantry. So the final answer is E) Pantry\n\nInput:I needed to find out how the city got its name, where should I start?

{"idx": 620, "text": "1) Read the question, note to consider each option individually and to eliminate any that seem unreasonable. For example, 'dropping to zero' is unreasonable, as the sun does not fall out of the sky.\n2) Next, eliminate answer choices such as 'heat up' since they are self-contradictory and therefore cannot be correct.\n3) Next, consider each answer choice independently and determine which has the best grammatical structure and logical meaning.\n4) Consider each remaining choice in turn. 'cool down' is a plausilble choice, but it does not contain the right verb form. 'It was really beginning to cool down' is more appropriate since the sun is beginning to 'cool down'.\n5) The correct choice 'It was really beginning [to] cool down' has the best grammatcal structure and meaning.\n6) Therefore, the correct answer option is E: It was really beginning to cool D: dropping quickly\nSo the final answer Cool Down.\n\nInput: After hearing the results, the candidate tried again to answer the same question in another way, did he do it?

The choice'smile' is quite vague. It could mean different things, such as either: A. expressing appreciation through a facial gesture or B. just being happy.\n6. So we can eliminate'smile' as well.\n7. Remaining choices are: 'looking for' and'show appreciaton'.\n8. We need to make a comparison between both the choices.\n9. We can eliminate 'looking for' as 'looking for' means that one is searching for the person or the thing.\n10.

Which of the following is the most suitable choice in this respect?\n4. Choices E and D do not work well because they are both negative descriptions, fragile is too vague to be an apt response and weak laxative is simply impossible; a laxative cannot be strong or weak. This leaves B, C and A as possible choices.\n5. Examine the second part of the question closely. A strong laxative must keep you regular; cakes and strong women do not help keep your bowel movement regular so they cannot be chosen as an appropriate answer.\n6. A cake is not liquid and even though a strong woman may be strong and therefore potentially able to help you regulate your bowel movement, it does not necessarily refer to your particular bowel movement, and therefore is not specific enough to be an appropriate answer.\n7. So this leaves us to answer A: regular movements, and B: cakes, which is not an appropriate answer.\nSo the final Answer is C: Regular\n\nInput: The doctor instructed the patient to drink plenty of juice to aid recovery, which kind of juice should you choose?

Further examination of D, E: E is too open-ended as chatting with friends is not the only factor that would make it fun.

Which of the following are logical inferences?\n\nInput:1. The boy was eating when I went to the store.\n2. Someone called me.\n3. Therefore, the call was most likely about the dinner plans.\nOutput: 10. Firstly note the key phrases in the question.\n2. Then make an assumption that these key phrases are logical when answered using yes or no.\n3. The most correct answer for the third statement is that the call was most likely not about the dinner plans(C) as the sentence assumes the boy was eating when the call came but the call may come about something other than the dinner plans.\nSo the correct answer is D: Not about the dinner plans. \n\n\n#### B.

Group together is about a group; to meet someone in that group, you generally face them, and enjoy them is also about group activities. It is about enjoying being with others in a group, and so on.\n4. Realise that B: Believe in God, C: Pay Bills, and E: Face each other are not relevant to the question.\n5. Look more specifically at the two options B: Believe in god and D: Enjoy together.\n6. There is not much difference between Believe and God.  God can be understood by a spiritual belief or a religious belief. In any case, it\u2019s a similar concept and God can be an external entity or an internal God. One can still believe in God even without being physically present in the same space.\n7. On the other hand, Enjoying together is talking about a group. Enjoying each other while being in the same group or physically together. This refers to real life social interaction as it is more of doing something together such as attending a concert or watching a sports event. There is no element of spirituality.\n8. In conclusion, the two choices that would not be a suitable answer for the question are B: believe in god and D: enjoy themselves because they lack the relevant context to meet with others.\n9.

{"idx": 5, "text": "11. Firstly, the most logical and specific answer is 'D: story books', since the fox was looking for a natural area which should consist of plenty of trees and vegetation. This information provides a logical reason of why the fox might be looking for'story books'.\n2. This is more about context and logic.\n3. The obvious choice to start with is probably option A: 'pretty flowers'.\n4. This seems to be a reasonable answer but it is also logical to eliminate this option for the following reason.\n5. A fox is an animal and probably likes flowers as we have all seen these animals eating from various flower gardens previously.\n6. However, if you read this sentence carefully, you will see that there is a word in it, which stands out and is a big clue to answer the question: 'THE FOX'. This means the fox was not just any fox, but a particular fox. So maybe it was carrying messages from a particular place as foxes are able to travel long distances. This means this fox was walking long distances. This means that it is quite possible that the fox was looking to find a hen house because hens are very commonly found on farms and farming is quite popular in forests like this.\n7. There's another possible reason which may have given this fox the idea of walking long distances to a forest which could provide him with plenty of natural vegetation to find the type of flowers which he is actually looking for.\n8. Therefore, our first choice of 'pretty flowers' is a bit inadequate because of some lack of logical information.\n9. Now the second choice we looked at 'B: hen house', which is the reason suggested in the first explanation given above about the fox's journey. However, even though this is a logical answer, the explanation for it has lacked much specificity about the type of nature the fox finds and how he found it.\n10. Therefore, the most specific and logical answer, which also has a high level of specificity, and is the only one with both logical and specificity information is:\nthe fox was looking for story books, and finally the answer is 'the fox was looking'.\nSo the final answer was 'D: story books'\n\n### Instruction:Write a small program that gets a number, then prints its even numbers", "answer": "C: natural habitat"}
{"idx": 9, "text": "1) Firstly, read the question carefully and try extracting the meaning of the words 'absorb extra ink' and 'fountain pen'.\n2) A fountain pen is a particular kind of pen with ink stored in a reservoir of the pen itself. In the past, pens could be refilled by dipping the tip in an inkwell for replenishing.\n3) When an inkwell becomes full, ink will overflow due to gravity on to other things nearby, hence not spilling all over the place.\n4) But ink from a faucet is more finely dispersed, which then means the ink does not overflow but stays in the pen.\n5) To prevent the ink that overflows from the fountain pen from staining clothes and spreading, a solution to the problem was to soak a shirt into an inkwell so that the extra ink can be absorbed and contained within the shirt.\n6) Ink is then stored in a bottle, not a well.\n7) Another way to get rid of excess ink in a fountain pen is to soak a blotter, which is made of wood pulp, and place it atop the paper.\n8) Then ink absorbs into the wood pulp and can then be picked up by the side of the blotter.\n9) If an inkwell and a blotter cannot be found to prevent ink from overflowing and spreading, another place to store the extra ink would be in the pocket of a calligrapher' s hand.\n10) The pocket would be made from a fabric that is finer than those of shirts and blotters as to allow ink to dry.\n11) Finally, ink is dried when not in use, and so does not need extra storage space.\n12) 'Desk Drawer' is irrelevant, and 'Calligrapher's Hand' doesn't make sense at all.", "answer": "E: blotter"}

Realize what the problem is, specifically that it is asking the name of the first American president.\n2. Go over the various choices and evaluate their feasibility.\n3. 'John Quincy Adams' seems an unlikely answer as it is not an American name so it may represent a typo or some sort of mistake.\n4.  'William Henry Harrison' is a plausibly American name. However, in 1855 there would be no way the question would ask who was the first American president as it would have been impossible since there were 31+ states at the time at the time of question.\n5. Zachary Taylor was the president of the United States during the Civil War (1860-1865), so this seems rather unlikely to be the right answer as the question only asks for the first American president. Therefore, 'William Henry Harrison', 'John Tyler', and 'Andrew Jackson' are all valid choices.\n6.

The same analysis can be done for the rest of the choice, with Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday being immediately eliminated. This is because they are not considered normal sale days and if you were to look for a sale on Black Friday you wouldn't expect to find sale priced items before or after the actual day.\n9.

{"idx": 117, "text": "The meaning of the sentence is to identify whom to call on when someone is in need.\n \n \n \n\n\n\nThe question asks us, 'Whom should I call when I need a favour?' or 'Who can I turn to when I am having some issues in my life?'\n\nTo give an in-depth analysis, the question poses the need for caring. In our lives, some people in our life care about us, and some do not.\n\nSo, in this question, by caring, what does it mean? Let's look at the various options.\n\n'Artichoke' is an animal that you eat. It is not caring. You can't call it to help you. So, we exclude it from the answer.\n\nNext possible choices to look at are'species' or 'all mammals'. We look at different species.\n\nSpecies is defined as the group of animals that can produce offsprings. One could imagine that a particular species may or may not exhibit caring behaviour towards the other species. Therefore, we exclude it.\n\nNow, all mammals refers to animals of the same physical structure, as defined by anatomy, that produce milk and breasts to feed their young.\n\nThe question has an intent of showing caring towards other members of the society. So, although all mammals share the physical traits, they may not necessarily have emotions like caring as part of their physical trait.\n\nNow to the last remaining choice- 'All humans'.\nLet's see why this is a possible answer.\n\nLet's read what the question said: Who is likely to have a caring heart.\n\nThe word likely indicates that the person may behave in a certain way, may act a little different and may have some characteristics of caring.\nTo prove this, we can take the example of a single parent trying to bring up her child alone.\nShe may seem cold and a very uncaring person, but in essence- she is a 100 times more caring than others because she tries her best to bring up her child in a difficult situation. She cares despite the fact that she is often criticized and looked down for being single and having no male child.\nShe does her best and that is caring.

The choices in the question may seem confusing but we can eliminate choices which sound more scientific and sound more complicated.\n3. For example, the choice A'slow motion' can sound a bit scientific and can be hard to understand.\n4. On the other hand, the choices seem more scientific and hard to understand are D'slow motion', and C 'fast motion'.\n5. Now, the remaining choice D'slow motion could also seem scientific and hard to understand.  \n6. So one needs to break down the word'slow' and analyse what it means.\n7. 'Slow' means the same as'slowly' or 'in a slow way' or 'at a slow speed'.\n8. Also,'stop' means to end or not continue an action so it means stop something from being done.\n9. Therefore, 'to stop a heart from beathing means to stop it from beating'.\n10. The remaining choice B 'faster motion' is grammatically incorrect.\n11.

Next, analyze 'burlap sack'. Although 'burlap' is a material, its use is limited to sacks because it's a fabric.\n8. 'Hot country', although a fitting description for a snake, is not what a'smart alec' would call a place where he'd hidden a snake. \n9. The phrase 'purse' refers to a hand bag.  \n10.

The phrase'smart alex', although not specific in relation to the context of this question, appears to be a more general description of a snake that is not as specific as 'burlap sack' does.\n12. This means that there is more than one suitable answer to choose from. Therefore, the answer is either 'A' or 'D'.\n13. The option 'A' has a slightly more fitting description, 'deep in his' compared to 'deep in her pet shops'.\n14. 'His' can be used here, instead of 'her's' because although the latter option is more suitable in a different context, 'deep in her pet shop' refers to a female.\n15. The difference in the terms used in these two sentences is, therefore, minor and can only make a difference in one of the options. \n16.

The front door is not the only entrance to a house; there are other ways too. Moreover, it is a public place.\n4. A suitcase in common usage refers to a hard-top suitcase. There is some possibility of using suitcases for delivering letters.\n5. If we can deliver a letter through the bowl, it would not be necessary to use letters at all and then where is the question coming from?\n6. Post offices exist for people to post letters and they are open every day; we could use them any day or all day. Hence it doesn't make sense to say that letters are sometimes delivered through them.\n7. Therefore to summarize, the choices of mailbox, front door, and post office are not valid and suitable, hence C: front door is out of the picture.\n8. Check the remaining choices in ascending order of logical possibility.\n9. Let's compare D: bowl and E: post office.\n10. 'bowl' can very well be used for delivering letters if there is a specific person to deliver those letters.\n11. Post offices exist for everyone; anyone can use them. Therefore, to say that letters are delivered here or there is not practical.\n12.

'Get back to' is ambiguous so can mean 'to return to something that was previously used for a purpose' as in'return to your work routine'\n6. 'Your work routine' is a phrase that does not sound like it has anything to do with boredom.\n7. Therefore look for an answer that can be used in response to when you tell your boss you're bored and it sounds related to a response to boredom.\n8. When you tell them you're bored, they may instruct you to 'fiddle' to keep yourself busy. \n9. 'Fiddle' can be used to describe many different activities such as playing musical instruments or using your hands to do something quickly.\n10. 'Dream' and 'watch film' sound unrelated to boredom and may take a long time to do.\n11. 'See new' as a suggestion from your boss' may sound more related to boredom. \n12. 'Get back to work' sounds like a suggestion that you return to your work.\n13. 'Get back to your work routine' sounds more practical and like it's used to deal with boredom.

This is a question that can be answered by thinking logically about what would cause the person to have an action of'make bread'.\n5. The choice'make bread' is more logical than \"have lunch\" because a person may not have the means or ingredients for \"make lunch\" or it would be a waste of food if the person was already going to work or shopping during lunchtime. \n6. Therefore, the most appropriate answer given the context is \"make bread\", because it makes more sense that a person would be in a situation of hunger and hence, make bread.\n7. The answer is C: Make Bread. So the final answer is C: make bread.", "answer": "D: have lunch"}

The options suggest that US citizens have to participate in the election and can only do so if there are no more than one option that can be used to answer the question: A and B. Choice 1 and Choice 2 are mutually exclusive and in terms of logic, do not make sense.\n3. Choice 3, Choice 4 and Choice 5 can be eliminated because the question is a reasoning logic question, not a reasoning memory question.\n4.

Analyze which choice makes sense in a context, and which choice does not.\n6. In this case, if he looked in a shelf it wouldn't make sense.  Shelf is a big place to search for pencils, and it doesn't really make sense to look in a shelf just to find more pencils.  However, penzils made in a cup or pencil case do make sense.\n7. The term 'desk drawer' can also make sense.  Pencils could be placed in a drawer, and if he was using a single desk there was a chance he did not look in a shelf.\n8. Therefore, we can eliminate four choices as they do not make sense, so far we only have two left.\n9. Analyse which choice makes more sense in a context and which choice does not: the desk drawer was more likely as he could have been using a single desk with some pencils in it.  This was not the case when the shelf was considered.\n10.

This way, we start with a reduced list.\n4) These are the wrong answers, and the reason why they should be eliminated are as follows:\n      B: This word is not used commonly when talking about maps so this can not be the answer.\n      D: This does not make any sense because scale does not have any sense if we talk about a map.\n      E: this has scale at the end, but scale is not a plural form, so this question is incorrect.\n5) If we start with these eliminated answers, then we are left with three choices. A (map is an informational device), C (Scale on a map) and F (scale on a map).\n6) The answer should either be A or C. The phrase \"informational device\" hints towards a map, and a map is used for representing geographical information.\n7) So, the answer should be either A: \"A map is an informational (geological) device\" or C: \"A scale on a map\".\n8) Now that we have the right answer, it remains for choosing the precise one as it is mentioned in the \"answer choices\" section of the question", "answer": "E: mississippi"}

Choices: 1 kg 10 grams  2 kg 10 gr 2 kg 11 grams A: yes B: no\nOutput:  1. Start by reading and understanding the question and the options.\n\n2. Realize that the ratio of quantities of apples and pear is specified. As such this may be written as:\n\n100 \u200b c  = 600 \u200b d \n2\n\n3. Therefore we can calculate:\n\n10 ** 100 \u200b+ \u200b60** 600 \u2248 1200g\nSo when the ratio is equal to 2000g the correct answer is A: yes, but not B: no.\n\nInput: I had 5 apples and 8 bananas. 1 apple=70g.

{"idx": 361, "text": "1: Firstly, understand the structure of the answer choices and the question wording, namely the question is \"people\" like to what?\n2.

Next, eliminate choices from the list which are not ongoing actions such as 'believe in god', 'watch movies', and \"eat corn'.\n4.

The word 'frustration' is an emotion associated with something that does not go well, and therefore does not belong in a question about working with wood.\n4. Look at the words that belong in a sentence such as being paid, losing money and frustration.\n5. The word that contradicts the other words has to be work with wood.

Rock band refers to a performance of mostly rock music performed by a group. Hence, option D: Rock band is completely irrelevant.\n4.

Firstly, read the five options carefully and note the possible types of mountains that they could be, for example Denali is a volcano in Alaska.\n3.) To answer which mountain is the tallest, we need to be aware whether the choices give us the information on the mountain's altitude to reach such height or the information is in terms of its base. We also need to bear in mind the units, for example'meters'.\n4. For example, if one of the answers is 'Metropolis mountain' with a height of 4015 meters, the altitude information is in meters and it would be clear that the mountain is the tallest.\n\n5. However, if the same answer of Metropolis Mountain has a height of 238 meters of base, this means the answer is the wrong one because the base of the mountain is not 4015m.\n\n6. However, if the answer is a volcano with a height of 6174m, it will be evident that is Metropolitan Mountain or Mount Everest ( 8848 m ), since only they can reach this altitude because the remaining options have heights below 4000m.\n\n7. Therefore, in general, the tallest option will always be on the left and have a base that is greater than 4000 so the height will be above 8000.\n8.

Then, consider the type of specificity present in the answer; a list of European countries, or an answer that is more specific.\n5.  In this context the correct answer is 3. A 'Country' is more likely to be a larger mass of land/region/region than an individual state or individual country. By 4th grade standard, the United States is considered one country, not several countries. Since the answer does not specifically refer to a state, or county, the choice of state or county is also incorrect.\n6.  The choice of 'Idaho' could be the specificity desired, but it is a region in the Western (North-Western) United States. According to 4th grade standard and the information given in the question,  Idaho must be ruled out.\n7.

However, when two people compete against each other, the outcome of the match should be fair and determined by the strength and skills of each player. Therefore, \"resentment\" does not apply to spectators in a sporting event either.\n9) The term \"winning or losing\" is not applicable, because spectators don't care about who wins or loses the event.\n10) Lastly, the term \"one winner\" is not correct either, because they would have to determine which of the teams would be the \"one winner\" and that would not make sense.\n11) Therefore, the option which does not make any sense is A: envy and the correct answer is C: winning or losing.\nSo the final the answer is C: winning and losing\n\nInput: If you want to see all the results of the election, which of the following is a good place to visit?

A 'Sadness' is a negative form of happiness, so we can eliminate Sadness as an incorrect response.\n6. This leaves'miser' and' play time' as logical answers.\n7.

If the books you need are not available in the library, then the best place to look is in a store that sells books.\n4. Bookstores are not free and require payment, which is one of their main reasons for being profitable businesses\n5. The other reason to visit a bookstore is that one is able to find new books in their stores, whereas you cannot do so in libraries\n6. Since the question does not specify any preferences from the choice of the user, we can choose either of these answers without any bias.\n7. But, it is important to notice that the bookstore we're talking about must be a large collection of books and not a small store.\n8.

Scan all the the choices and eliminate those which do not make any sense on the surface, like 'board vessels' which doesn't make sense to police as boarding vessels is the job of the navy, not the police.\n3. Elimination of choices: 'Traffic', 'Vessels', 'drugs'. All of them do not have anything to do with the Police. Hence, we can eliminate these choices from the answer.\n4. Make a comparison between the remaining choices: 'Direct Traffic', 'Help People' and 'Armed Themselves'.\n5. We have two choices remaining and need to compare between what the Police do and what the other two choices mean.\n6. 'Direct traffic' indicates that the Police direct the traffic flow and the direction of traffic. Hence, it is not correct for the Police.\n7. 'Help People' seems to be a more sensible choice, but the statement doesn't state what the Police also do, so we need to find out if it is also correct.\n8. Since 'Help People' and what police do are both contradictory and one of them would contradict the other, then there must be some truth to the word 'only'.\n9. Hence, by negating the only part, we can arrive at a new statement that is true, which eliminates the other choice because we know the Police do not help people only, based on our previous observation.\n10. Therefore, the Police do more things than just helping people and are true since we already know that by negating the only. Hence, the correct answer is E: help people.\n\nInput: This was the hardest work question. Do you know how I managed to pass?

The best way to do this is to restate it in your own words, and then answer it yourself.\n2) In this problem you have to determine what 'you' do in a particular situation so your answer and not a general, abstract answer.\n3) The problem will probably include a word, phrase, or sentence that does not fit its category and needs to be excluded or eliminated as an answer. In this problem you are being asked to choose the one item that should not be exposed to the sun for longer periods of time.\n4) Elimination is a common and powerful technique when dealing with problems such as this, and can be applied to all types of problems in a logical and efficient manner.\n5) Make a list of all the nouns or 'things' in the problem and then eliminate the ones you know should be eliminated. For example, a hat is not to be used to protect from the sun so you know it will not be your answer.\n6) Now that you know hat is not an option that should be used to protect your skin from the sun, you can move on to the next one, the'sock'.\n7) In most problems when elimination has gone this far, you can easily eliminate three of the four remaining options. For example, by eliminating hat and sock you have 4 possible options left; coat, sweater, helmet, and lastly, hat.\n8) Finally select your answer.\n9) The answer should be an item you wear on your body (not your hair) every time you go outside to protect your skin from overexposure to the sun.\n\nInput: A bookshop has 50 books, each of which has only", "answer": "B: binder"}

The choices are A-E represent a typical manufacturing facility found in a grocery store, a factory, a school, an airplane or a band.\n5. As you can see, choices C and F do not relate to manufacturing.\n6. Therefore, we can eliminated choices C and F.\n7. Option A represents a factory, which is a manufacturing facility.\n8. Option E represents an airplane, so the other two options that remain are B and D,\n9. In the given choices we can identify the school and the factory.  But do these two words have any similarity?\n10. Now we have to find out whether school can be considered a manufacturing facility. Schools are not generally associated with manufacturing or production, and the use of the word \"expect\" in the question also supports this view.  Therefore, \"a school\" does not fit the question.\n11. Hence, we can narrow down the options to B and D.\n12. The word \"band\" here does not suggest manufacturing, so we can eliminate it.\n13. Now let's check out the options B and D.\n(1) The word \"grocer\" indicates grocery store. This store usually has various items like food, cosmetics, kitchen items etc. Now, it is known \"bunch of people do the job of making product in a factory.\"\nTherefore, the option \"grocer\" does not match the information \"the manufacturing of the item\".\n(2) \"factory\" means we can make manufacturing products.\n(3) \"the aircraft\" does not mean manufacturing products.\nHence, the most important answer is D: a factory\n\n\nInput:  How can I learn the best way to perform a task?

Option `b`, however, is about the type of food that is eaten by ungulates, which could be the type of animal that James was eating, so eliminating these as incorrect answers.\n\n3) Look at the remaining options. The word `kill` could be interpreted as a term that refers to both people and animals. However, it makes no sense that James was firing on and killing people or that someone's animal died from fire. A person, however, is not a bomb or `a bomber` and James would not be firing on or killing people from a distance. Therefore, eliminate this as an incorrect answer.\n\n4) In the end, a person and animal are both subjects but `kill people` is ambiguous and not correct. The word `kill people` can be interpreted to mean James is firing on people to kill them, so this is also incorrect. It also doesn't make sense that James would be shooting his animal for people.

In this case, the action listed in the choices is 'opening eyes', because we only know the character is still lying down, which means his or her eyes are still closed.\n6. This eliminates the incorrect options 'thank god' and 'feel anger'.\n7. We are required to choose between 'drink tea' and 'open eyes'.\n8. Because when we wake up, we're often groggy and drowsy, so we could easily think about drinking some tea to wake ourselves up.\n9. In this case, we can choose 'drink tea', since the most logical action for someone who wakes up is to drink tea. So the option is C: Open eyes.\nSo the final answers is C: Open eyes\n\nInput: What can a group of elephants do? Choices: 1.

Bikes are too small to carry multiple (people).\n4. Start eliminating answers:\n    - Banks - banks are the targeted institutions.\n    - Police - police are the ones robbing the banks.\n    - City - there aren't many police stations.\n   - Bank - the bank being robbed can be any bank.\n    - Police station - if we know the specific police station robbed, then the number of officers present will be restricted to those station officers, making it easier to eliminate answer possibilities.\n5. Banks and police stations - police stations may have a limited number of officers.\n6. Consider the wording of the question - 'the police' use to get to 'the criminals'.\n   - The plural verb 'use' indicates that the bank robbers are multiple.\n   - 'The criminals' refers to'multiple people'.\n7.

This question can be tricky, so it is important to eliminate and cross out two options at most to prevent reaching a wrong conclusion.\n8. The fact that a village, a village and the village are all spelled differently might confuse you and cause you to cross out the village because the village can be a village. This is why it is advised to cross out one and only option at the most.\n9. The given option is Africa, but this word does not follow the pattern, it only includes the consonants AV, which is incorrect.\n10. Ohio is a region, but it starts with a consonant, so this option will not be the answer either since a region does not have a consonant as it's the beginning of a word.\n11. Big city is the first choice that we cross out logically since the opposite is the opposite of a city.\n12. Tribe is the second option that we cross out logicallly since it is a term related to a group of people, so it does not fit the logic of the sentence, or, better, the meaning of the opposite.\n13.

The question talks about a collection of atoms called molecules making up everything that can be held in our hands, which indicates that it is about our body, the things that we hold in our hands.\n2) Then, eliminate all options other than \"Hands\" and \"Feet\". Mythical creatures like unicorns, which appear in various mythologies, do not exist in our world, so they are not included in this question.\n3) Furthermore, a molecule is a component of an atom. A molecule is made of chemical elements which are held together by chemicals bonds. Therefore, \"Molecules\" cannot represent the answer.\n4) We can also eliminate both \"Air\" and \"Everything\", as the question explicitly mentioned we can hold in our hands, therefore, \"air\" cannot be considered here, and anything means anything.\n5) \"Atoms\" are the fundamental units of any matter. For example, hydrogen is an atomic element, and a water molecule is formed by two atoms of hydrogen. Therefore, the answer can only be \"Hands\" or \"Feet\"\n6) Lastly, \"Hands\" can be the answer as a person holds the thing in his/her hands and has control over it.\nSo the final answe is Hands\n\nInput:My sister has 8 children who are all at different what?

Hotels is a plural form while a reception area is a place containing receptionists, who are singular.\n5. Similarly, office buildings and motels are not appropriate as they do not contain reception areas.\n6. In contrast, a law firm can contain a reception area, so this option is ruled out.\n7. Therefore the remaining logical option is a hall, which may be in a variety of places that don't necessarily have a reception area. The option E: office building  is eliminated as it cannot contain a reception area.\n8.

Also, a 'bus stop' isn't the same thing as a bus station, and the question gives away that it is asking about the former.\n5. 'School' is a place that people may or may not be familiar with, and so is out of the context of the question that demands a specific location.\n6.

From our research, we find that 'awaking' is used to describe someone being woken up from sleep by an external object and then awaking, or 'waking up is defined as the process by which one becomes fully conscious and alert.\n4. Therefore, we move on to examining the options to the question.\n5. We see that each of the given options seems to be suitable to explain what is happening to Bill but we would need more information on the given variables to give a definite answer.\n6. Thus, we rule out options A-C because they don\u2019t provide enough information that explains the action of 'awaking' clearly.\n7. However D is a good candidate, as it tells us that Bill is opening his eyes after being awoken.\n8. But E is even better, and it clearly tells us the variable of eyes opening.\n9. Finally, after comparing both options, and realizing that E provides the most specific information, the answer is E.\nSo the final correct answer is E: Eyes Opening\n\nInput: You are searching for a word to describe the opposite of a 'perfectionist'.

After reading the whole question, we can see that the question is about the animals that will happen if the wild animals get touched by humans.\n4. Eliminate the three choices that do not directly indicate something that happens with the animals.\n\n5. The two choices we're left with are 'feel pain' and 'keep alive'.\n6. 'Feel pain' is a plausibly right answer, and it is supported by the statement in the second half of the question (the wild animals could feel pain...)\n7. But we should not forget that the goal of the exercise is to find all potential words and phrases we could use for 'keep the wild animals alive'.\n8. The words 'keep alive', however, do not appear exactly in the question text.\n9. We must use paraphrasing and think of similar words (or expressions) that could be used to convey the meaning of 'keep alive'.\n10. A possible way to paraphrase \"keep alive\" could be \"to keep somebody/something alive\", so \"could keep\" makes sense.\n11. We can further support \"could keep\" by the fact that it also appears in the question at the beginning (... could keep alive).\n12. Our answer could be something like \"could keep something (alive).\"\n13. But we must choose it from the given options.\n14. The two remaining options in the question are \"keep alive\" and \"feel pain\".\n15. As \"feel pain\" can be paraphrased to \"felt pain\", the chosen phrase \"could keep/feel pain\" is correct.\n16.

Which of the choices could be good for me? Choices:  - A: medium B: tight C: small D: fit perfectly E: large\nOutput: 1st to have a solution to this problem, we must first understand the question.\n2nd, the question is asking about hat types that I like, but I prefer one specific choice: medium.\n3rd, eliminate choices C, D, & E as an answer by the fact of the questions. We know from the choices that C:small, D:fit perfectly and E:large are all incorrect. So now it only narrows the choices to A: medium, B:tight and we can eliminate B:tight simply based on the word fit, and the fact that B:tight indicates that there is a problem with the hat.\n4th, we can choose A: medium as it is the only selection that is left.\nSo the final and only answer to the question is A:medium.\n\nInput: John got invited to a party, he will meet his friends there.

Choices: a. 1 5 b. 6 7\t c. 5 10\td. 9 5 e. 8 2\nOutput: From the options, we can see that 11 is not at the second position, hence it is not 11.\nSimilarly, we also analyze 11 does not come immediately after 10. Moreover, we also see that 11 does not match the position after 9. And most importantly, 11 does not fit the position after 7 because 11 should not be after 7 as 7 is the last number until 11 and therefore, it is not 1 5 nor 1 1 5 because the number 11 did not come after 1.\nThis leaves us with b and c. However, 1 5 is not a number and so b is eliminated and then only, option c remains because the number is correct but just not in the right quantity.\nSo the answer for this question is c.\n\nInput: Are you married?\t Choices:\t a.

The given context suggests that the pizzeria would only be found in an area with a high population of Italians. D as compared to B and A could be possible locations for an Italian population. But a \"Little Italy\" is usually an area of a major city (like Toronto, Montreal or New-York where Italians predominate ). In such cases the name \"Little Italy\" indicates the area is a part of that city, not a country in itself. Therefore C is incorrect.\n5.) However, Capital cities like Chicago or New York are the capitals of their individual states or regions that might have a high number of Italian citizens. In this sense, C fits with the context better. In comparison with A, B and C there is also a street where one can find a pizzerii in almost any town, but the context specifies that we are talking about a large city. Street and C could both be possible locations within a large city. We can eliminate D: food court as most pizza restaurants are not in food courts.\n6.)

Eliminate options that do not make any logical or factual sense such as, 'Better communication' and 'Overthinking', because these options do not pertain to the issue in the question.\n3. The phrase 'full immersion environment' indicates that the person is learning a language in an all encompassing cultural and linguistic environment.\n4. Therefore, the option that best answers this phrase is 'immersion'.\n5. In order to understand how this will lead to misinterpretation between the speaker and listener, it's important to understand what the phrase 'in a full immersion environment' means.\n6. 'Immersion' often refers to a total or totalizing system of thought in which one is fully immersed (literally or metaphorically) in a culture.\n7. The immersion of languages and cultural values may present challenges to the communication of each culture with another in a mixed cultural environment.  Many of these issues involve misunderstandings.\n8. Consequently, the best option to describe what will be a result of misinterpretation between a foreign speaker and listener is 'Misunderstandings'.\n9. Therefore, the most correct answer to what will be the result of miscommunication between two or more cultural speakers in a non-common language environment is 'Misunderstanding'.\nSo the final answer option is E: misunderstandings", "answer": "C: frustration"}

The meaning of the sentence 'in the family' makes us realize 'brains' will NEVER be the answer.\n5. The sentence 'they are all in the family' does not support the answer, since the question demands what the people in the family share.\n6. The sentence 'you share your last name with your daughter' shows we CAN SHARE last names WITH them.\n7. If we have to share something with the last name or a name we share the name.\n8.

Therefore, the action sought by the question is to get an answer to the form  of a question. There are also clues given at the beginning of the question which indicate that a person who is young is playing a game or sport. These may provide extra useful information about the context for the choice of the answers. Then, review and compare all the given options one by one, considering:\n1. Where would a child find a ball? This is the main context of the problem and it seems to be a logical conclusion that a child would be more likely to find a ball if his/her parents bought one or gave him/her one for a present. However, most parents would not give a ball to their children unless it was actually needed, such as for playing a game. One can further argue that a ball should be more likely to be found at a child's hand than on the floor or on a shelf. It is also more likely to be found in a toy store. Thus, a ball is more likely to be found where parents would bring their children, such as a child's house, or a toy store, or a play ground, when their children need or play with it. This would include not only parents but also grandparents, relatives and friends of the children.\n2. In a soccer game, it is more likely that a ball will not be in a store or in the child's hand. The ball can be given to the players or it can be found on the field, but it might only be the possession of just one player at any given time. However, during a soccer game, after a ball has been kicked or hit out of play or a period has ended, it is more likely to be picked up by a player or a referee and be kicked back into the game. This is highly unlikely if it hasn't been kicked or thrown out of play. If the game was not taking place, then the ball could still be in a toy store or on a shelf in a child's house or a street.\n3.

The other four choices are possible combinations of different elements, such as castle with king, monarchy with castle and so on. These four choices are logically valid but not enough to know which one is the answer.\n5. Consider the context more carefully and find something common between them.\n6. Find the connection between the king and throne, which is that they are both related to the royal dynasty.\n7.

There are only two remaining choices that seem to combine all the needed elements: a man having a throne and being met either in a castle or monarchy.\n10. We can only have a throne if he is either a king or a person with authority over a throne.\n11. We can only have monarchy if he is a king.\n12.

Although, the word 'primarily' is used and thus this choice would require a greater justification since it is different from the remaining choices.\n9: Option D - This option is a definite choice because it involves eating food and the action of eating can be considered as a very primal action, especially for human beings, and hence the food that is consumed by the virus is taken from a natural source.\n10: Option E - This option is a definitely relevant choice that involves computer malfunction but it is not necessarily a primary motive that the virus has.

There is no relevance between a toy store and a giraffe mascot or the child, let alone fond memories about the now-defunct toy store. Since all other options don't make sense either, the two-option 'toy store' is eliminated from the options.\n4. Similarly,'storybook' will not work as it doesn't mention childhood.  \n5. 'Great outdoors' and 'countryside' are too broad to be considered as a reference to a giraffe mascots.\n6. The only remaining option left is 'wildlife refuge' which is specific enough in terms of the childhood memories of the 'giraffe mascot'. Hence, the answer is 'wildlife refuges'.\nSo the final answer for 3 is E: wildlife refuge.\n7. Similarly, in the third question, start with reading the question carefully and looking for context.\n8. The question asks about which of the following items would you find in the now-defunct grocery store.\n9. The options which make no logical sense such as'shopping carts' can be eliminated.\n10. The option 'toy store' does not have anything to do with what the question is asking.\n11. The most plausible combination seems to be'shopping bags' and the 'cash register'. These can be found in a grocery store, which is now defunct.\n12. Hence, the answer will be A: cash register and bags. \nSo the final answer in the last question is A: cash registers and bags.\n\nInput: \tIf someone has a red belt, why would they hold up a green belt for comparison with what?

Eliminating 'being tired' and 'depressed' as being depressed and losing your job would be major events that are unlikely to be caused by a teacher's mood.\n3. 'Sobbing' is too specific to be the reason of the teacher's bad midded, because it is a specific case of bad mood which is only triggered by emotions.\n4.

Another option is 'jungle' but this is just a geographical label and does not indicate that lions are present or not present.\n6. The choice 'Veldt' seems like an aquatic/dry environment but does not actually mention anything about the lions presence, so this is not a plausible option.\n7. Next, look over A and B for clues.\n8.

Consider your choice: If gravity is to move the earth around the sun, that doesn't answer the question because gravity can cause objects to move without changing their position. (Refer to this choice again if you are unsure).\n5. Consider the other choices: If rotation is to make the earth rotate around the sun, that too doesn't answer the direct question because rotation can cause an object to rotate and is not the reason the earth is changing its position.\n6. Consider the other choices that may be used, to make the earth move or rotate around another object.\n7. Consider your final choice: Consider choice d: both A and B, where you are forced to conclude that the earth would not rotate around the sun but around something else. This doesn't really answer the question, because the entire question is about the sun and the earth, not about something else in space. (Refer to choice d again if you are unsatisfied).\n8. As for choice e: both A and B. Note that it might say 'and the earth revolves around the sun' instead of 'the earth revolves around its axis'.\n9.

The question has two main options 1) choose Apartment complex, 2) choose park.\n3. If you choose either of the two options, the question wants to know about one of the two.\n4. You're given options B) and E), which are completely irrelevant to the question, so you can remove them.\n5. You will have to compare the remaining options against the question.\n6. Since the question states'maximize your money', it makes it impossible to choose apartment complex.\n7. Therefore Choice option C) is chosen.\n8.

'Look first' is not a likely choice as it would be a waste of energy to slow down in order to take a look first while running after the ball.\n6) The option'skip' does not mean to jump over the ball- in the context of running after a ball, this answer does not make sense.\n7) Thus, the most logical explanation is that since one doesn't usually run after a ball while being lazy, tired, or carrying a heavy load- the answer is 'not fat' because in order to run after a ball, one must be fast and light.\n8) Hence, the final answer is E - 'look first'.\nSo the final answer will be E: look first", "answer": "B: have legs"}

The choices are: Candy Store, Butcher Shop, Kitchen, Auto Repair Shop, and Post Office.\n3. The question asks where one can buy treats for kiddos so looking at the two options that begin with the letter C, it is most likely that where one can buy candy and treats is called a 'confectionary store', not a butcher shop nor a post office.\n4. Checking the other two options, one is a kitchen (a place in a house), the other is an auto repair shop (where one can get auto repairs).\n5. Therefore, none of the other choices seem to make any logical sense, and the most logical answer would be Candy Store.\nSo the final outcome is C: Candy store\n\nInput: Where is the front desk in a hotel located? Choices:  a: lobby b: lounge c: front d: reception e: lobby lounge\nOutput: 1 Read the entire question in order to answer correctly.\n2. Check the first letters of each answer to distinguish which ones are in the correct order.\n3. The four initial letters are \u2018ldb'. The first letter \u2018d' is an important one, because all words with the beginning \u2018ld' start with a \u2018d', except \u2018ldb\u2019.\n4. Next check other words that start with the letter \u2018d\u2019 and eliminate them from the final choices, since a hotel lobby must be somewhere where the hotel is situated.\n5. So the remaining answer choices are \u2018lobby\u2019, \u2018front\u2019, and \u2018reception\u2019.\n6. \u2018Front\u2019 suggests that a \u2018front desk\u2019 in a hotel is near the hotel\u2019s entrance, whereas a hotel reception is not necessarily the same thing as a hotel\u2019s \u2018front\u2019.

The \u201ccreate music\u201d part fits best with \u201cband\u201d because the word \u201cband\u201d means a musical group, where the word \u201ccreate\u201d means to make music. The \u201ccreative music\u201d phrase might be referring to a band of many instruments. \n11. As for the word string quartet, we see that the term \u201cquartet\u201d means a group of 4 musicians where the word \u201cstring\u201d refers to a violin.

The choice it gave us is between Array and Linked-List. To answer this, we should think about the different properties of an Array and Linked List.\nA Linked List is a collection of nodes, each node having a reference to the next node. So the array doesn't support insertion or deletion operations.\nA Linked List uses an index at each node which represents the place for inserting new data. So the Array doesn't support iteration operations.\nA Linked-list is a linked collection of nodes that represent data in a sorted order.

Thus, it is possible that 2 of the remaining possible options are true.\n4. Eliminate the choice C 'dream worker' because it is too generic in its usage.\n5. Hence, the remaining option that is plausible is the choice B 'dream'.\nSo the final answer would be B: dream\n\nInput: John was in an accident on his way home, he got hit by another vehicle and now he can't go to work for a week, how do you feel about that? Choices: \t A: irritated B: excited C: depressed D: worried E: guilty\nOutput: 1. Firstly, understand the situation and make sure to read the question carefully.\n2. Now start eliminating the options that are not relevant or possible for example 'hit by another vehicle' and 'cannot go to work' cannot be the condition for a person to feel different things. Hence, these two options can immediately be eliminated as false and it is possible to answer another question about this person.\n3. Also eliminate irrelevant options such as 'depressed' and 'worried' because no information was given about the circumstances in which the question was posed.\n4. Now that we have more information about the context and situation of the question, it is possible that the answer 'excited' is relevant and plausible. However, in order to see if this is plausible in this scenario, do a deduction that will lead to the correct answer.\n5. Try to see why John is irritated, so make an inference that he is irritated by not being able to go to work because John got hit by a vehicle. (This reasoning leads to the conclusion that John is irritated because he cannot go to work/work has been lost or ru", "answer": "A: reality"}

There are multiple types of vehicles that can travel fast.\n3. Some of them are faster than others, so we need to compare the speeds of different vehicles to get a clear answer.\n4.

{"idx": 106, "text": "1. This question could easily be answered if we had more information like the names of each temple or a clear description of each temple so that we could relate any of them to a specific region or city, but unfortunately this is not the case.\n2. Therefore, a logical analysis of the question must be performed, as the word 'temple' appears in the question.\n3. The phrase'most famous temple', suggests that the temple in question would be widely known and renowned for its significance.\n4. This means we should now consider any region with an important and wide-known temple in its territory.\n5. Next, eliminate options 'jerusalem', 'Jewish community' and'middle east' because they have no relevance to the topic of a famous temple.\n6. This leaves us with the options left being 'city' and'mosque'.\n7. 'Mosque' makes no sense because the question asks about a temple, not simply'any house of worship.'\n8.

{"idx": 110, "text": "1: First you should break down the question a bit. This is not a trivia question; there is no need for you to get the exact answer. It's simply asking why geese move from one place to another. Once the correct answer has been chosen, then the actual answer can be given.\n2: For this question, there are at least 5 distinct possibilities: carried by people, group together, fly, guardhouse, and ultralight airplanes\n3: While the phrase \u201cguardhouse\u201d doesn\u2019t relate to anything related to geese as such, it could possibly be a term used to define the geese\u2019s destination, e.g., the term \"guardhouse\" could refer to a bird sanctuary. Nevertheless, this term isn't a normal one and doesn't relate to birds in general terms.\n4: \u201cUltralight airplan\u201d is used to refer to a small aircraft that can carry people or small animals. Since the question isn\u2019t asking about the aircraft that carries the geese rather than the geese themselves, eliminating this possibility would be the correct option to pick.\n5: The phrase \u201cfollow ultralight airplant\u201d doesn\u2019t make any sense. It\u2019s never been done or heard of, so if there is more than one true answer, this is definitely not the correct one.\n6: The phrase \u201ccarry people\u201d doesn\u2019t apply to geese but rather to humans in general. So, this answer couldn\u2019t be the correct one.\n7: The phrase \u201cgroup together\u201d has nothing to do with geese as such. It could be used to describe how an organization acts as a group but not how a geese acts. \n8: The phrase \u201cfly\u201d doesn\u2019t exactly refer to geese but rather humans. Geese could also fly but it requires the use of certain devices.\n9: In conclusion, the correct answer is \u201cfly\u201d.\nSo the final answer would be F: fly.\n\nInput:What is the value of $4.999999$4.999\u200b\nOutput: The answer is $5.00$5.00.\nSo the final answers is $5.0$, not $5.00$.\n\nInput:The value 212 is what percent of 139?

The answer clearly cannot be Florida or Denmark, since they are not the East coast areas of Florida.\n4. Therefore, the answer must be either United States or Map.\n5. United States cannot be chosen since the choice is for Florida.\n6. The choice Map is a valid answer if the question's meaning of the East coast area is meant to refer to the US as its East Coast, then the term'map' may be relevant.\n7. However if the choice Map is the only left, the question is a little convoluted and needs to be clarified.\n8.

We also see that he is competitive and enjoys competition.\n3) Now read the choices carefully.\n4) We see that options A and B both relate to winning and losing. This means that'might win' will be the least favourite option for John and an option that he would be opposed to.\n5) Next, from the remaining options we see that choice C does not make a lot of sense because the context tells us that he likes to compete against other people and compete at all. It doesn't make sense for him to 'perform better' on his own.\n6) Choice D is also not feasible because John hates to lose. If he'might win', it is not a loss for him and hence, John would not call his opponents his 'enemies'.\n7) And so the answer to John's personality must be E: enemies.

The word \u2018can\u2019 indicates a capability but not only a capability, but the question specifically is \u2018What\u2019, so it doesn\u2019t make sense for the lack of money to be the answer.\n5.

A euphoria may be one of the things that may prevent someone from buying Christmas presents, but the question is about specifically Christmas presents. The word \u2018what\u2019 indicates that it is more specific than that so we eliminate it.\n6.

Finally, read the various options and look at the first two answers - \"not his problem\" and \"tell us about it later\".\n4. These two options are most likely used if your response is \"ok, no problem\". They are both rather vague.\n5. Therefore we can eliminate them.\n6.

Since a newborn is a baby in human children, we can rule out options concerning other species of animals.\n5. When it opens is the moment that is of interest. By excluding options which do not fit this context, the remaining options are 'first time... sees light' and 'first time... is happy'. 6. We are looking for the first time the newborn sees light, which is one option so we eliminate the other and arrive at C: First time it sees light.\nSo the finalanswer is C: First time it see light\n\nInput: The most important thing in this game is the ball, where is it located at any time? Choices:  I: on the court B:  on the person holding it II: in the possession of the person who kicks it D: at its starting point - the tip of the tee  III: it never leaves the court\nOutput: 1: Start by identifying the grammatical structure of the text and make sure that it is not a question, but rather a statement.\n2. Then read the question carefully, and identify what is being asked about\n3. Identify which part of speech is appropriate for the question\n4. Read the available choices, and disregard those which are completely unrelated.\n5. By analyzing the remaining choices, we note that all of them are nouns which refer to the ball\n6. Option 1: on the court: This answer is misleading because it doesn't tell u where the ball is, at any time.\n7. Option 2: on the person holding it: This is also not helpful because it gives no specific location.\n8. Option 3: at its starting point: Similarly, it does not pinpoint the specific location of the ball.\n9. Only option 2 is left, which is on the court.\nSo the final answering is D: on the court\n\nInput: When an airplane is traveling at high altitude and its air resistance", "answer": "B: see light"}

Shoe Box D. Bedroom E. Drawer F. Garbage\nOutput: 1) Start by reading the question and understanding what it is asking for.\n2) Since you need new socks so that's what we are looking for!\n3) As we read from right to left, first option (A) has nothing to do with the question as we know there is no STORE FOR SOCKS. \n4) Option B tells us there'd be plenty of SUPERMARKETS and SOCKS, but not the other way around.\n5) The word \"socks\" in C makes it very likely that there would be a shoe shop, but it is still NOT IMPLICIT.\n6) Similarly, D, E, F are not applicable.\n\n7) SO FAR there was nothing that could be implicated to get the answer. So there should be no other option but the last one which says that there is no one who sells only SHOES.\n8) When we read the whole sentence, we don't know for sure whether there is a specific shoemake who sells shoes, but we can assume that the shoemaker would have the word SHOE in it.\n9) Finally, since there is no word SOCK in the sentence and SOCKS have been mentioned to be present in the supermarket (option B), the answer is F: Garbage\n\nInput: The world\u2019s oldest, biggest, and longest tree, which lives in Australia, is a__________.

Next, we can eliminate the other 4 choices because the question can be answered on a red bridge only and is impossible.\n4. For instance, the san francisco choice would imply that one could choose any fruit from a particular school to eat on a bridge.\n5. In addition, the refrigerator choice is also eliminated because a red bridge or a restaurant cannot actually eat.\n6. The last three choices are not possible to be on any red bridge.\n7. Now, eliminate the choices that are not possible because they are not relevant or they make no sense.\n8.

Look for a word that can be associated with an unknown event.\n3. For 'joke' and 'laughter' do not make senses with a surprising, unexpected, unknown event.\n4. Choose 'frightened'. It fits perfectly with a surprise or unexpected situation like being unexpectedly visited\n5. 'Frightened' refers to an unexpected situation that arouses a sense of fear in a person, leading them to act based on their desire to evade the situation.\n6. The other answer choices do not refer to an unexpected event, which is crucial in the context of this question.\n7. Conclude that 'frightened' is the correct answer.\nSo the finalanswer is :B. frightened\n\nInput: You are driving to the airport and need some help in parking your car. Where should you go? Choices: \n A: police\n B: garage\n C: gas station\n D: parking lot\n E: parking meter\nOutput:\n1. Read the question and make sure that your answer fits well with the given situation.\n\n2. There are many options and each offers something different in terms of solving the given issue.\n\n3. The option, \u201cgarage\u201d, mentions the word \"drive\" in it which shows that it is a place where someone with a car might go and park it, which is not needed in the given scenario.\n\n4. The next option \u201cgas station\u201d offers the word \u201cpump\u201d which is necessary in the given scenario, but it doesn\u2019t offer an option to park the car, which makes it unnecessary in this scenario.\n\n5. \u201cC\u201d \u201cparking garage\u201d offers a place where you can park your car and it also gives the word \"drive\" which makes it unnecessary.\n\n6. The last option \u201cparking meter\u201d describes a public parking garage where you leave money to get back a ticket and it also doesn\u2019t include the word \u201cdriver\u201d, which is necessary to be included in the answer.\n\n7. Therefore, an appropriate answer should contain two words \u201cdrive\u201d and \u201cpark\u201d to describe the parking in a parking garage. Therefore, the given parking scenario needs option \u201cD\u201d \u201cparking garag", "answer": "B: humor"}
{"idx": 486, "text": "1, Read the question carefully and try and understand what it is basically asking for.\n2. The man is the main character in the story and is likely the one being tested by the boss during job interviews. This is because he is the main focus in the story and the man is the one who is looking to impress during his job interviews.\n3. Check the five possible answers offered by the story.\n4. If the man took 3 hours daily for grooming and as a result got an injury, this would indicate that he probably over-prepared. He is spending too much time on grooming to compensate for his lack of confidence and probably also to make up for lack of experience.\n5. Therefore, to find the correct answer, eliminate any answers which wouldn\u2019t result in the man having an injury. For example, he could still have a vacation during his interviews because he isn\u2019t taking those 3 hours to groom before his interviews and because we are told that his interviews are spread out during the week; his interviews are not all happening on the same day and so he is only taking 3 hours per day, not per interview.\n6. The man also is not necessarily unfit to perform the job and isn't unfit either to get the job in the first place. He may also be a nice guy who cares about his appearance or he might be trying to impress during interviews. However, the main issue arising from grooming for three hours every morning is that he is taking 3 hours out of the day to groom. This is not the best use of time where he can look for a job. Also, he probably is getting frustrated and feels very overwhelmed with doing this during his interviews.\n7. On this basis, eliminate options C and E, as he isn\u2019t unfit and his looks are not the reason he is overworking.\n\n8. Next, we need to assess the possible results of him taking his time every morning to groom. One conclusion we can come to is that if he takes three hours every other morning for grooming and looks good, the end result is that he will be looking good and people will want to hire him. Thus, he will be looking good but his job won't be negatively affected. He will be able to get a good job because of his good appearance. This is the reason the", "answer": "A: tardiness"}

The author begins the sentence with the keyword \u201cDancing for a long period would\u2026\u201d. This suggests that the question is about the effect of long term dancing on the dancer.\n3. Next, make a complete and thorough analysis of the four given choices.\n4. The first two options are clearly incorrect or irrelevant. For example, option A'sore\u2019 and option B 'intercourse' are certainly not a side effect of dancing for a long period. This suggests that the options cannot be one of the acceptable choices.\n5. It can be noted that option D 'tired' is not incorrect, but does not make sense in the context. While dancing for long periods is not what would likely lead to tiredness, tiredness is certainly not a side effect or effect of dancing as the original sentence indicated.\n6. Option E 'expression' is the only choice left, and is the sole choice that is consistent with the provided evidence. In conclusion, the only correct answer is E: Expression\u2019, because dancing for long periods should not produce a tired effect on the dancer.", "answer": "D: become tired"}

In this question you will need to identify which ailment this text is referring to.\n3. As mentioned in the text David is in a great deal of pain, he is weak, and tired and he is shaking.\n4. These symptoms suggest that David might have some kind of flu or disease.\n5. Therefore you should eliminate ailments which are not disease-related, such as addiction, fatigue, relaxation and over-eating.\n6. Next, eliminate choices which might describe David's mood or state of mind, which are headaches and over-eating, as disease-related symptoms can have mood or state-related effects.\n7. Also, you need to be aware of the verbatim difference between symptoms and their causes.\n8. If it's a symptom it will usually be related to the state of mind such as shaking/shivering in addiction or fatigue.\n9. However, if you are in a state of fatigue you might have insomnia, you might shake and have headache.\n10. Therefore you should analyze the given choices in terms of disease and the state of being.\n11. For example, 'addiction' describes a disease and 'fatigue' describes a state of being. In this case, you can eliminate 'fatigue' from the choice.\n12. Also, you can eliminate other similar choices which are'shaking' and 'headache'.\n13. However, you can keep 'over-eating' as its cause might be related to the state-of-being aspect, such as weakness, fatigue, etc.\n14.

Since we are asked for the synonym for 'wrong', we have to identify words that have the same meaning as wrong.\n5. The word 'wrong' could also have different meanings, so we need to check the connotative of each option.\n6. The word 'wrongs' does not have a negative connotation, so it can't be 'death of', 'bad' or 'negative'.\n7. The word 'evil' may have a negative connotation even if it is used as a noun.\n8. The word 'wrongo' and 'false' are not acceptable.\n9. 'Bad' might be acceptable option but 'bad' can also mean good, which will not fit the context.\n10. The choices that remain in context are 'wrong' (used as a noun) and 'wrong' (as a verb).\n11.

D: windy 3: 53.75 degrees F 4: 53.5 degrees C 5: rainy 6: B: cooling cycle D: a storm 7. B: snow 8. F: heat\nOutput: 1.'Thunderstorm at night' does not seem to be a weather condition that would cause roads to be covered in snow. 2. 'Windy' does not describe a process that would cause roads to freeze over and become covered in snow. 3.'Weather that is 53.5\u00b0F and above', would not be cold enough to cause roads to freeze.\"\n4.'\"Weather between 53.5 and 77\u00b0F\" might conceivably cause roads to freeze, but it is incorrect. 5.'\"Rainy\" weather would not be covered in snow.\n6.\"\"Between 53.7 and 65 degrees F\", might conceiably cause roads to freeza.\"\n7. 'Snow weather' is another incorrect choice because it requires snow, not freezing temperature. \n8. 'Heat weather\" is also incorrect because it is not a process that would cause snow to cover the roads.\n9.

Make note of the words \u201cOnly time\u201d because they are part of the question and they are giving us a hint of what information we need to answer the question.\n5. The sentence that contains the important information is, \u201cSarah thought that\u201d Sarah has just given us a hint that she left.\n6.

We know that \u201cpreposition\u201d in this context is something that joins words, phrases, or clauses together, so it is most likely a conjunction.\n3. So then the question becomes: What conjunction is used to link two words?\n4. The only conjunctions listed in the given options are \u201cadjective\u201d, \u201cpronoun\u201d, \u201cconjunction\u201d and \u201cpreposition\u201d.\n5. The answer choice of a \u201cpreposition\u201d is not used to link two words, as it is a preposition is a word that describes the position of a noun in a sentence. Therefore, it must be rejected.\n6. From the remaining answers, it is clear that only \u201cadjective\u201d as well as \u201cconjunction\u201d are conjunctions, while \u201cpronoun\u201d and \u201cpreposition\u201d are parts of speech.\n7. Next, we must choose between the answer options based on the context of the question.\n8. For instance, if we are talking about a preposition that links two words, the only logical options are \u201cconjunction\u201d or \u201cadjective\u201d.\n9. The answer choice \u201cconjunction\u201d makes the most sense in this context; it links two words together in one phrase or clause, as it describes the relationship or position of two words to each other. \n10.

The first part asks which place a desk is usually occupied by a young person is located in.\n3. Check the list of choices and eliminate any place that does not make sense. There is no reason for a young person to be in an office building or a bedroom and also no young person will occupy a desk normally located in a school or a library.\n4. We have narrowed down the choices to A: office building and B: school room. The question can have two places since the choice is either an office building or a school room.\n5. We can eliminate option B: a school room because a school room is a place to study, it is not a place typically occupied by a person.\n6.

Try to eliminate all logical words and replace them only with a corresponding statement.\n4. For example, if the logical action would be \"to stand up, we could write'stand up' in the answer.\n5. In the same way, we can rewrite 'drink water' as 'drinks water'.\n6. Once you have identified all the logical action words, you can eliminate non-sense choices like 'Wait' and 'Eat'.\n7. 'Wait' does not give an action and 'Eat' cannot possibly 'do' a headache.\n8. The remaining choice would be 'Lie down' and'stand up'. We know that the headache is severe, thus the most logical action could be 'lie down' as this would be soothing and relaxing.\nSo the final choice would be F: lie", "answer": "B: schoolroom"}

And not all schools are located in residential neighborhoods.\n6:Then start thinking about other locations that a school could be located if it is not in a residential neighborhood.\n7:The term \"C\" means that the school is probably located in a \"community\" and the term \"neighborhood\" is defined as \"community\" in the free dictionary website.\n8:So, the most likely location for a school is in a community and the specific community type is \"community\".

However, taking care of proposals makes complete sense with the plausible meaning of 'finishing up'. So, one may conclude that 'finishing up' makes a lot more sense than 'getting work done'.\n5. The phrase 'finishing up' with the word'marriage' doesn't make any sense at all and therefore doesn't qualify as a possible option.\n6.

The second option'solar system' does not make logical sense because a human would not sit in it for extended periods. \n6. The third option \"coffee shop\", which may seem like the correct answer, does not make logical sense as it is not possible for a human to sit in it for a long period.\n7. The fourth option \"space shuttle\" is a good and logical answer considering a space shuttle is a spacecraft made to transport humans into space.\n8. The last option 'airport' may seem like the answer but does not make logical sense, since airports are areas to travel to or leave from.

The reason being, 'populated area' refers to the area and not a social group; similarly C 'group of people' makes no sense because society is an overarching term so it cannot be represented as a certain group of people.\n5.'Make person sick' can be false, even if the person is part of society.

Now read the options carefully and eliminate the options that don't make any sense in the light of the question.\n4. Some options are buses, and maps which would mean a bus station might be where buses are situated therefore, it wouldn't really be at a bus station if they do exist there.\n5. It sounds as though what we need is to find something that is outside a bus station but the bus station in a bus station.\n6. Therefore, it most likely it is a place to find information, such as maps.\n7. Making a comparison of the remaining options, we notice that the word'maps' is repeated which suggests that the answer is maps.\n8. Therefore, our final answer is - B: Maps.\n\nSo the end answer is B: maps \n\nInput:Which of the following should have been washed first according to the instructions printed on the clothing tags?

Also, option A(sign language) could mean someone who is able to sign the same as a person who is not able to sign coherently; thus making option \"B\" and even \"D\" wrong to some extent. 4) Now the options A and C could both work here if there is a person who is not in a position to  speak, perhaps they are mute or deaf.(4)\n 5) Then, B, C and D get removed from the list and we are left with only A.(5a)\n 6) Remember that the options begin with \"B\" and \"C\".

The first thing you notice about the given options is that they are not exactly comparable because the first, third and fourth options include \"square shape\" and \"different sizes\" both do not make sense for a \"door\".\n4. A \"door\" must be a \"rectangle\" or a \"round\" door. But the \"high walls\" make no sense for this word choice.\n5. Therefore you know that the first answer (A) is not correct.\n6. The second option (B) does not make sense to have windows in your room but is correct for flowers because the option could be \"furniture and flowers\" in your room.\n7. The fourth option (F) does not make sense because you do not need doors and windows in your room for it to be a room.\n8. The fifth option (I) is wrong because you cannot have high walls in the room facing the outside and still call it a room.\n9. Therefore, you know that the third option (C) is the answer, because it has the word \"flowers\" in it and it is correct for a room facing the outside.\n\nSo the final answer  is C: The room has flowers.\n\n### Instruction:Check the output format to see if the code makes sense.\n\nInput: When does a car need to be serviced?

It is a question about a calendar yearly that the person would like to have, but is disappointed as less number of days are visible in that calendar, compared to what he wants.\n2. Check the options:\n3. A is wrongly spelt\n4. B should not be a valid option because the person does not want the exact number of days in a year, but a number of days he wished for.\n5. Consider C (365days) as the expected answer.\n6. However, D is not a number but a word that conveys a general meaning.\n7. The person would not be pleased with D since it does not give him the option of choosing a particular number of days.\n8.

There are two options which appear to have the most logical meaning: 'fight' and 'urinate'. Of the two, 'fight' would seem to be less likely because it is not a plausible reason someone would be wet from fear.\n4. However, the word 'fight' is not necessarily the term chosen by the author, and it is possible that it could also be used to refer to fighting in the arena.\n5. Therefore, eliminate 'fight' as a plausible answer.\n6.

Check to see if the possible choices make sense in the context of the question.\n2.*In this case there is a reference to long sword, which means that the author had been thinking of this object as a type of weapon. And the object can be both a real weapon, and also a mythical creature or animal.\n3. Elimination: The word 'knife' does not make sense in the context since it is a different kind of object from the context. Also, the author probably would not refer to a weapon as 'the name of a knife'.\n4. Option'ship' also does not fit the purpose since it is not a weapon, it is a ship (or, if you prefer, vehicle). The author doesn't refer to it as a ship, but as a'very long sword', which implies that it is a long weapon like knife or sword.\n5.

'Fire' is obviously wrong as we can infer from the text that Dan is outfitting his house to generate energy with the 'oldest' heat source 'Earth'.\n5. There are two more options which are 'coal' and 'wood'. Since we know that Dan is outfiting his house with heat from 'the' oldest heat source on earth, it is evident that he should be using coal or wood as these are all that earth has for the most part.\n6. 'Coal' is clearly the most logical option. Not too sure about the exact definition of 'generating' heat from 'the' earth 'coal' so here would be an example:\n\nCoal being under the earth generates heat from heat and burns, generating electricity.\n\n7. As you may have noticed, none of the other options even begin to make sense.

Next, read the set of choices given and consider each option to decide which option has the most relevance to the context of the question.\n3. Check if each answer is relevant to the question. In this case, \"trying harder\" and \"quitting\" do not make sense. It is unlikely that James got a little too much competition and is going to quit, and he also probably did not feel pressure to perform better.\n4. Consider the remaining options further in order to make your final decision. \"Death\" does not make sense because it is unlikely that James is feeling pressured enough that he is going to die.\n5. Similarly, \"winning or losing\" is an extreme reaction to a competition, and it is not a realistic outcome of a competition.\n6. \"Pressure\" is a possible answer because it is certainly a feeling one can get from competitions.\n7. \"Trying harder\" is also an answer because James may feel that he is not performing as good as he'd like and hence feels pressure. \n8.

B: office might indicate the same working environment as a place of work but it has a tendency towards a working environment or a place where something is done, which is different than a friend's house or a place of enjoyment, which leads to elimination of this answer choice.\n8. C: friend's place is not the correct answer either, because it does not represent a place of enjoyment or companionship.\n9.

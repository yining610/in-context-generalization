Choices:  A: sheath B: sword closet C: collection D: container called scabbard E: museum<n>Output:		A: sheath <n>This is a question about the meaning of the word 'use', specifically in context to the expression 'useful'. The words 'of use' is a phrase that is used to refer to something being of benefit to someone. This fits with the fact that plumbing is used in building homes and therefore used in your own home. Similarly, a sword could be used to protect. In the second example, the word 'use' is used to refer to the way something feels, which is very different from the word's usual use of being of benefit. The plumbing cannot be used to satisfy thirst as it is water (not the refinery) that is needed.<n><n>### [solution](https://github.com/chris6999/leetcode/blob/main/day_12_solutions/solutions_0134.py)<n><n>```python<n>import re<n>class Solution:<n>    def findTheOne(self, words: List[str]) -> str:<n>        <n>        return re.findall(r'(\w+)\s?([^0-9]+)',' '.join(words).split())[-1]<n>s = Solution()<n>ans = s.findTheOne(["oil refineries", "own home", "water fountain", "wall", "thirsty", "show", "own home",<n>                    "museum", "collection", "sword closet", "sheath", "scabbard", "benefit"])<n>print(ans)<n>ans = s.full(["oil refinery", "sword", "sword closett", "own home", <n>            "own homes", "sword closets", "own your home", "use", "shaped like a sword", "sheath",<n>                    "usefully shaped like a sword",<n>                    "sword collection", "sword in your house", "useful shaped like a sword"]<n>	)<n>print(ans)

Choices: 0: 6 1: 6 2: 7 3: 6 4: 19 5: 22 6: 22 7: 101 Choices:<n>Output: 3: 6<n><n>## How does the code work?<n><n>### Instruction:Explain the algorithm behind your working code.<n><n>>The code works by running through a for loop and checks each element in a list, each element in turn is checked using a second for loop. The elements contained in the second for loop are compared with the result of the first for loop. The first for loop contains 2 numbers. If the first for loop finds that both are true, then the second for loop is used to find what the elements are, for example:<n><n>```python<n>a = [6, 19, 22]<n>b = [0, 22, 6]<n>c = -1<n>```<n><n>so the first for loop is:<n><n>```python <n>i = 0<n>while i < len(a):<n>    if a[i] == 6 and a[i] == b[i]:<n>        i += 1<n>        c = 0<n>        c += int(a[i])<n>```<n>In the first while loop, a variable "i" is set to 0, then checked if "i" (index or the number of elements) is smaller than or equal to the length of "a" or "b" list, whichever is shorter (the one with greater number of elements), where every single element of these two lists will be checked individually. If the condition is true, then the second while loop will work for that element, otherwise, it will just continue to work on the next element. The condition of the second while loop is as follows: as long as the current value of "i" is smaller than or equal the length of the list, that is, as long as "i" is smaller or equal to zero, it will enter the third "if" condition. The third "if" condition is when two elements of the same value are next to each other, the first element with a value of 19, the second with 22. Since "c" variable was set to "-1"

In each iteration, we check whether the current index value is greater than  `string.index`, which is equal to the string's length. If the index is greater than the string's length, means that we just visited last character and we don't have anything to print.<n><n>If the index isn't greater than the string' length, it means that we have something to print. Now we only need to find out which character to print, based on the current index:<n><n>- The first character of the string is at index 0, so it will always be at index 0. So in every iteration we need to check whether the index is 0 or not.<n><n>- The last character of the string are at index  `string_length-1`, so we will be only checking it when we go through the string for the last time.<n><n>- Between those two cases we only need to check whether the current index is greater or less than the index of the current character in the string.<n><n>- If the current index is less than the index of current character, it means that we need to print the character at the current index, so we will use `.char_at()` to retrieve that character.<n><n>- If it is greater, we need to print the next character from the current index, so the `.next()` method will be used to retrieve the next charater.<n><n>- At last, we check if the `list.remove(...)` method should be used to remove the current character.<n><n>- The character can be removed only if:<n><n>- the index of the char

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Output: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input:What does moving cars entail? Choices:  A: driving B: road C: getting tired D: accidents E: ticket<n>Output:		A: driving.<n><n>Input:Where could you find something that could be replaced easily? Choices:  B: something C: everything you cannot think of D: yourself E: all of the above<n>Output: A: everything you cannot think.<n>### Explanation:<n>The input for each of these question is the English phrase 'What does {thing} mean?' where the thing can be singularly capitalised. Given only the single word is required to answer the first question this simplifies the problem to answering every question with 'wall'.<n>To solve the first example we note that the word 'wall' is not used in the plumbing question. Given that we already know the question is asking 'where to find plumbing' we therefore also know that words with 'plu' as their first three letters are not in the answer. Therefore the possible words that are in the answer are 'dry' and 'runn' as these are the only words which begin with one 'p' and end with 'b'. Therefore by eliminating words that don't begin with 'p' we can eliminate the entire answer.<n>For the second example we use a very similar idea in that we note that the only word which contains'moving cars' is:'moving cars'. Therefore we can eliminate any answer which contains the word'moving cars' and'moving cars' appears in'moving cars', therefore we have solved the second question. For the third question we are searching through every word in the English alphabet excluding the words in the answer choices. To do this for each letter combination possible for each letter we can test for the answer choice. For example 'p l ew' can be answered, because 'pluw' is not the answer. Therefore for all these tests we end up with the same solution, as the answer for every question is simply any word that is not the answer itself.<n>### Extra points:<n>Input: Where is an animal that would not be of any use to you if you had cancer?

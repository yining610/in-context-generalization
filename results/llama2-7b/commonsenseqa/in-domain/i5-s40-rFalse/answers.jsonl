{"text": "E: beans\n\n### My solution: \n\nLet's take a close look at the first example to really understand what is going on. In summary, you need to figure out the main purpose of this sentence. \"Though he did everything required of [him].\" the second part of the sentence isn't needed, the sentence without the second part would remain a strong sentence. So, the second part is unnecessary.\n\nSecondly, what does \"him\" represent? Well, the answer is in the first part of the sentence. John only gave a perhfunctory examination. We can tell from the sentence that \"him\", represents John.\n\nThirdly, What does \"everything required\"  represent? The clue can be found in the first part of John's answer \"he missed the real cause of the death\" John didn't do everything that was required thus he missed an important point. Therefore John didn't do the \"real cause of death\" part\n\nAs to what would John missed from the real cause of death: we can get the answer by looking at the question \"He wouldn't have if...\" This is very similar to a \"why\" question and so the answer to this question would answer our question we can see the answer is \"he missed the real...\".\n\nFinally, we will try to build the answer.\n\nThe first part of the sentence will be the main part of the sentence. So, everything needed will need to be included. We need what or who, so in the beginning, we will put the correct \"him\", then continue by looking at the second part of the question to see what we missed from the first part (perhfunctorly examination).\n\nSo in summary:\n\n```\n    A: complete\n    B: thorough\n    C: carefull\n    D: thoughtful\n    E: complete\n```\nE is the answer because it describes correctly what John didn't do to the whole death part.\n\nLets see what can we learn from this.\nThe clue is always somewhere in the question. This is a very powerful clue in finding the answer. Once you figure out this clue it will help you significantly reduce time you need to spent on the solving a question.\nThe next clue: the first part often represents the main part of the answer. In our solution to this problem, the main part is \"He wouldn", "answer": "D: beach"}

If you want to learn how to code and develop programs, you need to have a systematic method for doing so. This can include things like designing software, writing code, testing software, and programming. \n\nThis was an assignment that was given in the course titled \u201cCoding in Python\u201d, which taught me how to write applications in Python, but also provided an overview of how to utilize Git and utilize Git to collaborate with other developers, and how to use Docker, which is a popular Linux container framework that allows you to quickly deploy websites and applications to a platform and use it for production purposes.\n\nIt was an overall valuable learning experience, but as a developer it is important to have a systematic workflow when working with software, Git is a popular tool for code versioning, which means it lets programmers see previous versions of the project and collaborate with other developers on code changes.\n\n### Instructions: Choose 2 questions to answer and write at least 20 words for each of them.\n\nWhat do you think of the way that technology is being integrated", "answer": "D: making money"}

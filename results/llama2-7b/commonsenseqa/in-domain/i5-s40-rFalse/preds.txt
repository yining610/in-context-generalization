Choices:  A: in the basement B: west C: solar system D: beach E: beans<n>Output:		E: beans<n><n>### My solution: <n><n>Let's take a close look at the first example to really understand what is going on. In summary, you need to figure out the main purpose of this sentence. "Though he did everything required of [him]." the second part of the sentence isn't needed, the sentence without the second part would remain a strong sentence. So, the second part is unnecessary.<n><n>Secondly, what does "him" represent? Well, the answer is in the first part of the sentence. John only gave a perhfunctory examination. We can tell from the sentence that "him", represents John.<n><n>Thirdly, What does "everything required"  represent? The clue can be found in the first part of John's answer "he missed the real cause of the death" John didn't do everything that was required thus he missed an important point. Therefore John didn't do the "real cause of death" part<n><n>As to what would John missed from the real cause of death: we can get the answer by looking at the question "He wouldn't have if..." This is very similar to a "why" question and so the answer to this question would answer our question we can see the answer is "he missed the real...".<n><n>Finally, we will try to build the answer.<n><n>The first part of the sentence will be the main part of the sentence. So, everything needed will need to be included. We need what or who, so in the beginning, we will put the correct "him", then continue by looking at the second part of the question to see what we missed from the first part (perhfunctorly examination).<n><n>So in summary:<n><n>```<n>    A: complete<n>    B: thorough<n>    C: carefull<n>    D: thoughtful<n>    E: complete<n>```<n>E is the answer because it describes correctly what John didn't do to the whole death part.<n><n>Lets see what can we learn from this.<n>The clue is always somewhere in the question. This is a very powerful clue in finding the answer. Once you figure out this clue it will help you significantly reduce time you need to spent on the solving a question.<n>The next clue: the first part often represents the main part of the answer. In our solution to this problem, the main part is "He wouldn

Language gives us the knowledge we rely on to interact with others as well as to function successfully in society. We use our language skills while dealing with others and figuring out the world around us. In this chapter, we will find out how we use language to understand how to function and interact in the social world, to understand ourselves, and to understand how to use language in meaningful ways.<n><n>### Instrucion:Answer the questions(1 to 4) below.<n><n>#### Question 1:<n><n>What is the difference between the verbalization and __________?  <n><n>#### Question 2:<n><n>What is it's called when the meaning conveyed by a utterance changes as time passes?  <n><n>##### Answer:<n><n>Anthropology<n><n>#### Question 3:<n><n>What is that called where different groups of people who speak different languages have difficulty communicating?  <n><n>#### Answer: <n><n>Language Barrier<n><n>#### Question: <n><n>What is it called when words or their meaning are changed in specific ways?  <n><n>####  Answer:<n><n>Slips of the tongue<n><n>### Instrection:Answer the quiz below.<n><n>### What is pangronym?<n><n>A noun that you add onto any other nouns name, giving it a word based name as a result of being stuck in your memory.<n>

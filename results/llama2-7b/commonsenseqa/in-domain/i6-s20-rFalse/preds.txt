The program begins by declaring an empty 10 x 10 integer two dimensional array `s.<n>Next, the program should enter a loop that increments (by using `++`) the number of rows for as long as the condition `row < i`, is set. The program should then set the value of both the `row` variable, and the `i` variable to one less than the current value. This can be done using the `--` operator.<n>After setting the row values, the program should increment (`++`) the column value to be equal to the current row, and then set the current row value to zero. The program should then use the array element value to be `s[i][j]`.<n>You could use any function to achieve this; for simplicity, however, you may use the *pythonly* built in function `print`, which prints out the value of the array element. Before the loop ends, the program should increment `s` by one.<n>You cannot use any libraries other than those in Python or MIP5.<n><n>#### Instruction:Complete this program in Python<n>### Example input and output<n>![in](https://github.com/moleroboticsco/molliecode/blob/main/images/in.png)<n><n><n>![out](https://github. com/molerobo ti cs/blob/main/videos/out.PNG

Explanation<n><n>1. This question can be easily found in the given code. The first instruction asks us to answer the following multiple choice question, and the second instruction asks us to guess the answers to these questions. It is quite easy to go through the given code as it is only 200 lines (in addition to the python imports).<n><n>2. Since we are guessing the answers to a multiple-choice question, we must first understand the nature of these questions in order to pick the right answer. For this, we can begin by reading the python code.<n><n>3. In the python code, we start by stating the answers. We start with the first question and the last, and we do this in every line of code (if we skip every other one). In every line, there is one string that ends in a?, and this string contains the answer.<n><n>   For example, the first line in the python program is:<n>   `Input: Where do you find a gas station?  Choices:   A: burn hot B? C: fuel tank D? E: burn hot`<n><n>   This means that the first answer (burn hot) is “B,” as this is what happens in line 2 of the python code. In line 2, the code prints “C: burn hot” in the terminal.<n><n>4. It might be frustrating as a beginner to look at code like this, but to really understand it, you must first look at it. Remember the instructions in the first code challenge exercise. After learning Python, you must read the code, and you must not skip one line of code. You must learn the language and understand it, just as a person knows English and understands it but does not necessarily know how to speak it fluently. You must learn it, read it, and understand it like a language. That is, you must start from the root and move from the leaves to the root.<n><n>   To do this, just ask yourself this: “

Choices: 	A: library B: bookstore C: bookcase D: novel writer E: shelf<n>Output: D: novel writer<n><n>---<n>#### Solution:<n><n><n>Answer choice for the first question is **B**. <n>The instruction is quite clear. <n>We want to find an option that represents a 'what'. <n>The answer choices represent an 'apparatus', 'appliance', 'wash dishes', 'implement', 'box' and 'apparatus'. <n>We can eliminate any choice that does not contain 'what'. <n><n>Answer choice for second question is **E**. <n>Just as the second question, the instruction is quite clear here. <n>We want an answer choice that represents a 'gas station' answer choice that represents a car. <n>We also eliminate any choice that contains 'burn hot' or 'fuel tank' in it, given that these terms are in the text.  <n><n>Answer choice for third question is **D**. <n>This one is tricky, because it should be a location, but there is the context of 'where' that changes the meaning. <n>The instruction does mention that 'house' is incorrect. <n>This would support eliminating 'house', however, 'Apartment' is also incorrect, because a car won't be found there. <n>Another answer could be the woods, but there is also 'E' with 'raisins', which is incorrect. <n>'Bedroom' is an interesting choice here as the instruction talks about car and gas station, so this could be the answer. <n>The text does not provide us any extra information, so I believe that 'bedroom' is the answer here.<n><n>Answer choice for fourth question is **C**. <n>The fourth question looks similar to second and third questions, where we look for a term that contains 'wine country'.  <n>This is what I would call a very basic question with a very simple solution. <n><n>Answer choice in last question is **D** again. <n>It is a little bit similar to the previous question, because the text explicitly talks about 'public place'.  <n>This is also a very basic question, where the solution again is very simple. <n>The last instruction also confirms our choice

We will use `list`.<n><n>To make it easy to use on different input types (which may be `str` or `list`) the question text will be surrounded by `*` and `"`, as will the choice texts. We convert the question text into an object for convenience.<n><n>For each choice, we parse it as a string. We have two possible patterns we can use to detect the start and end of a choice text: `*<something>*` or `"\".+?\""`.<n><n>We have a couple of options for the input. We can take the input as a single string, or as a list of `choice` objects, which should be formatted identically to the choice texts. This will save us a bit of work.<n><n>The code will need to make a final choice (assuming we picked an option), but which one? This will be chosen as the option in the list which begins with the same characters as the input. In the future, we will probably make this choice based on the first choice in the text, but this won't work if the first choice is not a valid choice itself. This may introduce a performance cost, but in this case it isn't too bad to use it, because for the second problem, we might have longer lists of alternatives.<n><n><n>```python3<n>def choice_generator(question, choices_string):<n>    '''<n>        Takes in a string of Question and a string of all the Choices<n>    :param question: The question for the user.

To hike or to jump is not the answer, the correct answer would be C: to jump into the waterfall.\nSo the final two answers are: \nC: to jump into it and\nD: to hike there.\n\nInput: Does your country have a constitution?

{"idx": 69, "text": "1: From context clues, it is likely that the phrase \"people in uniform playing with a balls\" is referring to a group or organization of people, such as employees in a specific profession.\n2. The phrase \"playing with a ball\" could refer to a variety of different activities involving the use of a ball, but it is important to identify what the context of the people in uniform doing this activity is.\n3. Considering the context of the question, the options \"hole\" and \"television\" do not seem to fit as they are not appropriate for a group of people in uniform.\n4. \"Sporting goods store\" may be appropriate for a group of unified people in a retail setting, but not for a specific activity that they are doing.\n5. \"Pool table\" could be a place where uniformed people may play with a ball but it also refers to the type of ball used in pool games, which may not fit the context of the question. \n6. \"Sporting events\" also seem to describe a larger group of events rather than specific activities, but some sporting events may involve a group of athletes in uniform. \n7. The appropriate answer for the question is E: \"sporting events\", as it's the best option among others that fit the context of the sentence. \nSo the final answer it D: sporting events\n\nInput: Where can you find the best shrimp in town?

{"idx": 73, "text": "1) The word 'bookshop' implies a place selling books.\n2) The context of the sentence means that the customer who read the magazine in the caf\u00e9 wishes to purchase her new fashion and also to locate, or 'visit' a bookshop after this.\n3) The word 'look' is an action to find information or a location. The answer must provide a location the customer can find the bookshop.\n4) The choices indicate business areas: student union (union of students) and mall (large shopping centre).\n5) A student union does not sell books per se, but is where you may find student groups involved in a variety of activities such as reading magazines.\n6) A mall, therefore, is not the location the customer is looking for after reading the magazine.\n7) This leaves the location 'department store', which sells general merchandise as well as books, and 'library', which also sells books. \n8) A department store, however, sells a variety of products apart from books, so it cannot be the answer. \n9) 'Library' is the correct answer because libraries typically sell books of many different types, including the newest fashion the customer has just read about.\nSo the final solution is E: library", "answer": "B: mall"}
{"idx": 77, "text": "1) The man's choice to run away with the circus (C) indicates that he has always desired to participate in this form of entertainment.\n2. This answer, circus, suggests a location where performances could occur, such as a tent or a building.\n3. Looking to the choices, we have clown college (C), circus (C), carnival (A), surprise (B), party (E).\n4. Clown college (C) is not a location where performances occur and is not specific to the context. \n5. Carnival (A) and circus (C) are locations where performances occur, but are not typically associated with the specific context of the man's choice to pursue a career in clowning.\n6. Surprise (B) could describe the man's reaction to pursuing a clowning career, but is probably not the correct answer.\n7. Party (E) could be a type of performance, but is not a location. \n8. Therefore, the best answer is A: circus, which is a place where performances occur.\nSo the final answers are A: circus\n\nInput: The boy saw the butterfly in the box and said \"Wow\". What was the first thing he thought? Choices:  \"Mm, this should be tasty\", \"'This is a lucky day\", \"'I must keep this secret\", \"I need to release this pretty soon\"\nOutput: 1: The man's comment, \"Wow,\" indicates that the first thing he thought about the butterfly in a box was its appearance or beauty, not its taste or practical use. This is inferred from the answer choices which suggest a variety of possible reactions to the butterfly, none of which are related to its physical appearance.\n2.  The best answer is \"'I must keep this a secret\", which states that the first thing the boy thought was not related to the butterfly's physical appearance, but rather a concern for its safety or preservation. This answers the question as the answer that does not refer to the butterfly in an objective way, but rather a subjective view of its importance. \nSo the final answer: \"...I must keep this a secrate\"", "answer": "A: circus"}
{"idx": 81, "text": "1) We can tell from context that the phrase'receiving workman's compensations' is a general term.\n2) Therefore, if it applies in the context of a business building, the answer must be somewhere that the phrase'receive workman's' could be applied.\n3) The choices A and C give us the term 'factory', which could contain people receiving workman's. \n4) The phrase 'insides of skyscraber walls' would be incorrect as this wording does not apply to context.\n5) The phrase'shop', while it could be found in a shopping mall or store, does not contain enough information to conclude the place where'receive Workman's' could apply.\n6) The phrase in question \"had tripped over a metal' rod\" tells us that some form of metal might be present somewhere in the phrase'receive Workman\u2019s compensation'. Thus we can narrow all answer choices down to metallic. \n7) The phrase 'had tripped over a metallic rod' would be redundant and is not correct based on this reasoning.\n8) The word 'insides' in answer option B could suggest that metal would be contained in shops. However B isn't the answer.\n9) The word 'construction' in answer option C suggests metal would be contained in a construction site and is in line with the phrase 'had tripped' and thus narrows down the rest of the options. \n10) Out of all answer possibilities, the only option that applies and fits best is option C: Construction site, as this answer is describing the place where the person received compensation.\nSo the final answers are C and C again: Construction site.\n\nInput: What did the detective know of the criminal's whereabouts?

'Soon' is the word they're most likely looking for in this context and it's the only one that doesn't use the word 'getting' - unless there's a typo in the question.\n3.

Instead of \"Losing weight is a good ____\", the choices are \"What is...\" and the question asks you to assess the consequences.\n5.

'She had never woken up as wakefulness in the morning.' is correct as wakefulness is a verb describing how you feel after you wake up. \n  4. 'She had never lain down as hunger in the morning' is incorrect as hunger is used incorrectly as a verb, and it refers to the state of being hungry\n3.) Therefore, the answer is B. \nSo the final answer B: hungry\n\nInput: The girl told her mother she was thirsty and that she went to what? Choices: A: fountain B: refrigerator C: water tank D: water closet E: faucet\nOutput: 1). This question is asking for the specific place referred to by choice C.\n2). The options in the question are: \"a fountain, a refrigerator, a water tank (which, although it is a container, it is not a place), a water closet, and a faucet.\"\n3). The water closet is actually a water closet in its literal meaning and in some cultures may be called a washroom or toilet, but it is often used to refer to a bathroom. This type of plumbing fixture would only be relevant in a home or possibly a restaurant, and the context of \"going to the bathroom\" is not relevant here. \n4).

However, the options provided (choice A, B, C, D, E) are not necessarily limited to specific sensations only, but the whole spectrum of them.\n4. For example, choice A (feeling cold) could be interpreted as a general description of all cold sensations, including for example chilly feel to frozen ice, or icy feel to cold water.\n5. While choices B (feeling pressure), C (feeling bumpy) D (itching) E (feeling clammy) are more likely to refer to specific sensations and would have to be interpreted in this way.\n6. Among these choices:\n    - choice B (feeling pressure) could refer to either strong pressure or not so strong pressure, but definitely something that feels more firm\n    - choice C (feeling bumps) could be a bumpy texture or one that is very uneven. Although, it's more likely to refer to a specific texture that would be considered bumpy.\n    - choice D (itching) is generally referring to dry skin or a condition that causes dry skin, but it could also be a specific reaction to something, such as skin-to-skin contact.\n    - choice E (feeling clamy) could mean something that is sticky or slimy, which seems to be a strange sensation. It is not likely to be interpreted that way.\n7. Therefore in this case, all choices are equally valid: it's not very clear what exactly is meant by these options and this is why they have been given as choices.\n8. The best way to answer is to think about a situation that could correspond to one of the options and choose that as the answer. \n9. In this case, choice D (iching) seems to be a good option because if skin rubs against something, sometimes dry skin or a condition causing dry skin could occur, since it often happens under many different conditions.\n10.

Finally, it is possible that this could be referring to a 'tabby cat' that has been in the wild for a long time.\n8. The choice C seems to be a good answer here as it outlines a place where most cats would probably find themselves - namely their home environment.

Therefore the choice of supermarkets is the most appropriate since both a pantry is a part of it and the presence of peanut butter in supermarkets is widespread.\n8. Peanut butr can also be stored in a supermarket and preserved in jars.\n9. Therefore, supermarkets are the most appropriate choice and the correct answer is the choice C.\nSo the final choice is C: supermarkets\n\n\n### Instruction:Answer the first two code lines to implement the code in python.\n\n# This code is a part of codinginterview problem. \nimport pickle\ndef function():      \n    with open(\"file.pickle\",\"rb\") as f:\n        data = pickle.load(f)\n    answer=data[\"A\"]\n    # for answer in data:\n    print(answer)\n\nclass data(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.A = []\n    def __getitem__(self, key):\n        return self.A", "answer": "C: pantry"}

The options of sitting down or go outdoor also do not refer to the passengers' physical state in the bus (sitting down or standing up), but rather the choice of sitting inside the bus or outside of the bus, which is not necessarily related to contextual concerns of standing up or sitting down. \n4. Similarly, the option of save money does not necessarily relate the context, since the passengers carrying their luggage in this context are likely doing so for purposes of traveling, regardless of whether they are standing or seated. \n5. Therefore, the remaining choices A, C, D are the only ones relevant, and D (go outdoors) is the most likely choice. \n6.

Most commonly, this case is carried from place to place by a person who travels for work or leisure, so \"bringing it to a business meeting\" is not the correct answer.\n6.

The Magnetic Poles have the strongest magnetic field, but it doesn't fit the context of the exercise.\n3.1 The question is only about physical forces and their strengths. Magnetism is a force, magnets generate magnetic fields. As such, the magnetic fields of two magnets is not strong enough to overcome the strength of physical gravity on the earth.\n4. This question is an opinion-based question that depends on the person\u2019s knowledge and perception. In the case of iron, it is a mineral. Magnets are pieces of strong iron. So, iron is a magnet stronger than steel.\n5. Steel is the most magnetic of all metals.\n6. In the general rule of Magnetism the formula is \"Materials having a higher concentration of iron and/or nickel have a stronger magnetic field than materials that do not.

Stylishly, stool legs can be considered as legs, and if we're talking about a general location to make legs, well, it's not always going to be an architect, nor to say that an internet cafe even has stools leg-making facilities.\n2) The options provide many locations where wooden leg-making could potentially be in use, so consider some things:\n    - What is the actual context here? We have a very general stool, and we're looking for legs, which by the nature of the word, seems to be a component that is to be put onto a surface, be it a wooden stool or any other surface, so a leg-making place isn't a place to build a stool in.\n    - The sentence in the question isn't saying'stool-leg-making-place'.\n3) A bar can be a building with a blacksmith shop. This is a possible connection from the sentence.\n4) The only option left is B, which stands for internet cafe, however:\n    - The cafe does not describe any stool parts, we don't know if they serve stools to their customers, which would lead us to assume that they can make any stool-related item without context, however, we don't actually know if the cafe makes legs. Legs are a possible item, but it is only possible item of the wording, not the primary one.\n    - The building is not a stool component in any way. We are just mentioning it to make it absolutely clear that it is not a stool, legs or jail. Therefore, we deduce that B is not the correct answer, because we don't know that they build legs, we just know that they are a stool-related building.\n\n5) The only option left, which fits the context and actually describes a leg, is A: Jail. This means that any prison could make stool legs and there's a large possibility of getting out the option that fits, which happens in any case due to the broad answer range.\n6) Therefore, we reach the conclusion that A would be the best answer.\nSo the final answers are: A: Jail.\n\nInput: What is a typical reason to buy a car?

Choices:  A : fine B : well C : good D : not so bad E : bad\nOutput: 1 \"in great shape\" is a phrase used to describe something that is in good condition.\n2. Looking through the options:\n    - Option 'A' (fine) is a noun that refers to the state of being of very high quality and it could be an acceptable answer, nevertheless, \"in great shape\" does not imply that one item is more high quality than another, but that it just is in good shape, hence it can be eliminated as an answer.\n    - Option  'B' (well) is another noun that means \"prosperous\" or \"flourishing\". If \"in great shape\" meant \"extremely well\" then \"in great shape\" would imply \"magnificent\" or \"perfect\" condition, but since \"in great shape\" means \"good condition\", then \"well\" cannot be the answer.\n    - Choice 'C' (good) is another adjective that means \"of a high standard\" or \"of a standard that is acceptable\". If the car was in good standard, then the salesman would have only assured us that the car was good, and it would have been sufficient to say so. The fact that the salesman went as far as to reassure us that the car was in \"great shape\" is enough to disqualify this choice as the answer.\n    Option 'D' (not so bad) is an adverb that means \"bad but not", "answer": "E: motorcycle"}

From the given choices, we can say they all relate to swords in one way or another, but the locations vary.\n4. 'Sheath' is the container that sheathes the sword's blade. So this choice is irrelevant.\n5. 'Sword closet' is the most appropriate option. We can say our house has a closet, it could contain some swords.\n6. 'Collection' is the smallest possible grouping of things, as we are interested in multiple swords. It is not a place where they are found but what they are.\n7.

For an animal like a 'horse', 'go' does not apply as a verbal description for its movement.\n6. However 'getting' as an action may or may not be applicable; but what it does say is: 'to take (something) without wanting to or intending to do so': https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/get.\n7. Since the situation under consideration is for a horse 'getting' would not apply because horses don't 'take' water but 'jump' ponds.", "answer": "A: georgia"}

Choices:  no A: music system B: stereo C: tuner D: receiver E: speakers\nOutput: 1: The speaker in the house referred to a specific audio system for the house that is having low sound levels.\n2. The word 'house' here means the house itself and it indicates that the sound is not correct even when adjusted to'max volume' level on the audio system.\n3. The person is looking for the 'explanation' why the sound is not correct and not for 'exchanging' an 'upgraded' audio system.\n4. So it's clear that the audio system is a specific set that is meant to be fixed.\n5. None of the options will do, because the words'music system','stereo' and 'tuner' are all connected to audio system, that works with the audio system. \n6. The question refers to a set 'that is in the house' and thereafter 'too low'.\n7. So the options C and D cannot be the options because they refer to the audio system set while the question refers that 'the speaker set in the house must be fixed'.\n8. Option E is clearly not the answer because it is not related to speaker set.\n9. Option A'music system' could probably be called as 'audio system' too. \n10.

The best answer choice, then, is C: Dock.\n2: Docks are often seen in large cities, near ports and where boats dock, which makes them attractive places for public performances of all kinds.\n3: It's also worth noting that a platform on a dock wouldn't be a singular element, like one might imagine in an arena or concert hall, but a number of individual platforms, meaning it would more closely resemble a stage.\n4: Docks are also likely to be near a waterfront, so there would also be a body of water, in tandem with the surrounding docklands areas, creating a potentially magnificent backdrop for public performances.\n5: All in all, a public stage at a dock would be a truly unique performance space, likely to garner much attention from both local citizens and travelers alike.\nSo the final answers is C: dock\n\nInput: Where did the inventor patent this discovery?

The statement \"which of these countries has a very long boarder with the other one?\" is the main statement. The five options provide five different countries.

Choices:  a: throne b: ground c: pillow d: head e: back\nOutput:\n1. \"Where does the king often sleep?\" would be a question from a point of view of someone interested in the king. \n2. The phrase \"often sleep\" suggests a regular nighttime activity, so it's likely that the person is asking about the king's bed.\n3. Looking through the answer options, option b 'ground' doesn't fit. Even though the king could sleep on the ground, it would be too uncommon compared to sleep on the floor (option d), bed (option c), and throne (option a).\n4.

Glee is the least relevant option as it indicates the opposite feeling of sadness (suggesting that the person is satisfied with their involvement in the event).\n9. Therefore, the answer from our perspective would be 'despair' which indicates feelings of helplessness, regret, and sadness.  \n10.

And there are some context-related places in which we could keep this instrument (band practice, music room, etc). \n3. So lets go through the options to narrow them down, given our constraints:\n4. All places beginning with *'under' *are not applicable.\n5. B: symphony would not be the best place for storing this instrument in your home.\n6. C: The'music room' is a place within your home where you could store the wind instrument, but it could be misleading or unclear as to the context. \n7. Band practice could be a place where you could store the instrument or the instrument itself is present in that place where there is music being made. \n8. The place where the 'practice' happens is likely the room with the instrument, not the practice room itself, which is more likely the name associated with another purpose in the home aside from just storage. \n9. This leaves us with the options 'band practice' (D),'music room' (C), and'music store' (E). Which is the most fitting? \n10. If band practice is in your home, then the context of'music' would be the best place to put the wind instrument (the band is making music while performing), given that storing it in the music room would not really convey the information of the place intended by the question.\n11. However, if band practice is actually in a place outside the home (a music store for example), then the information of where you would store a wind instrument is not intended by this question, and you would want to keep the information of the practice (in the music store) and the information about where the wind instrument should be stored elsewhere if at all (the wind instrument should be stored in the home, like in the music room).\n12. Therefore, the most fitting way to answer this question is to have'music room' as the context of where the instrument is kept, with the instruction being \"Sore a wind instrument in the'music room' of your home\".\nSo the final answer would be \nC: music room\n\nInput: If the sharks are the ultimate predator in the sea, what animal is an equal match on land?

The PENTAGON was built around the year 2000 A.D. and is an architectural masterpiece to this day. The military nature and architectural quality suggests it is an unlikely place for LED lighting.\n6) The CONCERTS is an activity done for entertainment. While concerts involve lighting, it is unlikely that the lighting used is LED, as mentioned previously.\n7) The AIRPORT is a place for travel. Many airports have nighttime operations and they may have airborne LED's. However, this option is unlikely, as it is very rare that LED's are found in airports and is very unlikely that they blink. \n8) Lastly, the CARNIVAL is a large event often held during the night. While there are often light sources during the carnival, blinking is unlikely. \n9) Therefore, blinking in the air at night is usually seen when the area that the light is in is the AIRPORT. \nSo the final answer would be A: AIRPORT\n\nNote: The question had to do with blinking, but did not indicate any blinking with light.\n\nInput: A cat was looking for a place to lie down, so it went to the shade to rest.

He could have spent his life having more 'fun' however it would have been a mistake to state 'having fun' as the chosen choice when the reason is the opposite of it.\n3. We further narrow down to the first three phrases:\n    - 'Ignoring' could not be the reason because doing so would indicate the child was ignoring his own goal of teaching the grandpa to read. Additionally, this phrase is not very specific to the situation given the context.\n    - 'Write' could not be the chosen reason, because it does not reflect the situation's description. The choice does not reflect the fact that the grandpa had not spent his whole life writing or not learned how to write.\n    - 'Learn New Things' could be the correct choice because it reflects the grandpa spending his whole life not knowing how to read, therefore meaning that the child tried to teach his grandfather because he wanted his grandpa to be able to learn new things.\n4.

A city is not a singular place or area, but would be made up of various places or buildings within, including where you could find schools. \n       - Therefore, the correct answer would be \"C: Every city\" since schools would not be exclusive to any one specific area or building.\n\n     - D: prague\n       - The same logic as above holds with regards to this option as well.

B: bullblee - if someone uses the word \"bullblee\", they are \"talking nonsense\". This choice is probably not the answer.\n7. C: cow - a cow is, of course, not a bull, but a cow is not the answer as it's not the opposite of a bull.\n8. D: female - someone may claim to be a female, but that does not determine what a bull is or isn't. This choice is probably not valid.\n9. E: charging preys - what is the opposite of 'charging'?\n10.

{"idx": 685, "text": "1.\"Instituting civil action,\" as indicated in this sentence, refers to taking legal action or creating a lawsuit. \n2. The choices that are suggested by the word \"result\" could suggest various outcomes or consequences of taking legal action and creating a lawsuit, including \n      - bad feelings  \n      - confusion\n      - hurt feelings\n      - going to court\n      - sandwiches\n3. It's important to carefully examine the context and the nuances of each choice to determine which one most closely aligns with the intended meaning. \n4. For example, \"bad feelings\" could refer to a negative emotional state that is a consequence of taking legal action. Actions taken in anger tend to have a negative effect on parties involved, which would align with the idea of bad feelings. \n5. A similar case could be made for confusion, as this could be an emotional or mental state that is the result of the legal action or a lawsuit.  Again, this would align with the negative emotional state that results from the action or lawsuit.\n6. However, these consequences are unlikely to be represented by options like \"sandwiches\" or \"going to court,\" as they are not related to emotional or mental consequences. \n7. Sandwiches are a food item that could be eaten after a legal action was taken.  While it's true they could be eaten, the sentiment expressed in the question doesn't imply that they are being treated as a consequence.\n8. The idea of going to court, on the other hand, suggests that this is a part of the legal action or lawsuit, but it does not convey a negative emotional consequence of taking these actions.\n9. Therefore, the answer choice that best conveys the intended meaning of \"result of instituting civil actions\" is A: bad feelings, because it aligns with the emotional or mental state of taking legal action or creating lawsuits. \n10. While the other options are not incorrect, they do not represent the nuances or accuracy of the intended meaning. 11. Therefore, the correct answer would be bad feelings.", "answer": "C: going to court"}

Finally, Michigan in the shape of a glove has a big countryside area which would be farm lands.\n7. Since farming areas or farmlands are mentioned in the phrase, Michigan would be the most appropriate.\n8.

None of the choices except dining room could possibly be used for entertainment.\n3. The question implies that such a kitchen where this usage is possible should be present inside a larger room or a place specifically.\n4. The dining room is the only place that fits the context of smaller space or room to be used for entertainment and at the same time is also present inside (i.e. inside home) of another larger space such as a house in this case. 5. The other option that is present inside home is bedroom but can only be used for personal entertainment, but not for entertainment for others.\n6.

{"idx": 753, "text": "1: The question is asking for the location where the person who started the fire might end up if they damaged property.\n2. There are two types of damages: material and nonmaterial. Material damage means that physical property was damaged due to the fire. Nonmaterial damage means that property was not actually damaged, as in the case of a fire alarm tripping.\n3. In this case, damage of property due to a fire would probably be considered material damage.\n4. The options in the question could be: damage, going to jail, going to school, burns, and destruction.\n5. The two options that refer to the location where the fire started are going to jail and school.\n6. That leaves us the options of damage, burns, and the final option, destruction.\n7. It's unlikely that someone would end up at a school for burning something or for getting hurt from the fire in general.\n8. Therefore, the option that is left which fits best in the context of starting a fire in the first place is the final one, destruction.\nSo the final answers are A: damage and C: going to school.\n\nInput: Did the teacher have to cut class due to the disruption of the school? Choices:  B: disturbance C: chaos D: ugliness E: untidiness F: dirtiness G: disorder H: distraction\nOutput: 1): The question is asking for an appropriate word in describing what happened in the school.\n2.

The options provided as choices for what happened may refer to what took place in a particular class: disturbance, chaos, ugliness, untidiness, dirtiness, disorder, and distraction, but these words do not fit into the context of the school as a whole. \n4. Options A, B and C are all adjectives. If they refer to the class being disrupted or disturbed, then those adjectives could be applied to an individual student or to someone who may have acted up in a class. \n5. However, if they refer to the entire school experience, it's more apt to describe the entire school as disrupted or disturbed. \n6. The same", "answer": "B: going to jail"}

The person is most likely looking for shelter, and that means choosing an option among A to E\n5. Choice A can be crossed out, because the phrase \"amount to nothing\" suggests that the action is useless or worthless.\n6. Choice B is wrong too, because visiting relatives is not something that should be done in a wilderness or forest area. \n7. Choice C is not a valid option either, because the word charming suggests that the person is not wounded, but enjoying himself.\n8. Therefore, the only valid options are C: doctor himself and D: doctor himself.\nSo the final answers are B: doctor himself and C: doctor himself", "answer": "D: doctor himself"}

'Was' should be changed to 'was playing'. \nThe question is asking about past tense. \nThe answer should be A: 'riding horses a lot' or C: 'Have fun' as the given scenario is not of the current time and the friend 'was injured while riding horses' a lot. \nSo the correct answer is 'A: He was injured while riding horses a lot'.\nSo the final answer choice is C: 'have fun'.", "answer": "C: curry"}

We can conclude torso, body, or garment, will be used in the answer (because we have an arm, a body, and a garment).\n4. However, among these options A: leg and B: garment are wrong because they are not going to get hit or protect an arm, while D: body seems like the right choice as a person is unlikely to get hit while wrapping his/her body around an arm or torso.\n5.

Therefore, when looking at the choices, it's necessary that we eliminate every choice that doesn't contain all of the items listed in the context: 'hairbrush and bandages'. \n4. Looking at the choice 'Drugstore (Choice A)', this does not contain all the requested items, namely a hairbrush - as a hairstyle or accessory, so it can be eliminated. \n5. Additionally, bandages, as a general term, do not necessarily always refer to'medical grade', so 'Hospital (Choice B)' and 'Bedroom (Choice C)' are also can both be eliminated.\n6. The remaining choices, 'Car (Choice D)' and 'House (Choice E)', both cannot provide all of the products required.\n7. Therefore the most logical answer choice left is 'Drugstore (choice A)'.\n8. As 'Drugstores' are a place where medicine and medical supplies are typically sold. \nSo the final answer would be D: Drugstore (Choice A).\n\nInput: When are hurricanes and flooding the most dangerous for people?

Severe weather conditions of hurricanes and rising water levels in flooding is often harmful for people when these conditions occur.\n3. Looking for the answer, \"What would be most harmful for people\" is implied.\n4. When both high sea level and hurricane conditions occur, these would be most harmful to people who are in the vicinity of these conditions.\n5. When the rise in sea level is sustained, this would be the most dangerous.\n6.

Other places where candles might be found are on a birthday cake or on a table in a dimly lit room but these are not common practices for a restaurant.\n4.) Apart from the table and a cake, the room is not where candles are usually found in a restaurant. \n5.) The word \"dimly\" has been used in the context of \"dimly lit room\" in which candles would not be placed in order to light or illuminate.\n6.) Candles are typically placed on a table or on top of something in order to be close to people to illuminate the environment. \n7.) Candles would be kept away from the kitchen as they would burn or melt in the high temperature and fumes. In short, the choices A, B and D are irrelevant. \n8.)

{"idx": 821, "text": "1.'Good' refers to being skilled, so the question is asking us about the consequences of not being 'good' at playing violin.\n2. Each of the choices below could describe the result of not being 'good', but unfortunately, none of them fit the context.\n3. The word 'happiness' could potentially belong, but since it's in the past tense, we rule that out and look at the choices which do not have a time constraint.\n4. The choice'relaxation' does not fit because it does not describe the event of not being 'good'.\n5. Similarly, 'create music' could describe what one would do if they were NOT good at playing violin but it would be misleading as it describes what one would do if 'CREATED music' which is not what we want.\n6. 'Sadness' also does not quite fit because it could be felt at both extremes of being 'good' or 'not good', and also has the emotion attached.\n7. Thus, the choice that fits is 'loud sound' - so loud sound would happen if one is not good with playing violin.\n8. Therefore, the answer would be E.\nSo the final answers is E: loud sound\n\nInput:What can you do to make sure you don't die when swimming?

{"idx": 825, "text": "1:The question asks about the place where it is possible to sit for extended periods.\n2. In order to understand the phrase \"for extended periods over a bow\" we need to know what exactly does it mean.\n3. The phrase \"for extended periods\" refers to long time.\n4. The phrase \"over a bowl of water\" refers to water that is usually used for washing purposes.\n5. Therefore, if an individual sits over a 'bowl of water' for an extended period of time, they are in a location where it is normal to get wet and clean.\n6. All choices are plausible environments for this situation. However, only options A, C, and D are possible candidates for such a long stay in a bathroom. \n7. This is because the bathroom is often the most convenient place to sit for an extended period of cleaning.\n8. As there is no water in options 'B', 'E', we can eliminate these two choices.\n9.

The choices are: a father, b \"his son\", c \"his name\" and d \"the person referred to\". The phrase \"we are talking about\" a man\" indicates that he exists somewhere and has a name. b does not fit because if his name were, for example, \"John\", the question would still be relevant, even though he is John's son. C does not fit because in a given instance we might be talking about a man named Cain, but that is a given instance and not the rule.

The utility room is the most likely option where a janitor might keep a pail, as it would contain items like a bucket, broom, and cleaning supplies, which matches the context of cleaning a building.\n6. Therefore, utiliy room is the best answer.\nSo the final answers are and utiliy room", "answer": "E: utility room"}

Choices:  No one grows oranges as a hobby. Oranges are grown commercially because there is a large demand for them. The most common orange is the sweet orange and it has the right characteristics for being grown more frequently. Most oranges are seedless. There is a different set of requirements for growing a good orange then for growing an orange. Only a few types are suitable for mass production. Sweet oranges cannot be grown commercially because they're not hardy enough. They're too pricey. They're highly susceptible to diseases. There's simply isn't enough market for a small fruit grower to turn a profit. The best orange for mass production can't be grown commercially.\nOutput: 1: All the statements could be potential reasons because a food item may not be grown in peoples back yards however that does not mean that all of the statements are valid reasons and the fact that no one grows oranges as hobby does not mean that it is not commercially grown.\n2: The answer choices are:\n    - option A: No one grows oranges hobby. \n    - option B: Oranges are grown commerically because their there is a large demand. \n    - Option C: Only a few types of oranges are suitable for mass production and there are different set of requirement for growing a good orange therefore only few oranges are mass produced. \n    - and option A: There is a different set or requirements for a great orange that only few oranges have so that means that the oranges that require for mass production are not good which is why most commercial farmers do not keep doing it.\n3: the given choice is option", "answer": "D: office supply store"}

{"idx": 913, "text": "1: The sentence asks where we would find people standing in line near a road\n2. We know that people will typically stand in lines to wait for something or for someone, this might include:\n    - Waiting for something to complete like at a factory or hospital\n    - Waiting to enter a place (like a mall)\n3. We now need to answer the question. Where might people be waiting near a road?\n4. The phrase \"a line near a road\" could be interpreted as a single line near a single road. However, \"a line near a\" in the question refers to a set of people at all different locations, so a single line wouldn't make sense.\n5. We also know that people will use things like bus stops, so let's look for places where people wait for buses. These would be places where people gather near busy roads or busy intersections.\n6. So the options A, E, B & D don't make sense here.\n7. The only option left is C, \"a (bus) stop.\" Bus stops are places where people wait for busses to come to them so it makes sense here.\n8. Therefore, the correct answer is Option C: \"a bus stop.\"\nSo the final answer would be C: \"a busstop\".\n\nInput: A person whose father can also be known as?

However, they are too specific and narrow in scope to provide a comprehensive answer to the question. The answer cannot involve a single one of these options for the given example.\n7) When considering harmful actions, the impact on the victim could be emotional, physical, financial, or social.\n8) The options 'lend money', 'cross street', and 'ride a bike' suggest a more indirect approach to causing harm. In this case, the answers might involve indirect intentions that do not necessarily result in direct harm.\n9) Therefore we can exclude the options E, B, and C from our choices, based on the given example in the question.\n10) Based on the examples provided, the answer would most likely be one of the remaining choices, either A or D, because they offer a direct and immediate action capable of causing harm to someone else in a direct/personal way.\n11) While D (ride a bike) may appear to fit the context of the example, in theory it's actually more difficult than it would seem to cause harm.\n12) To be exact, to 'ride a bike to cause harm' would involve planning, coordination, and effort to specifically target an individual in a situation where they are vulnerable and defenseless (on foot).\n13) In addition, riding a bike may incur financial, social, or other negative consequences for the person who causes harm, so it may not be an effective or efficient way to do it.\n14) The option A (feel sorry) is the opposite of the", "answer": "A: feel sorry"}

There is no such thing as \"was bad.\" The answer should be \"she is\", \"she was\", \"she was not\", etc. \n3.

According to the question we know the answer is neither B: rhythmic movements, nor A: music. Rhythmic movement can only be a result of good music. \n5. C: Music is a wrong answer as well, because what could rhyme to \"music, having fun\"? \n6. Therefore the answer is either D: \"moving body\" or E: \"having fun\".\n7. \"Moving body\" is just a body movement, not a dance. \n8. The other answer is E, having fun, which is the one we get from the question.\nSo the final step is E: having fun", "answer": "B: rhythmic movement"}

The phrase 'the bird' in this question implies a specific bird which is implied to already have acquired the feathers, not one that has just hatched from an egg or had recently molted.\n2. The question is asking where it acquires the feathers after it hatches, not if the feathers are naturally there already or are added later on in life.\n3. This implies a place where the bird acquires its feathered from, and would not apply in the earlier stages before it is born with feathers of its own.\n4. This question is asking about general feather coloration, not any specific color or pattern.\n5. Therefore, we can consider all the choices, from B to E.\n    - 'B' 'nest' could be a possible answer but does not necessarily involve any coloration since the feathers are not growing from a nest.\n    - 'C 'beak' could be a possible choice but refers more to its shape and size rather than its color which is only on its feathers.\n    - 'D' 'egg' would not apply as the baby birds are born with their own feathers.\n    We know 'E' 'body' is wrong because we know the bird has acquired its feathers already after it hatches.\n6. Therefore, it can be assumed that the other choices \"beak\", \"nest\", and \"body\" can be eliminated. So the final answer is E : body to explain the original question\nSo the final answer will be D: Body\n\nInput: Which of these two buildings were constructed in the year 2000?

{"idx": 933, "text": "1.)The question asks 'why would someone confess to murder'\n2.) The choices 'guilty conscience', 'fear', 'go free 'and 'problems' can likely be ruled out due to the connotations for each, in that 'guilty conscience' refers to a remorseful feeling, 'fear' often refers to apprehension, 'going free' implies receiving freedom (or perhaps freedom's being granted), and 'problems' indicates an issue, obstacle or challenge.\n3.) Thus, only 'find god' remains as the option to consider.\n4.) 'Find god' refers to finding or encountering god, through either belief, perception, or acknowledgement of god.\n5.) So we see that 'find god' could describe someone who, upon confessing to murder, finds or is reminded of the existence of god, and thus begins to have a change of heart, in that they are no longer willing to live a life which involves crime, and instead wish to align themselves with god.\n6.) Therefore, the answer is 'D: problems'.\nSo the final answer D: problems\n\nInput: You can get gasoline from a what? Choices: A: fuel B: drainpipe C: filling station D: gas station E: car\nOutput: 1 The context for the question is that people want to fill up on gas.\n2. As the context is people filling up on gas, we should find the correct answer that explains how this can be done.\n3. If we eliminate the first answer(A: Fuel), the second answer(B: drainpipe) is something that can drain gas (i.e. doesn't work as an option. \n4. If we look at the remaining 3 options, it is easy to see that the third answer(C: Filling station) is the one which is correct.\n5. A filling station is a gas station. Since a gas station is a place we fill up on, getting gas at a gas station fills us up.\n6. Therefore, 3rd choice, C: Filling station is the answer choice which is correct.\nSo the final answe is C: Filling station\n\nInput: Who's the smartest person in the world? Choices: A.

If we focus on the first sentence (and what it implies) we can immediately eliminate D since it's not the most likely option (\"focus on the task\")\n2. Then if we take into consideration that the children (presumably) were a \"group\" it's more likely that the majority was \"focusing well\" rather than \"focused on the same thing\", which would be B (\"focus on the task\").\n3. A (\"focus\") is a bit of a stretch since it's a bit of a fancy word for focus (which would be C)\n4. Since in real life \"distraction\" would actually be B (\"focus on task\"), when it comes to the sentence, it might as well be a distraction since it's not exactly in line with the teacher's statement.\n5. E (\"focus from the task\") doesn't give us much insight into what the majority of the group was focusing on. If anything, the opposite is true (\"focus on tasks\") since it would be more likely that some of them were distracting each other from focusing on tasks.\n6. That leaves us with the option D (\"distractions from focusing\"), which is the most likely option and the answer to the question.\nSo the answer is D: distractions from the task\n\n## Input: The company is trying to increase productivity.

Though this answer sounds right, it makes no sense in the context where man was driving to the airport and is leaving the luggage in it so that he could pick it up later.\n4) So, the answer is left to choose between: hotel, bus stop and trunk. The context of the sentence is what to us stands out first, that means the context is hotel. Then, the context should be narrowed down to whether the man was in a hotel or outside a hotel. If a passenger in a taxi, a train, a bus or any other form of public transportation, then they do not put luggage in hotel, they leave it at luggage storage or luggage room. \n5) The possible answers are A: closet, B: hotel, C:sidewalk, D: bus stop, E: trunk\n6) The answer is B: hotel \nSo the final answer becomes B; hotel\n \nInput: I tried everything I could think of, I made a mental not to never give up, and I decided to what?

Considering the phrase'make a big splash', which refers to a very powerful and loud disturbance, it is implied that the rock must hit the water with great force.\n3a. If you were considering throwing it from the mountains, then the rock would be thrown from a height, not from the ground(which is why choice A is incorrect).\n3b. Likewise, you could not throw it from the bridge, even though it's the shortest distance, as there would not be enough time or distance to achieve a powerful impact in the water when the rock is thrown.\n4a. The location is not in a specific city, and even though a city's surface might be flat, the ground is generally not completely flat and even at large distances from water, they slope slightly(choice C).\n4b. The rock would not make a 'big' splash if it were thrown from the surface of the earth, where the rock would probably make a small splash at best, which is why choice E is incorrect. \n5a. This leaves us with only choice B, 'countryside', which could refer to a relatively flat area not in any city and is therefore the most likely option to provide the conditions for causing a 'big' splosh.\n5b.

One can argue dancing has no real complexities and it's much more about how you express yourself in front of your partner.  Jane might be the better dancer, however they dance together very well.  This is a good choice of continuum because we have coupling and coupling.  We know the people are already engaged in a relationship, this activity shows a little more intimacy and it's more complex than sex and making love.  While it's more complex and shows more intimacy compared to making love.

To answer the question we know what we need is a choice between this 2 and this activity is more complex.

Choices:  Choices: A: left B: right C: front D: back E: in front\nOutput: 1.) There is an assumption that 'the course' refers to a room with seats wherein students are to sit during the course.\n2.) Out of the options, 'left' and 'right' are the options most likely to be used in such a room, rather than 'front' and 'back'.\n3.) If we assume that 'in front' refers to a desk in the front area of the room rather than an actual front, this could also be one of the answer choices, but this should not be the first one guessed.\n4.) Therefore, the most likely choices are left or right, leaving front and back as alternative choices rather than the first ones.\n5.)

It can be deduced that the answer has to be something that people in the same family share. Thus, the answer must be a common object or attribute. \n3. Therefore, the answer has to be an object and can't be a person. This leaves one more choice which is a shared possession. The shared possession can be anything - food, tools, money etc. While the answers B,C and D are related to sharing an attribute/body part, the only answer that is associated to sharing a possession is A.

'Suffering' stands for being in a painful or unpleasant state or situation, hence isn't a suitable option either.\n3. 'Pain' is an option that definitely stands for feeling of distress or suffering.\n4.

The answer choices are as follows: A: train station, B: house, C: cupboard, D: cricket stadiums, E: surface of earth.\n3. Train stations could be considered as a place for breathing air.\n4. The word \"recently\" is an adverb that means recently, therefore the air has to be breathed relatively recently (within the last few days)\n5. A house and a cupboard can contain air. \n6. A cricket stadium could be referred to as a place for breathable air.\n7. The surface of earth could be considered as air however there is no evidence that it was breathed in.\n8. There is only 1 answer choice that fits this: E: surface of earth; we could find air that has been recently breathed by only a limited number of people on the surface of earth.\n9. Therefore, the answer would be 'E: surface of earth'.\nSo the final answer will be 'E: surface  of earth'.\n\nInput: Where would you look for a specific type of plant?

A flower shop is a place where flowers are generally kept. (Forest: is a place where trees grow. If the question was asking for an individual flower, flower shops would be a way to go, however the question was \"A specific type of plant\", hence it would be a waste of time to look in a flower shop for plants of that kind). \n5: B. \"A woods\" could contain woods, however the general context and what the question is asking for specifically is to locate a specific plant and to the best of our knowledge woods would not contain that plant.\n6: C.

Therefore, the context requires specific locations where \"some line of people are next to a sign\".\n3. The options are:\na. bus stop: This is a place where people wait for the next bus to arrive, and may be joined by others in a line. However, the phrase \"a sign with some line of people are next\" does not make sense with this context.\nb. street corner: This is a place with a traffic light or intersection where people waiting to cross the road may form a line, but the question here is specifically about a sign with a line of people next to it.\nc. roadblock: This is a situation where traffic is obstructed or delayed, but it does not include a sign nor a line of people.\nd. fast-food drive-thru: This is a type of service from a restaurant where customers can receive food ordered from their cars, and do not involve signs nor lines of people.\ne. city: The word \"city\" does not specifically relate to a single location with a sign.\n4. There are several parts that indicate something about the context of the question.\na. The sentence mentions \"some\" people, which implies that more than one person would be involved in this situation.\nb. The sentence mentions \"a sign with them\", which implies that the place the sign would be located is somewhere on the same property as the people are standing.\nc. The phrase \"next to\", which is the phrase specifically highlighted in the question, shows that the line of people and the sign are in close proximity to one another. \n5. Therefore, the phrase is describing two things - a location with a sign, and a line of people standing very close to that sign.\n6. The only correct answer is a. street corner, as this is the only location that accurately fits this situation.\nSo the final correct answer is A- Street corner.\n\nInput: What is a type of food that can be used to cure what ails you?

The following answer choices describe appliances that do not use water and soap, such as a washing machine, space shuttle, disneyland, or the surface of the earth.\n4. Appliances used for cooking, such as a blender, use water and soap as ingredients.\n5. Therefore, the answer choice that would be most likely to use both water and soap is 'blender'.\n6. If the question asked for an appliance, the'space shuttle' would be the right answer, as it is the equipment that transport astronauts back and forth to space.\n7. The answer 'Disneyland', is also a valid answer. \n8. If the question asked about'soap', the right answer would be 'blender', as this appliance is the one most commonly used with soap. \n9.

The king and ambassador may have important and official meetings, or they may have private or formal meals with their families or attend a royal event with their households, this seems to be consistent with the image of a king and ambassador meeting somewhere in the castle.\n3) Therefore, the correct answer should be a castle.

{"idx": 283, "text": "1: The phrase 'have more kids', indicates a situation where a family is raising and caring for their children. \n2: The phrase 'larger house' could be considered as a possible choice because this question asks where a person goes to get more kids. However, referring to a larger house does not directly suggest the possibility of having more children, which rules out this choice as an applicable answer. \n3: The phrase 'bigger house' is slightly more relatable to the question, as it makes a direct suggestion of increasing the size of a house if it's already too small for children. \n[3] However, 'too small for children' can also be replaced with the phrases 'a place where children' or 'a place where there are a lot of children' and these phrases are more directly related to the context in the question. These phrases also provide a better meaningful association to a phrase 'where does a person go to get more children.'\n4: It's logical to assume that getting more children includes finding a mate to begin having a family and the choices 'understand themselves' or 'a life partner' can certainly be associated with this. However, it's difficult to clearly understand the context in the question 'get where' as it's not specified. With the phrase 'understand themselves', it's likely the context refers to an understanding of self and it could be suggested that they 'grow as a person.' The phrase 'life partner' is a term used to refer to a marriage partner or significant other but it doesn't indicate going to a specific place. \n5: 'Second chances' is a phrase that could be considered because it is often associated with having more children, but it's difficult to understand whether the'second chances' in the context provided is referring to a second chance in choosing where to raise a family, in a choice of finding a suitable mate, or a second chance in having child. The phrase 'compliments' doesn't have any association to the context in the provided question.\n6.

The story-time question implies that sitting on the floor while reading or listening to a story is more enjoyable than a sitting chair. This is because readers can adjust their seats to their own preferences, which could be on the floor or a chair.\n2. The floor is a more comfortable place to sit.\n3. We can still enjoy the book we're reading by ourselves, without the help of others, but we are more comfortable when we talk to our friends while reading the book.\n4.

But people can adjust their sitting position on the floor. People could even adjust their height upward or downward according to how comfortable it is.\n6. The floor is more comfortable than the chair or bed. Sitting on the bed all day can make your coccyx hurt, even if you read while sitting on the bed. You must change your position to make the bed comfortable. It can be difficult to do because sometimes you may want to turn to a different position and still lean on the bed.

Choices: \n A: it has longer ears B: it is larger C: it has more eyes D: it has a bigger mouth E: it snuck out \nOutput: 1) The sentence is describing all cobras as not having a snub nose, which means that they all have a long nose. However, a snub nose is shorter than average. Since there is no mention of size in the question, it must be referring to size, not the type of nose, therefore.\n2) Choices A and B imply that cobras have longer ears or are larger, but cobras have long ears and are larger than other snakes - they are not the same as a snub nose type of snake. However they do not mention how a cobra will know if it is long or large. \n3) Choices C and D imply that cobras are larger or have more eyes (e.g. a snake with 3 eyes).\n4) Choice E implies that cobras sneak out (how would it know that it just sneaked out if it has eyes?

'Sun himself'. This is not what the quote means.\n    - The person could be laying on the beach because God would be with him and it is a religious custom. 'Thank God'. This answer is not specific to the beach context and does not imply that the person is lying on a beach.\n    - The question suggests the man is laying down on a beach and then says he is 'racing against time', which only makes sense if the man is also running. So that eliminates the choice D as an option of why he might be lying on a beach. (Lying - not running).\n    - If the word 'love' in the context of human relationships (e.g. romantic love) would be a suitable answer, so could 'express love'. However, 'express love' does not make sense in this context, and the word 'express' in this sense means'show/display' rather than 'express'.\n    - The choice E is the only one in the question that expresses the meaning correctly. A person could be lying on the beach to relax or simply enjoy the sun or sand.\n3) There is only one choice in the question that matches the explanation and makes sense in the context of the question: B.

The choices A: living, B: feeling good and C: hyperventilating are not what are described in the question. 4. The choices D: Looking around and E Breathing deeply are similar to what is described in the question. We would expect to see people taking in fresh air by stopping and taking a deep breath of air when outside. For example, when walking in a fresh city with a big city or when going to the mountains. 5.

Is someone preparing soup outside? No, as it would require a large container or pot to heat food. Even if someone is cooking outside, it won't be soup. 4. At a soup kitchen, they do not give someone soup (they serve food, they do not serve soup), while at a grocery store soup is sold. 5.

Out of the answer choices, all places that mention Ficus refer to it as a plant, so the answer is not among them.\n4. 'Middle East' suggests nothing apart from the fact that the plant is related to it.\n5. We ruled out 'Palace' already as the answer is not palace-related.\n6. 'Dictionary' also doesn't match the answer because it is a definition of a ficus plant, not a location where it is used.\n7.

Listening to music implies the reason why the person might want to put their headphones on.\n4 Looking at the options, it's not possible to determine what listening is for the passenger, because the context of the sentence does not provide any information.\n5. In fact, there are multiple options for how they listen to music, and these options could all be legitimate reasoning.\n6. Therefore, we can eliminate the other options because there's no way to identify which action listening is supposed to perform.\n7. In this case, the sentence provides more information than the options provide, so we can't eliminate any of the options.\n8.

In other words, if we read \"invisible man\", we can imagine that there must be some means to make a person invisible (e.g. magic) which is in the complete opposite of fragile man.\n7) Therefore, we are left with \"immortal\" as the correct answer choice, which is what the sentence is looking for.\nSo the final correct answer is Immortal\n\nInput: The person who likes to learn is looking for what?

From this narrowed list, we can see that there is a variety of choices: 3) Uber/lyft, which represents rideshare apps that pair drivers and riders online, while 4) Yellow cab, which is a service operated by independent taxi drivers \n4) Considering the question is about Canada, the best answer is C.

This question seeks to find the answer that best fits the now defunct toy store, story book, great outdoors or countryside or wildlife refuge where he used to fondly visit.\n4. Therefore the correct answer is B: storybook. The toy store and the wildlife refuge are also possible answers, but because the word is 'the now defunct' it is not logical to have a fond memory of toy store or a wildlife refuge since it seems more appropriate to have a fond memory on something that is'still around' or still in use. \n5.

'Back and back', with the emphasize on 'back' makes no sense. \n6. That leaves only the two options, A and E.\n7. But 'back and forth' and 'back and back' are both opposites of 'forward', but they are also both the opposite of 'back'.\n8. Therefore, the two words should be either 'back' or 'forward'.\n9. The word 'back', which means away from or moving away from a starting point is opposite of 'forward' which means towards or moving towards a starting point. \n10. However, the word 'also' is describing two things in the same direction and could not be considered as 'forward' or 'back'.\n11. The word 'tally' is a noun which is uncommon in this context, so it cannot be the answer. \n12. The word 'this' is commonly used at the end of a sentence which implies that there is no other thing in the sentence.\n13.

Although palaces (choice C) are often lavish or opulent, they are not necessarily a common home to the gentry or middle class, as the word 'palace' refers to a building used as a country residence by a member of royalty.\n5. We can eliminate C as an option.\n6. From the remaining three options (A, B, E), B is the most suitable in line with the usage of the term 'gentleman'. \n7. The expression \"A gentleman is very wealth...\" refers to the way a gentleman acts and not to the way a gentleman dresses, therefore 'gentleman' refers to a personality trait and not a clothing style.\n8. As such, 'big house' is a common expression which refers to a home that is substantial in size, it's a place where a gentle man could flaunt his wealth, just as a smaller house can be flaunted by a poor man.\n9.

It implies that a child may ask for help with a class assignment or ask a question about their homework. \n    - Enter school: This is directly related to the context in which a school bus is used to transport children between their home and school. In addition, it implies that the school has already started sessions and classes, so it cannot be prior to the morning. \n    - Wash the dishes: This is likely not a chore that would be assigned to a child before getting on a school bus, since it implies a more routine task. \n    - Read a book: This is not related to the context of a school bus and would likely be part of a pre-bedtime routine rather than a morning routine.\n    - Drop out of school: This does not apply and is not applicable to the context of a child getting on a bus before getting on the bus and thus, the answer is an invalid option.\n3.

By way of comparison, the roads in Michigan go on for hundreds or even thousands of miles. They are long, straight affairs where there is no cross-traffic, only the direction of the flow of traffic.\n3. If you were to look at a map of the state of Michigan along the length of any of the roads, you will find yourself looking at a line on the map. Each road resembles a line, not a curve or other pattern.\n4. The roads in this state are labeled county roads, as in \"M-49\", so it's important to know which county you're in when trying to look at a road from the perspective of the map.\n5. The map is viewed from the sky, like an aeriel view, which would give you both a longitudinal and vertical view of the roads.\n6. Cross-county roads are also referred to as county roads, so you can see a road in this state being traveled across a number of counties.\n7. The roads in the state of Michigan are called county roads.\n8.

Of the options, 'raise corn','seed plants', 'grow plants' and 'farm land' cannot be said to help grow more plants from one plant. \n5. These options apply to the initial plant planting or to planting of whole crops. \n6. The phrase'seed crops' means crops that can be used for farming purposes the next year. However, the crops that are grown must be seeds for these to be able to take root and grow again into something that can be farmed.\n7. The phrase 'plant plants' also means the plants that are planted and grown each year must be seeds, therefore we exclude answers A and B because both of these answers do not allow for new plants to be created from a single seed.\n8. Looking at answer choice C,'seed plants' can be narrowed down to mean'vegetable seeds'. As per the prompt, the farmer chose seeds to plant, to get more plants, not the plant itself. This means option C cannot be the correct answer.\n9.

C) A suitcase is like a cabinet and can hold papers, however the type of content is not specified and thus not helpful. D) An office supply store contains notebooks and other types of paper which are used for sale. However, it is still not possible to distinguish whether these items are specifically for sale. E) An artist's studio (as per question) may contain some non-saleable papers, but it is broad enough to also refer to any other type of papers which may be sold.\n7. Therefore the most appropriate answer is E - 'Artist's Studio'.\nSo the final answer would be E: artist's workshop", "answer": "E: artist's studio"}

Choices: A: flamboyant B: overwhelming C: a fool D: smart E: humorous\nOutput: 1: The teacher was not flamboyant. The term 'Flamboyantness' is not a synonym for teacher or even a profession.\n2. The teacher cannot be described as 'overwhelming' as it's not a word related to teachers of students, as teachers only teach and don't \"overwhelm\" students with their presence.\n3. The term 'fool' stands for an idiot, which does not suit the teacher's character. It's a synonym for 'foolish.'\n4. A student who makes fun of the teacher will likely call the teacher'smart' and not 'humorous' because 'humorous' refers to something which makes us laugh.\n5.

It's a safe way to transport them, because there's no way that you can lose the suitcase, and it's hard to break into one. B: department store is a place that can store jewelry. Also safe because it's an area that keeps the jewelry from physical damage and burglary, but we can't wear the jewelry in it. \n4. C: safe deposit boxes is the safest place. The reason being is because it is a place where you are the one who will have the key and only you will also open it. Only then the jewelry is safe from being stolen or broken. You put it in safety vault in the bank, so if there is burglary in the bank, it will be safer there than in your house, where any person can come inside by simply knocking the door. Also, you can deposit jewelry in the safe deposit box. So, if you want to take jewelry on a vacation, you will only need to carry the key and the safe deposit box (A) to get them safely \n4. D: these twos cannot be considered as a way of transporting jewelry. In fact these twos are not a way to do it, because the question is talking about something that will transport jewelry, but is not those kinds of places.

Therefore the only viable choice left is computer science (choice D), which is a field of study that focuses on computers and their functions. \n8.

{"idx": 559, "text": "1.\"The audience laughed\" would mean that something amusing or comical had happened, likely in the video being shown on the screen.\n2. \"A projector displayed people...\" suggests a live scene rather than a movie, because a projector is often used for slideshows.\n3. \"While the audience...\" means we cannot assume they were watching a video.\n4. \"What might they be watching?\", asks which type of scene we could witness the laughing audience watching.\n5. From the choices listed, one might assume that a movie at the theatre, or on stage in a cabaret, or at a conference, could make the audience laugh. But, only a meeting between people could also result in laughter because people are watching each other.\n6. Therefore, we have eliminated everything besides A: movies or B: theatre. \n7. Both a movie at the cinema and a play at the theatre require a performance, thus neither answer option would fit a situation where the audience is simply laughing unconnectedly.\n8. It is unlikely that the audience would be laughing at what they see if they are only watching a video on a projector.\n9. It is more likely that the audience is watching the scene before them, live on the stage or from the auditorium, the laughter being their reaction to what they see.\n10. Therefore the answer would be A: movies or theatre.\nSo the final answers are: A: movie / B: theater\n\nInput: The man who had worked for the company had retired, but his job could not be found.

All the options can be eliminated in sequence as follows:\n    - Option B: A shopping bag, a cabinet or a car trunk are all storage areas, but we are told \"if all the seats in your car are full,\" which means there may already be something in your car that could be stored, making this choice unnecessary. \n    - Option C: A shopping bag is incompatible with a trunk and a trunk is an incompatible storage space with cabinets, so we can eliminate these two together. \n    - A trunk is a storage space that is commonly used in vehicles. \n4.

The choices in this question are: A: self-pity, B: communication, C: understood, D: pain, E: embarrassment.\n3. Looking a the context of the situation, getting a bruise, yelling in pain as a response, and yelling afterward, we can conclude that the answer is actually pain.\n4. However, since pain relates to one's state of health, it is not necessarily the best answer, we may need to choose an option where pain is an indirect consequence.\n5. In this context of pain, one is in an extremely physical and painful position, being unable to act on their emotion through the communication of their feeling appropriately. Therefore, it is likely that yelling is an indirect consequence of self-pity.\n6. Therefore, when you express yourself by yelping, which is the most likely feeling you are expressing?\n7. The choices are:\n\t- Self-pity: No, as self-pity is more of an underlying feeling not expressing itself through yelping directly.\n\t- Communication: No, yelping when pained is in fact an indication of the complete opposite, it's not talking, it's yelping, which indicates distress.\n\t- Pain: No, this one is more fitting in the previous context.\n\t- Understood: No, one is not necessarily understood when expressing themself through yelping, they're just pained, and yelping is the reaction to pain.\n\t- Embarrassment: this could be an indirect consequence of the reaction to yelping as in the previous scenario, when another person sees you yelping as they're hurt, they could be embarrassed for you.\nTherefore, the correct answer is E: embarrassment, as it's probably the most indirect consequence of yelping, in this specific context.\nSo the final answers are C: understood for the 6a, and E: embarrassment for 1.\n\nInput: If someone is playing with his hair, what is he doing?

Based on the context of living with roommates, the choice 'bathroom' does not make sense as it's an enclosed room where people typically go to bathe or shower, and is not a typical room where people would choose to live.\n3. Similarly, the choice 'closet' is not a room where people would often live, and is also not a typical room where a folding chair would be used.\n4. The choice 'room' could be a room where college kids might live, but it does not necessarily imply that a folding chair would fit in that room.\n5. The choice 'church' may seem to work as a room where a group of people may gather for a specific purpose, such as attending a church service or religious meeting, but this is not necessarily the case. \n6. 'Choosing a folding chair' within a 'church' requires a higher degree of speculation than is reasonable. \n7.

It is a sign of protest and is only a small statement.\n6. Changes in society come by political reforms and laws. This would be done by voting and appealing to the ones who make laws. In this context, the answer is (B) Vote.\nSo the finalanswer is B: vote\n\nInput: In what way could this place be described as ancient? Choices: 1. A: very old. 2. B: older than others. 3. C: archaic. 4. D: historic. 5. E: historical.\nOutput: 1 These are old, very old, historic, very old, but still describe ancient in different senses or ways.\n2. Older than others and very old can make some people older than others and can make it more obvious that this place is younger but still old.\n3.

In order to be correct, the adverse effect should be related to jogging.\n    c. E: EXHAUSTION; exhaustion is one of the adverse effects of running. Running continuously all day may result in this effect.\n    d.

Neither the three feet (D) nor the 3-arm-span (E) match the description of what something is made up of, because in the case of 3-feet, it is a specific length of physical measurement while the description of the 3-arm span is a very specific, peculiar, and vague description. \n5.

{"idx": 651, "text": "1, This question asks for a single duty but parenthood is a broad and complex role and there are many answers.\n2. There is a shortlist of parental duties, but these include speaking freely, happiness of a child, care for children and control children. However,'speak freely' refers to speaking one's mind freely and in an uninhibited manner; this is a person choice, not a parental responsibility.\n3. 'Happiness of a child,' implies that a parent's primary role is to ensure a child's happiness, however, parenthood includes so much more than simply ensuring a child's happiness.\n4. 'Care for children' includes feeding them, taking care of their health, helping with their emotional needs, and so forth. But this duty is not exclusive to parents and includes other caregivers.\n5. 'School child' refers only to a child going to school, which refers specifically to a child's education rather than the parent's primary duty.\n6. The correct answer is, based on the context of being a parent's primary duty, 'control children.'\n7. The phrase control children is most likely intended to convey an ability to keep children in line through discipline or correction, rather than through physical means.\n8.

However, it appears to be a question about the location itself, rather than who might donate it.\n6.

It also appears that building the graveyard should be in a town or city, rather than just any location. \n8. Therefore, Choices E cemetery is the most logical to chose.\n9. This makes the best sense because graveyards are generally in towns, cemeteries or cities, so it can only be built in one.

A theater would usually keep larger, more elaborate statues in display, however there are many theaters and a statue could be on display for any length of time based on circumstances. If many statues are not on display at any given period, then the chance that there would be thousands or even a large number in the theater would be extremely low.\n6.)

Choices:  a) Breathe air;  b) Swim in a stream;  c) Live on dry land;  d) Eat dirt;  e) Live in an aquarium.\nOutput: If the question is asking what 'fish' does, what the fish do is swim in a stream and breathe air, and most of them live in an aquarium. A fish isn't considered dead until it breathes air, which takes place in the water. When they get out of water, they die. Eating dirt is the wrong answer. A fish doesn't eat dirt.\n\nInput: Which of these animals is bigger: the cat or the dog?

Choices:  Tiny. Small. Big. Large. Huge.\nOutput: 1.) To answer this question, it's important to interpret the word \"closest\". In the context of this question, the word \"closest\" refers to a physical distance rather than a figurative distance.\n2.) The words \"tiny\" and \"larger\" are not sufficient because they are only descriptions of size. \n3.)

Looking into the choices, a person is either complimented, liked, care about, understand themselves, or popular.\n3. Let's consider why a person is approached by a lot of other people, it must be due to a high social status since people seek the attention of a well-respected, important or powerful individual.\n4. Compliments or popularity can indicate high social status, but as per the phrase \"lot of people\", these are not the exact answer.\n5. Let's go on and consider care about.\n6. This option indicates someone who is cared about, loved, appreciated, cherished, or thought of affectionately by many people.\n7. We need to look at how people approach a person who is loved or appreciated and it must be due to their care for the person.\n8. Therefore, the answer will be an option that conveys the idea of being cared for, which is the phrase \"know all\" (D).\n9. Hence, the final answer is D; \"know all\".\nSo the final answer answer is D: know all\n\nInput: Which group has more women than men?

{"idx": 795, "text": "1- The question is asking the action a satisfied person might do.\n2. Options A and E don't make sense as a satisfied person might not necessarily be doing anything to express his or her satisfaction- It could be silent.\n3. Option B means looking through groceries, which is an action but is not necessary done only by a satified person.\n4. Option C is also not correct because it is done only when one is passing through the street but not necessarily happy\n5. Only option D makes sense because everyone needs to be happy, or to do whatever it is one needs to do to make one happy.\n\nSo the final answer should be D: feel happy\n\nInput: What might a potted plant be located next to? Choices:  C: dining table D: office desk E: bedroom furniture F: entertainment center G: couch\nOutput: 1: A potted plant should be a living house plant growing in a pot usually on the floor or on the window sill.\n2. As given in the options\n\n3. The living in the city could possibly be referring to cities\n\n4. Thus, there is no reason for plant to be moving into cities.\n\n5. There is no reason for it to be moving into the living room\n\n6. The reason given in the text is moving from one place in rural areas to another place in urban areas.\n\n7. Therefore, we can eliminate options: A, C, D, and G.\n\n8. The option 'office desk' is not the correct one because that may be temporary, because it might not suit all the plants, the same way as the house doesn't suit all the plants.\n\n9. The option: 'bedroom furniture' as well as 'dining table' are also wrong as they are considered to only belong to the areas where people spend the most time and living plants can survive in many surrounding.\n\n10. So based on these observations, it would come down to option: F - 'entertainment Center'.\n\nSo the final output would be F: entertainment center\n\nInput: The old man, who had forgotten his appointment, was found dead.

This is the preferred method of playing the game and therefore must be included as an answer.

The phrase \"crowd of fish\" does not necessarily mean \"crowd of schooling fish\" or \"crowd of young fish.\" It is much more similar to a \"group of fish\" or \"a school of fish.\"\n3. - The phrase \"they do not get grades of sit at desks\" indicates that schools, grades, and desks have something in common.\n4. - If we go through the choices A, B, C, and D, schooling fish do not have any of these things.\n5. - A fish does not have a grade, a grade does not have a fish, a desk does not have a grade or a fish, nor does a grade or fish have a desk... There has to be a relationship.\n6. - The key is finding the answer that does have that relationship and excludes the others.\n7. - Schooling - a word not mentioned in the question - can be applied to a school of fish, so \"schooling fish\" would be the answer of choice A, which would mean \"a group of fish\", not grades or desks.\n8. - However, this does not exclude the other answers as A and the others can be applicable to the general population of fish. \n9. - The correct answer is B: fill the pond.\nSo the final correct answer is B: Fill the pond\nInput: The teacher said, \"they can do better\" and \"they need to learn a little faster than they can do.\" What is their assignment?

The phrase not being used implies that the planes in the chosen place must not be operational.\n3. The answer choice options given could contain one or two airplanes. A: War; C: Sky; D: Graveyard\n4. The only answer choice that could contain a sufficient number of airplanes that are unoperational is 'aircraft carrier', where it is possible for an airforce to be stationed.\n5. Additionally, the term 'aircraft carrier' also has a secondary meaning implying it to be a warship or naval ship and the inclusion of such words in the phrase 'not being used' supports this option as the likely answer.\n6. Therefore, it is appropriate to conclude that Aircraft Carrier is the correct answer and the answer is C: aircraft carrier.\nSo the final choice is C: aircraft carrior\n\nInput:A fishing pole has a handle that's made of wood. It's used to control a ___. Choices:  A rope B: hook C: fishing reel D: bait E: tackle box\nOutput: 1) The context in which the handle of a fishing pole is being described indicates that it is part of an item that is used to catch or catch and release fish.\n2) A rope is not required to achieve this task and thus it can be excluded as an answer.\n3) A fishing reel is also not necessary for catching or catching and releasing fish as it is typically used for fishing once they have been caught.\n4) The phrase \"handle that's made of\" implies it is the main or only handle, rather than one among other handles.\n5) A fishing pole can have a single hook attached or only one bait, therefore an option B 'hook' can also be eliminated due to a lack of specificity.\n6) A fishing pole may contain more than one hook or more than one type of bait.\n7) Out of all the answer choices, a fishing reel requires multiple hooks or baits, therefore an option D 'bait' can also be eliminater.\n8) A fishing pole also requires a reel when it comes into contact with fish.\n9) Since a", "answer": "B: aircraft carrier"}
{"idx": 811, "text": "1.\"Consumption of beer\" in the question refers to regular drinking or \"habitual\" consumption over a long period of time.\n2. The adjective 'intoxicating' suggests a temporary state of being drunken or inebriated.\n3. The adjective 'liquid' implies a state of being in a liquid form.\n4. The adjective 'harmful' is negative in context but would still be acceptable if the subject is beer itself as opposed to the effects of over consumption, i.e. drinking alcoholic beverages like beer.\n5. Therefore, the answer can either be 'harmful' or 'liquid'. \n6. If the intention is to find another adjective, we can use the remaining options to replace the answer, since the options must be used in the same sentence structure as is 'beer consumption'. \n7. Thus, we can eliminate the first two options, 'water' and 'liquid'. 8. We can eliminate 'water' because it does not describe a result of a long-term beer-consuming habit. 9. Similarly, since 'liquid' can also describe other long-standing habits such as drinking coffee, we can also remove 'liquid'.\n10. The remaining options are 'intoxicating' and 'harmful'. Both of these options describe the harmful effects of beer consumption. \n11. The word 'intoxicating' is generally used as an adverb that implies drinking too much and becoming intoxicated, the word 'harmful' is more neutral in its context.\n12.

The driver controls the car by steering a wheel. If he is under the influence of drugs (which makes him not focus), he can lose control of the car and crash it.\n2. The choice E indicates that the driver 'controls the car' in a 'car-park' but it is not in any way related to the question. \n3. The choice A can be considered to be correct, a 'driver controls a car' by way of 'behind the car.\n4. But in a sense, 'behind' can also mean back of a car and this cannot be considered to include 'control'. But when considered further, 'behind the car' simply means 'the entire car'. As such, this cannot be classified as the 'driver controls a car'. \n5. When we combine choices 'A 'and 'B', A and B are also not possible choices because of the word 'drug'.

Option B:isolation means to be put apart or separate from others, this does not fit the context clearly as forgiving attitude is a positive term.\n4. Option C, absolution means to free from guilt. This also does not suit the context of \"receive a chance at a fresh\". \n5. Option D is \"Great relief\" This option provides an insight into how it can change a person's perspective, but is also somewhat ambiguous. It's more of an unspecific concept that can't be verified.\n6. Option E, \"feels better\" refers to how forgiving attitude can make feel people and may show how important forgiveness is to them. However, it's again somewhat ambiguous to specify how forgiveness can make a person feel better.\n7. As a whole, the context seems similar to the word \"empathy\" which means the ability to understand and share another person's feelings, which is also important in showing compassion and understanding. \n8.

Looking through the options, the phrases 'watch television' and 'watch garbage' are similar, as they both involve watching something.\n4. Thus, it'd be necessary to eliminate as many options as possible that aren't applicable from the context of this question. \n5. Looking at the choices, 'dumpster' could be an option in which to view garbage if the context were to be garbage collection or recycling. \n6. As the phrase 'dumpster' (choice B) only means garbage as in 'trash', it's an invalid option to eliminate as a location to view garbage, but the options 'landfill' (choice C) and 'trashcan' (choice E) refer specifically to garbage as compared to landfill or trashcan which are the collective materials of various garbage items.\n7. Due to their specificities to garbage, the only options left to consider are B, C and E. \n8. As it's unnecessary to have the option for garbage collection, this eliminates options B and E making 'landfill' (Choice C) the best answer. \n9.

A'spider web' is more accurate if we are talking about harm from being 'caught'. If we get caught in a spider web, we may be caught because we were careless.

The correct answer (No) needs to answer the question: If a person doesn\u2019t know anyone in space (i.e., doesn\u2019t know anyone traveling to space because they are the only person in that population), do they have friends?\n3. To answer this, let us know define the terms Friend & Person.\n4. - A person is someone who's alive (a human in general, not necessarily human) that can be considered a friend\n5. - Person must exist somewhere in universe/space (as in a planet) to be called a friend (must be born from the dust of earth, mars or the other planets)\n6. - Everyone alive on Earth has many friends as everyone belongs to the same planet and therefore same group of people.\n7. - This also answers the statement: \"If a person doesn\u2019tknow anyone in space, do they have friend\u2019s?\" (i.e., \"is there any planet with aliens that earth/mars/any planet is connected to/travel to/etc?\") - no\n8.

Choices: 1. A: she inhales carbon dioxide 2. C: she is angry 3. D: she is sad 4. E: she is happy\nOutput: 1.'Carbon dioxide' seems like the correct answer if one was to think this could be a reason her cheeks are red.\n2. 'Anger' could be an explanation as well, but it's possible that she is angry without having red cheeks, and it's also possible for someone to be happy and still have red cheeks.\n3. 'Sadness' seems like the correct reason if red cheeks in this situation is a sign that she is crying, but sad cries tend to be quiet, and the fact that it says her cheeks 'are' red implies that she is crying a lot or for a long time. In addition, crying out of sadness as opposed to out of happiness, should make her cheeks redder, so it does seem more plausible that her cheeks are red because she's crying.\n4. 'Happiness' seems like an accurate explanation as well, but happiness can take many forms, and red cheeks aren't necessarily a sign that someone is happy, it's just an assumption made by the questioner.\n5.

However, that's not where the question is asking.\n5. The school contains students and teachers, who are paid for their work, so that's not the answer either.\n6.

In woodworking, this can refer to a change in the shape or size of a board or piece of wood as it is dried or cured, but warp is not directly related to petrification. \n7)The word 'petrify' is a term that means to make something into stone or to turn something into stone.

In the context of'small dog', it's clear that it's referring to a breed of small dog rather than a small dog that is physically small.\n3. This is due to the fact that New England is a geographic region that describes several different states in the northeastern region of the United States.\n4. Looking at the answers:\n    - The statement isn't referencing England, the country, but a specific state located in the United States which is called 'New Hampshire', which is also indicated on the third choice.\n    - In Denmark, they might use coffins for small dogs due to their large population of dogs.\n    - If we are to go with the meaning of 'own home' (B), the dog would then be found in Hampshire, England instead of New Hampshire, the U.S.\n    - The word 'Hampshire' cannot be a part of New England (which is the name of the region), so 'Old England' cannot be the correct answer.\n    - All other places mentioned in the other answers are not associated with the dog breed that were just mentioned in the question.\n5.

But the sentence is actually talking about the band, pluralizing the noun would create confusion that's why the answer is CLASSICAL.\n7) Capable and classy are too vague to be correct answers, \"capable\" is a general term and can fit anything and \"classy\" is describing the band and doesn't fit the time constraint of the sentence.\n8) If we make the sentence \"The band enjoyed their successes and fans, they loved\". Here the time constraint has also been removed, therefore the nouns CLASSICAL and COLLECTIVE are now correct choices in the sentence.\n9) The options CLASSICAL(The band performed classical) and COLLECTIVE(The band performed collective) both suggest that the band performed in front of the crowd.

The cathedral itself is a reverent place, however loud voices or loud noises could disturb the atmosphere in this place of worship.\n3. The terms 'quiet place' and 'dining hall' are generally considered not as reverent or sacred as a cathedral, indicating that it would be more acceptable to speak softly in those places.\n4. The choice of 'altar' could be misleading, as it's generally associated with a place of worship. However, the question asks for the 'dining hall' which is not considered as such. \n5. Therefore, it's necessary for a place of worship to fit the description of a reverent place, while a cathedral - as the question implied is preferred. \nSo, the final answer is: 1. B: quiet place, 2.

So we have now a choice between C-John Davis  lodge 40 east to toll road and D- John Davis I-16751 Toll road.\n3: To eliminate the option C-John Davis  Lodge 40 East Toll Road because the name should not have any number at end of word this is a toll road so we could eliminate it.\n4: Now we are left with C-John Davis I-16571 toll road. The name John Davis could be in relation with something else and not the John Davis  Loho Toll road so option C is eliminated again.\n5: Now we are left to John Davis I-19091 toll road, after we have eliminated it we will eliminate the next option John Davis I-90761 toll road the name John Davis is too far and too complex with too many numbers this rule could eliminate many choices after that we are left with the option John Davis I-1862 Toll road this means John Davis  Lodge I-1655Toll road  and the answer is D: John Davis I-11655 toll road.\nSo the final choice is D. John Davis I-1062 Toll road.\n\nInput: Where is the closest water? Choices:  F: toboggan B: frozen lake C: snow D: sled E: skating rink\nOutput: 1 - water -", "answer": "D: connecticut"}

The word \u2018nervousness\u2019 could also be given as indicating someone\u2019s experience in meeting people. This is possible, as most people would be slightly nervous when in a social interaction. \n\n5. However, the other answer choice \u2018being bored\u2019 can also be used as an indication of being nervous, as it can mean feeling bored with the situation and feeling anxious about escaping, which is an anxiety indicator. \n\n6. Therefore, \u2018making new friends\u2019 can be given as the more logical choice as it would indicate a positive social situation whereby a person would expect to make new friends or at least be in an environment conducive to meeting new people.\n\nSo the final answer could be either D: making new friends or E: making new friends because the sentence implies the need for new interaction.\n\nBased on the original sentence and the above explanations, it could be said that the sentence is unclear as \"meeting people\" could mean a positive or negative experience.\n\nInput: What does Jelly Wad not do?

It is only logical to assume that the answer to the first question is the place where the book is kept when it is NOT reading.\n5. To clarify, a book is NOT reading, it is BEING read.\n6. As the first sentence only requires the phrase \"it reads\" to be changed to \"it has been read\", the second phrase can be easily changed to \"it has being read.\"\n7. The second question (where would a person keep a BOOK while it has been read?), does not require a change-the-phrase answer; it requires a place where the book is being stored after having been read.\n8. The only answer that can fit the description is \"in bed\", although the book may not be physically in bed but the place can still be considered in-bed.\n9. A closet, a school library, a classroom, or a desk cannot be considered the correct answer because these answers do not necessarily indicate the place where the book has been read but only where the book is now.\n10.

Mountains are not the only thing that may be possible for the planet to have.\n3. If the planet doesn't have water as well as no clouds, then it cannot have no air.\n4. Without air, the plants would not be able to generate oxygen.\n5. Therefore, mountains are not a definite for the planet to have, and there may be other possibilities.\n6.

{"idx": 160, "text": "1: The term that is closest to this situation is 'happiness'.\n2. The emotion of getting paid is a positive one, as it means that one has earned money and has been successful in their job or endeavor.\n3. Some may experience a sense of relief or gratification at receiving a paycheck, but these emotions do not necessarily convey the same level of joy or satisfaction as happiness.\n4. Other emotions related to paying bills or spending money, are likely to be more negative as these activities may be associated with additional costs or responsibilities.\n5. Therefore, the answer would be happiness (D).\nSo the final answer here is D: happiness\n\nInput: The manager's plan seemed complicated, which was the reason why he was so nervous.

She can't be explained in terms of being tense, tired or anxious because she was the one planning the event. \n4. She can't also be explained in terms of uncertainty as the plan was too complicated.\n5. There's only one remaining answer which is: She was nervous, as a plan that seems complicated will be a cause for concern, making the manager anxious.\n6. Therefore, our answer should be: E: She was nervous.\nSo the final, correct answer is E: She was nervou", "answer": "C: happiness"}
{"idx": 164, "text": "1)The paragraph describes the situation of a person running barefoot on a hot pavement, and Bob's feet hurt.\n2)Options A: a bed of Nails refers to uncomfortable situation as the choice itself uses a word opposite of a \"comfortable\"  such as a bed. It does not fit the context.\n3)The context of Option D: ground/pavement also refers to pain and not comfort, which means option D: ground is also not suitable.\n4)Option C: attractive consistent looks relates to physical appearance, which is irrelevant to the question.\n5)So, the best answer is Option E: city block as the description of Bob's running includes \"From the corner store to his house\" which is obviously a short distance from store to the house. Furthermore, Bob must have run from an adjacent house to reach the corner store, and this adjacent house would be either adjacent to the store or at the corner itself; the \"corner store\" is at a corner. So, we can confidently infer Bob's running direction from the store to his home is a direction crossing the city block diagonally, either northwest or southeast.\n6)So the final answer is Option E: City Block.\nSo, the final answer is E.

The phrase \"if not constructed well\" implies that if the building is not built according to specific standards or regulations, it might be considered...\n\n3.) \"massive\" (choice A) refers to something that has a large amount of mass or substance. For example, an elephant or a whale could be considered a massive animal because they have a large amount of mass.  \n\n4.) \"insubstantial\" (choice B) could be used to describe something that is not very real or substantial, especially when trying to build something on a large scale like an entire building. \n\n5.) \"dwarf\" (choice C) is often used to describe something that has a small amount of mass or substances, like the term we use with people - dwarf. While a real massive building could be seen as insubstantial or dwarf, this word choice implies a negative connotation with reference to the building being poorly constructed, thus it's not ideal. \n\n6.) \"inconsequential\" (choice E) is an adjective that describes something that is not important or not significant enough to make a big difference. For example, an action that results in something inconsequential is an action that has little impact on the situation.\n\n\n7.) \"good\" (choice D) is an adjective used to suggest a positive outcome or a favorable outcome.

Choices: \tA: romance B: music C: passion D: movement E: confidence\nOutput: 1: The question is asking what a shy person might find appealing in dancing. \n2. The word \"shy\" is used to refer to an introverted and socially awkward person who is reluctant to express their emotions in public. \n3. The listed choices, \"romance\", \"music\", \"passion\", \"movement\", and \"confidence\" - while they describe elements used in dance - are not necessarily appropriate for a shy person. \n4. A shy person might find the word \"movement\" off-putting, as it denotes physical activity or mobility. \n5. Also, if the person is uncomfortable expressing themselves verbally, \"passion\" or \"romance\" might not appeal to them. \n6. However, a shy person may find themselves appreciating \"confidence\" as it may be expressed through the movement of the body or through spoken word. \n7. \"Confidence\" could also be seen as comforting and reassuring, as opposed to \"romance\" or \"passion\", which can be perceived as overbearing or intimidating in certain situations.\n8.

Where could they use a translator for assistance? Choices:  a. in a courtroom\nb. at a restaurant\nc. in the hospital\nd. outside their native country\ne. within a university\nOutput: 1 When there exists a language barrier between two parties, a translator can be employed to assist in the communication process by translating the spoken language into a different language. \n2. A translator is typically used in situations where the lack of shared language creates misunderstandings or difficulties in communication, such as a courtroom (for legal and official situations).\n3. In this example, a translator is used in a restaurant in the hospital, in their native country and within a university.\n4. Based on the context, the correct choices are: b. at a restaurant, c. in the hospital, and e. within a university.\n5.

{"idx": 180, "text": "1.) The question is asking about a change that occurs to a person prior to or after death as a result of injuries or illness.\n2.) The options can be considered in the context of their plausibility as a cause of death.\n3.) Option A (\"sleeping longer\") is a physical or mental state that can happen to anyone in any circumstance. It doesn't explain a change of the person's appearance, and can't be considered a cause of death. \n4.) Option B (\"getting cold\") refers to a bodily reaction that can either have a positive or negative effect. It's plausible that a sick or ill person could become cold and could even develop hypothermia, but it doesn't explain the change of color or death that is required in the context of the question. \n5.) Option C (\"death and decay\") suggests that the human body is physically deteriorating and rotting. Whilst this might be a natural course of events after death, it's not consistent with the way the question is described. Furthermore, the word \"death\", which is used in Option C, could be interpreted as a synonym for option D (\"change of color\"/\"stop breathing\") and may not require as an explicit detail as in the case of Option D.\n6.) Option D (\"change of color\") suggests that a person's skin is changing from one color to another, either due to illness or as a result of death. In the context of the question, as a possible cause of change of color or death upon the person, it's a plausible explanation. \n7.)

C: music shop\n\nInput: The man was disappointed, he'd been at his office all day while his friends enjoyed themselves by what? Choices: A: swimming B: the beach C: boating D: playing in the park E: a party\nOutput: 1: The man was disappointing. The fact that he'd be at his office all day and his friends not showed that he was alone.The context suggests that the day was a holiday. \n2: To describe a day off in a holiday mood, there is no word that fits best except 'enjoy themselves'. Therefore: \n3: The most reasonable activity to be enjoyed is going out for a holiday. The context also tells us it's a pleasant outdoor activity. \n4: The answer is A: swimming/at the beach.\nSo the final result should be: C: a party\n\nInput: Where else could he be?

The correct answer choice sea suggests a more natural home for water than the other three choices - water, a lake and an underground\n5. Choice B is wrong because a sea is a part of ocean, but the question was asking where else could he be, not where else could ocean be. \n6. Choice D is wrong", "answer": "B: music shop"}

'Murder most vile' is a phrase that indicates malicious intent. 'Drill' is an activity as well. 'Bargemaster' is about having some relationship, rather than about an action taken. 'Understand' is about an ability to do something, perhaps.\n5) 'Learn' is a verb that denotes an action. So, after considering all that, we can rule out some and determine that the answer must be a verb.\n6) We can also eliminate 'Murder most Vile' because by definition it isn't an activity but an intention that precedes the activity.\n7) Since, according to the context of the question - which refers to a certain amount skill achieved through the practice - only 'bargemaster' and 'learn' remain.\n8) The phrase 'bargemaster, learn' sounds like the result of someone who has learned to operate a certain type of boat, so the only likely response is 'bargemaster'.

E: to win in a battle.\nOutput: 1 This is not an 'it's possible that\u2026.' question.\n2 The correct answer is B (Make themselves feel old).\n3. The question doesn\u2019t make sense.\n4. It's an 'it's true that\u2026.' question. The correct answer is A(To make others feel happy).\n5.

{"idx": 304, "text": "1) To start, the question wording \"what do rich people like in term of bagels\" suggests that bagels are an item/food that can be seen as common to both rich people and poor people alike, the phrase rich/wealthy are typically used to describe the privileged and wealthy class in societies.\n\n2. Bagels are a type of bread roll, a roll that is often toasted with various spreads often found at breakfast time and lunch time.\n\n 3. It is common for any kind of person to have certain preferences on personal likes and dislikes, but the question does not ask for something related to personal tastes but that of a rich person.\n\n4. Rich people can be seen as people who are very wealthy or highly privileged in life, wealthy people can have various kinds of income and net worth, but for the sake of this question, let focus on the wealthy person who have high net worth.\n\n5. Using this context, the choices above can be narrowed down to what rich people like to have.\n\n6. Looking at the choices A: poor, B:sleepy C:plain D: needy E : homeless, there are 2 choices here that the question doesn't talk about at all and are the correct choice by removing the other choices.\n\n7. Choice A: poor - not related.\n\n    Choice B: sleepy - not related.\n8. Since the focus is based on the wealthy, and not their social circle, or the bagels themselves.\n\n9. Choice D: needy - also not related.\n10. Choice E homeless - not in question.\n\n11. Therefore, the correct choices are B+C: plain and sleepy\n\n12. These can be chosen as the correct answer because they suggest that the rich can have other preferences aside from just the bagels - it can be anything, that doesn't have any relation to how rich they are. The idea is the rich and wealthy can be rich with different kinds of things but their richness also doesn't necessarily mean they are incompetent with their own bagels choice.\n\nSo the final answer if B+C: Plain and sleepy", "answer": "C: plain"}

A: park B: parking lot C: gas station D: dealership E: garage\nOutput: 1 A car showroom is any space where cars for sale are displayed. However, a car showroom is not considered as a place to buy a car.\n2. If you go through the choices, a dealership (A) is commonly a place where cars are sold to the public. In fact, a lot of individuals choose to buy cars in dealerships.\n3. A garage (E) may be used to store a car, but it may not be the intended place to buy a car, it is generally a place for the car to rest and it is not commonly visible in the main car showroom.\n4. A gas station (B) may offer cars for sale, but it is not specifically considered to be a car showroom.\n5. Finally, a parking lot (C) is not a place to buy a vehicle.\n6. Therefore, there is only one correct answer, which is A: dealership, as it specifically refers to a space where cars for sale can be presented.\n7. This is the only choice that includes the word \"dealership\" as well as indicating \"a place where cars for sale are visible\".\nSo the final answer would be A: dealership\n\nInput: What might an employee", "answer": "C: criticism"}
{"idx": 312, "text": "Answers: 1. The context is a grocery store. At the grocery store, there is a queue.  Customers stand in the queue to get the items they purchased.  There is food at a grocery store, not cars, so the choices with cars are out.  In this case, the only choices are line and order. \n2 and 3. The children in front of them are loud and disturbing.  They cause delays and frustrations, so \"the line was fast, but was out of order\" is not necessarily the case.  Also, frustration is a very broad word which is not necessarily an immediate reaction of seeing the kids in front of them being loud. \n4. They were what? The only choice that is a correct description of what they are feeling is the word \"annoyance\".  The answer has to be between irritation and annoyance. I think the answer is closer to \"irritation\" because the word itself is \"irritate\" to mean \"annoy\", and \"the children in front of them\" have annoying and irritating effects \"the line was fast but was out of order\", and the word is also used to mean feeling \"irritated\".  Therefore, the answer is \"out of order\". \nSo the final answer will be E: Out of order\n\nInput: Which of the following is closest in meaning to:  the act of moving one's feet as to the next place.

In other words, the choice which is closest to the word with the same context. \nThe word \"go\" in English has many meanings, the most common meaning is \"move from place to place.\" The meaning of \"go\" in the sentence is to \"move.\" The word \"walk\" in English has many different meanings, but they are all different, but they are all to be the same meaning as the sentence. The word \"walk\" has the same meaning in this sentence. \nThe word that describes a path does not mean the word \"walk\" is a different word. You need to pay attention to the context in which you're walking. \nSo, the only answer that is correct is B: take", "answer": "B: being annoyed"}

The first one could suggest that the child played in a room of a particular size in his house. This answer would not be correct because the child's room, as stated in the question, was very large compared to the house itself.\n3. The other option \"B. nurserywould suggest a child's \"playroom\" was relatively small compared to other rooms in a building. This answer is also incorrect because a playroom of any size is considered large to a child and we can conclude from the context that the child's room was extremely large, much larger than any playroom. \n4. Therefore, answer \u201cE. retirement home\" is the correct one because it implies a large room located in a particular place where there is a high number of people present.

{"idx": 324, "text": "1.) The question is trying to get the meaning of a figurative phrase from the choices.\n2.) Teamwork is typically associated with sports or games, so it wouldn't make sense to ask where players would be signing up for teamwork instead. \n3.) That said, teamwork can also signify working together with a group of people towards a common goal, so choices C and D do contain information relating to teamwork and its place. \n4.) Therefore, the answer could be C: play games, or D: play ball. \n5.) But the choices aren't clearly specifying that the teamwork activity involves sports or games.\n6.) On the other hand, the phrase \"play chess\" makes sense out of context, it's a reference to the mental activities involved in strategic planning and competition. \n7) It's quite evident that play chess is associated with games of mind.\n8.) Based on that, the correct answer should be either play games or play chess. \n9.) If it was choice A, play things, then we are not making sense of the figurative phrase by understanding what it means literally.\n10.) Hence, play games fits the context and has a figurative connection to the phrase. \nSo the final answer ends up being: Play games.\n\nInput:Why do the cats not want the mouse to be eaten? Choices: 1.

A roadblock, generally speaking is something that prevents people from moving, for instance in the case of roadblock, usually a road.\n3. If the question were more specifically about a type of 'roadblock' (exactly an obstruction, as the definition of roadblock suggests) then choices 'A' (public place), 'D' (hoverboard) and possibly 'B' (space shuttle) would be relevant.\n4. However, looking at this from a general perspective, choices 'A', 'B', 'C' and 'E' cannot be chosen as there is no reason to travel to a public place, drive on a road, ride a hoverboard or explore a supermarket.\n5. To get a more general answer and avoid considering more specific choices, one would have to think about what'space' is a place where a variety of activities can be undertaken.\n6. 'Space' does not suggest the planet Mars or even something as general as planet 'earth', but something more broad, like the 'universe'.\n7. The activity that could be undertaken in this universe is a variety of 'exploration' including'research', 'observations' and'scientific experiments'.\n8. The best answer choice relates to something that can be used to 'go to' space, namely a'space shuttle'.\n9. Therefore, the answer to this question would be D: a space shuttle.\nSo the final answers are C: space shuttles and  D: hoverboards.", "answer": "C: space shuttle"}

Choices C and D make up the remaining choices.\n3. They do not contain the word 'at' and since the context of the questions asks for 'the table'. Which can be considered the place. Hence, they are not the appropriate choice.\n4. The correct choice is thus either A or B. \n5. If we plug in the numbers given in the choices and simplify it, we get\n(11)*2+10+2=40+2, if choice A is picked.\n(12)*2+6+2=22+2, if choice B is picked.\n6: Since 12> 11 and 12> 6.\n7: The correct choice is thus choice B.\nSo the final choice is B: 12\n\nInput: How would a doctor recommend keeping warm?

The other words that can be derived from the context provided are meat grinder, stable, red Barn, gate and green field.\n3. 'Red barn' can refer to a variety of buildings, including barns, but it does not necessarily fit the context as there's no mention about red in it.\n    - As for'stable', it could be relevant to the story provided although it also doesn't entirely align to the context of a cow leaving its stable.\n4. Similarly, 'green fields' may or may not exist in the story because it is not explicitly stated in the sentence. \n5. In comparison, the word 'cow' can be used as an adjective in this context as cow's are animals that are often found in fields.\n    - In other words, we can say that the cow is a cow. \n6. Furthermore, meat grinder does not seem to fit the context because a meat grinder specifically refers to a device used to grind meat. \n7. The answer must be based on what we can derive from the context itself.\n8. Therefore, the right answer here is A: Meat grinder (the cow is a cow).\nSo the final answer would be A: meat grinder\n\nInput: How did the author write about a horse that is fast?

The term'school band' could include clarinet playing, but not necessarily only clarinets. Clarinets are not often the focus of a school band, as other instruments (such as drum) tend to be more important in a band ensemble.\n3b. Therefore, a school band is not the answer.\n4a. Music stores are a common place where instruments, including clarinets, can be purchased.\n4b. While music stores are a place where clarinets are sold, it is not specifically a place to get one. \n5a. An opera house where opera music is performed is a place where clarinists may be required for a performance, however, the actual purchase of a bass clarinet is not necessarily involved in this context.\n5b. Therefore, an opera house is not the answer. \n6a. You would go to home to get a bass clarinet. \n6b.

Choices: A: Barcelona B: Real Madrid\nOutput: 1:\"Which team has a larger market \"means to have a larger valuation.\n2. Valuation is normally expressed as a monetary value, as it is in our current example.\n3. The term \"valuation\" implies, of course, that one is comparing the value of two different things or items.\n4. Here, the teams in Barcelona and Real Madrid are both valuing their respective teams at a higher number than the other.\n5. Looking closer, however, the values are larger by different amounts. \n6. Barcelona is 8 times more valuable than Real Madrid, a number which is significantly higher than the number of different times that Real Madrid is more valuable than Barcelona. \n7. Barcelona has a larger market value than Real Madrid, which is the final answer.\nSo the final choice is: A: Barcelona\n\nInput: What makes someone think they got away with deception?

{"idx": 372, "text": "1.'With whom?' is the only suitable word to be selected from choices A-E, this is because 'who' (in choice E) includes 'whom' as one of its pronouns.\n2. 'With whom' denotes two people, hence the two alternatives 'his own family' and 'her own family' does not fit.\n3. The term 'friend' (in choice D) is a noun, and is used to designate two people so again does not fit. Hence it's ruled out.\n4. The same can be said for two choices, choice B and choice E as they refer to one person.\n5. 'His body', 'his eyes' and 'his hair' are body parts. Hence they're not applicable.\n6. The other choice that excludes 'own family', 'good health' and 'her finger' is 'brown skin'.\n7. Hence, the answer is C: own family (C)\nSo the final answer the answer is C: her own family\n\nInput: Who is she referring to in her statement, \"the baker\"? Choices:  A person from the shop B: herself C: another baker D: another customer E: the family\nOutput: 1.\"Who is she referring to in the statement, \"the bakery\"?'\n2. The word refer is in agreement, and the choice must use the pronoun it refers to, hence, \"her statement\" will not be appropriate to use.\n3. The phrase 'the bakery' means the place of sales, and is not the same as an individual, therefore the phrases 'a person from the shop', 'herself', 'another baker', 'another customer' and 'the family' are not appropriate.\n4. 'the person' is a noun and does not include the pronoun 'it' which refers to the preceding subject.\n5. 'the bake shop' and 'her shop' are phrases with a shop as the subject, they are not correct either.\n6. \"the store\" was ruled out earlier for the same reasons.\n7. Hence, \"herself\" is the best choice in this context.\nSo the final option is C. the option A person from the shop\n\nInput: Which color is the best to use to mark a hazard on the road?

The ferret 2. lots of attention.\n5. Now there is an adjective and a noun to be compared.  There are two possibilities:\n    - Ferret (F) has lots of attention (A) => Ferret (F) is lots of attention (A).\n\n    - lots of attention (A and F) have lots of attention (A), therefore, lots of attention is lots of attention (AA).\n6. Let's begin with one of the option's answer. \n    - The option A is not correct as the adverb phrase \"lots of\" modifies the noun \"attention\" not \"ferret\", \"attention\" is the adjective and must be attached to the word \"lots\". If we swap the adjective and noun, \"ferret\" can't be pronounced properly as it is \"ferret getting lots\". \n    - The answer choice E is incorrect as it contains the word \"mother\". It should be replaced.\n\n    - The option B is incorrect, in the phrase \"sick bay\", although it might make sense in some context, according to the current context \"sick bay\" does not exist.\n\n    - Option F is incorrect because the phrase \"own home\" modifies the adjective \"lots of\" instead of \"ferret\"; \"lots of\" means \"a great amount of\u201d.\n\n    - The last option in D describes a place where animals are on display so that people can pay an admission fee to see them.

{"idx": 580, "text": "1.\"Instituting civil action\" is a more formal way of saying bringing a civil case to court or pursuing legal action regarding a dispute or grievance.\n2.\"Instituted\" could be to describe civil actions such as marriage, organization, and the creation of schools, which would not necessarily be associated with feelings.\n3.\"Feeling\" is a more likely candidate as all the other choices are either formal nouns, or verbs.\n4. The choice of \"complications\" is vague and does not relate to the context (brining a civil action).\n5. \"Tiredness\" may be associated with feeling but it's more of exhaustion rather than a necessary step involved in a civil case.\n6. The choice of 'angry' can cause some conflict as emotional aspects may be associated with a civil action, but that would depend on the case itself.\n7. 'anger' is commonly used to represent a stronger feeling than 'tiredness' so it could fit in as an alternative answer with the option of 'angry' being the actual feeling behind instituting civil action.\n8.\"Trial\" is a word related to court processes.\n9.'Court' and 'court case' could also lead to a trial, but it's more likely that 'Court case' would be used when referring to the legal process. \n10.\"Trial\" is also a common phrase used with civil cases.\n11.

Considering the choices, A (furniture store), B (fishing camp), C (hardware store), and D (sporting goods store) are all locations that sell fishing rods.\n3. Though these locations may be places where one can buy a particular item, they are locations that are not typically associated with the purchase of goods.\n4. Option E (engine) is not a location but rather an object that could be used to fish.\n5. Option E is the only possibility that does not describe an actual place where people can buy a fishing pole, so E is eliminated.\n6. There are only three options left.\n7. Option B states that one can buy a fish pole at a fishing camp, which seems to make sense. \n8. However, an option already exists that covers this. There's no need for a double-entry for the same location (a fishing camp). If there were such a thing, one would presume it would have been mentioned earlier.\n9. Option C says one can buy a fish rod at a hardware store, which also seems to make sense. However, it's already been established that such an objective can be met elsewhere.\n10.

Considering that the context is only the middle-east, then options like china, or a city in india, are not correct as they do not belong to or are in the middle east. \n3. Further, option B suggests texas and since the question is not asking for a specific part of the map that has a temple, option B is also not correct. \n4. Option C could be correct for a city in the middle east that is known for a Temple. \n5. However, the correct answer that matches the context is option D which suggests \"China\" which is the middle-eastern country and thus, is the correct answer that matches this context of middle-east. \n6.

Choices: A: bumpy B: blustery C: boaster D: bouncy\nOutput: 1: The word in question would be 'busty' so considering all the choices, we can quickly reject C and D as they do not make any sense with the word in question. 2: The choices left to be examined are 'A', 'B' and 'B'. 3. This further eliminates the choice 'B' as 'boaster' means to brag and the question would not refer to that. 4. From the choices left, 'A' (bumpy) does not make sense as 'bumpy' suggests the word 'buttocks' and buttocks is not the question in concern. 5.

{"idx": 596, "text": "1) The answer to this question will consist of a verb that describes how mosquitoes affect their environment.\n2. The verb'move' does not reflect on the way that mosquitoes affect the flowers, or 'pollinate' because they typically do not feed on flower nectar.\n3. The sentences 'it was that the insects' and'made the flowers pollinate' could be understood to be the same. Both sentences include the word 'insects' as well as the word 'pollinate'.\n4. Therefore, 'help flowers pollinate' matches the context of the sentence and is the correct answer.\n5. 'Help' can be a verb meaning 'assist' or 'guide'.\n6. 'Pollinate' refers to the process of fertilization in plants, especially when pollen is transferred between flowers, resulting in the production of new flowers.\n7.

The phrases are given: I used to have and I have.  \n3. The question is asking us if \"I used to have once and a week\" is the same as \"I have (once and a week) twice a week\". If the two phrases are similar, then choice A is correct, otherwise choice B is correct when the phrases are different. \n4. \"I used to have\" means \"behaved in a way no longer the norm\" thus, \"but now I have one\", implies the norm changed to not eating so many ice cream cones twice a week. \n5. Choices C, D, and E imply the same thing as the given \"once and a week\". \n6.

The rest of the sentence specifies New York or Idaho as possible locations, that means the department store in Northwest USA could be located in Idaho or not.\n7) Therefore, the answer has to be the closest one to the Northwest USA.\n8) Looking at the choices: New York (B.), Big city (D.), Idaho (C.). We see that New York refers only to the big city.\n9) This means that Big city (D.) is the closest to the Northwest USA, since it's not referring to Idaho. \n10) As for Idaho (c), it is a place referred to in the same sentence. \n11) So if we discard D. for not referring to a place close enough to NW USA, we can rule out C.\n12) Therefore, The answer is\nD.

We also need to exclude certain types of police jobs from the answer because the sentence would not make any sense otherwise (for example policing an academy does not mean only one type does nothing but police academies but would be included if it was the only type doing that activity).\n3.As such D is eliminated because they can never be seen in cars to do anything so they can not be the policemen doing that task.\n4.C is also eliminated because policemen are not boarding vessels as an activity, and to the best of our knowledge they will not be seen doing so.\n5.E is also eliminated because drug policing is only for certain authorities.\n6.So we're left with A or B, which are both options suggesting that traffic controlling and vessel boarding are in the same category as police directing traffic and policemen boarding vessels. \n7.Therefore, the only choice here is A: Direct traffic. \nSo the final answer the answer is A: Direct traffic\n\nInput:What does the snake always do?

The answer options are: street, binder, obesity, living room and office suite.\n4. Though the words 'obesity' and 'living room' fit the context, they are definitely not proper nouns for what we are looking for.\n5. 'Binder' is a possible option because it can contain papers and organize them, but it is not clearly the noun we need in the sentence.\n6. Finally, the only answer option that can be used as part of a proper noun in this context is 'office suite', since it's a type of room in an office complex or building used to organize and store papers.\n7.

A rain forest is a natural environment for monkeys to live in, however not everyone could live in a rainforest due to the inhospitable condition that it presents to some individuals.\n4. Tree tops can be good hiding spaces for monkeys, however they cannot be confining, as individuals can wander and move about freely.\n5. A toy store could carry toys that look like monkeys in captivity, but this isn't the focus of the question.\n6. Zoological gardens often feature monkeys, and in these instances, the animals are confined to a cage and therefore could be considered captive.\n7. Outside of zoological gardens, the only form of a \"zoo\" that is relevant here is the great outdoors.

{"idx": 660, "text": "1) The term'scenic route' generally refers to a more picturesque or interesting route that one might take while traveling. \n2) Taking a'scenic route', therefore, involves choosing a different journey that is less direct but more pleasing to the eye and potentially more interesting.\n3) The question asks which of the answer options best describes the'scenic route'.\n4) The options that are not the'scenic routes' are the following:\n    - A 'countryside' refers to the type of scenery found throughout rural areas.\n    - The 'United States' is not a place but instead a country.\n    - A 'beach' is a type of location that may be picturesque but it is unlikely to be the best choice for a scenic route.\n    - The same can be said of the option 'atlas' as it refers to a specific place where a traveler might find a map. \n5) Thus, we're left with two answer options 'higway that cut through the developed land' and 'highway that cut through the united states'.\n6) The phrase 'highway that cuts through' is very common, but 'highway that cut(s) [and not through] the countryside' is a commonly known phrase as well. \n7) The other option 'highway that cut the countryside', doesn't make any sense as a phrase and thus is not relevant.\n8) Therefore, the answer for the question is C: highway that cut through the unites states.\nSo the final Answer is C: highway that Cuts Through the United States", "answer": "A: countryside"}

We cannot know if a job seeker are intending to provide work or not. It is unclear. So, they are not the right choice.\n    - C: income: this answer choice is probably the one we want. If we get a job, we want to get income. So answer choice C: income is right.\n    - D: hope: it is a nice answer, but it is the same as the answer choice after the \"when\". In answer choice B is 'employment' and answer choice C is 'income', there is almost no place for 'hope' to come in. So D: hope is not the right choice. \n    - E: offer: is not the correct choice. People apply to jobs to get an income, an offer is a request or proposition to do something, it is unlikely. \nSo answer choice is B: employment.\n4. Now, the context of the sentence is 'you are seeking to provide yourself with *income* when you are applying a job'. That means when we apply for a job, and we want to provide income. \n5. We should think \"you are seeking to provide income to yourself\" \"income\" and \"provide yourself with income\" means the same thing so we can ignore the first part. 'provide yourself' and 'provide income' are the same thing, so we only need to choose the word that describe the relationship between two parties- employer and employee, employee and job seeking- not one person.\n6.

The next letter is B for a B&B. A B&B is known for its small rooms, and not as fancy as hotels, which is why in B&Bs the rooms are small and cheaper and people don\u2019t stay there just for a night or for a business trip, but rather for an experience and because of this they often don\u2019t get distracted during the day as much and they feel more relaxed.\n\n### Question Answer\n### Instruction\nAnswer the following multiple choice questions. \n\n## Instructions\n\n## Question 1\nWhere might a television used at\nnight be found?\n\nA. cabinet\nB. house\nC. apartment\nD. bedroom\nE. woods\n\n## Question 2\nPeople often watch TV in their\nbedrooms during the night because TV is\none of the devices that keep us relaxed\nbefore sleep.\n\nWhere should a person stay so", "answer": "C: drugstore"}

If looking at each answer separately, airports are locations where people are likely to travel and buy airplane tickets, which is not relevant to the context of shopping for groceries. \n4. Also, the urban area, although a destination in and of itself, is not a location where people go to buy groceries. 5. Shopping malls, like airports, are also not necessarily places where people buy groceries. Therefore, the only place where people buy grocercies or other items is the shopping mall. \n6.

The options A and B seem related to something he could have done or worn to prolong the effectiveness of his escape. \n4. Option E,'sit down', is unlikely, and does not provide insight into preventing the short-lived escape. \n5. Options C and D seem to imply that he should have thought about resting or running longer to have a greater or lasting escape. \n6. Option D is unlikely to be correct because the subject is trying to escape and would not be at a physical state that would allow him to run longer. \n7. Options A, C and D don't stand out as obviously relevant, but the subject is running and they are about doing something or going somewhere related to his feet, therefore A - tie shoelace  - is more likely relevant. \n8. However, tie shoelaces can be tied, which would cause them to loosen. \n9. Therefore, the answer B - rest, would also be more likely because he could rest from his feet which would allow him to continue running if he does continue running at some time. \n10. Alternatively, he could sit down after tripping. \n11. Therefore, the most relevant and also most likely options are B - rest, and C which are essentially the same choice with both referring to a resting period which he could do to extend the length of time his escape continued. \n12.

When the spring season was over, who did that place belong to? Choices: 1 A: Gardener 2 B: The Owner 3 C: Florist 4 D: Landscaper\nOutput: 1The question asks who will be responsible for the garden after the end of the Spring season. There is a hint of someone who could do this from the choice 'Gardener', 'Landscaper' and 'Florist'.\n2. Looking at 3 of the options, they are as follows: \n    - Gardener is a possibility because a gardener tends to someone else's gardens for a living. If the owner of the property is no longer here, then the gardener would go to the person who owns the building or rents the place.\n    - The landscaper, being the gardener, is only a possibility if the gardener doesn't do it by himself.\n    - The Florist is unlikely to be the one to take care of it because she/he does not specialize in flowers and fol", "answer": "E: anger"}

A steakhouse specializes in steaks and other types of meat, as well as other food like baked potatoes as the name suggests.\n3. This isn\u2019t about a steakhouse in general, but a specific type of steakhouse known as the'steakhouse with a view' which specializes in meat dishes and also has a nice view.\n4. A corn field, is a specific land plot dedicated solely to growing corn with nothing else around.\n\n5. Corn fields in the US are normally small with a few stalks of corn that stand out of the ground in small bunches. This can look pretty boring from the outside or from a distance.\n6. Therefore, finding a steakhouse with corn fields has more to do with the view that you can have from the inside of the steakhouse than finding the actual corn fields around it.\n7. The best option in this case is C: mexico.\n8. When it comes to the view, Mexico is a nation with gorgeous sceneries.\n9.

Looking through the choices of 'grief,'solo', 'isolation'and 'pleasure', it seems like 'pleasure' may be an incorrect answer. \n3. Grief and isolation make sense for this situation, however, pleasure is an interesting answer that may require more thought because \"pleasure\" in this definition is a noun while the options available are verbs. We can't say \"to have pleasure\" but rather \"to be pleased\". \n4. This is why \"pleasure\" is a great answer, it's a word you can replace any verb with and make sense to the question. \n5.

The phrase \"and stop being married to someone\" indicates that the person who is experiencing this is most likely just starting to date new people after an end of their marriage, or, the person who has been married for a long time. \n8. This indicates that the phrase \"stop being married\" should not be replaced with a past situation in their life but rather a current situation that is happening recently. \n9.

This choice may reflect on the personality of the person rather than relating to gifts or gift purchases. \n6) With choice C, 'earn' is used here to describe the person's activity to gain money, as the act of earning a wage or salary would be done with intention to have money. However, to be 'gift' is different. 'Gift' can be given freely without any requirement to have money or possessions. If a person is known to provide 'gifts', then they would be known as a 'gift buyer'. \n7) A present buyer would also be called a 'gift buying'. This statement makes clear that the word needed refers to the same thing. So, the choice C: earn money cannot be selected. \n8) Choice D would be a possible choice, as it refers to'someone who has money'. However, the'money' that the person has should be used to purchase gifts. The word does not say that they use their money to acquire wealth or possessions, so the statement is not contradictory enough. \n9) In conclusion, the only choice that fits the statement is choice E: 'gift buyer', which correctly defines and clarifies the meaning of the statement.

Looking at the context, as a place in which we can live and breathe, a house or a charming surround are out of scope for the air we are talking about. In addition, those places have a larger surface area and are not specific locations, unlike the choice D.\n5. The train station is not specific enough, as its air is breathed by many people traveling in/out and does not remain in the station for an extended period.\n6.

(6) \"He didn't know any truth\" seems to be a possible interpretation. (7) \"He didn' believe the truth\" might also be an interpretation.(8) He has no idea what truth is.(9) He doesn't know if there is any truth. (10) So if any of these are right, the answer should have some of the word elements \"truth\", \"understand\", \"know\", and \"there\", otherwise he's not interested in knowing the \"truth\".  (11) If any of these interpretations is correct, \"truth\", \"know\" and \"exist\" are must be also be contained in the word. (12) The word then must contain \"exist\" and the other two elements, but must not contain \"there\". (13) Therefore, the question can be re-formed as: Are there any correct antonyms of the word 'Truth', which we are looking for? (14) The answer obviously can be none.

Given that the context is exercise and workout related, we can discard the other choices.\n3.

One would be relaxing after a tiresome job and/or after a tiresome day at school, and the other one would be to prevent the body from gaining weight.\n5.

Tiredness, however, while it's also related to tiredness and fatigue, it's a more general feeling.\n8.

There's no specific reason why you would be tired.\n10. You could also be tired because of your lack of energy or energy that just drained out from you because of your heavy workload.\n11. Therefore, both D: losing weight and A: fatigue answers might have a slight conflict as fatigue is a general term, it can be related to other contexts such as studying and sleeping but it's not specific to exercise-related tiredness.\n12. So, we'll discard A: fatigue.\n13. Now we're left with D: losing weight and B: relaxation.\n14. Losing weight isn't directly related to exercise and most definitely a reason to exercise.\n15. That leaves us looking at the option of relaxation.\n16. It's highly likely people work out to relax, and one could argue that relaxation is the main purpose and is what a gym represents.\n17.

In the first option, 'dry hair', refers to the weather or a physical characteristic. The sentence does not provide any further information that is related to the context given in the first clause, so it can be eliminated. \n4. In the second option, 'blowing hard', is a verb from a list of verbs used to describe strong wind, however it does not match the context of the question or the first clause, so this choice is also eliminated. 5. In the third option, 'change direction', does not fit the context of the sentence. \n6. In the fourth option, 'wave the wheat', again does not fit the context. \n7. In the final option,'spreading', is an adjective or participle, and fits the given context, as it describes the way in which a large wind can affect an area of land. \n8.

The possible answers to the given question include:\n   - 'to keep it alive' - This choice does not refer to the survival of fish as the question asked, but rather to the survival of the bait - so it is false.\n   - 'to make it taste better' - This suggestion also does not apply to fish as the question asks but refers to salted fish as food - therefore false.\n   -  'to stop it from getting hurt' - this option is related to fish-on-fish violence on a small scale - so it's true and false as well.\n   -'to kill it' - this suggestion is related to the use of salt as a means of killing an intended animal - so it's also false.\n   2.

The question asks for the source of the stale smell. \n3. A cupboard is where food is stored and that can be either old or new. Hence, a cupboard is excluded. \n4. Since the question mentions a house with a kitchen, the choices to be evaluated should not be the home itself, but the kitchen. \n5. One should check to see if the floor, carpet, cabinets, walls, or ceiling of the kitchen is the source of the smelly odor, and determine if anything there is the source of decay. \n6. 'Cupboard' can also refer to a type of room that has a closet-like space in it, usually for personal belongings. \n7. 'Bathroom' is generally a room containing a bathtub that people would use for cleaning, as well as a toilet that they would use for defecating. \n8. 'Surface of earth' is a very broad answer and would not be necessary for this context. \n9. Hence, the answer could be either the floor, cabinets, walls or ceiling. \n10. Since 'floor' is closest to the ground with the least probability of containing rot, it should be the first and most commonly checked place. \n11. The correct answer is D: floor of kitchen.\nSo the final question is D: floor. This choice is also noteworthy. When considering the stale smell, there may be a number of objects that could be decaying. It could be food, a container, or a book.

As per the sentence \"where is one likely to purchase...\", the answer is looking for locations where vinyl products are available for purchase.\n4. A'safeway' is a large grocery store, which carries a wide variety of products but does not typically carry vinyl products (unless it's a specialty product).\n5. A'record album' is a collection of recorded music, not specific to how it is purchased.\n6. A'record store' is a brick and mortar location typically selling audio equipment and music, however, not necessarily vinyl - they could carry vinyl but it's not likely.\n7.

The plane's cabin is used for carrying people. \n4. That leaves us the remaining options: B crash, C slowdown, D living, E speedup. \n5. A crash option makes no logical sense - planes are built specifically NOT to crash.\n6. A living option is also a poor choice for a few reasons. Living in a cabin would be akin to living in a prison. And planes are for flying, not for living in.\n7. A slow-down option is also incorrect. The opposite of a slow-down is a speedup, which is ruled out.\n8. That leaves us with C slowdown and D living, which both mean an inhabitation for a long period of time, neither of which is accurate for the given context. \n9. There are only two choices left: B crash and E speedup.  \n\n10. Given the question has ruled crash out because it would be nonsensical and not required,  the possible choice would be E speedup.  There can be no crashes in an environment speeding up, which would cause the cabin to experience an acceleration.  Therefore, E speedup is the correct answer. \n\nSo finally, the final answer is E speedup.\n\nInput: A small town restaurant has a big sign out front with a picture of what?

Since the answer to the question is about how to use something, it's best to look at answers that relate directly to that. We might not immediately see it but using something is a way to take advantage of something, that is why to make refers - as in you make something functional for a use. On the other hand, to study doesn't fit so it's out of options available. This leaves us with Know, to use and to gain.\n3: From the choices available, as to use and to gain are not the correct options, the best answer would be To know, as it's the most useful.\nSo the final answers are: 1: To know, and 2 To learn\nSo the final answer it To Know\n\n\n---", "answer": "E: hands"}

However, while these activities are true, the question is in search of a verb that is an energy source for the horses. \n5. In the choice B, eat grass is in fact an activity that horses do, but it is not an energy source but more of a component of food for the horses. 6. Option D - dominated is an action that could suggest a source of power for the horses, however it also does not relate to the energy source concept. \n7. The choice drink coffee does not even have a correlation with horses or energy. \n8.

The best way to understand the phrase the 'Bird on the fence' is'stuck'. \n3. A 'Bird on the Fence' is an idiom and the description of the idiom is 'a helpless and useless person'. \n4. This is because the helpless and useless individual refers to someone who can't do anything, similar to a bird, who has difficulty 'getting off' the fence. \n5.

Looking through the options, one could argue that 'working out' is the appropriate phrase, but this phrase would be used to describe the general feeling of having done physical activity, rather than to specifically describe the feeling after a run.\n3. \"Falling down\" can be associated with the term \"get tired\", as one might trip and/or fall after working out, but this does not necessarily apply specifically to the feeling of satisfaction after a run.\n4. The phrase \"satisfaction\" can also be an accurate description of how someone would feel after a successful run, but this would be a more general feeling and not specifically related to the activity itself.\n5. Thus, the appropriate phrase must focus on the feeling after a run specifically.\n6. We can see that 'getting tired' and'sore' are not the correct choices, as these are more likely to describe the general feeling after any physical activity but would not specifically target having run.\n7. That leaves us with'satisfaction' and 'feeling of accomplishment'. While both of these phrases could be considered an accurate description of the feeling after having run, the wording of the question implies that there is something else that can be described in place of the phrase feeling of accomplishment. \n8. Therefore, the phrase is \"satisfaction\" in that this would be a more apt description of the desired feeling after a successful run.\nSo the final word is B: satisfaction\n\nInput: How many more calories does it take to get the right number of grams of protein as indicated in the answer?

Since James was trying to fight against a phenomenon that was happening (too much heat), he would need to do something that prevents it, or makes it stop. In this case options B, C, D & E are each an action that is occurring somewhere within his body, and not a concept to do something with or about that phenomenon. \n6. So the only solution he'd have would be to either'stop', 'prevent' or 'prevent','stop it', in which only'stop' best gives an action that could effectively stop the happening activity.\n7. Therefore the answer is C: expansion. \n8. A clue to this answer could be found in the question - James' body was cooling off too quick.\n9. If it was expanding at a rate where cooling was occurring so fast, then the body was expanding more than the environment it was cooling in, which could explain the 'loss of heat' in James.\n10.

{"idx": 98, "text": "1) The phrase \"lived in my mouth\" implies a person resided in one's mouth.\n2) A demonstration is a public presentation that demonstrates a product, skill, theory, or anything else in a specific way. Therefore, while it may be possible to put something in your mouth to demonstrate how it works, this cannot truly be considered living in one's mouth, as the term only implies a presence over time.\n3) A conference is a meeting, often with specific speakers, such as in a scientific or business setting, but again, the term cannot be used to describe someone actually residing in your mouth. \n4) A building is just that, a building, with a solid structure and many rooms. This is not the answer in this instance.\n5) A garage is another option, which does involve a space with defined dimensions, but again, this is just a garage. This space is not the correct response to the phrase \"live in my mouth\".\n6) An empty or inhospitable space is not an appropriate description of mouth.\n7) Finally, the most reasonable option in this case is for the person to be living in your mouth.\n8) Therefore, C is the most appropriate answer.\nSo the final Answer is C: In my mouth\n\nInput: What is considered the most difficult time for you personally?

Dinner time is not the most difficult time for many as it is one of the most popular times, people are in the mood for socializing and dining with others, or just relaxing from a long day with a family or friends.\n4. Rush hour also differs in difficulty depending on the specific day and location.\n5. The options'midnight' and'morning rush' are not a personal experience as people are sleeping and cannot necessarily say that those times are the most difficult for them.\n6.

Choices: A: reading B: writing C: vision D: eye strain E: blurriness\nOutput: 1: She struggled more with her vision.\n2. Reading is a skill used with clear vision and the body naturally wakes up from sleep with clarity of vision.\n3. Writing is the skill she is less skilled in, but it is mostly done during daytime.\n4. Eye strain is common for people who sleep during the day or work during the night and would be worse from looking at screens all night.\n5. Blurriness is not caused by looking at screens all night, it is caused by looking at objects that are further away and this is a skill she is not struggling with at all.\n6. Thus, the word she is struggling more with would have to be vision.\n7. Therefore if we are reading between the lines, she has a condition that affects her vision in nighttime and vision during the morning.\nSo the final word would be vision.\n\nInput:She had a bad headache, but when the doctor examined she had ear pain, what could be the cause?

The most appropriate answer that fits the context of drinking alcohol and eating fried foods would be a place where both services are commonly available, especially when drunk alcohol is considered.  \n5. There are instances where alcohol and fried products are served together in a same setting, such as in a pub/bar or a restaurant, or bar/tavern, these places would be the obvious answer to the question being asked. \n6. Another answer could be to suggest an airplane as you can find beer alcohol in a plane.\n7. But this would be highly unlikely as food and drinks in a plane are typically quite limited.

The first clue is that they are the only one there. This suggests that there are no other people around so there must be a logical explanation for what causes it to rain. \n3. The logical answer is that It was already rained. If there is no-one there then there must have been someone there before or else it's impossible for it to rain once. \n4.

It can be observed that the sentence structure of the question requires that one of the options below must be correct to choose the correct option as an answer choice\n3.  The first option has to be correct, so we are left with choices to choose from\n4.  By taking the first option, we are to infer that his mother is sick, which leaves us with choices II and III.\n5.  Now that we have been told his mother is sick, we need to use our inference and apply other options to the remaining choices to see if any of them could be deduced to be possible cause for his mother's sickness\n6.  If his 'wife' was ill, it doesn't mean his mother was ill too, however the next choice IV- it was a snow day could mean he couldn't get out of the house, and his computer was out of service for that purpose. \n7.  If his'mother' was ill, we then would still have the option V- his computer was out of the service, as he could have used it while his mother was taking care of her sickness. \n8.

'Hair salon', on the other hand, would not be a suitable answer as it refers to a specific type of business/service, not to a specific location.\n4. If we take a look at each of the remaining answers, we can identify that the phrase 'to look good' can only make sense in the context of an actual location/spot. \n5. This means that the options 'family room', 'flower garden', and'movie theater' would be the best fit for the phrase in question. \n6. However, there is a logical flaw in this answer.\n7. Consider that 'family room' could be in the home in general, 'a flower garden' - is usually outside and 'a movie theater' - would not be within the house itself.\n8. Thus, we need to pick a correct answer that would refer to a room or a space within the home itself.\n9. Considering this fact, the phrase'movie theater' can be excluded as it could potentially refer to an outside location.\n10. Therefore, the options left are:\n- 'family room'\n- 'flower garden'\n-'movie theater'\n- 'tropical forest'\n-'movie theatre'\n11. The options 'flower garden' and'movie theater', could both refer to an outside location, so they can be excluded too. \n12. Hence, we are left with the answer:  family room.\nSo the final answers are: Choices: [A]: family room", "answer": "A: family room"}

The context of the question, \"where are there more\", implies that the booths are more dense in an area.\n2: Looking at the choices: gas stations are unlikely to have booths; they are likely to have gas pumps instead. The same applies to city because it's unlikely that all roadsides have booths.\n3: Booths are found at train stations since a large number of people travel via train, they have booths to help facilitate travellers needs.

All the choices in the sentence seem to have a link with the idea about death.\n3. However, they do have significant differences in their meaning.\n4. If someone is described as 'dead', it implies that the person experienced physical death - a definite state of death. However, this is not the case in the given sentence.\n5. Similarly, 'dying' means the person is already going through the process of death, however, the given sentence is about someone who is still alive and will not have the immortal life. \n6. The only option that has a negative tone about life is 'Mortal', but that option could also be used to refer to the idea that someone with immortality had the ability to live forever, which may be confusing in the context of the question. \n7. The only option that could be used to refer to physical death or dying is 'Die'.\n8.

We have the choices Helicopter, own cars, speak words, believe in god and dance together.\n4. Looking at the first answer, helicopter is used in reference to the flying capacity of helicopters, which does not allow humans to personally transport themselves from one place to another. The second answer, own car, suggests that it's possible for a person to transport themselves if they had access to a car. But, if we look at the definition of transport, to transport ourselves means we are not in the same physical location. So, a car is not the answer.\n5. The third answer: speak words, refers to language as the basis of communication. This does not necessarily allow for transportation.\n6. The fourth answer, Believe in god, again refers to a state of mind and not a location.\n7. The fifth answer, dance together, is referring to the dance as a type of transportation or a form of moving about.\n8. It can be concluded hence, that the answer choice is Dance together as that is the only choice referring directly to the ability to transport oneself.\n9.

The sentence does not indicate a specific board game nor whether it's a multiplayer game or not.\n3. A toy store, a home, a school and shelf all provide a place where a multiplayer game could in theory be played, but with different difficulties.\n4. Playing at a toy store will require a lot of time/money spent, and also is less likely to happen as it is primarily business. Plus, the available space would make it even harder.\n5. A 'home' would have a lot of benefits as it can provide a comfortable and intimate setting for playing. However, it would also make finding a player for the other team a lot harder, which in turn lowers the chance of playing a multiplayer game.\n6. School is another interesting destination for board games with the ability to include a wider range of players. However, it introduces a lot of obstacles such as time, rules, and finding a place for a game. \n7. Shelf, on the other hand, is a place where you could play a game if you have one ready to use.\n8. Therefore, if we combine all of the considerations, the answer would be E.

Based on the choice, we got 6 questions, each with a different animal. \n3. It is important to note the context of question here which involves animals/pets and not something related like animals/pets and sleep \n4. Among the answers for each question, let's focus on 'need to eat' and 'go to sleep' which appears in the answers to the first 4 questions.  \n    - The animal in the 4th question which is deer is a land animal, while the rest of the questions contain marine animals. \n    - All the animals in the questions contain the word'sleep' which only a few of them (2) contain the words 'eat'. \n    - The phrase 'go to sleep' in the answers is the same as'sleep' except the phrases 'going to'/'go to', indicating a state of action for an animal \n    - To summarize, the phrase 'go to sleep', if used in the context of being related to animals/pets and tiredness, means an animal is going to sleep itself.  \n    - If it is referring to an agent of food, it means the animal is going to get some food from its owner. \n5. For the 5th question, the answer is 'lie down' and this means an animal can lie down for hours during a period of time or in a single event, but not go to sleep directly. \n6. Thus, the correct combination of answers is 'lie down' in the third position indicating that the animal 'needs food' (position 2) and 'goes to sleep' (position 4). \n7. Now, if we remove the 'lie down' as it is already out of the context, we are essentially left with 'need to eat' (position 2), as well as 'goes to sleep'. \n8. Now, if it is referring to an action, i.e. 'going to sleep', it means the animal is about to sleep. There is no need to eat as well. \n9. However, as seen in the context, 'goes to sleep', is synonymous with'sleep'. \n10. Thus, there can be no need to eat", "answer": "B: lie down"}

A basketball court can definitely be indoors in a gymnasium, but there is also a time of year to think about, where the question was asked.\n6. Los Angeles is a city, but it is not too warm or cold year-round. The question might have been asked during school hours, and you could even say the gym could also be considered a use.\n7. Therefore we have narrowed down this answer to either indoor CITY, OR indoor USE. The word use is more likely to mean a basketball court is indoor because gym classes can be held indoors.\n8.

Looking through the answer options:\n    - Option C: It may seem at first glance to be a fitting answer, since desktop computers do usually contain some sort of storage or filing system. But then again people don't always stay confined to their computers to handle the files they need to manage.\n    - Option A: Like the laptop, the smartphone, and portable devices, suitcases also house many types of personal items that people carry with them in their day to day lives, so suitcases definitely do contain digital files, but it's far from the ideal place to keep these types of files given the mobility of the smart devices.\n    - Option C is unlikely the case since a filing cabinet is a piece of office furniture that holds and stores paper documents. A filing cabinet would not be the most appropriate tool in this situation.\n    - Option  D: desk drawers are not very likely to contain digital files. One could argue that they are the best storage for such files, especially important documents, but even then, most desk drawers are for housing pencils, scissors, pens or other physical items. That's why they are placed on top of the desk and accessed with our hands, not computers.\n    - OptionE is a cloud, a term that generally represents the abstract Internet. A digital file is a file stored on a device, usually in binary form, making a cloud an unlikely answer.\n3.  The only item that remains is Option C, a computer.  Of all the choices that appear to fit this context, computers are definitely the most logical choice because not only are they the primary tool for digital file processing and transfer, but are also the device where a digital file is most likely to be handled most of the time.\n4. For all these reasons; the answer is Option C.\nSo the final  answer is C: computer\n\nInput: If someone has a cough what should they get help with?

A classroom would have a lot of glues bottles in the classroom itself, but there would also be a few bottles in desks.\n5. There aren't that many desk drawers and glue bottles in a typical school environment. \n6. A typical desk drawer is not likely to have several items, let alone a few dozen glue bottles.\n7.

There is not enough relevant information to determine if this is an accurate description of the meaning of B, it's possible that this means that the person's life has reached a certain age and doesn't suggest that the person won't live long, but not much is known about the context in which the meaning of 'growing older' is used.\n7.

Choices:  - A: one B: two C: nine D: never E: ten\nOutput: I believe I have your phone number. I will ask you again for your phone number until I believe I do. If you still don't believe I have it, it's because you don't trust me. Or because you're an idiot who never learned it and keep providing variations and making excuses.

{"idx": 330, "text": "1.\"Where would you put a ____?\" asks where to put the word \"light\" in sentence. \n2.\"Light\" is a noun that refers to a form of energy that makes things visible. \n3.\"Ocean\", \"desk\", \"universe\", and \"attic\" are all locations. \n4.\"Chair\" is not a location, instead it is something that rests on something else. \n5.As such of the locations in question are only suitable for sitting on them, it is unlikely that the word \"light\" would be placed on them in the context of this question, because placing light on something you are sitting on/in is unlikely to be something you would do, except perhaps in a joke. \n6.But by virtue of the fact that it is a light, it is likely to be placed overhead, or somewhere that would benefit from it. \n7.A likely candidate could be the universe, because \"Everywhere you look. Up, down, back, front. You'll find light.\" says, \"Astronauts have described a universe bathed in light, where you can't get even an inch away from it. In space no one can see anything, except light and its shadows.\". \n8.Therefore, the correct answer is E: \"the universe\", as sitting on light is almost impossible, but light needs to be visible and the universe is \"bathed in light\".\nSo the final answer with the correct spelling is E: \"the Universe\"", "answer": "B: desk"}
{"idx": 334, "text": "1) We can ask ourselves if a more liberal behavior is likely to be the answer choice or a more conservative one. \n2) Looking at the choice, we can see that \"conservadox\" is a combination of the root words \"conservative\" and \"heretical\". Although it could be accurate that this is the right word choice if it fits the context.\n3) But does it really mean \"more orthodox\"? \n4) We know that heretical is already defined as not orthodox. \n5) So it must be an adjective that describes a behavior that is more liberal than orthodox and at the same time more orthodox than heretical. Only heretical behavior could be judged as more liberal, but that's opposite to what the sentence is saying.\n6) Therefore, the right answer is D. recalcitrant because it means stubbornly refusing to obey another's authority, not willing to change. \nSo the final answer would be D: recalcitrant\n\nInput: The man said he was tired, what was the situation he was tired of or from?

Looking at the choices, you might think to choose between the internet and travel websites (D) as internet is not a place. But 'internet portal websites' would mean searching for a deal on the Internet, and travel websites would mean searching for a price deal on all travel search engines. If travel websites can be compared to a portal to travel, the internet is a portal to the worldwide web (the internet), so they are the same. 3. Therefore, the answer to the question is the internet. \nSo the answer to the question must be D: travel websites\n\nInput: What are we talking about in this question?

Similarly, while a 'puzzle puxxle' may contain many parts that make up a 'puzzle', it is not made of a single piece like the others.\n5. The only answer that can be described as made of a single piece is a 'puzzle'.\n6.

Choices: 1: Walk in the dark 2: Sleep 3: Eat dinner 4: Watch a movie 5: Leave the theatre 6: Go home\nOutput:1.

The options provided are 'walk in the dark','sleep', 'eat dinner', 'watch a movie', 'leave the theatre', 'go home'.\n3. They all make sense in the context and some of them could happen after a movie is over.\n4. It would not be realistic to 'walk in the dark' during the movie,'sleep' if you are still awake during the movie, 'eat dinner' when it's not meal time yet, 'watch a movie' if the movie is yet to play, and 'leave the theatre' if the movie isn't over yet.\n5.

Only the option lamp is most likely associated with the concept of light sources while still being in the possession of someone who can keep it.\n8. Therefore, the most suitable answer is D: lamp. \n9. The lamp can refer to various lighting items that are commonly used in homes, they can be light fixtures, chandeliers, table lamps, floor lamps, or simply a lampshade. \n10.

Choices: A: famous B: worth millions C: worthless\nOutput: 1 The answer must reflect the choice of word chosen by the painter or a third party.\n2. All of the choices relate to the idea of a painter\u2019s work, and specifically the perceived monetary and/or social value of that work. \n3. The painter may choose to say their work is \u2018famous\u2019, but fame does not equate value, as an artist\u2019s work may be famous but worth nothing. \n4. Similarly, a third party\u2019s opinion of the painter\u2019s work may choose to say it is \u2018worth millions\u2019, but that doesn\u2019t determine if the painter is successful. \n5. \u2018Worthless\u2019 is not a term frequently associated with artistic work, as art is typically perceived to have some monetary value even if it is not \u2018worth millions.\u2019 \n6. Looking again at the choices \u2018famous\u2019 and \u2018worth millions\u2019, they seemingly best reflect the painter\u2019s work, but \u2018famous\u2019 does not explicitly reflect the question\u2019s statement \u201cwork is what?\u201d, and \u201cworth millions\u201d refers to a perceived monetary value which does not appear to be the focus of the context.\n7.

As for the two options that can be done romantically, they are build family together and fall in love.\n4. The context is implying that one wants to romantically do something with their loved partner, and making love is only one way of doing that. \n5. There is no choice regarding falling deeper in love. This is about an existing romantic relationship and not for those who are still not together. Therefore, the answer that is about another step towards romantic commitment is build family together. \n6. The other two options are about consequences of a romantic relationship.

In general, the word \"wasted\" implies that something valuable was lost or degraded, so all choices except \"E\" are consistent with this idea.\n\nIn order to analyze these possibilities more closely, we can consider a few important aspects of the question: \n\n- What kind of things can be wasted?: Time, money, energy\n- Where are these resources often wasted?: In everyday life\n- What does this wastage result in?: Not achieving desired outcomes, feeling regret\nWith these in mind, it seems like the most logical choice would be \"D\"  wasting time. Not only does it fit with all three aspects of the question, but it also contains the word \"time,\" which is one of the resources that can be wasted. \n\n2. What else could this saying mean:\nWhen we think about the past and how we may have spent our time, it's easy to feel regret or disappointment if we realize that we could have used our time in a different way", "answer": "B: welcome change"}

This is why it is natural to look for these family members where there are other family members \u2013 on social networks (B) or at family (C) events (where you would interact with several family members in a single event).\n3. However, these avenues might not work well for searching for \u201clong lost\u201d relatives.\n4.

The tree's leaves start dropping after mid October.\n3. \na. The first word, 'turning', does not apply as leaves do not 'turn' in to other elements; they fall.\nb. The second sentence describes winter. One could argue that since autumn follows summer, it is the right season to describe the leaves. However, the question inquired when the leaves will start falling, not when they will be removed from the tree once it is time to take them down.\nc. The third word,'starting', relates only to fall and fall is an adjective related to autumn. The question poses in autumn a specific period of time when the leaves start falling. \nd.

So, the answer could either be an object in which a rosebunh can be placed, or a type of garden that would be suitable for rose bushes.\n5. The flower garden (B), the pot (C), and the formal garden (E) are the three most likely options as they could all be considered to be either a place where rosebushes (the object in question) may be placed (B), or a place where the rosebush may grow or be placed.\n6. All three options make sense in terms of the context of 'how would I place my rosebush'.\n7.

Choices:  E: africa F: asia G: europe H: america\nOutput: 1)The sentence asks about a yurt which can be found in many countries. In its definition, yurt refers to a round mobile tent of felt or canvas, traditionally used by a nomadic people from central Asia.\n2) Choices are: E: Africa F: Asia G: Europe H: America\n3) From the definitions, we can infer that all the answers refer to 'tent' of various types. \n4) However, Asia refers to the Eastern Hemisphere, which is not necessarily where in the world the yurt is.\n5) The first three answers are referring to places where in the world, so the first to be eliminated is G and also H.\n6) The definition of yurt implies that it refers to a nomadic people's dwelling place, and Africa and America have different kinds of nomadic people, therefore the answer is not Africa and also not America.\n7) That leaves us with 2 possible choices: F and E. E refers to Asia, which actually contains many nomadic people and the yurt itself.\n8) Therefore, the answer is F: Asia.\nSo the answer F: Asia is chosen.", "answer": "C: backyard"}

Choices:  A pajama top at bed, A pajama set top only, B pajama top bottom set, C pajama set top bottom\nOutput: 1: The given question refers to \"keep pajamas\", while the choices refer to various possible pajama setups. The answer is not based on the number of pajamas or their setup but on their storage location.\n2. The context of the question indicates that pajamas are typically worn at night, sleeping, in bed. The only answer that refers to bed is answer A, top at bed.\n3. All the other answers refer to places outside of bed or their contexts only partially match the question. For example, choice B mentions pajama set top and bottom but doesn't refer to wearing locations. Choice B is therefore incorrect.\n4. All the other choices refer to places besides bed, however, choice C (pajama set top bottom) can imply multiple locations.\n5.

The context here is a \"curling iron\", which could potentially be kept in the bathroom - but only if it's an electric one with a stand and cord.\n4. Walkways and salons are not common places to find curling irons stored. \n5. A bathroom (Choice A) and a drawer (Choice E) both serve as a reasonable place to store a curling iron since they are the appropriate locations for a tool that people would ordinarily bring into the bathroom to style their hair.\n6. Additionally, since the context states that people do in fact keep their curling iron in the bathroom, and curling irons in general are tools, a bathroom (Choice A), is the most likely answer.\nSo the final explanation is A: bathroom\n\nInput: Where will your friend be working in five years?

In the given context, the leg would likely break in a state of rest, and the verb \"lay\" would then suggest two possible objects: the bed and the floor. \n3. But the fact both objects are named in the question indicates that the context is not about simply \"lying on the floor with a broken leg\", for example, \"someone is standing on one leg and the other leg is broken\". The focus here is on the leg itself, and how it is situated in reference to an elevated surface: \"someone is standing with his leg elevated by a pillar/pier, a stool/a stand, a chair/table, a sofa/cushion/mattress, a bed...\" - hence, bed is the most probable object that could be \"layed\" with the leg elevated.\n4. That said, the object \"bed\" will either be in a hospital, at someone's home, or hotel. \n5. Based on the context, \"hospital\" and \"home\" are unlikely as the latter is not where one stays overnight and the former will include a bed as an object. Similarly, the word \"hotel\" is unlikely because it's referring to an establishment as opposed to an object as the question indicates.\n6. \"Piano\" is unlikely as it only refers to a musical instrument, not an object.\n7. \"Grand piano\" is unlikely as it sounds similar to 'grand hotel' and 'grand hospital'.\n8.

Out of the aforementioned, the post office is the only one not in proximity to a house, thus not related to the question.\n4. The front door is where most people first encounter the mail and could happen to be open, but is not the mailbox; therefore it's not the mailbox one finds open. As a result, the mailbox doesn't reveal anything once opened; thus it can't answer this question since it's not open.\n5. Inside a newspaper is not likely to contain the 'letters that had been delivered', as it doesn't deliver.\n6. This leaves us with package and mail box, which are both locations containing the letters that were delivered.\n7.

A guide is not a traditional reference (as it covers places and not information as a book does). \n3. A TV generally provides entertainment or news which is not the type of information most people would traditionally access. \n4. A guide is written out and provides practical information about places, which is relevant but not traditional (like a book). \n5. A newspaper is written out but provides both news and information, which is important but not the only type (there are books as well). \n6.

Choices:  1) A: Bull 2) B: Elephant 3) C: Aardvark 4) D: Lion 5) E: Giraffe\nOutput: 1) The expression 'Bull in a China shop' means a person who is clumsy or inept at something.\n2) This is applicable to the bull as it is clumsy when in the china shop. The expression doesn't make sense to be applied to other animals as they are not typically clumsy or inexperienced.\n3) No animal fits the context of the phrase 'clumsy or ineptic' and also contains the same letters as 'Bull' (Aardvark).\n4) A Lion cannot work in a china shop as it is known to be more powerful than a bull. The expression 'bull in a china shop' refers to a clumsy bull who is in a shop of fragile chinaware. A large (powerful) lion cannot be considered clumsy at that context.\n5) A Giraffe has different legs from a bull and is not considered clumsy or incompetent in a china shop. \n6) A giraffe also contains different letter patterns than \u2018bull\u2019.\n7) Therefore, the answer to the question is 'A: Bull'\n\nInput:What is a wagon?

(S) So (S) in order to find them, we must look for places with more direct and prolonged exposure to sunlight. \n5. (E) Rocks, which can be found in deserts and other sunny areas, would provide ample sunshine for lizards to bask in. \n6. (E) This is why you would often find a lizard basking on a sunny rock. \n7.

Choices: A: trees B: swamp C: lake D: grass\nOutput: The statement \"you'll often find spiders near water\" implies that spiders are more likely to be found around areas with moisture, such as water or grass.\n1. The word \"near\" suggests that spiders can be found in a variety of locations. \n2. A \"trees\" option does not specifically indicate the presence of water, it could be implied but the option is rather wide and could be interpreted for locations like a desert or jungle. \n3. A \"lake\" does not really suggest that the presence of water is necessary as water could be found in swamps, which leaves swamps. \n4. A lake, on the other hand, is mostly filled with water and it is not as prone to be found near water.\n5. A \"grass\" option would be less likely to be considered as the presence of water is more specific with a swamp or lake with their obvious moisture and mud or other bodies of water. \n6. A \"grass field near a lake\" is a place where you may find many animals, including spiders", "answer": "E: rocks"}

C: a bridge: a bridge can cause shadows depending on its form and the time of day, however unlike the surface of the moon and a building it can be seen, \n6. D: the ground, the ground could be considered a place where shadows could appear because it is visible without being a light source in itself \n7. E: a bright light, a light source's position in relation to the observer can cause a shadow, however like shadows cast on the surface of the moon or by a bridge,  the subject of a shadow does not describe a place where shadows are likely to appear, thus this answer choice is the most inappropriate. \n8. Therefore, the answer option that could possibly fit the statement is B: a building.\nSo the final appropriate answer is B: a building", "answer": "D: ground"}

{"idx": 634, "text": "1.) The sentence is asking for where fish most likely spend their time.\n2. Looking through the choices, we find that a body of water (A), lake superior (B), underwater (D) and aquarium (E) all contain water and are either places where fish live or places where fish can be found and observed. \n3. All of these options still have the word 'water' in it, which would indicate that fish spend most of their time in the water.\n4. However, when we read the choices carefully, we can deduce which words in the sentence should be emphasized. \n5. In this sentence, it's not the word 'water' that is given importance over the other options, but the phrase 'the majority of' which stresses the importance of the majority part of this time. \n6. Furthermore, the context of the sentence also emphasizes the importance of time spent, not just the place. \n7. The sentence reads 'Where do fish spend the MOST of their TIME?', which indicates that the majority part of the time is the important time. \n8. Therefore, we find that toilet (E) is not the ideal choice of answers as fish do not spend most of their time there. \n9. Therefore, the correct words to pay special attention to in the sentence are'most' and 'of their time'.\n10. As fish spend most of their of their time in the majority of their water, which in turn makes them the majority of a body of water, we can deduce that the answer is choice D: underwater.\nSo the final answers are: D: underwater \n\nInput:How many times is more than fifty?

The context of this question involves more than just a number, so the sentence is asking about'more than a quantity' and not about 50 being the quantity.\n2) We can further note that the first choice (1) says '5 times'. '5 times' could either represent the actual number of times or be indicating that the quantity is '5' or some value between 0 to", "answer": "C: underwater"}

This can be solved by using the word order rules for asking a question. \"what and\" is used to join two sentences or parts of a sentence together.\n6. When trying to answer the question, she has a deep love for all of her friends implies that she loves to entertain them and that she loves to host.\n7.

White flag can have both literal and idiomatic meanings. \n3) Looking at the answer choices: a french government (choice A) does not relate to the context, a friend's house (choice B) cannot be the proper context for the circus monkey as such a concept is not relatable, and a zoological garden (choice C) is more likely to be the true setting where a circus monkey would function. \n4) There is also the idea of a'madagascarean ape' (choice D) which could be appropriate for the context, although the phrasing is inaccurate and off-putting. \n5) The phrasing'south african ape' (choice E) is also incorrect, further adding to the confusion in terms of identifying the proper setting for the circus monkeys. \n6) Therefore, we must consider the idiomatic meaning of white flag, to which a circus monkey can be found in a zoo, representing a country. \n7) The answer is thus C: zoo.\nSo the final is C: zoo\n\nInput:I'm going to the library.

However, the context refers to a library. A library is not an area where one eats or stores food. \n4. Money (choice D), refers to monetary amount and its purpose to complete an activity. However, monetary amount is unnecessary to go to a library.", "answer": "A: french government"}
{"idx": 646, "text": "1/2. 'Ignorance' has been used, but more context is needed for the question.\n2. Assuming that \"not ignorance\" indicates that ignorance is excused, then we can assume the rest of the sentence implies what can not be considered ignorance. \n3. Looking at choice A: 'learn about subject' doesn't really require information; it implies a learning of information, but not necessarily that the subject was learned. \n4. Choice B: 'learn new' implies a new learning or acquisition of knowledge relevant to the context. \n5. Thus \"find truth\" fits best in that one has to find it, possibly through new learning or understanding of previously learned information.\n6. Choice C refers to the idea of knowing the truth but being blind to it, that's not a reasonable interpretation of the context provided.\n7. Finally, option D means \"being ignorant is a form of bliss; it is not to be known or identified to be ignorant\" and therefore cannot be used to fit the context as 'ignorance' has not been used. \n8. Option E is a valid meaning of 'judge' but again, not really applicable to the context where 'ignorance' was not presented as a possibility or alternative.\n9. Since none of the given options fit the context, the most likely answer could be either A: learn about subject or B: learn new based on the implication that it can lead to the desired outcome based on the context.

The choices provided are: a jewelery (or jewelery) B: fort knox (location), a church (location), a jewelry store (location), and a treasure chest (location).\n5. Looking at the provided answers, a jewelery could be a location of SGRP gold, but the context does not specify it explicitly.\n6. Similarly, fort knox (C) has a historical significance as a location where gold bars are stored. However, it's not explicit.\n7. Similarly, a church (D) could contain gold, if it's a church that owns an SGRP property, but it's vague.\n8. A jewelry store could also contain gold from SGRP, but it's out of context.

Company going public implies that they are raising more funds beyond those provided by its stakeholders, mainly shareholders. \n3. The options have reasons why an IPO might take place and are therefore answers as to why a company would raise funds at that point.\n4. The option 'being ridiculed\" does not relate with IPO, rather, it relates to \"going viral\" or 'trending online' in terms of internet memes or 'popularity'.\n5. The option 'Problems' does not relate with initial public offer, but rather, with 'problems of the world' as a general statement.\n6. The option 'More funding' is indeed a good answer to IPO but not enough to the question, since it suggests that the company is raising more funds rather than why, thus making it less specific.\n7. The option 'Telling all\" is an interesting answer but again, does not suggest a reason for the IPO, but rather for being honest with everyone. \n8. Out of all the options, the answer 'Revealing information\" is the specific and detailed answer with 'why' included to the 'public offering' in question. \n9. Therefore, the option is A: Revealing information. \nSo the final answer would be A: Revealing Information.\n\nInput: If they weren't the right size, the jumper wouldn't fit whom.

This is not true of a reception. \n4) If the answer was C: church basement, it would suggest that there is no seating at all - the guests are expected to stand in a tight space while they watch whatever is going on at the table in front of them. This is not realistic for a reception because if any dancing or celebrating takes place, there needs to be enough room for everyone to move around properly and comfortably.  \n5) If the answer was D: corridor, it would suggest that it's the least desirable option because guests feel pressured to move faster in their direction while other guests are walking in the opposite direction. They also feel like they are walking through a crowd of people, which can be inconvenient in large events on narrow corridors (e.g. large schools, stadiums etc.). \n6) If it was E: restaurant, it would be the better option since guests should feel comfortable to sit on any table they so desire and enjoy a meal with friends or family. \nSo the final answer would be A: Restaurant for the convenience of the guests, their comfort, and allowing them to have a variety of seats throughout the venue as they please. \n\nInput: The man had to wait in line at the supermarket last week-end, did he find it difficult?

As such, they will hear both sides of the argument before rendering a verdict. \nConvictions are related to courts and sentencing, and it is the job of the judge to carry out these things. \nA trial is the presentation of evidence and arguments leading to a verdict on guilt or innocence.The judge will listen to both sides, and then make a decision as to whether someone is convicted of the crime. If someone is convicted, then it is the job of judges to carry out sentences, which can be anything from community service to imprisonment. \nServe justice means literally 'give justice'. This refers more to the idea of being the voice of society and ensuring laws are adhered to. \nPass sentence means that judges are responsible for carrying out punishments after someone is convicted. This could be anything from a fine to a prison sentence, or maybe even the death penalty.\nBring in the verdict refers more to the idea that the burden of proof is on the trial's prosecution, to prove that the defendant committed the crime. It also implies that the prosecutor has presented all their evidence and arguments and are waiting to go to the judge to hear the verdict, so this is not an applicable answer.\nTherefore, the answer must be C: bring in verdiction.\nSo the final  answer is C: bring in verition", "answer": "D: pass sentence"}

'Home', while it could mean a secure residence, also denotes a place of privacy, which negates the mention of security in the question. \n5. Terminal denotes a place in an airport or bus station where passengers can board vehicles, therefore it is not directly related to security. \n6. 'Airport' can be described as an area of large buildings that protect travellers from the outside world and could be related to security, but the term 'highly criticized' suggests the choice is negative, opposing what would be typical for an airport. \n7. That leaves only 'airport' as the only option that would describe a high-profile location that receives critical opinions regarding its security measures. \n8.

{"idx": 882, "text": "1: The question asks for the most likely location for a horse to live.\n2. Choices provided include Michigan, Stable, Race track, Farm Yard and Arizona.\n3. Since we're primarily talking about a single horse here, then it makes the most sense to rule out any location that has multiple horses. Michigan is not a horse location, and Arizona is not a horse location either. It seems like the two options from our choices that would make the most sense are the stable and the farm yard.\n4. A stable is a barn or shed for keeping horses. This is the most likely location of where a horse lives. The race track could be where a horse lives, but so does the farm yard. The farm yard typically contains stables. So let's choose the one that includes stables as a more fitting option for this question.\n5. The choice can now be narrowed down to the following three options that offer stables: stable, farm yard, and race track.\n6. Comparing these three choices, the race track seems to be the least likely location for a horse. Stages and horses are often located on a separate location from where the actual races are performed. There are stables nearby, but the horses are generally only located there for the purpose of moving the horses from its normal location to where it is performing or racing.\n7. That leaves us with two options: a farm yard and a stable. Both would be a great place to keep horses, and both provide adequate shelter for them. However, a farm yard is usually not an activity that involves or involves a specific stage of horses competing; it's where the horses live more permanently. A stable also has the same purpose in that it houses horses and keeps them safe.\n8.

(A desk could be thought of as a table with a shelf, but a table is not a shelf.)\n6 D could also be a place of work, and most places of work have places to store things like clipboards. Therefore, any place of work could be the location chosen by James.\n7 The only place in the question not associated with anything related to work is E. However, a desk is not mentioned in the question and a desk is the most likely choice of place for keeping a clipboard. \n8 It might be a desk in an office supply store or another location, but since the question does not mention a desk it could also be a desk in a classroom or a lecture hall. \n9 The clipboard is easily found where it's kept (it might be a clipboard in an office supply store) so that place does not fit.

Tossing it, however, is not what the question asks, so that's an invalid answer choice.\n4. If they keep it and use it to buy something expensive, that is not something that they were specifically asked to do. The answer doesn't seem to fit.\n5. We're left not knowing for sure what they would do because the question doesn't explicitly state that they are keeping it and using it for something large.\n6. Therefore, we must choose the best answer that fits the context of the question. \n7. The answer choice that suggests they would buy something large is \"use it to buy something expensive\".\nSo the final answers are", "answer": "C: play piano"}

However, none of these could be related to a medical device in regards to safety or a liquid such as isopropol alcohol.\n3) There are two main reasons why these two specific words can be found together:\na. Firstly, a laboratory.\ni. When we talk about isopropol alcohol in a lab, we refer to a very specific liquid used in certain laboratory experiments where scientists are exposing it to high temperatures to perform some chemical reactions which produce some gases. These gases are commonly used in the production of alcohol.\nii. Even when used in a non-medical field, isopropol alcohol refers to a very strong liquid, which makes it a rather dangerous substance that can\u2019t be easily kept in a normal cabinet. Therefore, it is common to see it stored in a separate lab cabinet.\nb. Secondly, a hospital.\ni. In hospitals, safety glasses are used especially by medical staff and visitors to prevent their eyes from any possible injury. In most cases, we find these glasses in front of every hospital machine and even outside different doors.\nii. Furthermore, they are commonly found on the side of the medical staff\u2019s cabinets.\n4) When we put both of the above in consideration, we can easily say that the answer to the question should be the laboratory or a hospital.\n5) Therefore, the answer should be A and B: lab or hospital.\nSo the final answers are A and B: laboratory and hospital.\n\nInput: Where would you get a cash card and a gift card?

The question asks for the reason why Dan thinks that \"getting in line\" is the best choice. 2. The choices provide various reasons why it may be a better option to wait in a line than stand in waiting confusion, boredom or \"have to wait\". 2. The word's \"have to wait\" is commonly used in the sense of having no other choice but to wait, such as when waiting in line at service counter. 3. The word \"boredom\" is describing a negative emotional state where one feels disenchanted, tired, or lazy. Such emotions are more likely to occur when standing in a long line rather than \"getting in line\". The phrase \"get in line\" is a term used to describe the act of putting yourself in a line, which requires you to stay in it until your turn comes. 3. In contrast, getting in line is considered a wise choice because it helps alleviate confusion and boredom. 3. \"Getting in line\" implies going back to what is expected, instead of wandering around in a group of confusion and boredom without knowing what to do. 4. In summary, the answer is A \"being ordered\", as this is a phrase used to refer to the process of ordering people according to a pre-established rule.\nSo the final question is \"Dan said that getting in a line was the best choice, because it would lead to being ordered.

Therefore, you would still have to clean it so it can be used. \n9 Leaving it in the cupboard will give it a safe place, but be out of the way. \n10 You wouldn't want to leave it on the table because it might get dirty if not cleaned on time. \n11 Similarly, a restaurant would be too out of place because 'the silverware is not usable yet. \n12 Leaving it in the kitchen or kitchen sink is not a good idea either because you may not have time to clean it yet.

Though these two words could fit the sentence context, they are not as likely or obvious choices as the other two- 'pain' and 'death' as they are extreme.\n5.

Therefore, all the remaining options but one- 'pain' or 'death' are eliminated leaving 'getting hurt' (D) and 'getting hurt' (the other one C).\n7.

The context of the question is that the two people likely feel at ease knowing they 'don't stand out at all', that they fit in and don't attract attention. \n4. As such, one option is pleasing, as we'd have to think about what this means when applied to a person or character. \n5. Generally, while everyone may not find a specific person or characteristic pleasing, there is a possibility that one may find the other to be pleasing.

Feeling'special' or 'unique' could likely happen in an intimate setting, i.e. a romantic gesture, when someone feels cared about or appreciated by another person. This could not be related to a gift.\n4. The feelings of offense or displeasure could occur when someone is given an object for a gift that they are not happy about their receiver or that they do not personally like.\n5. It's possible to feel 'personal' or 'rare' about a gift, but this is typically as a result of the unique or special nature of it, which goes against the prompt of a common gift. An extremely rare and unique gift could trigger these feelings.\n6. Finally, the feeling of 'offended' could happen when someone's gift is viewed in an offensive or insulting manner, as the giver did not mean it.

Hence, it must be eliminated.\n3. B: 'a better job'. \n    - 1. If a person earns $100 in their current job and they find a better job with the same company wherein they could earn $110 or more, the person doesn't have to make more, as they are at their current job.

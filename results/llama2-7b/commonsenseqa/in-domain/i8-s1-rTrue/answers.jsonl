Choices:  T: two options B: no option C: none options D: all options E: everything\nOutput: 1) We need to determine what the question is actually asking. The question is asking about a hypothetical situation where one knows what they need to know, but the answer is a multiple choice question.\n2) We can eliminate options B and E since the question is hypothetical.\n3) The question implies an \"either/or\" answer. Thus, any answer that would fall into the \"other\" category would be incorrect.\n4) Choice A is incorrect since it is given and not the answer to a multiple choice question. \n5) Choice C is incorrect since the question asks for a question where \"what you know is all that matters at all.\" Choice D is incorrect since it assumes the \"no options\" scenario.\n6) Choice E is the most likely answer since the question asked 'if there is only ever one choice and I know everything I need to know, what would I choose?'\nSo the final answer for this choice is E: everything\n\nInput: Which of the following is not correct in the United States?

Choices:  A : pick one finger to rub B: eat C: stand up D: drink E: pick a finger to grab\nOutput: 1. The question is asking what the average person will do while at meal time. \n2. Since the question is about what the average person will be doing, it would be incorrect to assume that the focus is on the specific action of eating.\n3. Looking over the options, B: eating wouldn't necessarily apply while sitting down and is too broad.\n4. Option A: pick one finger to rub is very specific, too specific since while eating you might be using a hand to hold something without rubbing your fingers. In addition, the choice lacks the focus on sitting down.\n5. C: stand up: While standing up may or may not be applicable, it's not specific enough to reflect an action during meal time and is very broad.\n6. D: drink can be applicable to meal time, however, it's unlikely that one would drink just a little water at every meal. Plus, the choice is missing the focus on the sitting down aspect.\n7. Option E: pick a finger would apply to all scenarios, but this choice is too broad and not specific.\n8. Therefore the most fitting answer would be A: pick one finger.\n9. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: pick one finger, which describes the likely scenario.\nSo the final Answers is A: pick one digit \n\nInput: What must you have before you cook a turkey?

Good News  C.  No News\nOutput: 1: The question is easy to get good or bad news from animals.\n\n2: \na) Good News: A cow gives milk, which is good.\nb) No News: A cow, as well as many other mammals, including humans, breathes out in our noses, which is not good but is not news\nc) Bad News: A pig doesn't give oxygenated air.\n3: A: Bad News makes sense to be the right answer. A cow gives milk, but not oxygenated air. Furthermore, the pig doesn't have anything relevant to inform humans.\n4: Therefore, the most appropriate answer to this question is A: Bad News.\nSo the final outcome is A:Bad news\n\nInput: What do many people want after visiting a restaurant? Choices:  a) Lots of people  b) Bad news\nOutput: 1 There are two options and the question is asking to select one of these.\n2 Choices: a.

IV. a casserole. V. artworks. VI. a mousetrap.\nOutput: 1) The question asks us to chose the options which can be created 'by making many things'. \n2) 'A sandwich' (I) is not a correct answer choice but is actually an example and is hence not relevant to the correct options. \n3) Option III, 'a quilt', is a correct answer choice as it can be made by joining several pieces of fabric. \n4) Option V, 'artworks', is also a correct answer choice, but isn't as relevant as 'a quilt' since the'many things' referred to could be items of any type. \n5) Since the correct options are both V (artworks) and III (quilt), it can be inferred that 'quilted art' may be the ideal answer choice because it allows for multiple items made in the process. \n6) Therefore, the most ideal answer choice is V plus III (quilt plus artworks)\nSo the final answer (in words) is \"quilted art\"\n\nInput: At a party, where is the dessert stored?

Objects contained within doorways can typically be found on another side of the doorway opening.\n5. Choices E: doorway and D: doorknobs are not relevant to the scenario provided. \n6. Hence, we can eliminate choice D: doorknop and choice E: doorway. \n7. Therefore, we've narrowed down our choices to A: television, B: control panel, and C: open doors. \n8. Although all three options could fit the scenario provided, option C: opening doors doesn't necessarily have to be part of an object contained within the doorway. \n9. The most appropriate choice would be B: control panel, which is an object contained within the structure of a doorway opening.\nSo the final chosen answer is B: control panel", "answer": "B: subdivision"}
{"text": "), and the doorknob (D) all could be part of or located within a doorway, they aren't always necessarily within the structure. \n4. We can eliminate option D: doorknub due to it being a redundant choice. \n5. From the remaining choices, E: 'doorway' stands out as the only choice that could be a correct answer.\n6.Option B is not a plausible choice, as 'control panel' implies that it's an electronic panel and not a structural element of a door.\n7. Similarly, options A and C are not possible as a piece of furniture or any object that cannot be 'contained by' a doorway. 8. Option E: 'doorway': stands out as the only option that is both directly related to the question as well as being the most probable answer.\nSo the final awnser is E: doorway\n\nInput: Why is a rocket flying through the air?

We should note and eliminate options C: it has fuel because flying through the air isn't a rocket's primary motion.\n3. Similarly, option B: I can shouldn't be a valid answer as flying is a motion and not a motive.\n4. Option D: that is full of gas is again eliminated because fuel is being used to propel the rocket, not to keep it in the air.\n5. Option E: it looks like it is being used as a filler to provide an answer to a question that probably hasn't been thought out.\n6. After considering every option, the answer that best aligns with the question is A: I want to.\nSo the final answear is A: I want\n\nInput: I am going to build up my energy to go on a trip I need what?

Option A: breakfast is incorrect because", "answer": "D: clear"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) could be an acceptable answer choice due to their physical presence in and around the doorway, they don't necessarily have to be contained by the doorway itself.\n4. Option E, doorway, can be a valid choice since the phrase 'contained by' might refer to the entire structure of a doorway instead of being contained by the door itself.\n5. Therefore the correct answer is E: doorway.   \nIn conclusion, this question can be difficult to solve without context clues, but focusing on the words contained and doorway and eliminating the other choices provides the correct answer.\nSo the final question is E: doorway\n\nInput: At the bottom of the well, I can't use my telescope. Choices:  A. Not useful B. Not needed C. Not desirable D. Not available E. Not accessible\nOutput: 1) When we are at the bottom of a well, we can't use our telescope. The well has a bottom and a well's opening has a small hole on the surface, and from the surface of a well to its bottom, is the well. A telescope, which looks distant objects, is typically used to look at a distant object. 2) Looking at choice A: Not useful, that simply means using a telescope is not useful. That may or may not be true for the scenario which is giving rise to this question.\n3) Now considering choice B: Not needed, it can't be that a telescope is never required at the bottom of a Well because sometimes someone might need to use a telescope to look at objects that are inaccessible from the surface. 4) Eliminating choice B: Not needed and looking at option C: Not desirable, a telescope at the bottom of a  well becomes desirable because the objects there will be different from those seen from the surface of a Well.\n5) Now, we are down to choices D: Not available, E: Not accessible. For choice D: Not available it's hard to imagine a scenario where the well is not available for use because typically, wells can be used to do many purposes; a well may be dug to provide fresh drinking water. It may also be used as a place to look at something, and that's why the author provides an example to explain his answer. 6) Choice E", "answer": "D: headache"}

When someone asks where you should find the food within a house, it's necessary to analyze the given options to determine which of them is best suited to the context provided. \n3. When the word 'within' is used in the context of this question, it means that the option can be found somewhere inside the residence. \n4. This means that B: Refrigerator and C: Pantry are the only correct options.\n5. Given that the refrigerator (B) is the obvious choice, there's no need to consider further options.\n6. Therefore, A: Bathroom and E: living room are the only incorrect options. \n7. Therefore, we can safely conclude that the only appropriate answer is B: refrigerater. \nSo the final answer to this question is B: refridgerator\n\nInput: What are a scientist and a mathematician both doing at once?

D: wallet\nOutput: 1) The question states where is the best place to put ring to hide it, so we are looking for a place to avoid something.\n2) The given choices all contain some part of ring to suggest that they would be good hiding spots.\n3) Ring is on the finger, so finger cannot be the place to avoid ring.\n4) The question provides the option of Doormat. Doormat is used to cover the opening, so it should not be used as a place to hide ring.\n5) The remaining options contain a certain characteristic (ear, wallet) of ring that should be avoided while hiding ring.\n6) Therefore, the only option that makes no reference to ring is option C: ear. \n7) This provides the correct answer.\nSo the final correct answer is C: ear\n\nInput: What does it mean to be in the shadow of something, or in the shadow\u2019s shadow?

All choices contain a part of the Shadow (Fence, Glow, Cave), except Shadow itself.\n4. Owner does not belong to the context of Shadow.\n5. Fence, Glow and Cave refer to the shadows and are not the main objects.\n6. Only the given Shadow can be in the shadows of another item, given the context of the question.\n7. Therefore the correct answer", "answer": "D: get arrested"}
{"text": "), doorknob (D) are all things you could grab if you wanted to, they do not satisfy the given word 'contained by'.\n4. 'Doorway' (E) is a structure that contains an opening; therefore, it fits the given word 'containing'.\n5. Option A: television is irrelevant, as it is not in the vicinity of a door.\n6. Similarly, option B: control panel is not necessarily a part of the door but is a component of a door system.\n7. Option C: opening doors is incorrect because doorways contain various features such as a latch, a door, door jamb, and hinges; none of these open by themselves.\n8. Option D: doorknobs are often used to open the doors; but they do not contain objects themselves, and they are only a part of the entryway.\n9. Therefore, the only viable answer remains E: doorway.\nSo the final choice is E: doorway\n\nInput: What isn't a material component of an instrument used to detect life-supporting liquids in space? Choices: \nA: telescope B: dial C: glass D: trays\nOutput: 1- The question is asking what the material component of an instrument is that's used to detect life-sustaining liquids in space.\n2- A material component is something that's made up of material.\n3- Option A - telescope and Option B - dial appear to be correct from a surface perspective. A telescope (A) is material, and a dial could be a material component (B).\n4- But we cannot use telescopes to detect water. A telescope is used to see far away object, so it cannot be used to detect water.\n5- A dial usually has to do with mechanical or electronic devices. Dials are used for measuring time or as a clock face is used for setting the time. Hence A: telescope and B: dial are incorrect.\n6- Option C - glass is incorrect because water is a liquid, and it's not a correct choice.\n7- Option D - trays are material, but the question states material component of an instrument, not material of an instrument.\n8- So, the final answer is the one that remains with C: glass.

Looking towards E: doorway, this is where the door is itself. It would be incorrect to choose this unless the object is contained by the structure of the door itself; in such a case it would not be able to be grabbed from it.\n6.

Choices:  a: good time b: sick c: vacation d: bad time e: good luck\nOutput: 1) The question is asking which option among others is not an acceptable form of having a good day.\n2) Examining the choices, as bad time and good luck are mentioned, these two choices already seem unrealistic options to use when looking for a good day, especially if the other possible ones are not specifically mentioned.\n3) So, we end up with options A, B, C and D.\n4) Since A, B, and D are used as words to describe a day, they seem unlikely to apply to the circumstances. So, we end up leaving C which describes the weather/weather condition.\n5) This is the correct answer as weather itself can be an element to ruin a good day.\nSo the final  answer is C) the weather.\n\nInput: In which place would I see a house?

The only possible answer choice that would fit the given description of 'contained by' is E: doorway. \n5. A doorway is literally contained by a door, and since the question is only asking for the name of the doorway, any object located inside of a doorway can fall under that umbrella.\n6.

Therefore, option E is the most correct one.\nSo the final Answer is E: doorway\n\nInput: You should keep what? Choices:   A: yourself away from harm B: away from harm C: yourself from harm D: yourself E: away from harm\nOutput: 1.\"Away from harm\" is a grammatical error. The sentence should say \"harm from yourself\", keeping it as A: away from harm or B: yourself away from harm.\n2. \"You\" is a pronoun used to represent someone, so it should be placed in front of the verb. This means the correct sentence is \"Keep yourself away from harm\". \n3. The correct answer is C: yourself from harm as this is correct in terms of grammar and also the context of the sentence.\nSo the final  Answer is C: yourself from Harm\n\nInput: After the dog ate it, what remained?

The question is asking for the location of the man's car keys.\n3. Option 'a' car keys being located on the dashboard is plausible since they would be close to the driver.\n4. However, this doesn't necessarily have to be the case. According to the rules of this game, the options should not be ambiguous and specific enough to make a decision.\n5. Option 'e' of the man's keys being located under the glove box are not specific enough, since there are many places below the glove box where the keys could be stored.\n6. Option 'f' on the other hand is too vague as it can be said that the man's keys were in the ditch, not necessarily on top the steering wheel.\n7. Option 'd' on the ashtray does, however, sound plausible, however, this answer would not be useful to the original question, as the focus is on the location of the keys, not their use.\n8. Considering option 'c' on the ignition is ambiguous, since it could be referring to the key for the ignition switch or for the ignition of the car's engine.\n9. For our final answer we can eliminate options 'a', 'e', and 'h'.\n10. Our options thus far are:\n    \n- Option 'g' on the steering wheel. This option does not include ambiguity and is specific enough making it the ideal answer.\n\nSo the answer", "answer": "A: violence"}
{"text": "), doorknob (D) and doorway (E) are all part of a door, they don't necessarily fit the bill of contained-by.\n4. The wording of the question itself rules out anything located elsewhere, but specifically contained by a doorway, i.e. something which can come out from the doorway (e.g. a child).\n5. Therefore, it must be an object which is inside the physical structure of the doorway itself (being that the doorway is a rigid structure), which leads us to choice C: opening doors.\nSo the final answers is C: opening doors", "answer": "D: trouble"}

If the item belongs to a television then it has to be grabbed from inside the screen, which wouldn't be possible at the doorway. \n5. If the item belongs at the door entry panel as it has the name 'control panel' then it cannot be grabbed at the doorway because the 'doorway' contains the 'entrance door'. \n6. A door knob cannot be grabbed by itself because it isn't an independent and containable object that can be grabbed by hand, it's a locking mechanism which can only be used to open or unlock the door. \n7. A doorway does not contain or provide an independent object to be grabbed. It's a space in which the door can be accessed, hence the answer has to be D: door knob. \n8. Also, 'doorway' doesn't describe the door knob as it can be anywhere.

Choices:  The: place safety A: place safety B: protective zone C: protected environment D: safe zone E: safe haven\nOutput: 1) The question is asking us what we call a place of'safety'.\n2) To decipher the meaning of the phrase we need to look beyond the actual question and analyze the language used in the question.\n3) The term used for'safety' i.e. The place of'saftey' is grammatically incorrect. \n4) Safety in English language usually does not follow 'the' at the beginning, for instance, the word safety doesn't start with 'the' i.e. Tthe Safety, \n5) It's more common to use 'a place of safety', instead of 'the place of safety'. \n6) Thus if the question was to replace the inappropriate word 'the' with an appropriate word and ask a similar question then the answer would be 'A place of safety'.\n7) Although it can be argued that the question and the phrasing itself is grammatically incorrect. So the answer is not limited to 'A: the place safety' or any form of 'the + place of safety'.\n8) It could be any of B: place safety, C: protected environment, or D: safe zone. \n9) However, these don't match the context and meaning of the question. \n10) Option D isn't a place, rather it would refer to a time period that is safe, hence out of the context and scope of the question.\n11) Likewise, Option B: place safety doesn't fit the context either, it could be a place, but not necessarily relevant to the meaning of", "answer": "B: arrest"}

This means that the test itself is not being described as fun.\n3.

The 'contained by' portion of the original sentence excluded this specific choice, as an object can be contained by a doorway without it necessarily being within it. \n7. Therefore, we can eliminate choice E: doorway because an object can be 'contained by' a doorway even though it's not within it.\n8.

This would most likely require a shovel than a rake as the latter is better suited for collecting.\n5- The reference to scoops and shovels indicates that the tool would need to be quite large, which means that a regular shovel would be the choice that makes the most sense. 6- Choice F: scoop shove implies that the shovel would have to be large to dig up a lot of weeds at once.

However, it does not make the appropriate reference to nutshell, therefore this option is also ruled out.\n5) Option 5: in reference to a nut could be an appropriate response. However, this answer is not very intuitive or clear as there could be any number of nutshell referrals within this question.\n6) Given this, the most obvious and correct response would be option 6: all the facts summarized. \nSo the final answer we get is 6: all the fact summarized. \n\n\nInput: What must you do at a pond in order to be able to fish in it?

Choices: A: eating B: stabbing C: dipping D: scooping E: squeezing\nOutput: 1.- 2. The phrase \"a person eating from their\" could be referring to the situation where someone is eating from their plate.\n3. However, it could also be in reference to a person using their fork while eating. This would make more sense in the context of the question as we are evaluating the actions of one person while in the act of eating.\n4. Whenever a person is using a fork while eating it is essentially an extension of their hand, which means that they are also using that hand to stab the food.\n5. Choices B and D have been ruled out because stabbing and scooping are not the same action so they are not valid and E is not accurate either because the fork does not involve any form of squeezing.\n6. Therefore, it has to be A & C which means that a person using their fork is either stabbing or dipping. (which are two actions that one can do with their fork while eating)\n7. So the correct choice is A & C. A person is eating and using their fork, so they are simultaneously dipping and stabbing from their fork.\nSo the final input is A & C: dipping and stabbings.\n\n\n\nInput: In which of the following situations does a person usually wear white?

Given that the question asks where you would \"grab\" an object, I would consider this the best option, since options B: control panel, C: opening doors, and D: doorknobs don't leave any room for \"grabbing\". \n6. Therefore the answer that best fits an answer choice, and the final answer is E Doorway.\nSo the final selected answer is E: doorway\n\nExample1\nInput: A human must be at least 18 years old to do what?

We can also eliminate 'doorknobs' (D) as they are for turning and opening doors, not grabbing.\n5. Therefore the correct answer is (E) doorway.\nSo the final answers are E: doorway\n                \nInput: Which statement would a scientist likely agree with? Choices: 1: Squirrels should not be kept as pets. 2: Pets should never be allowed to climb trees! 3: Never leave a pet outside all night. 4: Weight loss has no health risk. 5: Pets and children don't mix.\nOutput: 1: The question is asking an opinion that a scientist would likely agree with. 2: The question specifically asks for one statement, not a set of statements. 3: The question only asks for one statement so answers from more than one statement will be marked wrong. 4: Since the scientist must agree with this statement, the statement must be true and thus the answer has to be 1: should be. 5: Similarly, the fact that the statement needs to be true implies that this answer has to also be 1: should.\nSo the final 2 answers are 1: should, and 5: shouldn't.\n\nInput: Which of these words could have been the name of the person in the first paragraph?

{"text": "), and a doorknob (D) are all different kinds of things that fit within a doorway, it's the 'contained-by-meaning' that will help us rule some things out. \n4. For instance, a television doesn't necessarily 'contain' any doors (opening them or not). Even a door is unlikely to 'contain' a television, that seems like an unnatural concept.\n5. The same goes for a control panel - this usually refers to the inside dashboard of a car. Also, an opening door isn't necessarily contained within a doorway, and neither is a doorknob. \n6. Finally, 'doorway' itself is the only choice that has no other word that could be substituted for it. It has a distinctive meaning; one might consider grabbing something from within the doorway, but since the context is different, it still becomes a likely answer.\n7. Therefore: E: doorway, is the best possible answer.\nSo the final answers is E: Doorway\n\nInput: From the bedroom, look east, what will you see? Choices: A: sunrise B: mountains C: a body of water D: the forest E: an office worker\nOutput: 1.The question states that we are looking east from a bedroom.\n2. The sunrise is the most likely answer. The context here is that the time of dawn is just around the corner; that's why the room is east-facing.\n3. The mountains are irrelevant from this context. The mountains are farther to the southwest, not east as described in this problem.\n4. A body of water is typically further away and to the west of a bedroom. \n5. The forest is unlikely to be close enough.\n6. The same goes for an office worker.\n7. Choices B and C are both unlikely, therefore the correct answer is A: sunrise. \nSo the final answer A: sunrise", "answer": "A: insubstantial"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) could be inside a doorframe, the other choice E: doorway implies a large structure that can fit an object and a person. It is quite unlikely that a person would be grabbing an object contained by a giant doorway.\n4. In other words, the doorway needs to be small enough to contain an object. \n5. In that case, the answer we're looking for needs to be some form of an object that fits under the doorway. \n6. The choice that best fits this logic is D: doorframe.\nSo the final correct answer is D: doorframe\n\nInput: The police officers were looking at the man's car and where? Choices: A: license B: registration C: windshield D: dirt E: rearview mirror \nOutput: 1 - Police officers could have a look at the man's license and registration. - The question is a yes/no question. - The answer in the middle of the list (D), i.e., dirt, is not a place to find the man's license or registration, so it should be eliminated. - The other answer in the list (E), i.e., rearview mirror, is an appropriate place to locate the man's license, so it should be considered the best choice.\n2 - The other answers do not make much sense. They are the following: A - License plate is more common than license. Registering a car is likely to be done first, then license plate is issued as a result. - The police already have the vehicle's registration, but not the license.\nB - Registration cannot be confused with the car's make or model since each car has just one registration.\nC - This is a part of a car. It is not a separate document for the license.\nD - Car registration should not be confused with car paperwork.\nSo the final response is E: rearview mirror.\n\nInput: There are three options for finding one's keys: (1) looking directly underneath one's bed, (2) examining the kitchen and (3) under the table.

{"text": "), and a doorknob (D) could be within the aforementioned context, it's the choice E: doorway that best fits this scenario as it has all the requirements mentioned. \n4. If an object is contained by a doorway, it means that it can't be located outside, so while an object could be close to a doorway in B and D, only an object within the structure of the physical doorway would qualify.\n5. Therefore the most fitting answer is choice E: doorway.\nSo the final Answer is: E: doorway\n\nInput: I like to get to the top of the mountain by taking what? Choices: a) the hardest route b) a shortcut  c) the most convenient path d) the safest route e) the fastest \nOutput: 1: The contextual clues in this situation suggest that the speaker is planning to climb a mountain. 2: The top of the mountain could be reached by a variety of methods, including a trail, rock climbing, or using a rope. 3: It is implied that the subject wants to climb the mountain quickly and efficiently, which suggests that they should choose the fastest route. 4: The choice in bold states that 'I like to get to thetop of the mountain by taking the fastest route'.\nSo the final Answer option C - 'The most convenient path' is incorrect.\n\nInput: I always like to give a speech in front of what? Choices a) People b) A group c) A crowd d) Friends e) Family \nOutput: \n1: The contextual cues in this question suggest that the speaker is making a speech in a public gathering. 2: People is the most likely audience.\nSo the final choice is option C: A group", "answer": "E: learning about"}
{"text": ") or even doorknob (D) are not incorrect, they all do not satisfy the requirement to be 'contained by'. However, option E 'doorknob' is a good candidate as it satisfies this requirement. It provides adequate grip and support for holding an object that is within the doorway, such as groceries or a heavy box.\n4. Thus the answer is E: doorknob.\nSo the final choice is E: doorknb\n\nInput: If I want to make a video with a wide screen, what should I do? Choices:  a: turn to a different channel b: change the tv c: turn on the screen d: change the channel e: put the tv off\nOutput: 1) If I want to make video with a wide screen I should - \"change the channel\". \n2) The term \"wide screen\" refers to the actual size and shape of the screen, whether it is wide or narrow, or widescreen or fullscreen.\n3) The term \"screen\" refers to a device that displays images, typically in some form of visual media, such as a television. \n4) The term \"channel\" refers to a specific path along which a television signal can be transmitted or received, either through cable, internet, or satellite. \n\nSo the answer is d: change the channel.\n\nInput: In order to have my breakfast I need what? Choices: a: sticks, b: stairs, c: spoon, d: fork, e: napkin \nOutput: the answer is a: sticks.", "answer": "B: getting cold"}
{"text": ") and door knobs (D) could be considered, they don't specifically 'contain' objects within a doorway, and all these object are outside.\n4. Thus, the only choice that includes the word \"contained by\" is option E - \"doorknob\".\nSo the final answer to this question is E: doorway. \n\nInput: What do most people think of more than once a week? Choices:  Coffee A: ice cream B: money C: music D: gadgets E: caffeinated beverages\nOutput: 1) The question asks what most people think about more than once a week.\n2) For this, we need to consider the given choices and how each word would reflect the context of the people in the question.\n3) While A: ice cream and B: money could each be considered relevant to the context, since there are so many other factors that could potentially be important to the context, those two factors cannot be assumed to be the most important.\n4) Similarly, C: music and D: gadgets both share similarities to the context of the question. However, the inclusion of the word Coffee (option E) tells us that Coffee is one of the things people think about much more than other things. So, we can deduce with strong confidence that Coffee is the right pick.\n5) Therefore, we can assume that the phrase'most people think' in this question is synonymous with the phrase 'people think', and the most logical choice would be 'Coffee'.\nSo the final choice is: E: coffee\n\nInput: If I get to work first in the morning, who is the second to get to work? Choice:  A: nobody B: myself C: my boss D: my co-workers E: the guy next door\nOutput: 1: The answer is choice E - the guy next door. In any given instance, the guy next door would be the next person to get to work after you, so the choice that answers this question most completely is E.\n2: The other choices all describe a state of things happening to you or for you, but they don't describe the relationship between you and a person who is second to arrive at a given location.\n3: The question does not ask how many people are second to you or", "answer": "B: music shop"}
{"text": "), and door(E) are logical options based on the context of the question and the meaning of the question, they do not satisfy the condition of the question.\n4. Doorknobs are not a separate physical object contained by a door in the classical sense. Rather, it's a physical construction that connects the door to its frame, and the only way it can be grabbed is in conjunction with the frame; therefore, it should be eliminated from the options.\n5. This leaves us with options D and E, which are correct.\n6. Option D: doorknobs correctly answers the question and is the correct answer.\nSo the final choice is D: doorknobe\n\nInput: The scientist performed an experiment on a single mouse. The mouse was in a small cage. What happened? Choices: 1. A: They saw a black mouse 2. B: The mouse went crazy 3. C: An explosion 4. D: Terrorism 5. E: It escaped\nOutput: 100% Correct: 6.

Choices: 1. A. A small, light-colored bird that makes a nest in the ground. 2. B. An unspecified thing of small size. 3. C. Wonderful, great. 4. D. A little bird that makes a nest with small colored lights. 5. E. A small black, white, and gray bird that doesn't really matter.\nOutput: 6. The question asked what 'ponder' means in a dictionary, and the given dictionary definition is that it's a verb, defined as pondering, and that a ponder is a thoughtful contemplation or reflection.\n7. Looking at the given options, each option is describing a definition that could be related to the word 'ponder', albeit not the correct one.\n8. Option A: A small, light-coloured bird that makes a nest - could be describing the meaning of the word 'nest' in a dictionary, not the word itself.\n9. Option B: An unspecified thing that is of small size - it could be an unspecified 'thing' (object or concept) of'small size' however it's not 'ponder' explicitly.\n10. Option C: Wondeerful, great - Could describe a meaning of a different word than 'ponder' (e.g. the word 'wonderful')\n11. Option D: An unspecified small (and black)... - It could be describing the color and shape of a non-specified small bird. It doesn't describe the meaning of the word completely.\n12. Option E: Unspecified little (black)... - it could be describing the color of an unspecified small object (that doesn't matter).\n13. While all the listed options are related to the word 'ponders', they're not correct.\n14. Since the only option that does not share the same meaning as 'ponders' is option E: Unspecified small, unspecified bird that doesn", "answer": "B: fragile"}
{"text": ") and doorknob (D) could all be located within the structure of a doorway, the only choice that describes the location of the object with an independent nature is E: doorway.\n4.

Choices: A: when B: morning C: today D: evening E: past 5 o'clock F: noon \nOutput: \n1. Based on the sentence structure in the question, let's analyse the choices. \n2. All except option C, 'today', imply that the person would begin at some past time, therefore this option can be eliminated. \n3. 'To get to one location at some specific time' can be restated as 'to reach destination X at time of Y', and given that we need to indicate the beginning of this process, we can infer that 'to get there' and 'begin' are synonyms. \n4. Looking at the remaining choices, option A: 'when' indicates a chronological time, which in this context doesn't make sense because we're talking about a specific location (i.e. a specific place and time), and not just a location. \n5. Options D: evening and E: past 5pm might seem plausible based on when the person would likely want or expect to reach the destination (i.e. at the end of the day), however, this would also depend on what time they started getting started on the process.\n6. Although option B: morning and option F: noon might seem plausible because they indicate a specific hour and time, these won't work here because they also state 'at a specific time', which is already implied (i.e. the end of the day).\n7. Also, we may eliminate options C: today, F: noon and option G: midnight because we can infer that choosing these time would simply mean that we have already started working on this process, so they're out of the question.\n8. Therefore the only option left out is option F: past 5pm, because it correctly indicates that this is the specific place and time that the person would", "answer": "E: garden"}
{"text": "), doorknob (E), and doorway (D) can be located within the structure of the given doorway, the choices of C and E are not as plausible for the context as the remaining selections. \n4.

Choices: A: nowhere B: the present C: the past D: the future E: the yard\nOutput: 1) The first thing necessary to solve this is to observe the given clues. The woman saw the cat in the present; therefore, the clues are the woman'saw' and the cat was in 'present.'\n2) We can eliminate options E: the yard as it does not relate to the main verb in the sentence and B: the present as the woman did not see any past or future cat.\n3) Since she saw it in the present, it could have been just one, hence option A: nowhere can be eliminated, therefore, the remaining options can be reduced to C: the past and D: the future.\n4) Although both options D: the future and C: the past can be true and plausible with the given context, option C: the past is more common and logical.\n5) Therefore, the correct answer is C: the past.\nSo the final option is C: the past\n```\n\n---\n### Installation\nInstall python at your computer.\n\n---\n## Predefined variables for testing cases\n```python\nWORD = raw_input(\"Inserir palavra: \")\nRES = raw_input(\"Qual ser\u00e1 a resposta? \")\nNCORE = raw_input(\"Quantas cores quis a resposta? \") \nNCORE = eval(NCORE) \n```\n\n---", "answer": "A: look beautiful"}
{"text": ") and door handle (D) could all be objects contained within a doorway if the door was open, they're too broad; one could likely find these as object within a doorway even if the door is closed.\n4. Doorknobs are too narrow; they're a particular style of handle and aren't relevant to this scenario.\n5. \"Doorway\" (E) doesn't have to be a physical door; any structure can function as a doorway, hence it makes them a bit too broad.\n6. Therefore, it's more plausible to choose 'doorway' (E), as they're the most specific and directly applicable answer to the question.\nSo the final answers are E: doorway.\n\nInput: A new idea has just been thought of at work. It's fresh. What's the least of these choices that is made as a result of this thought? Choices: A: to take a break from work B: to make a list of every item needed to begin C: to get started D: to make an appointment to begin E: to delegate\nOutput: 1a. Our goal is to find the least likely response from the statement that a new idea has just been formed at work.\n1b. As the only responses that don't involve breaking from work at all are A: get started and B: delegate, we can eliminate those that only contain one work related action.\n1c. Option C: to make a list would lead to delegation, so it may also be a result.\n1d. Option D: to make an appt to begin implies that something will start from the appt (ie: at the appt itself), so a follow up question would need to be asked if this is what's intended.\n1c. From the remaining choices, option A: to take a brake may not always be necessary, since they may not wish to stop at this moment, but may go on to get started on the idea later.\n1c. Of the two remaining options, we can reason that if the intent is to \"begin\" the idea, then delegating wouldn't have to be the first action taken. We could delegate the idea to help it get started.\n1d. Therefore, the most likely response to beginning the idea is to delegate. This means that we must exclude D, and D is eliminated.", "answer": "D: learn"}

Option A 'television' is also invalid because it's not mentioned in the question as being an object within the doorway.\n7. Option C 'opening doors' cannot be contained by a door because the opening doors would be located outside or inside the door, not within the doorway itself, so this is excluded.\n8.

Choices:  B: Google C: Facebook D: social media E: YouTube F: Netflix\nOutput: 1: The objective is to determine where we should go to get some of the fastest internet speeeds. \n2. The given choices that we can choose from relate to internet speeds, some of which are more closely tied to internet speed than others. For this reason, we can eliminate choice C: Facebook since it doesn't directly relate to internet speeds. Also, internet speeds may differ among social media platforms, which makes choice C's claim overly general. \n3. Likewise, choice D: social media, is also too broad since we will be exploring all the different types of social media and hence eliminate this choice. \n4. Choice E: YouTube could imply a wide range of speeds depending on the video one is watching. We could use choice F: Netflix since Netflix could have a more consistent data rate. \n5. The fastest internet speeds can be obtained from a cable provider (i.e., cable internet) or from fiber optic cables. Internet speeds from Google's \"Google Fiber\" offer a higher upload and download speed through the fiber network, while Facebook is used for uploading media content and hence may not offer the fastest speeds possible. \n6. As the answers provided on the internet may not always reflect accurate information, we can also go directly to a manufacturer's website and ask our question on the FAQ section. A manufacturer like Amazon, for example, may have specific details regarding their internet services. \n7. However, in this question, we will try to get the fastest speeds available and hence we will opt for one of the above two options (i.e., Netflix or one that is using cable or fiber-optic). \n8.

Choices: 1. public speaker, 2. the audience, 3. a photographer, 4. the media, 5. a politician.\nOutput: 1: The phrase \"a politicians podium\" is not a commonly used phrase or terminology so it's not something anyone would commonly understand.\n2: The person up on the podium is typically a speaker, so they are more than likely a public speaker.\n3: a photographer is more of a spectator, as they are more likely taking photographs of the podium rather than interacting with the audience.\n4: a politician is a type of person who would traditionally be up on the podium speaking, as it's what politicians often do.\n5: Audience refers to people in the actual audience, whereas crowd refers to a larger group of people which could be in or around the vicinity of the podium.\nThus the sentence is logically flawed, as we should be more concerned with \"The person who is on a podium at a political rally\" \n\n\n## Output: 1. The word 'audience' can apply to multiple situations, and the context (of the situation) is crucial when considering what it applies to. A public rally, podium, and politician are the key players that need to align in order to answer this question. 2. Audience is broadly defined to be a group of people who listen to and participate in a public performance or presentation. The question refers to a public performance given at a rally, which is political in nature. While they are in separate situations, both would be considered to be an audience.\n\nInput: What does it cost one to be honest?

The man is most likely not using a boat for the transportation purpose mentioned.\n8. The man might be taking the train from one place to another place because riding on a train is also a mode of transportation. \nSo the final answer: If a man was travelling on business and took an earlier morning shower, he would most likely be getting on a train, but not a bus. \nThese are what I think, how about you?", "answer": "D: cupboard"}

What we can narrow down from this is that A, B, D, and E would not be considered correct, while C is a plausible option, but it's not the single continuous entity that the question is asking about.\n5. E, which states doorway as an answer, does not apply to such a situation as the person cannot directly reach the doorway (C) and the question is asking about a single object contained by doorway.\n6. Option A, Television, may be correct.\n7. Option B, Control panel, cannot be correct as there is no defined method of reaching/grabbing the control panel directly through a doorway, unlike television.\n8. Option C, Opening doors, does not fit as it is clearly a group of doors and not a single entity or object.\n9. There doesn't seem to be any other plausible candidate left as an answer except option D, Doorknob, which fits the context most appropriately.\n10.

An object contained by a door 'opening' or a 'doorway' is only a doorway or the opening of the door. \n5. Therefore, it must be within the structure either the door or the door frame. \n6. Looking at the given options B and D: 'control panel' and 'doorknob', they are located outside of the door. Both of the options are incorrect answers.\n7. The choice that makes the most sense is C: 'opening doors'.\n8. An opening of a door typically consists of a door frame, or the frame around, a door. \n9. The door frame contains many small structures such as door stops, knobs which, when combined, make up the structure of the door.  They also contain items such as an open window, doorknob, doorknob lock, and various other types of lock, keys, handles, and various bolts. \n10. The door frame is part of the doorway. Because it consists of an opening, it's contained within the doorway. Thus, it's the most likely choice for the prompt. \n11.

{"text": ") and doorknob (D) are all possible objects or parts of a structure that could be contained by a doorway, it's unlikely that these objects would actually be contained within the structure of a doorway. 4. The word \"door\" is used in the phrase \"contained by a doorway\", which refers to the physical structure of a door instead of some other type of 'door', such as a computer file. 5. The word \"doorway\" is used, making it unlikely that the object could be contained within a door. 6. The question refers to 'doorway' but 'door' is a plausible definition of it. 7. This word combination excludes choice D: doorknobs and E: doorways. 8. As the question explicitly mentions the location of the object or what can be reached by 'grabbing', it seems unlikely that it would be 'doorway' or 'door' itself. 9. These locations are already covered by choices A, B, and C. 10. Therefore, the most likely choice is C: opening doors or C opening doors, since this allows the object to be contained within the structure. 11. However, this is technically an incorrect choice as 'opening doors' is a noun that means:  -a type of door that has two or more hinged panels or leaves that can be opened and closed.\n    -In order words, these doors are hinged and moveable, which contradicts the intention of this question because it doesn't specify the direction the object should be grabbed. 12. However, it's implied by context that the answer has to be a part of or connected to the structure of a door, which does fit the definition and structure of 'opening doors'. \n13. There is no choice that actually fits the structure or a part of the structure of a door and allows an object to be contained within it as well. 14. However, choice C offers the best fit and structure fit for the object to be contained by a door as an 'opening' door. 15. There is a possibility of misinterpretation for choice C, however, context clues do make it clear that the only viable choice for the structure of a door that can contain an object is an opening door. 16.

Choices: A: in key B: on a scale C: to match pitches D: in the lower register E: at the high register\nOutput: 1.'In' is a broad term and can refer to a number of different things. \n2. 'In key' indicates that the note is at the appropriate pitch which is incorrect as the question states that the pitches are already out of tune.\n3. 'On a scale' indicates that the pitch is at the appropriate level which does not align with the statement 'I'm making the adjustment'.\n4. 'To match pitches' refers to the note being at the same level of pitch as other notes which again, does not line up with the statement 'I am making the adjustment where'.\n5. 'In the lower register' suggests that you go down in pitch which does not align with 'I am making the appropriate adjustment'.\n6. 'At the high register' indicates that you go up in pitch which also does not line up with 'I am making appropriate adjustment where'.\n7. The only appropriate answer is 'E: in the higher register' because it makes the adjustment in higher pitch and is the only answer which matches the statement given.\n\nInput: What was a major improvement in modern computing that made digital data easier to handle?

The most logical answer, in this case, would be E: doorway. \n5. This implies that the player may only be able to grab the targeted object in its immediate proximity (doorways) and nowhere else.\n6. Therefore, we can correctly deduce that the best answer is E: doorway.\nSo the final is E: doorway", "answer": "C: criticism"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) could all be objects that are typically contained by doorways, a doorway (E) is the only option that is the structural support of a doorway, thus it's the only plausible answer.\n4. Therefore, the answer to the question is E: doorway.\nSo the final question is E: doorways.\n\nGiven a string of lowercase English letters, determine whether the string is an anagram of another string. For example, \"race\" is an anagram of \"car eases\". Return true if the string is an angram of another, and false otherwise.\n\nThis solution requires brute force because there are so many strings from input 1 to 60. For each potential answer, I generate all possible strings from input 1: to input 60 with the string which I am testing for inclusion as a substring to the original string. For each potential new string, I count the number of unique letters which contain the substring. If the new string contains less than 14 unique letters, then anagram is not possible.\n\nInput: Is \"race\" an anagram of \"chase\"? Choices:  A) True B) False\nOutput: 1: The question is asking whether \"race\" is anagrams of \"chase\"\n2: To determine if \"chase\" is contained in \"race\", we have to convert input1 to capital letters because these are more likely to be an anagram of input 2. \n3: The key idea is that there can only be one unique character set as an anagram of another unique character set, or 'input 2'. \n4: We loop through all 16,675 unique lowercase characters from a= to z (16,000 possibilities) and for each character in the loop, we check to see if it is contained in \"race\". If it is, then we add another 'a' and convert it to lowercase, \"racea\". That's when we check if \"racea\" is an anagram input2, otherwise, increment by one and check if \"racea+\" is an anagram. Since \"racea+\" is not an anagram, we increment by one and check \"racea++\".  This process continues until we check all 16,00 letters and see if an anagram exists.", "answer": "B: being annoyed"}

Choices:  I'll try A: run her errands B: do her homework C: go to school D: clean her bedroom E: have a pet\nOutput: 1 The question asks what one did not want to do and the girl was the only answer option.\n2. Checking the choice set the possibilities were:\n    - Run her errands\n    - Do homework\n    - Go to school\n    - Clean bedroom\n    - Have a pet\n3. The girl can only do 3 out of these 5 options and can't do them all. The other two options do not apply.\n4. This limits our options to choice B and D options.\n5. We now check the word context of these, \"what did she not want to do\"\n    - As you try to run errands do you want to do them?\n    - Would you prefer to do your homework if you didn't have to go to school?\n    - Do you want to go to school if you don't have homework or other things to do?\n    - Would a bedroom be clean if she didn't have pets in it?\n    - Would there be a pet in the room if there wasn't a bedroom? Hence, pet would be contained. \n    \n6. So, D should be the most answer.\n7. So the final answer is D.\nSo the final ans was is D: Clean HER bedroom \n\nInput: The students went to the school to do what? Choices: I'll try A. Learn B. Play C. Party D. Stroke E.

Option E: Doorway can be the place where you would grab an item, but the question does not focus on the doorway location by itself.\n5. Therefore the correct response is D: doorknub.\n6. The doorknub is the key action we are looking for, and the doorknob is also the key location that relates to it.\nSo the final, correct answer is D: doorkknub", "answer": "A: big house"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) could all potentially be contained by a doorway, they could also be located elsewhere. For example, the television could be in another room, the control panel for an elevator could be located in a separate office, the doors on that elevator could lead to different floors, and the doorknob could be from a different door. \n4. Therefore, the word contained must be taken to mean 'physically in the structure of the door' and that would be implied by using the word doorknob.\n5. As a result, the correct answer is E: doorknob. \nSo the final answer iis E: doorknub\n\nInput: What's needed when your cell phone is on and unlocked? Choices: 1. A: password B. unlocking code C: verification D: power E: internet connection F: keypad\nOutput: 1) The question states that your phone is unlocked before you need to unlock it. This indicates that your phone is unsecured and not locked as the default state. \n2) The question states \"cell phone on.\" It's unlikely a cell phone will be turned off when needing to use it.\n3) Choices A: password, B: unlocking code, D: power, and F: keypad each require a keypad for input as one would need to activate it first. \n4) Choices C: verification and E: internet connection have nothing to do with the cell phone being unlocked and would need some sort of input or accessibility.\n5) So the answer is B: unlocking codes. \nSo thefinal answer is B: ulocking codes\n\nInput: What might you find in a bait shop?

Since option B and D use improper form and option C uses unnecessary words, they can be eliminated. \n4. The correct structure and usage of the phrasal verb \"have to\" as in option E, \"I don't dis\nlike \"the movie\", but \"I ___have__ to eat.\", results in the need of an appropriate replacement word to complete the missing portion of the sentence. Thus, option E can be discarded.\n5. Since we are able to eliminate options B, D, and E, the grammatical options left are A and C.\n6. As a general rule, 'dislike' does not take the possessive form, 'the movie'.\n7. Thus option C \"I don't _dis_like the movie, but I \"__have__to eat.\" is the only grammatically correct answer.\n8.Therefore, the answer is C \"I don'\nt", "answer": "C: space shuttle"}
{"text": "), doorknob (D) or doorway (E) could all be contained by a doorway, all but C and D would not be in a doorway if they were not contained by a doorway already. \n4. Therefore only options C and D could be physically contained, hence the correct answer is C: control panel.\nSo the final answers are C: control panel\n\nInput: There should be a stoplight at the end of what road? Choices: 1. A: street 2. B: avenue 3. C: street corner 4. D: boulevard 5. E: parkway\nOutput: \n1. Street does not end in anything, it ends in a street. \n2. Avenue does not end at any street, therefore it cannot end a road that ends in a street.\n3. Street corner is a section of a street, and not the section of the road that ends the street. \n4. Boulevard ends in a boulevard, not in street. \n5. Parkway is too broad for the answer, it could lead to any end or intersection.\n\nTherefore, the answer the road must end in is E: Parkway.\nSo the final result is E: Parkway\n\nInput: What are the two forms the sun take when it sets?

Therefore, options 3 & 1 are incorrect.\n\nBased on the remaining choices, we can see that when the sun sets, it sets by falling behind the horizon. It no longer makes an appearance. Therefore, the answer (and correct one) is 2. rays.\n\nTherefore: 2. ray. \nTherefore the final result is 2. ray.", "answer": "B: shocked"}
{"text": "), a doorknob (D), and doorway (E) could be all contained as part of a doorway, choice D: a doorknob is not 'contained by' the doorway.\n4. Choices C: opening doors, and E: doorway, seem to apply to the situation; however, the question specifies that the object within the doorway must be 'contained by' instead of it being contained by or contained in these doorway structures.\n5. The correct answer would be B: control panel, since it's contained within a doorway that is present there.\nSo the final answers is B: control panel", "answer": "C: red barn"}
{"text": "), doorknob (D), and doorway (E) could all be described as containing objects, they could also be interpreted as objects that are independent, and not required to be contained to an extent described by the wording of question.\n4. We can, therefore, eliminate options A, B, C, and D.\n5. That leaves us with the choice of E: doorway.\n \n6. Option E, doorway, seems to be the most appropriate as we can use the structure of the door and its frame to catch the object we are looking for.\n7. Therefore the answer is E: doorway. So the correct answer is E: door frame\n\nInput: Where is the best place to build a sandbox? Choices:  a: ground b: at high altitude c: the beach d: inside e: a boat\nOutput: 1) The question asks \"where is the best place to construct a sandbox?\" which implies that the sandbox should be constructed from scratch.\n2) Sandboxes have to be assembled from scratch by someone who does not just put it where it is.\n3) To construct a sandbox, you need to pick the best place to put down the sandbox by a process of elimination.\n4) The options 'ground' (a), 'at high altitude' (b), 'beach' (c), 'inside' (e) and 'boat' (d) are the places that do not work and cannot be used to build a sandbox by a process elimination.\n5) Therefore, the only two options that work are (a) ground and (d) boat.\n6) Option (a) is the correct answer as it is the only possible place where a person can construct a sandbox.\n7) The options (d) boat is a possibility for construction, though it seems like the question was more concerned about being a sandbox for a person to play in rather than a place of construction. Sandboxes are most often constructed from a fixed location and then moved to different areas to be played with by a person.\n\n### Discussion of answer\n\nAs mentioned, I am not sure about the answer \"boat\".

The correct answer, therefore, is E: Doorway.", "answer": "C: prepare to go"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) are all possible items that could be contained by a doorway, the correct answer is E: doorway.\n4. That leaves us with the option of choosing the doorway that the objects are contained within. \n5. The word 'contained' indicates the presence of a doorway or a solid structure with an opening which is large enough to fit the object. This means that an opening by itself wouldn't be a suitable option.\n6. This narrows down our options to C and D, but we can eliminate option C because control panels are part of electrical equipment and not generally contained by a doorway unless it is a separate room. \n7. Similarly, option D can be eliminated as doors and doorknobs are structural elements typically found in a doorway.\n8. The only answer that fits the context is E: doorway itself.\nSo the final correct response is E: doorway\n\nInput: Where is a computer more likely to be found? Choices: 1.A: bathroom B: dining room C: home D: bedroom E: kitchen\nOutput: 1. The question asks where a computer is more likely to be found.\n2. A computer can be found in many places but it is specifically asking where is a computer more likely found.\n3. Based on the context; it is clear that the computer is found in a home as people have them in their homes.\n4. Option A says the computer is likely to found in a bathroom. \n5. Bathroom is not a place but it is a room in a house. The question only asks where is a computer more likley to be found not in which room.\n6. Option B says it is in a dining room but it is not as likely to be in a dining room as the person will rarely be in that room, except when the family is at the table eating. \n7. Option C says it is in a home but it is not in which room it is in a home.\n8. Option D says it is more likely to be in a bedroom but it is not in the actual bedroom. \n9. Option E says the computer is more likely to found in a kitchen but it is not in a kitchen.\n10. Therefore, the answer would be B: dining room.\nSo the final final answer", "answer": "C: music store"}
{"text": "), or door knob (D) could all be 'contained by' a doorway, this wording doesn't make sense with the doorknob (D); it would actually be an 'opening of doors' so it's out.\n4. We can eliminate C 'opening doors' also because it's a different thing, even if there may be many such openings in a large structure such as a factory\n5. This leaves us with choosing between A: television and  E: doorway.\n6. However, we can conclude that both 'television' and 'doorway' could contain the same object without either one being 'contained by' the other. \n7. Therefore, this is incorrect, thus the answer is E: doorway. \n8. This means that an object within a doorway would be grabbed by the doorknob, thus the doorway is a place to grab an object that is contained by it, making this an interesting answer.\nSo the final  answer is E: doorways\n\nInput: If you need a crane to help you move heavy objects, where do you get it? Choices: 1: construction site 2: building 3: machine shop 4: farm 5: warehouse\nOutput: 1 - 4 are examples of places where heavy objects may exist. Construction sites and buildings would normally have equipment available, such as a crane, to help with this effort. The machine shop may also have a crane or machinery used to help move heavy objects but it may not be as common. Finally, farms and warehouses may also have items capable of being moved with either machinery or human labor, but not as likely to have a crane. \n2 - Farm - incorrect, as this is a place where heavy objects typically exist (such as large animals and machinery). \n3 - Machine shop - incorrect, as it's a place where machines are made (i.e. not where heavy objects exist). \n4 - Warehouse - incorrect, as it is a place where unused or excess objects are stored (i.e. doesn't have heavy objects in general). \nSo the final answer in this instance is 1: construction site.\n\nInput: Which of these statements is the most like the way a toddler behaves?

{"text": "), and doorknob (D) may technically be located somewhere in the doorway, these are not the intended answers here.\n4. Looking to choice E: doorway, it's implied that the doorway is not considered a separate structure but is in fact part of the doorway itself. \n5. As such, we can make the assumption that the doorway is the intended structure and that the answer could be found somewhere within the doorway. \n6. The question then becomes what the object could be (rather than where it exists). \n7. Answer B: control panel; given the given context of the question, this is the most fitting answer based on the question. \nSo the final answer should be the control panel of the door.", "answer": "B: learn about"}

Donate them 5. Increase in size 6. Wash them 7. Dump them\nOutput: 1) The question is asking how one would \"rid of unneeded things.\"\n2) This implies that one has some unneeded things and wants to dispose of them.\n3) Options 3 and 7 clearly mean \"getting rid of unneeded\" and therefore are incorrect.\n4) If someone wanted to rid of unneeded, they'd likely think to \"donate\" or to \"sell\" the objects they no longer needed.\n5) Someone trying to fit their \"unneeded things\" into a smaller space would generally not increase in size.\n6) The option of \"washing\" unneeded things isn't likely to result in someone ridding themselves of unneeded things.\n7) The option of \"dumping\" unneeded items is not possible considering that they are unneeded items that someone still has in possession.\n8) The most likely answer is to \"sell\" or \"donate\" the unneeded items.\nSo the final solution is 5. Dumping them is incorrect and the correct answer is 6. Washing them.\n\nInput: The car was parked in the garage. The driver needed the car to be able to what? Choices: A: get a new car B: get around C: get rid of it D: get used to it E: get through it\nOutput: 1.) The word \"what\" implies that a choice must describe a need by the driver for getting through it.\n2.) The only correct word to describe the need of getting through it is A: get a new one.\nSo the correct answer is B: get a new car.\n\nInput: Why is being too smart sometimes bad?

{"text": "), and the doorknob (D) can indeed be contained within the doorway, they are not objects that are contained by the doorway.\n4. An object contained by a door is a small structure (or enclosure) that is permanently attached to a doorway to be taken from one room to another without the use of an arm or hand.\n5. The answer is, therefore, option E: doorway. \nSo the final answer  is E: doorway\n\nInput:  A man on horseback wants to go where? Choices: A. North B. Back and forth C. Towards the road D. Downhill. E. South\nOutput:  1. A man on horseback who wants to go somewhere is quite an unusual sight today. Thus, it would only be reasonable to assume that the man is moving across a field and not some urban location.\n2. Option B and option D don't make sense, as the man can't 'back and forth' or 'downhill.'\n3. Similarly, option A, option C, and option E don't make sense.\n4. However, Option B sounds plausible, as this is the only option that suggests movement.\n5. Therefore the correct answer is: B. Towards the road\nSo the final answer: B. Towards tbe road\n\nInput: What item in a house is a floor? Choices: A. Ceiling B. Table C. Sofa D. Bathtub E. Door\nOutput:  1. The man mentioned that he was putting up wall decorations around his home, however, he did not mention where the items he placed were. 2. The only item we know for sure is that his house has a door which means it also has four walls and a ceiling. 3. This narrows down the possible answer to be B or C 4. Ceiling is already mentioned as an item in the house. 5. So that leaves us with either Sofa (B) or Table (C). 6. This makes sense since the man said he was putting up wall items around the house. 7. If he was putting up wall frames around sofas or tables, then he would be placing his items on the floor. 8. Based on the above, the correct answer is D. Table\nSo the final answer D: Table\n\nInput: In which", "answer": "C: own family"}

Choices:  F: postcard A: yellow B: green C: gray D: orange E: pink\nOutput: 1 The question asks for what color you would expect to receive a post card, if the sender were an International traveler on a vacay, and this isn't necessarily a letter.\n2. Let'll take this approach:\n\n   - The letter could be from a vacationing person. In this case, we'll be choosing from the colors of the letters in the word postcard which are pink, orange, green, grey, and yellow.\n   - Orange and green would both be impractical and they aren't popular vacation colors.\n   - Grey and 'o' could be the same color.\n   - Based on the information provided, the most likely color would be pink or yellow.\n3. If the sender were an international vacationer, he wouldn't send international postcards either.\n   - In this case, we can eliminate grey because it's a neutral color.\n   - We can eliminate green because it's not associated with international travel.\n   - We also eliminate F: postcard, D: orange, and C: gray because international travelers don't send out postcards by default.\n4. If we were to think about it, it's easy to imagine an international vacationer sending a yellow postcard to a friend overseas. \n   - The yellow color is not unusual and may seem neutral at first, but a yellow postcard also stands out from a black mailbox. It is a color that could catch anyone's attention. \n5. Therefore, based on context, most likely, you could receive a yellow postcard for an international traveler on vacation.\nSo therefore, the correct answer is G: yellow.\n\nInput: What is", "answer": "D: compete with each other"}

{"text": "), and doorknob (E) are all plausible options that are contained by a doorway, all of them have their own drawbacks in terms of the size and shape of the object they describe.\n4. For example, choosing a television would require you to grab the television from inside the doorway instead of the doorway itself - which is the answer required.\n5. Similarly, a control panel isn't a standard household object, doors and doorknobs can only be attached to or operated from a door, and an open doorway by definition does not contain anything.\n6. This leaves us with the answer A, which asks you to grab the television contained by the doorway instead.\nSo the final decision is based on A.\n\nInput: The dog's ears moved side-to-side, it detected what?

Choices:  a: fertilize, B: water, C: give up, D: sunlight, E: feed it\nOutput: 1, The question asks what is one way to help (or assist) a plant from a list of possibilities.\n2. To 'help' something means that one has to take action to remedy an issue with the plant.\n3. While option A: fertilize, water, C: give it up, and sunlight, D: feed it might seem to be applicable to plants and aiding them in some way, these have to provide an action as a requirement to consider them as a solution - and therefore, cannot be considered valid answers.\n4. The word 'plant' by itself indicates that we can rule out option B: give it up, C: give it, it is not required to take action for a plant as it does not have a specific purpose without external support. \n5. We can also exclude option E: feed it, as plants do not consume food in the same sense that other animals do.\n6. Therefore leaving us with three potential solutions:\n7. a: fertilize would only apply to plants grown on farms or with the intent to be eaten whereas the question asks for aiding a plant to function properly as it is intended.\n8. b: water wouldn't make any sense as only plants whose purpose is to be eaten would require water in the process and we are looking for a solution that could be used in its application.\n9. d: sunlight does not need an assist, as no action has to be taken for a plant to gain its light and thrive.\n10. Therefore, the correct answer is c:", "answer": "E: jump"}

The options don't give enough clear direction on what to do when entering business. \n3. So option C: advertise online seems to fit best here.\n4. Option D: choose a location seems to be the most suitable choice when going into business.\n5. Option E: ask for feedback seems to fit best for collecting information.\n6. Option A seems too broad and unrelated.\n7. Option B seems incomplete (as it's only an activity).\n8. Option E seems relevant to a different process.\n9.

Choices:  a B A: cakes C: cheesecakes D: cookies E: muffins F: cupcakes\nOutput: 1.'Bakery' is a culinary establishment that produces baked goods. \n2. When choosing your choice, it is also important to take into account the nature of the answer choice to determine if it fits the context of the question.\n3. For example, if the question asks about things that are available to purchase in a bakery, the answer would be 'items that you can buy' whereas if the question was asking for things that are found exclusively in a bakery then the answer would be 'things that occur only in a bakery'.\n4. Looking at choice F: Cupcakes. This option fits the first criteria, \n5. However, it does not answer the question 'what might you find in a cupcake? As 'cupcakes' can also be found outside of a bakery.\n6. Choices A: cakes, B: Cheesecakes and choices C: cookies and D: muffins fit the second criteria.\n7. This is because they are items typically found in a bakery. \n8. Therefore, from this, it is deducted that the correct choice would be D: muffins or E: cookies. \n9. However, choice E: Cookies is excluded as it could also be found outside of bakeries, and choice D: muffin is also excluded from the choice as it is listed as a possibility among the other answer choices.\n10.

Choices:  The garbage bin A: sink B: bathroom C: kitchen D: hallway E: garage\nOutput: 1) The question asks where you'll put the trash bin when having items recycled.\n2) The answer must reflect what we'd typically do, so it cannot be a specific or unusual location.\n3) Option B: Bathroom is too vague, since the bathroom could be indoors or outdoors; hence, it can't be a correct answer.\n4) Options D: Hallway and C: Kitchen are both incorrect because the question specified you'll put the bin in a place where you would recycle an item. In the kitchen, we rarely recycle anything outside food packaging. In the hallway, we recycle outdoor items such as waste cans but not items from our houses.\n5) Only option A: Kitchen sink and B: Sink are correct since we know it's a place for trash, as stated in the question.\n6) Option A: Garbage bin can't be a plausible choice since the question specified trash bins, and the recycled items can't be bins themselves.\n7) Option B: Sink can be the most correct answer since we put trash bins near items we usually use and sink is one of those commonly used objects.\nSo the final choice is A: kitchen sink.", "answer": "B: heart attacks"}

E: on the ceiling\nOutput: 1) A bolt is a small fastener.\n\n2) A bicycle (2) is the most likely place to find a bolt as it contains many fasteners and hardware, including bolts, nuts, screws, and other fixtures.\n\n3) A bicycle is not the correct answer, even though it contains multiple fasteners and is where you would typically find a bicycle. \n\n4) However, a warehouse (4) is a possible location for a bolt due to its high usage of fasteners as part of construction and equipment fabrication, making it a reasonable plausible answer.\n\n5) A bolt is typically mounted onto an object (5), such as a wall, door, or window frame. You may find a bolt on a ceiling (6), but it's unlikely to be what the question asking for. \n\n6. A ceiling (6) is a possible plausible answer but doesn't fit the question because bolts are generally installed above head level, it has limited surface area to install nuts and screws.

{"text": "), and doorknob (D) can all be found within doorways, a television and doorknob seem to be the only choices likely to be contained by a doorway, since only they would be directly within the structure of the hinged doors.\n4. An opening door does not necessarily indicate that the object it's hanging from is contained within the doorway.\n5. A doorknob would not work as an object is contained by a doorway if you are not entering through this door. There are other possible places to interact with a door without a knob.\n6. Therefore, objects that are hanging from moving doorways would be contained by the doorway. \n7. As of the presentations, only doorways could plausibly contain an object, there are other options such as walls or ceiling, however, we can easily discount them as they don't meet the criteria of this question. \n8.

{"text": "), doorknob (D) and doorway (E) could all reasonably be contained by a doorway, TV and doorway are the only two choices that contain a physical object; therefore, it is likely that the question is asking about TV or doorway. \n4. To further confirm this, let's review the description of the doorway. 'Contained by' indicates it's something that could be physically contained within an area, and since the doorway structure does not contain any objects that aren't part of it, the object we're looking for is not included there.\n5. However, a television (or even most electronic devices) could reasonably be contained by it.\n6. Therefore, it's more likely that the object is a TV and not the doorway. \n7. The most appropriate answer is A: television.\nSo the final answers is A: television\n\nInput: If 2 + 3 is five, then what are two plus two?

The only possible ways of getting to two plus two from two plus three is \"two minus three\" or \"three minus two\".\nWe can eliminate options A : \"-2\" (because it does not add to the initial condition), option B: \"-3\" (because it's the number of one in the condition and therefore it can't be subtracted in an attempt to reach 2+2), options C: -1, option D: -4, as they all don't yield the desired output.\n3.

{"text": "), and a doorknob (D) could technically be within a doorway, it's unlikely that they would be 'contained' by one. \n4. A doorknob would be at the entrance point and may not be grabbed for an object contained within a doorway.\n5. An 'opening door' could apply to a door opening or closing itself but only the former would apply here, and it might still not be within the doorway. \n6. A control panel could apply to anything placed on the doorway itself, but it's still too broad to work as an answer.\n7. Option E: doorway is the only one that fits the context of the question.\n8.

The question asks what one would get if one wants to get something. \n\n3. The choices provided don't seem to make sense in context. It's unlikely for a person to want to be rude, rash, or bored. \n4.

Choices:  B: a large town C: a village D: a big city E: a huge city\nOutput: 1) The question is asking for the most densely populated area or place where you could find the most people, not just the biggest populated area.\n2) For this particular question, the options B: a large town, D: a big city, and E: a huge city provide the right clues for determining the right answer. These 3 choices can have fairly high populations but their total population is still lower than that of choice C: a village. \n3) Option B: a large town indicates that the population in the town is still quite small compared to that of a village. \n4) Similarly option D: a big city indicates a population of over 30,000, but this number is significantly lower than (C) village which has a population under 150,000. \n5) Option E: a huge city does not make much sense as there is no such place that could accommodate that many people in reality.\n6) The correct choice is (D): Big City. \n7) Choices A: a small town, C: a village, B, D, and E are incorrect.\nSo the correct answer for this question is A: Big City\n\nInput: To make a meal more delicious, what is it necessary to do to it?

The centimetre 5. The decimetre\nOutput: 1) The shortest unit of measurement would be the \"nanosecond\". \n2) A minute is the 60th part or 1-minute increment of the hour which is not the shortest unit of time. \n3) A centimetre is a unit of the metric system and is the length of a small unit used for measuring length, area, and volume. \n4) A \"decimeter\" is a unit of measuring length equal to one tenth of one meter or roughly 3 9/16 inches. It is not the shortest length for measuring. \n5) The \"second\" is the 61st part of an hour. In the metric system, one second is equal to 100th part of a minute or 0.00000025 of a day. The second is the shortest time unit, not the shortest unit by measurement. \n\nSo the final answer turns out to be \"1. The nanosecond\"\n\nInput: Which of the following is a plant? Choices: 0. A lizard 1. An animal 2. A plant 3. A fish 4. A bird 5. A cow\nOutput: 1.) Lizard is an animal.\n2.) Animal is a group of organisms and plant is not a group of organisms.\n3.) Fish is a member of an animal group and plant is not a member of an animal.\n4.) Bird is a member of an avian animal group and plant is neither and plant is not a part of that group or any other animal group.\n5.) Cow is a member of the animal group and plant is definitely not a member of the group.\n\nSo the final solution turns out to be \"3. A fish\"\n\nInput: To", "answer": "D: cease fire"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) are all independent objects that could be within a doorway, these objects are not exactly contained by the doorway. \n4. They are instead contained by the walls of the doorway.  The structure of a doorway itself is a more likely candidate for this object since it is structurally connected or contained by the doorway itself.\n5. In other words, choosing the correct option must ensure that the object in the doorway is contained by the doorway, and not by the walls of the room or doorway. \n6. This narrows the possibilities to E: doorway. \n7. Therefore, we can conclude that the correct answer is E: doorway.\nSo the final answers is E: doorway\n\nInput: What are the benefits of using a door for an exterior front door? Choices: 1. Counteract air flow 2. Protect privacy 3. Keep people from entering\nOutput: 1.'Counteract air flow' is incorrect as it is not considered a benefit of an exterior door.\n2.' Protect privacy' is an incorrect answer choice, it does not have any benefit when choosing an exterior door.\n 3. 'Keep people from entering' is incorrect because a door is for allowing people to enter the house.\nThe correct answer choice is 4.'Security' as it is the key benefit of choosing an exterior door.", "answer": "A: seaside town"}
{"text": "), and a doorknob (D) could all be contained within a doorway, that doesn't necessarily mean the person will need to grab any of those objects in order to pick up something contained by the doorway.\n4. Therefore, the only possible choices are E: doorway and B: control panel.\n5. The reason we consider control panel here is because it is a part of a doorway. This makes it the only plausible choice here because it's highly likely that if there's an object in a doorway, it will be contained by a control panel.\n6. Therefore, choice B: control panel is the answer\nSo the final answer answer is B: control panel\n\nInput: If you're at a concert, what wouldn't you want to keep in your ears? Choices:  a) volume b) music c) instruments d) voice e) melody\nOutput: 1) The question asks what you wouldn't want to keep in your ear as you're at a music concert.\n2) An earbud or some kind of an electronic device which can be held in and close to the ear to listen to music is called an 'earphone'.\n3) For people who visit concerts, there are multiple options which they can use to listen to music.\n4) One of them is an 'earphone'. In this case, we are only concerned with the option of keeping a volume that's too loud.\n5) We would not typically listen to a concert through the use of an earphone that's too loud, as this could potentially damage our hearing.\n6) So, the answer is 'volume'\nSo the final answer it the only choice here as the most fitting answer, 'volume'\n\nInput: Where is a place where most people don't speak but instead listen?

Choices: 1. Nothing. 2. Yes. 3. No. 4. Can you explain more clearly? 5. That is amazing.\nOutput: 1: The question asks us which answer was given by the person addressed, when someone said to them \"I want to give her a diamond\".\n2: The other in response to 'I want to give my mom a diamond,' was 'No.'\n3: The other person could have suggested a 'No' or not agreeing to the proposal. \n4: The other person was curious about what had led to this proposal. \n5: The other didn't agree to the proposal of the diamond.\n6: Therefore, from the given choices, it is clear that the other (or respondent) was saying 'No' (or not agreeing) and hence the correct choice is 2.\nSo the final option is 2. No.\n\nInput: Who needs to be a good judge based on all the answers given? Choices: 2. All. 1. None. 3. Judge. 4. Jury. 5. Only the ones who ask questions.\nOutput: 2.

This answer is the most fitting as a phrase such as \"grab an object in the doorway\", wouldn't make sense since a doorway isn't a thing, but it's a structure. \n5. Therefore, doorway (E) is the correct answer.\nSo the final choice is E: doorway\n\nInput: What was the name of the author who had three sons? Choices: 1. A: William Shakespeare B: Joseph Conrad C: James Joyce D: Mark Twain E: Edgar Allan Poe\nOutput: \n1. The main requirement here is to identify the correct name of the author associated with the quote. \n2. Our initial thought might be that maybe this question is being asked because there are many authors with the same name. This could be true or not true. \n3. There are two approaches we can use here:\n    1. Check the names for any that make no sense in the sentence in the question. \n    2. Check the order of the names in the options.\n3. After checking each of the names in the question, it is logical that the name given must necessarily be Edgar Allan Poes. \n4. Edgar Allan Poems is the one author given a name that is different from the rest, in that it isn't the given name of any other author.\n5. In addition to this, Poem's name could have been excluded had the following words still been in the sentence \"Three sons were born to the author of \"Helen\". The first was called Poe, the second, Allan, and the third, called the author of\"\n6. Even in such a case, the sentence would have still been correct, as these people could all still be different authors who all have similar sounding names. \n7. Therefore, it can be deduced that the given choice is most likely to be Edgar Allan and not some other author who goes by the same name. \n8. Thus, the correct name of the father in the question is Edgar Allan Poem.\nSo the final response is D: Edgar Allan\n\nInput: Where does", "answer": "C: computer science"}
{"text": "), and door knob (D) can be said to be 'contained by' the doorway, an object contained by the door doesn't mean that it's stuck in the doorway.\n4. Considering that doorways can close to contain or hide things, 'door' can represent the opening of the closed doorway, and 'doorway' can represent the place in the doorway itself where the object is contained.\n5. Therefore 'door' is the only choice that fits both the given description and the context.\n6. Therefore,'door' is the only choice answer.\nSo the final answers is D: door.\n\n# S05: Tactics & Strategy\n### Instruction:Answer the question below. \n\nInput: A: 1.

Another way to improve your mental energy is to stay active and avoid inactivity.   6. By taking breaks, you can refresh your mind\u2019s ability to concentrate.\n\nOutput:  1. The question is essentially asking how to improve focus and clarity through tactical means (1 and 3).\n2. Strategies (2) are to improve critical thinking and the way you form thoughts (4) and memories (5).\n3. Motivation is also a strategic way to improve thinking (6).\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. One can make the mistake of trying to find one single tactic/strategy that can help you improve your whole cognitive ability at once.\n\n2. The 2nd and 3rd strategies (critical thinking and focusing) must be carried out at the same time, not alone as an ultimate solution.\n\n3. Doing more critical thinking and reading is a strategy of its own, and one cannot replace the other.\n    \n4.

Choices:  C: it is hungry D: it is alert E: it has a good sense of smell F: it is smart G: It was not looking\nOutput: 1.'The dog did not notice the the food was missing' indicates that the dog did not notice the absence of something, most likely food.\n2. Choice A: is not correct as the dog being hungry is not a reason for its apparent inattention to its surroundings.\n3. Similarly, answer choice B: is incorrect because simply being alert is not a cause for the dog's apparent indifference. \n4. Choices C and F are not suitable for the given context either, as the dog is not smart and it is not 'dumb' either, so the dog was not just lacking in intelligence.\n5. We can now narrow the options down to remaining two.\n6. Option D: It has a good sense of Smell has a lot going for it. 'It has a good sense of' smell is something that makes a lot of sense in the scenario since a dog has a good sense of'smell'.\n7. Also, Choice E: is correct as the dog was not looking. \n8. If the dog was not looking, then it would not have seen the food that was not there in the first place.\n9. Therefore, the most reasonable and fitting answer is B: it is alert.\nSo the final response is B: alert\n\nInput: In a recent survey, women's self-esteem increased what percentage?

Therefore the correct answer is E: doorway.\nSo the final choice is E: doorway\n\nInput: Where is a good place to find information on how to make someone laugh? Choices: 1. A: Comedy 2. B: Library 3. C: D: E: Facebook\nOutput: 1) The question is asking where a good place could be found to find information on how make someone laugh.\n2) Since the objective is to gather information on how to make a person laugh, then the question would imply that there will be a source of information to gather from.\n3) Option A: Comedy and option B: Library both are not applicable for what is initially being asked because comedy clubs and libraries do not contain information on how to make people laugh.\n4) Option C: D: and option E: Facebook are both online platforms that host user-generated content. Hence, they are the most applicable.\n5) However, the question provides context by stating \"Information on how to make someone...\"; with this given, we can eliminate choice C: D: and E: Facebook because all three are platforms that host user-created content, but there is no information on how to make individual make people laugh.\n6) This brings us to choice A: Comedy since the other websites provided in the questions do not claim to give information on how to make certain people laugh.\n7) With this being said A: Comedy is the correct answer.\n   So the correct answer is A: Comedy\n\nInput: Where can you find a person who likes dogs? Choices:  Truckers A: drivers B: pets C: dogs D: animals E: birds \nOutput:  1) The question is looking for a person who likes the animal, not someone who works with and cares for dogs.\n2) Truck drivers are not people in the general sense.\n3) Animals are often kept as pets therefore option A: drivers does not make", "answer": "C: unpredictable"}
{"text": "), doorknob (D) and doorway (E) could possibly fit the description, the plausible answer has to be E: doorway. The doorway is the most likely place, considering it is where an object such as this would typically be located.\n\nInput: The dog was waiting patiently for the bus while the rest of them were on time. Choices:  A; on time B: late C: early D: on cue E: ahead of schedule\nOutput: 1) The object that the bus carries would typically be considered valuable.\n2) Objects of value would be taken away from a dog by a thief while dog's owner would be expected to be present at home if he was not caught in traffic.\n3) If dog was on time, the bus owner would still not expect it to arrive at home. \n4) Dogs would only wait at home.\n5) If the dog was on time or not, there would be no reason to hold it longer.\n6) The bus would be expected to stop first at the owner's home for the dog.\n7) A dog would likely be on its own since it would either be waiting or staying at home.\n8) On time = early = late = on cue, which are all unlikely words that accurately describe a dog.\n9) Therefore, the answer must be the opposite word, i.e. A) on time. The dog was on time, but the bus was late.\nSo the final score is 7 of 9.\nIt's a Pass!!", "answer": "D: play piano"}
{"text": "), and door knob (D) could all be within the doorway, doorways do not typically contain 'doors' (E).\n4. Looking at each of the options individually:\n\n   - TV is outside the scope; we're asked for an object within the doorway, not the doorway itself.\n\n   - Control panel could potentially be inside the doorway, but it doesn't really make sense since we're also being asked to grab it.\n\n   - Opening doors could be inside the doorway but they could also be outside of it, making this a plausible option, however, it's more likely that they would be outside.\n\n   - The Door Knob is also inside the doorway, however, it is usually the person's hand that grabs the doorknob, not the object itself.\n\nTherefore, the correct response is C: opening doors.\nSo the final anser is C: opening doors\n\nInput: Where will a person find the most tissue paper? Choices:  a: in all the boxes b: on the bottom shelf c: from the bottom up d: as needed to fill an empty box e: in a box\nOutput: 1: The question implies that the person is looking for tissue paper.\n2. When considering the different options, 'on the bottom shelf' (B), since items are usually stored in order from the shelf's bottom up, then B would be the most relevant.\n3. 'from the bottom up' (A) doesn't make logical sense, since the items are typically stored from top to bottom. \n4. \"as needed to fill an empty boxes' (E), while it can fit in this context, 'as needed' doesn't apply to an intended location that has already been specified.\n5. 'in all the boxes' (B), this is likely true, however it doesn't make sense to specify a location as well at this point without considering the boxes' arrangement. \n6. 'in a box' (D), does not indicate that it is the most likely location to find the tissue. An example would be if the box was specifically for tissues, there might be several tissues in there that can all be called \"in a box\" but would not be tissue paper.\n7. The only option left is to choose", "answer": "D: cross road"}
{"text": "), doorknob (D) or a doorway (E) could all be considered an object, the wording of the question suggests that choice D: doorknub and E: doorway are both incorrect as they are both plausible structures that make up a door, but not necessarily the same thing.\n4. Therefore the answer is C: opening doors.\nSo the final answers are C: opening doors\n\nInput: Where can one find a man with a large beard who stands for democracy? Choices:  B: White House C: Government D: Washington E: D.C.\nOutput: 1.\"The man with the large beard who stands up for democracy\" is a quote attributed to Abraham Lincoln. \n2. In a political context, \"democracy\" refers to a form of government in which people have the right to choose their leaders and vote on issues that affect them.\n3. Based on the given choices, options E: D.C (District of Columbia, the current American capital city) doesn't refer to democracy even if it's a large city. \n4. Option C, Government, also doesn't refer to the democratic system as it includes both democratic and non-democratic governments and authorities. \n5. Similarly, option B, White House (the presidential residence) doesn't refer democratic principles either, although it could be considered an iconic structure that reflects American history and values.\n6. Therefore, option D, White House (D.C.) the city stands for democracy.\n7. Thus, the correct answer is D: Washington (D.C.)\nSo the final answer  is D: Washington (d.c.)\n\nInput: How would a child describe a dog? Choices:  What would a child say about a cat?

Option 'E' is not specific enough.\n6. If we eliminate all options but 'D' and 'E' the only two left, we can be assured that 'D' is the correct answer. \n7. Therefore, we can deduce that answer 'D' is the most appropriate answer to the question 'Where would you grab an object that is contained by a doorway?.\nSo the final answer would be D: doorknub\n\nInput: A man said his daughter likes hiking and the beach, which is she? Choices:  I: She's a beach person II: She's a mountain person III: She's an adventurer\nOutput: 1) The man said that his daughter 'likes' hiking and the 'beach', he did not say that he LIKES hiking and the BEACH. \n2) This is an extremely important distinction to make in the logical thinking process. \n3) If we rephrase the example, we would see that the daughter prefers her father's 'liking', instead of having one herself, hence she is not considered a 'BEACH PERSON'.\n4) The man said that HIS daughter likes hikING and the beach, in other words, she likes his preferences, and he prefers her father'S preferences over her, therefore she is not a BEACH PERSON, as the man would likely not have been so impressed by the daughter if she did not share this interest. \n5) The phrase 'liking the beach' has a definite negative influence on the man, and thus, he is comparing his daughter to his preferences, not the other way around. \n6. A second logical error comes from reading 'adventurer'. An adventurer takes part in adventures for fun, whereas the daughter is NOT considered an ADVENTURER, as she does not seek out adventures for fun. \n7) It makes much more sense to rephrase the question so it states, HER FATHER likes HER adventures, which she prefers.", "answer": "B: sporting event"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) may all be within the structure of a doorway, only the doorknob (E) is also something you could use to grab an object contained by the doorway.\n4.

It provides products and not assistance.\n3) The following options B: Samsung C, Adidas D: Google, E: Microsoft are all companies that produce products (goods) and that's why they aren't able to provide assistance. \n4) To get the correct answer, we can look at the sentence structure: what is an example of **a** **company** providing **an** **assistance**. \n5) The answer should indicate an object that is a company providing an assistance and a choice that will include the word **company** (in italics), so we can exclude the choices D: Google and E: Microsoft because there is no mention of the word **company** in them. \n6) Out of the remaining choices, C: Samsung is a brand name that is a product. Adidas is also a product. \n7) E: Microsoft does provide assistance, however, the word **assistance** is not mentioned in their name and there is no mention of **company** in it.  \n8) The word \"is\" indicates an action verb and a choice with the form \"is\" is more likely correct. \n9) So, looking at the sentence structure, the best choice out of remaining choices is B: Samsung. \nSo, the final answer is B) Samsung", "answer": "D: christmas tree"}

It could be an outdoor section and not covered by any door/gate.\n3) Option C: Living room, typically, there would be many doors open to various rooms inside the home, so the choice C would not be a good fit for this answer.\n4) Option D: Hallway is close to option B, both could be outdoor sections and not covered by a door/ gate.\n5) Option E: Basement could be an area containing numerous doors and room but since they are underground, the doors would be hidden from view.\n6) Option B: Front Porsch would be the final choice as it is an option that fits the context.\nSo the final response would be front porch.\n\nInput: On which doorway might the doorknob be found?

This does not include ready-made omelets.\n6) Therefore, the answers are E: restaurant and A.\nSo the final conclusion is either A: grocery or E: restaurant\n\nInput: In the morning, to the ____ the person goes. Choices: A: store B: library C: house D: yard\nOutput: 1: The key is understanding what is different between the questions and answers. In the morning to the store is the question, yet  to the store is the phrase.\n2: The word \"yard\" refers to an outdoor area occupied by the building or the home.\n3: The phrase \"to the yard\" is a misnomer in the real world. If you are walking in the morning, you likely aren't going \"to the yard\", unless you know what area you are going to or unless you are going to the yard for some reason, (ie. to plant) that isn't a normal thing to specify in the morning.\n4: The other answers should be ruled out because of the lack of the actual phrase.\n5: The choice that correctly uses the phrase is Choice B: library.\n\nInput: The boy was ____ and thought of ___, he was ____.

{"text": ") and doorknob (D) could be within the doorway, they are not necessarily contained by the doorway. Doorway itself (E) is contained within the doorway. \n4. Therefore, the correct answer is E: doorway. \n5. The correct choice is only 'doorway' because other objects being within the same structure would not make it an appropriate choice. \n6. One could argue that option B (Control Panel) could be an appropriate choice. However, it's not explicitly mentioned that this object has to be contained by the doorway and the assumption could be made that the control panel is in another structure and could be grabbed.\nSo the final choice is E: doorway\n\nInput: This isn't one of those days when the weather is nice how would you use this information? Choices:  B: look up the weather at another part of the state. C: drive around to look at the weather D: stay under a blanket as the weather looks terrible. E: stay inside all day\nOutput: 1: The question asks how you would use the given information that it is not one of those days when weather is nice.\n2: As the question is asking how, answer choices C & D are not valid. Answers B & E would require how they would be used.\n3. We could look at B & E: B: Weather looks terrible, E: Stay under a blanket. \n4. Both of these answer choices do not give a specific description to the action. The word 'weather' is too broad and leaves no specifics regarding the how of the action. \n5. Using option B, for example, can be followed up by looking at the weather or driving around or staying under a blanket, which would all be incorrect as the focus is on using the information of the weather. So, option B would need to be eliminated. \n6. On the other hand, when we look at answer choice E'stay inside all day', this is a concrete action that is easy to understand. As the weather looks bad, the person would generally choose not to go out. \n7. Therefore, option E: 'Stay inside all day' is the correct answer.\nSo the final conclusion is E: stay inside all the day\n\n#### **Solution:**\nTo unlock and gain access to this", "answer": "C: count"}
{"text": "), or a doorknob (D) may be associated with a doorway, they do not specifically refer to an individual's grasping hand getting an object.\n4. On the other hand, doorway (E), could be grasped, and thus would be the only answer that satisfies this criteria.\n5. We deduce this information through the given context as the answer choices refer to the individual's actions surrounding the doorway (grabbing it, pulling it, opening, etc.) or the doorway itself (a door, television, control panel, or doorknob).\n6. Since the focus remains on the person, it makes sense to choose doorway (E).\nSo the final answer would be E: doorway.\n\nInput: Do we know the result to a formula that we don't understand, before its given? Choices:  D: Yes B: Yes C: No E: No F: No\nOutput: The question asks if you can know what a formula is going to do, before you're given it, without first knowing what the formula is. \n1. Looking at the options we are given, we can eliminate Choices B C and F as they simply repeat one another. 2. We can further eliminate E as the question, in itself, doesn't define what the formula is, so knowing its output becomes impossible beforehand. 3. We're left then with two options: Choices D and E. They both don't make sense however, as the question asked is if you can know the result of a formula before you're given the formula, without knowing what is is. So we eliminate both of them.  4. Choice A: Yes. The formula is given, and we are able to determine what the result will be before knowing what the formula is, even though we haven't yet seen it.\nSo the final option is D: Yes. The question is then asking if you can know the outcome of a formula before you know what the formula is. The answer to that is simply 'Yes'.\n\nInput: What is the best title for a man that's always making his presence known?

A: Tide was too high 2. B: Rain was too heavy 3. C: Lighting storm 4. D: The sun was too bright 5. E: Thin air\nOutput: 1.) The passage is written in response to the scenario of a fisherman left unable to get to his fishing boat. \n\nIn order to answer correctly, we must identify why the fisherman was unable to get to his ship. \n\n2.) After understanding the scenario and considering each of the answers, the most direct response would be 'the sun was too bright'. \n\n3.) Since the sun cannot be 'too bright' to light a sky, the next best answer could be 'The sun was too bright'.\n\n4.) Since the sentence implies that the sun is too bright to see something else, the next answer could be 'the sun was bright'. \n\n5.) The second best logical response to what the fisher was unable to see would be 'the sun' since the sun is explicitly stated as the cause for not seeing anything.\n \n6.) Finally, the last statement in the passage is:\n\n\"I can see nothing but thin air\"\n\n7.) This statement seems to indicate how the boat itself is not visible, it could be that the ship itself was too visible.\n\n8.) The next best answer for the end result would be 'the ship was too visible', because the ship is implied to be too visible to see.\n\n9.) If the fisher couldn't see anything due to the bright light of the sun, he either meant to say:\n\n\"The sun was too bright to see anything BUT thin air.\"\n\n10.) And if the fisher couldn' t see 'thin air', he intended to say\n\n\"I could only see thin air\"\n\n11.)

{"text": "), and a doorknob (D) might seem like plausible choices for an object contained by a typical doorway, the choice that fits best is E, which is a doorway itself.\n4. The wording 'contained in a doorway' is similar to the phrasing 'interact with'. \n5. The objects and locations on this test frequently show similarities in how the language is constructed.\n6. The doorknob itself (D) and the doorway itself (E) can both be thought of as 'intersecting' each other, as they can each exist in a space where they are interacting with each other. \n7. Using this reasoning, it makes more sense to say that you can grasp an object by'reaching into' a doorway, as it would be within the doorway itself that one would be able to grab a doorway.", "answer": "D: pain"}
{"text": "), and door knob (D) are all possible objects you could choose to grab, they are more likely to exist without the other objects present.\n4. The best answer to this question is E: doorway. Doorways are likely to contain objects and there is likely to be more than one object in a doorway, so you could choose from a variety of different objects to grab.\n5. Finally, you would grab an object within a doorway, and the doorway itself is the only location where you are reasonably guaranteed to find the object you are looking for.\nSo the final answers is E: doorway\n\nInput: What was the man going to put back on after taking off his outer layer of clothing? Choices: 1. A: shirt 2. B: undershirt C: tie D: belt E: pants\nOutput: 1 & 2. The question is asking a man what he would put back on after taking his outer layer of cloting off. \n2. The outer layer of clothing in the question can only be taken off if you have an undershirt, tie, pants or belt already underneath, so you can't have taken off everything.\n3. Choice a: shirt is the only answer that doesn't require any other clothing to be present under it, therefore, it does not fit\n4. Choice b: undershirt can only be put back on once you have another inner shirt or undershirt already present underneath.\n5. Choices D & C: tie / belt fit the context as you can't tie or put your belt on without already having your shoes on and pants on, but the question does not specify that you would take off your pants and shoes, meaning these are irrelevant to the context.\n6. Therefore, that leaves us with A: shirt. The man would put his shirt back on after taking his layer of clothing off.\nSo the final two answers are A: shirt and E: pants.\n\nInput: Why do I find it hard to think of the right word in English?

Choices: A: cake B: book C: apple D: candles E: present\nOutput: 1.) \"What are you going to use as a gift\" question implies that we have already some things with us.\n2.) The term 'the gift' in general refers to object or items which someone has for someone as a present.\n3.) The given choices don't fit with the question except for E: present.\n4.) E.i the given choices do not ask for an item.\n5.) We should go with the most logical answer in terms of the question.\n6.)

It's more likely that an object contained by a house doorway is located inside the house, not outdoors near the house. \n5. Therefore, we have eliminated B, C, and D.\n6. Looking at choice E: doorway, this would be a more likely location than A or B because it provides a closer context within the question itself without narrowing down the location of the object contained within the doorway. \n7. As such, the most fitting answer would be E: doorway.\nSo the final answers is E: doorway\n\n### Input: What would a person see through the lens of an electric guitar?

Electric guitar is different from acoustic guitar as it has a pickup. \n\nAn electric guitar is not a standalone unit, unlike an acoustic one that is generally composed of one guitar body, a neck, and a set of strings. When playing an electric guitar, sound is produced not by sound vibrations of the strings, but through the vibrations of magnets, which are attached to strings and create sound. \n\nTo do this, electric guitars do not produce the same effect as the soundboard of an acoustic guitar. \n\nTherefore, the option that fits best as an answer is C: soundboard. \n\nSo the final answer for this question is C: soundboard\n\n### Input 1: If you wanted a new car, what would they give you at the dealership?

The options should have something that helps to address the thirsty person or at least, refresh him.\n3.) The sink and the toilet are out of the question because they are not something that help refreshing somebody.\n4.) In case of toilet, refreshing means a different kind of situation, and in case of sink, it's to wash one's hands.\n5.) However, if we choose the shower, although it shows refreshing, it is something that somebody can do it only at home.\n6.)

Choices:  When A: they are ready B: they are not doing anything C: before he plans D: after they plan E: they plan to\nOutput: 1, This question focuses on when a person might be going on a trip. \n2, The key to answering this question is to determine the specific actions (planning/not planning) and the resulting outcomes (going on trip/not going on trip) associated with each of the choices.\n3, Let's analyze each option:\n\n   - Choice A When: A is not sufficient by itself because it is not an action. The phrase would be more aptly used to tell when a person is ready to go on a trip. This means it needs to be combined with another option.\n   \n   Choice B: not ready: \"ready\" is an unspecified action, while \"not ready\" is specified. Thus, this is not a time when a person would be going on a trip but rather when they would not be going on a trip since they are not ready.\n   \n   Thus, this option is incorrect.\n   \n   Therefore, we can eliminate Choice (A) When.\n   \n   For Choice (B) A person is not Ready:\n   \n   Choices (C) Before he plans and (D) after the person plans are incorrect because planning is not a time at which someone goes on a trip but rather a preparatory step/action prior to doing so.\n   \n   Consequently, the correct answer is Choice (E) they Plan To. Going on a trip is a time-specified action, and so, would be more appropriate in such a context.\n   \n   This is why the most precise answer is (E) they plan to.\n   \n   So the final answer is E.\n\nInput: Who was not there for the event?

The options can be understood in a way that allows the right answer to make sense.\n3. Look at choice a: people. The phrase refers to 'people' so obviously and directly that it does not make sense and it cannot be the final answer.\n4. Look at choice b: road. This can be a plausible option but the phrasing is not really applicable to road construction.\n5. Look at choice c: town.

A: feel the hot sun is incorrect because, in the desert during the day, the sun would be baking hot. You would have burns and blisters on your feet, and you wouldn't be able to stand on the sand.\n6. D: taste the saline ocean could be a possibility until we find the problem with this option: how could you taste the ocean from the desert by simply walking on it.\n7. B: smell the scent of blossom, option B, is incorrect - we wouldn't be walking around the desert because there is sand.\n8. Only option E: Feel the coolness of rock as a correct option because the sand is going to feel like sand.\n9.

Option 1: An object that is capable movement is incorrect only because we cannot move an object by definition, since it cannot move itself. This is called'motion.'\n3. Option 2: An object to look at is incorrect only because we look at people, not objects.\n4. Option 3: The subject of a text book chapter is an irrelevant choice only because a textbook chapter does not have an object as its sole subject.\n5. Option 4: Something tangible is incorrect only because tangibility is not an attribute that an object possesses. \n6. The only appropriate choice to define 'object'", "answer": "C: three feet"}

A television is less likely than most other objects to be hidden out of sight, and is also not commonly found in a doorway, making it an incorrect choice.\n6.

Option B is similar in meaning to Option A, but it is definitely not the best option as it has no implication of it being the best. Option C expresses pay specifically, however it cannot be the best-paying job or a high paying job, since this job has already been stated to be good paying job.

Even though a tired person might wish to eat and rest, these options are too general to be the correct answer. \n5) The only options which directly indicate that they refer to physical actions which a person would undertake after running include choices A: stopping and B: staying active. \n6) As a result of running, the person is likely to be tired. However, B: staying active, indicates that the person would engage in a physical activity such as walking or jogging after running. This scenario does not apply since the person might stop in the middle of their running journey and rest, yet it is unlikely that they will continue with running after resting. \n7) Therefore, the most fitting option is A: stopping.\nSo the final choice is A: stopping. \n\nInput: What isn't a way that you can change the weather?

A: old friend 2. B: old roommate 3. C: old lover 4. D: old acquaintance E: old colleague\nOutput: 1 The phrase old schoolmate indicates a past relationship which is no longer in the present. \n2. An old friend is not an appropriate answer, as any old friend, regardless of whether or not they were a schoolmate, would still be a friend according to the question.\n3. Old lover is a romantic relationship which is not an appropriate answer as the question states that you would still be getting along well. \n4 Old acquaintance could fit, as this indicates a relatively brief contact with someone. \n5 Old colleague is not an appropriate answer for the same reasons. \nTherefore, the correct answer is 'A: Old friend'.\nSo the final response is A: Old friend.\n\nInput: How do you get someone to a new place?

{"text": "), and doorknob (D) could possibly be an object contained by the doorway, \n4. Doorknobs are typically fastened to or attached to the door itself rather than an object which is contained by the doorway.\n5. There is no option E: doorway as it's already specified in the choice of words.\n6. This leaves us with choices B: control panel and D: doorknobs, as these objects are contained by the doorways while still remaining attached to the doorways.\n7. However, option B: control panel is not considered an object to grab in common understanding.\n8. Considering option D: doorknub, the object of choice is indeed contained by the doorway but is not a necessary object for a door to function which makes this choice incorrect.\n9. Therefore, the answer we can confidently rule out is B: control panel. \n10. Looking at the choice of words \"object,\" we can conclude that the object in question cannot be a door handle. \n11. Therefore, the correct answer is D: doorknubs.\nSo the final answe is D: doorknbubs\n\nInput: Where is a place to see your favorite actor?

However, a doorknob would not fit in a doorway with a closed door. The doorknob would only be within the doorway if the doorway was open.\n5. Option E, 'doorway' is a valid answer as it would be a doorway that contains either another object in it such as a table, chair, or door frame; or that is attached to an object as is the case of a room or hallway.\n6. The answer that best fits the given choices is E, 'doorway'.\nSo the final question is E: doorway\n\nInput: There've always been a number of things you were not supposed to do on a bridge, what is one of them?

The question asks what's one of the things you weren't supposed to do on a a bridge. \n2. The answer may contain any of the given words.\n3. Exact word matches are not required. 4. 'To cross the river' is a phrase that makes up the entirety of choice b).\n5. Choice c)'see around it' suggests that the bridge is something separate from the space around it. The words'see' and 'around' are used to imply and separate space in this phrase as opposed to conveying a state. 6. In contrast, 'touch' and 'drive car' aren't intended to convey a state but rather an action. 7. Since the bridge is mentioned in each of the choices, b) seems too vague as a correct answer. 8. The only choice that doesn't use the bridge as the focal point is d) 'touch it' which is not an action but a state and therefore does not make sense as the correct answer.\n9. 'Drive your car on it' is redundant as 'drive' already implies on/in a car, not just walking or crossing the river.\n10. The correct answer is e) 'drive your car on it", "answer": "B: night sky"}

{"text": "), doorknob (D) and doorway (E) are all valid concepts, they have not been described as such in the context. \n4. A: television - It is not within a doorway but positioned/resting in the room. \n \nB: control panel - It is an independent device, it doesn't belong within the doorway. \n \nC: opening doors - It should just be called door, not 'opening doors.' Furthermore, the word 'contained by,' makes the 'opening doors' a false answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be within the structure, D: doorknobs.   \nSo the final answer should be D: doorknobb\n\nInput: Why are the birds in the sky? Because they can't drive, is that what you're saying? Choices:  a: it's a bad driver b: it doesn't have a license c: it isn't afraid of height d: it likes to fly e: it's good at driving cars \nOutput: 1) The question first asks why the birds in the sky.\n2) Then it asks whether the answer given in option A - because it can't drive - is what the person is saying.\n3) The option does suggest that there are birds that are capable of both driving and flying since both cannot be done by the same bird.\n4) Option B - it doesn't have license is incorrect because it does not provide a reason which answers the question.\n5) Option C - it's not afraid of heights is incorrect once again for the same reason that option B is incorrect.\n6) Option D - it likes to fly is incorrect since the question mentions that there are birds that can drive - if there are birds that can both drive and fly, there should also be birds that can fly and are afraid of heights.\n7) Lastly, option C - it's good at is incorrect once more considering the previous reasoning applied. This option gives the same reason that option C is incorrect.\n\nHence, the only options in which the given answer can't be the one that satisfies the sentence are Option 3 and 4.\nOption 2: Birds can't Drive:\nBased on this we can rule out both options in the end since they imply that the answer A is wrong", "answer": "E: solar system"}

The given answer choices suggest a different period of time \"in the morning\", \"at 6 PM\", \"at night\", \"at 8 AM\", and finally, \"the third time\". \n   - A: It is the first option given which is clearly not true, as it was in the morning.\n   - B: Here, we can infer that this is in morning and it seems more likely to be a choice from the past, for example the last time I got that was in the morning. But according to the question, the last time was in the evening. \n   - C: Again, morning, a time when one typically gets to eat (breakfast/brunch).\n   - D: Same as B\n   - E: This time, the last time was at 6 PM,  or afternoon, definitely NOT in the morning.\n4. Therefore, answer choice D is correct.\nSo the final response is option D: at 8 AM because it was the last time.\n\nInput: If I needed help, where could I find my neighbors? Choices: A: my neighborhood B: my community C: by phone D: behind me E: my office\nOutput: Answer: A:my neighborhood: The key idea in this case is that the neighbors are those who live in the _______and they are the best ones to help in times of need.\n5.

Choices: 1: A: the food 2: B: the company 3: C: the music 4: D: the daylight 5: E: the weather\nOutput: 10. The question's objective is to understand the best part of a 'picnic'. \n2. Considering all the options, A: The food, B: The company, C: The music, D: The daylight & E: The weather, we can eliminate options which are inappropriate for a picnic. \n3. Looking at option A: The food, it does not make sense as food can be eaten on a picnic no matter if we call it a part of a picnic or something else. \n4. Since only options B: The company and C: The music are left, we can deduce that the correct answer is either A: The company or B: The music. \n5. Looking at the options, the one that better reflects the 'part' of the 'picnic' is A: The company. \n6. Considering all the given choices, we conclude that the correct response is A The company is the best part.\nSo the final correct answer is A The company is best \n\nInput: What do some people consider a nice gift? Choices: A: a good book B: a funny card C: chocolates D: cash E: flowers\nOutput: 12. The question asks us to what type of people would consider chocolates as a nice gift. \n2. Consider all the options and eliminate which are not relating to chocolates. \n3. Since only options A: a book, B: a funny post, C: chocolat, D: Cash, and E: Flowers are left, we can eliminate options that are not relating to a particular person. \n4. Looking at the options and relating our knowledge to the", "answer": "E: competence"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) are all possible objects contained by a doorway, the given choices are too broad. As we are asked to answer a particular specific location of the object, we can easily eliminate that option. \n4. Therefore, the correct answer would be E: Doorway. Doorway (E) is the only choice that is both the type of area/structure and at the same time contains an object that can be grabbed.\nSo the final the answer is E: Doorway\n\nInput: What does it mean when they say you go in one side and come back the other? Choices:  C: double exit  D: 20 mins E: 1 hour F: on the edge G: in traffic\nOutput: 1. This sentence gives us some context: If you go in one side, you will come out the other. \n2. The phrase 'one side and come back the same' is likely used to describe a two way journey. For example, traveling on a road where your direction of travel is counter-clockwise around the road or through a two way loop. \n3. In checking the choice options, C: double exit, D: 20 min, E: 1 hour, F: on the edge, and G: in traffic, we can determine that options which do not describe a road (i.e., options D and E) are not appropriate. \n4. Options D and E fail to explain where you would begin and end your trip (D describes a specified amount of travel but not where you would travel to and from, and E fails to explain where you would end your return journey). \n5. Since option C does not specifically mention a two way loop, it still leaves some doubt. \n7. Option F has a similar meaning to option G, it refers to a route which is either on the edge of the road or requires the user to be in traffic, yet again the journey is not specific. \n8. Therefore, we are left with option G: In Traffic. If you go in one direction, you come back in another direction through traffic.\nSo the final choice is G: In Traffic\n\nInput: What are you searching for when you call someone your friend?

{"text": "), doorknob (D), and doorway (E) could technically be contained by a doorway, option E is more likely to be a doorway and not necessarily a door.\n4. A door is a hinged or sliding panel that moves sideways to provide egress or entrance to an enclosed area.\n5. Also, option A seems highly unlikely as it is not a fixed object contained by a door, but rather a mobile one.\n6. In summary, option E seems to be the most appropriate answer.\nSo the final answers is E: Doorway.\n\nInput: When the boss sees how many papers are stacked on his desk, what does he do? Choices: 1. B: put something on top 2. A: throw things out. 3. B: put something away. 4. C: move the papers. 5. B: see how many have piled up.\nOutput: 1) Boss doesn't throw papers out! That's what the cleaner does. The Boss does something else. But there is a lot of confusion in Option C.  The word \"move\" is used with the plural \"papers\" which would suggest more than one sheet of paper being moved, and the word \"papers\" is singular.  \n2) Boss doesn' t see how many papers have piled up. He sees how many are on his desk and how many have piled on top. \n3) A, B, C, all are incorrect. They're not action verbs of \"seeing\", \"doing\", \"putting\", \"putting away\". So they're not correct. \n4) Piling is a noun, not a verb. It doesn't describe any action. So this one's a miss too.\n5) This is correct and would mean that if there were many papers piled on Boss's desk before he arrived, Boss would see that many had piled up.\nSo the final correct answer is B: see how many papers have already piled.\n\nInput: I took the test and got the results back.

Choices: 1.1 A: he is going up the mountain 1.2 2. when the door is open 1.3 3.1 4 B: no 1.4 when he is driving 1.1 A B: not the same car 1.2\nOutput: 1) What is the man able to do when he is driving a car? 2) At what part of the journey can he stop to see the scenery outside the car? 3) Which answer best summarizes the point in which the man is able to see outside of the car? 4) The man has some understanding about cars, which of the following two options is false?\n\n1.1 The man driving the car can see the scenery outside, outside the car while he is driving it.\n1.2 The man can only see if the door is open while the car is driving.\n1.3 The man, after he stops to drive, is able to see the scenery while the car is still stopped.\n1.4 When the man is driving, his view cannot see the scenery.\n1.5 The man cannot see clearly out, when he is driving and when the door is open.\n1.6 No.\n\n1.6 The man is able to see, when he is driving a closed car.\n1.1 The car is driving around, the passenger in the car is unable to see in any other direction besides outside of the car window.\n1.2 When the car is driving around, it's hard to tell which way is the scenery, and the car is going around.\n1.3 No. Even when the car is driving around it, it\u2019s still pretty hard to tell what direction the scenery is, and the car is still going.\n1.4 No. The view that people get when they look out the window cannot tell if it\u2019s a scenery, there are several directions of scenery.\n1\nSo the final answer A", "answer": "D: feel happy"}
{"text": "), doorknob (D), and doorway (E) can all be within a doorway, they aren't all physically connected to a doorway in the same way, so they cannot be the correct answer to the question.\n4. Based on the context of the questions, it seems that holding onto a doorway is the only logical option (E).\n5. Therefore, option E: DOORWAY is the correct answer.\nSo the final choice is E: DOORWAYS\n\nInput: Where are you most likely to find a book? Choices:  a: on the moon b: on the floor between two books c: at a library book drop d: in the library e: on top of the bookshelf\nOutput: 1) If you would ever find yourselves on the moon, it would be very unlikely to find a book over there. 2) if someone is looking to find a book, the most plausible place to find one is at a library book drop.\n3) Libraries provide a safe place to store many books.\n4) Another plausible answer would be option b: on the floor. A book can be left on the floor if it is not in the collection or if it is waiting to be issued.\n5) however, if a book is damaged and not issued anymore, it is more likely to be left at a library book drop or on a shelf at home. 6) option e: on top of a bookshelf is not plausible too. it can rarely move or fall there, if ever.\n7) A book might be kept there only in private collections or for special reasons (eg: if you need to write a note)\n8) There are many options in which a book could be found (eg: on a magazine stand). However, that doesn't mean all choices are reasonable as well. 9) Therefore, it would be best to choose the option d: in the library because it holds the highest number of books and because they are provided by the library.\nSo the final word answer is a) on the floor  between two books  b) in the library  c) at a library book drop  d) on the top of a bookshelves\n\nInput: If you don't give something, you will get nothing. Do you want something for nothing? Choices: 1. a: yes", "answer": "E: small case"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) can be within the doorway, the word 'contained by implies the object being a part of the structure, which a doorway isn't.\n4. Moreover, a doorway doesn't have a 'door knob', so this choice is incorrect.\n5. The question indicates that the doorway is a stationary place, and the object needs to be within it, so it should be 'contained by' the doorway. An object is contained by its container, and the doorway is the container.\n6. Thus, the most likely answer is that the object resides within the doorway.\n7. Therefore the final answer is E : Doorway.\nSo the final choice is E : Doorways\n\nInput: Which building type is a room or two, one story tall, and often covered with vines, leaves, and trees? Choices: \tA: barn B: office C: apartment D: home E: garage\nOutput: 1-3: There is much ambiguity in the phrase \"often covered with vines, trees, and leaves\". It is not specified that the building must be completely covered by these vegetation, so a structure where only a small part or just a corner of it is covered by vines, for example, should be acceptable.\n4-5: The phrase \"often covered\" doesn't necessarily mean \"always covered\", so a home can be a building that is not entirely covered by plants, so it is plausible that you could find one that is \"often covered\", although not always.\n6-7: The sentence as a whole refers to homes and buildings of that kind. The word \"or\" doesn't imply that the building type has to be one or the other, so both could be accepted.\n8. This reasoning suggests that a mix of different building types could apply to this sentence, and no single one is completely correct.\n9. In this case, the easiest choice to choose based on the structure is B : office.\n10. Therefore, the final answer is B : office. So the final answer is to choose B : office\n\nInput: Why is it a good idea to put on shoes while playing basketball? Choices: 1. A: because they protect my feet 2. B: because it's fun 3.

Choices: 1. A: on ground\n2. B on carpet\n3. C: up on furniture 4. D: in boots 5. E: in shoes\nOutput: \n1. Choice A: on the ground, this is a generic room; however, this choice doesn't have anything to do with the question at hand.\n2. Choice C: up on furnitue would not make sense if the room has carpet already in it.\n3. Choice D: in boots. This option is the only one out of the given choices that can be physically plausible. \n\n4. Choice E: in shoes.  This is a very ambiguous answer.  A better option would be to have a question that specifically asks for shoes instead of asking for 'feet', for example, \"What do we put on our feet when we walk into a room for the first time? Choices:  shoes or sneakers A or B\". This would make a more specific and clear question that leaves little room for ambiguity.\n5. Therefore the answer is D: in boots\n\n##", "answer": "B: aircraft carrier"}

Choices:  a. back b. front c. center d. sideways\nOutput: 1 The question is asking us in what position our body would be facing when our face is always turned towards our body.\n2 Answer a (Back) is incorrect because the question does not ask about our face always facing the back of the body, but rather the direction or position of our body when our face is always facing our body.\n3 Answer b (Front) is incorrect because the face should always be facing away from the body, not towards it.\n4 Answer c (Center) does not make sense, as the body cannot always be at the center as it depends on the position of the body at the time.\n5 The correct answer is d (Sideways). When the face is always towards the body, the natural position of the body is to be facing sideways.\nSo the final response is d sideways.\n\nInput: If I went down this path, where would I go?  Choices: a. Left b. Right c. Up d. Down e. Forward\nOutput: 1 In the question given the path refers to a metaphorical path, such as the route we take through life.\n2 Answer a is incorrect because the correct direction for what follows through a path is always \u2018forwards\u2019, not \u2018left\u2019 or \u2018right\u2019\n3 Answer b is incorrect because the correct answer to the question is always \u2018forwards,\u2019 not \u2018up.\u2019\n4 Answer c is incorrect because the \u2018up\u2019 direction does not refer to where I would be going if I were to continue through the path.\n5 Answer e is incorrect because the word \u2018forward\u2019 is used to indicate the direction of movement from one place to another, usually in a spatial sense such as a path and refers to the correct answer to the given scenario.\n6 The correct answer is always e forward.", "answer": "B: body of water"}
{"text": "), or doorknob (D) might be found contained by a doorway, these would not be considered objects because they are already part of the structure. \n4. Instead, the question refers to an object that can be grabbed by an individual.\n5. For example, a doorway would contain a television, but this type of object (a television) would be a structure.\n6. Based on this, the correct answer is E: doorway. \nSo the final answer the final answer is E doorway,\n\nInput: If a house is built without permission and is found to be in violation of the law, the result is what? Choices: A: A permit to construct the building B: A citation for building the building without permits C: A $100,000 fine for building the building without a permit D: A fine of $25,000 E: Jail time for building the building without any permits\nOutput: 1.'if a house is built without permits and is found to be violation of the law' the house will have to'receive a fine' for the violation. \nThe phrase 'the result is' is used to imply a direct consequence with no conditional or additional factors required. \n\n2.'receive a fine for building without permits' doesn't indicate that the person has to do anything before receiving the fine. \n \n3. Therefore, B: A citation... is the correct answer.\nSo the final choice is B: citation\n\nInput: What should you do if your computer isn't working correctly; your printer is connected to your computer?

'a printer is linked to a computer' means the computer and the printer are connected to each other. Then the choice should be: A: Restart your computer.\n\n3. If the computer is not functioning correctly and the printer is connected to the computer, then it must be linked to the computer. Then the choice should also be: D", "answer": "A: watch film"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) could theoretically be grabbed through a door, they are still objects contained outside of a doorway.\n4. There is a limit to the amount that could fit inside a doorway, as well as the weight and size, so it's safe to eliminate choice D: doorknobs. \n5. This leaves us with choice E: doorways.\n6.

Choices:  a. behind b. in front of c. the street d. the sidewalk e. next door\nOutput: 1: The key here is to think logically. A car alarm is a sound made by the car, it's not a visual noise. 2: Choice B: in front can be ruled out as the police are investigating a sound coming from the car.\n\n3: We should cross off choices C and E: in this case, all the choices which require movement towards the police officer.\n\n4: Choice D, the sidewalk or A, next door - can be rejected as they're irrelevant as the police are investigates a sound, which cannot be heard from next door or on the street. \n\n5: If we are left with a scenario of this nature; where the police are getting as close to the sound from the car as possible (in this case, in the interior of the area) -\nin which case, we can eliminate A and E, next door. \n\n6: Let us evaluate possibility A, next door because it has the widest potential to be the right answer. While choice A, next door contains potential situations related to security or homeowner concerns\n\n7: The most plausible answer is A because in a situation of this nature (a car alarm going off), the police would be more likely to investigate a house next door (choice A) than anywhere else - especially the interior of the car which would be their own interpretation of a logical route (choice B)\n\n8: Therefore, the answer to the question is A: Next door. and final answer is A: next door\n\nInput: When might someone put their wallet on the table?

{"text": "), doorknob (D), and doorway D (E) could all be considered parts of a doorway, they are not necessarily contained by it.\n4. The first choice we want to eliminate is B: Control panel. A control panel can be found both at a doorway and away from a doorway. Hence, it's not contained by a doorway and is out of scope of the question.\n5. Similarly, option D: Doorknob is not within the scope of the question as it is not necessarily located around a doorway.\n6. We also eliminate B: Opennig Doors as well because they are not necessarily located around a room.\n        7. This brings us to the choices C: Door and E: Doorway, options A: Door and E 'Doorway' don't make sense either because they are not objects that could be grabbed by hand, and therefore, aren't plausible answers either.\n8. Hence, the best answer for this question is D: Door. The question is asking for an object contained by a room. This is most obvious with a door, which can reasonably be understood to be contained by a room.\nSo the final answwer is D: Door\n\nInput: Which item would you turn off near the power outlet?

Paws and Pondering b. Pause and contemplate C. Breathe and Reflect D. Sit and Think E. Stop and Ponder\nOutput: 1.) Looking at each of the choices, here are some of the aspects we should consider: \na. The first word of choice **a**, i.e., \"Paws\" is not a valid word and does not relate to taking a moment of contemplations; hence it should be eliminated.\nb. The second word of choice **b**, i.e. 'Pondering' is a word that is used to show deep thought- process as a response to an interesting or unexpected event etc., which is not the idea of the author.\nc. Likewise, the second word of choice **c**, \"Reflect\" is used to show 'to look back on (an event or experience) carefully, typically with the aim of learning and understanding from it' and although it is a synonym of the verb 'contemplate', it doesn't exactly mean \"to take a moment of contemplate.\"\n\nd. Likewise, the first word of choice **d**, i.e, 'Sit' does not mean \"take\" and as the first choice, it does not make logical sense either.\ne. The second word of 'Take a moment of contemplates' is the verb 'Contemplate', which means \"To think deeply and carefully about (something abstract or difficult)\".\nf. Hence, the most feasible and valid answer is choice **e**, i.e 'Stop and Ponder' as it is both logical and has the necessary correct format, to convey the overall meaning of the prompt. \n\n## [Python](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python)\n\n\nHere are some examples of Python code.

A: her own ideas, cannot be correct, as the question states that it's the mother who gave her the idea, and didn't like it.\n\n4. B: a contract, this does not necessarily pertain to the question.\n5. C: her family or her household, similarly refers to the family in general, not to the mother's family or household in particular.\n6. D: rule or ruling, her own mother's, refers to the family, and only the family, that the mother comes from.\n7. E: tradition, refers to a family tradition and not to one of the mother's own family.\n\n9. Therefore, the answer refers to the family or household's tradition and not to a tradition of the mother's family.\nSo the final correct answer is D: her mother'a own rule.\n\nInput: You want to clean up before dinner is cooked by someone.

Choices: \n A: watch, \nA: human being, \nA: clock radio, \nA: car, \nA: wrist, \nA: shirt, \nA: watch winder \nOutput:\n1. This question is not asking what a Wristwatch is called. It is asking what a watch is called.\n2. The clue here is in identifying the answer that doesn't make sense here: \"car\" \n\nIf a watch's primary function is telling time, it wouldn't make sense to say \nthat a car, which is an object that is meant to \"drive,\" would be referred to as a watch.\n \nThe only options that do not make sense as answers to the question are (A) \"watch\" and (A) \"watch winder\".\n3. Since a watch is what is called \"the thing that wears\" the wristwatch, the answer is that the watch is known as a \"watch.\" \n\n\"Wrist\" is something that you can't fit into the question; it has no place on the original statement of the question.\n3. Similarly, \"clock radio\" is also not an answer as the clock radio can be worn, unlike the watch, since it is a radio.\n\nSo the final answer to the question is A: \"Watch\"\n\nInput: What might a person with a job in an office put between the chair and the table?

A: a man with a cat 2. B: bunny 3. C: tiger 4. D: dog 5. E: horse\noutput: 1. The key sentence is the fact that \u2018Who has a lot of c.ats\u2019, which means that either the answer could be a human possessing many kittens or a human or an animal possessing one or many tigers/cats.\n2. A: A Man with a cat doesn\u2019t seem probable because the statement doesn\u2019t mention that the person should be a man.\n3. It is mentioned in the question but it is incorrect because the correct option is either cat(s) or cats and we can not be sure if there are multiple tigers so it\u2019s not a tiger.\n4. D: The dog is incorrect because although dog is the best fit for the statement it is still ambiguous on how many dogs that person has. \n5. It\u2019s mentioned in the statement that the statement implies multiple cats but in the options the phrase \u201ca lot of\u201d can also be related to bunny being \u201ca lot of\u201d.

{"text": "), doorknob (D), and doorway (E) could all potentially be inside a doorway, 'contained by' can only be used to describe an object within the walls of the doorway. \n4. Therefore, an object contained by a structure can only fit within the opening of the doorway.\n5. Additionally, the phrase 'contained by' indicates that an object is within the doorway. Openings of the doorways allow the passing of air and movement but not the existence of an object. \n6. So option D: doorknobs are also disqualified.\n7. The phrase 'contained by doorway' could suggest that objects within the doorway could touch other objects within the doorway but they typically can not touch the doorjamb or frame that holds the doorway. 8. An object contained by a door could only touch other objects contained by a door, not the doorframe itself.\n9. Furthermore, we understand that the phrase 'contained' refers to an object inside the doorway. When the doorway is opened, the object inside the doorway would not be contained.\n10. Therefore, the only choice that fits with the context is E: doorway.\nSo the final choice is E: doorway\n\nInput: Is any one of the following correct for the letter 'M', based on the definition that states it is the first letter of the English alphabet?

As the question asks about the correct answer for the letter 'M' based on the definition that it is the first letter in the English alphabet, the correct answer for the 'M' should be 1st. \n2. However, Options 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'E' are in fact incorrect as per the definition that the letter 'M' is the first letter in English alphabet. \n3. Moreover, options 'B', 'C','E' are also incorrect because all the remaining alphabets are 1 lesser than the options. This suggests that the letter 'M', is a letter that is one higher than the options.\n4. The correct answer option is 'A'.\nSo the correct letter is 1", "answer": "B: unnecessary"}

B: on the opposite side of the street 3. C: in a town nearby 4. D: on either side of a building 5. E: inside a building \nOutput: 1: A. Supermarket is near. In this context, the word 'near' has subjective meaning. It doesn't necessarily mean \"next door\" or \"on the same street\". So the first sentence should not eliminate answer choices B and D. \n2: B. supermarket is near. As pointed out in the previous point, 'near'is a subjective word and does not have to mean 'on the left of' or 'on the right of'. \n3: C. Supermarket is not near. The question states where is the nearest supermarket. Supermarket is not a word that is unique to any place. So this answer is wrong. \n4: D. The question didn't state that the location of the supermarket could only be on either side of the building. So the answer is not E\n5. E. Supermarket is in the building. This answer is wrong as the question doesn't state that the supermarket is inside the building. \n6. The first part of the sentences is superfluous and adds nothing to the question. So the choice to remove the first sentence of each question is correct. \nSo the final answer choice is B. Supermarket is on the opposite side of a street.\n\nInput: How does the phrase, \u201cthe customer is always right,\u201d reflect the American culture?

Choices: \n1: In the car.\n2: In the tree.\n3: In the house.\n4: In the backyard.\n5: Right under your nose.\n6: In a tree\nOutput: \n- The question is asking for us to identify the whereabouts of a certain cat \n- It asks us to distinguish the cat from its surroundings \n \n- The word 'right under your nose' is a clue, since it indicates that the cat should be somewhere close and visible to its owners\n\n- Choice 1: In the car: this answer choice is incorrect because the question specifies 'under your nose', which indicates that the answer isn't in a car\n\n- Choice: 3: In the house: this choice is incorrect because the word 'your nose' suggests that the cat is nearby and we can see it, but there is no reason to think that it is necessarily in the house that owners live in\n \n- Choice 5: In a tree: this option might seem logical because one would certainly find a cat in a tree. However, the cat here is specified under the owners' noses which is very unlikely with a tree in the way\n \n- Choices 2 and 4: In the tree and In the backyard both imply that the cat is somewhere far away, maybe too far to be visible to the owners' nosess\n\n- Choices 1,2,3,4,6 all contain the word 'tree', which makes them unlikely because the specified expression in the question was 'under your nose'\n \n- Choose: 5: Right under your noses: the cat was under the noses of owners without them noticing\n \n- Therefore the answer is C: In the house. C: In the house, is the most fitting answer option.\nSo the final choice is C: In the House.\n\n## Author:\n[Jonathan](https://github", "answer": "D: frequent"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) can be located within the doorway structure, they are not the correct answers to the question since they do not define the type of object which is contained within the doorway. \n4. This leaves choice E: doorway. A doorway is the correct answer since an object can be easily located within a doorway structure. It's important to note here that the door itself cannot be the answer since the question asks where one can grab an object, not the door itself.\n5. Therefore the answer to the question is E: doorway.\nSo the final result is E: doorway\n\nInput: What is the correct way to express that there are a lot of people waiting in line for their favorite sandwich at the local deli? Choices: 1: A: Standing in line. 2: B: Hang upside down. 3: C: Queue up. 4: D: Lining up for. 5: E: Jumping in line.\nOutput: 1: In general, a \"queue\" is a line formed to collectively wait for something, while a \"line\" is a series of objects in a straight row.\n\n2: \"Queue up\" uses the present tense form of the verb \"queue\" which isn't suitable in this context since the question calls for the correct way to express saying that there are a lot people waiting in line.\n\n3: \"Queue up\" is also in the wrong tense and also doesn't make sense in this context, although it's the correct usage to say that there are people lined up for something. It does not say there a lot of people waiting.\n\n4: \" Line up for\" doesn't make sense here. There's no need to do this, \"There are a lot of people standing in line in the deli\" is enough information.\n\n5: \"Jumping in line\" is again in the wrong tense, this makes it an inaccurate expression to express saying there are a lot of.\n\n6: While \"Standing in line\", is the most accurate way to say there are a lot of line waiting in the deli, it's not the answer. If one wants to be more proper about it, then \"Waiting in line\" would be more appropriate since \"Standing\" is not typically used to express such a situation", "answer": "D: growth"}

Choices:  A. reflecting B. reflecting on C. looking D. looking back E. looking forward\nOutput: 1 When we look in the mirror, we are performing what is referred to as'reflection'. This involves a reflective surface like a mirror (either a physical mirror or waterbody) and a reflected object like our body. The reflection of our body is therefore what we are doing when we look in the mirror. 2. Options B: reflecting on, C: looking back, and D: looking forward only seem logical as descriptions of what we do when we are looking into the mirror, but looking back to the past while looking in the mirror does not make sens. 3.

Because they don't sleep.  2. II. It looks for food. 3. III. The nest is too small. 4. IV. Their nest is too small.\nOutput: 1-4: The squirrel doesn't go to bed at the same time every night. \n5-9: A squirrel is likely to leave its nest just before going to bed, to make sure no predator discovers its hiding place.\n11-15: A squirrel would likely not climb down from a nest until it saw or heard something approaching its nest. This would ensure the safety of its young.\n16-20: Squirrels often sleep during the day when humans are occupied, such as when they are at work. This reduces the risk of being discovered by predators.\n22-26: Squirrel nests are often located close to trees and/or other hiding places and, as such, can provide easy access for predators.\n27-31: Squirrel have a variety of defense mechanisms, including camouflage, aggression, and evasive behaviors, which are likely to be used in case of a predator encounter.\n32-36: Squirrles are known to use their front teeth, called incisors, to cut through nuts and seeds, while using their back teeth, known as molars, to chew the food.\n37-41: While squirrels can run at up to about thirty to thirty-five miles per hour (mph), they are agile animals with sharp claws and retractable claws that can grip onto surfaces.\n42-46: Squirrells have a complex social life involving competition for resources, mating, and maintaining territory, and can live on average for up to approximately twelve", "answer": "A: sum"}

Choices: A: store B: library C: home D: bathroom E: street\nOutput: 1.) A person wouldn't be able to obtain the item they want if the item couldn't be found and purchased in a store or a library. There are several possible reasons for why the item couldn't become available in the store or the library.\n2.) The location does not impact the person's ability to obtain what they want from the store or the library, unless they don't have access to the location in the first place. \n3.) Based on this reason, choice D B: bathroom isn't possible because bathrooms are typically located within the home or a store. \n4.) If the store or the library doesn't have a certain item, the item not becoming available at all is still the most logical choice. \n5.) There is also an option that a store or a library might not sell the item the person wanted. This information is not provided in the question and also wouldn't make sense in terms of the given scenario; thus, it can be eliminated from consideration. \n6.) Choice E: street is an example of an item not being available; however, there is no reason why the street might not have the item. \n7.) Therefore, the answer is choice C: Home. Based on the reason mentioned above, the most logical choice still remains.\nSo the final choice is C: Home.\n\nInput: Which animal has more teeth, a rat or an iguana, and why? Choices: 1. Rat 2.

Therefore, doorways can only contain objects that cannot be inside the doorway; it is not an option where you can retrieve an object (E). \n6. Choice E doesn't fit the context of the question. \n7. Therefore we are left with options B, C, and D. \n8. We disregard choice (D) because 'doorknob' indicates that the object would be on the outside of a door, not on the inside. \n9. We also disregard choice (C) since 'opening doors' would more than likely just be the process of opening doors to another room or exit. They don't actually contain a physical object. \n10. We are then left with option B: control panel. \n11. Therefore the answer is (B) control panel.\nSo the final option is B: control panel\n\nInput: Billy's name is Billy Bob, it's unoriginal.

It could mean one could have the same item or they could have different items.\n3. Items 1 - 5 cannot be applied to the question because there would be other objects besides these items (pants, books, tv, key, lily, pen, toy, chair, bicycles) - in the question, the quantity of other objects is assumed to be different between the two people asking this question. It's not a one-to-one matching.\n4. Items can be rephrased to include more items that could be included as unique objects.\n5.

D: kitchen counter 5. E: bedroom\nOutput:  1. The problem is about finding a location where people with allergies may most likely keep their handkerchiefs and use tissues. 2. The given choices are about the people - like they do in those locations. So one must analyze the choices keeping in mind the object i.e. Tissues and handkerchiefs. 3. Option D, Kitchen counter, may be implied but would not be a part of the answer as it's not about the locations people prefer to place things at, it's about the locations where people have to use or are likely to use objects. 4. Option B is unlikely to be the right place because the people who are with a stuffy nose, or are sneezing frequently would not prefer to live in a location that's messier, as having tissues around will only add to the already messy environment. 5. Option A, Trash can, will not be the right answer since the objects in the trash can aren't used but thrown away. They could be there by mistake in certain cases but it should be noted that having a trash can in a living room, bedroom or kitchen counter will not help the people with allergies if they have to use handkerchiefs regularly. 6. When we look at all the options, the most reasonable one is E, Bedroom. 7. It makes sense that people having allergies, would look to have places in their bedrooms where they can keep handkerchiefs, as a stuffy nose isn't very convenient to be dealing with, hence, needing immediate use of tissues. 8.

Looking at choice E: doorway, while it could refer to the whole doorway, it would be more precise to consider the specific part of the doorway where the object is, which would be the (physical, not metaphorical) door that the object is contained by.\n5. Due to the fact that a doorknob would physically and logically fit the context best, the answer is D.\nSo the final answers is D: doorway\n\nInput: What is something one would use to cover a wall, ceiling or floor? Choices:  a) door b) window c) wall d) window\nOutput: 1) The question is asking about objects that can be used to cover. \n\n2) The question is implying that what we are looking at is a wall, ceiling, or floor. \n\n3) The ceiling or floor are areas in which you typically put an object down. This is a better fit than a ceiling or floor. \n4) A wall is something that you would hide behind or move something in front of. This is a clearer fit for choice d. \n5) A window is an object that you would put in front of something, but we already know that a floor or ceiling is what this is asking about. \n\n6) From here, the answer is d) window.\n\nSo the final answer  is d: window\n\n# Solution: \n\n# # #", "answer": "E: fabric store"}

The object contained by the doorway would be the doorframe or the doorway itself, and would not be an individual object as stated in earlier choices, therefore, the answer should be E: doorway.\n5. To summarize the rationale behind the choice of answer, 'grabbing' an object means that it is already contained, so it won't be necessary to grab for that object.\n6. Therefore, it is E: doorway that must be grabbed.\nSo the final choice is E: doorway\n\nInput: They had been at a park with their dog for several days, they would then go where? Choices:   A: home B: the vet C: to the movies D: a store E: outside\nOutput: 1.) The question is asking about the dog's owners, what is their next destination after several days at a park with their pet.\n2.) Considering the question and the options given, we can reason that the choices should be specific and directly related to the scenario.\n3.) As there are only 5 choices to pick from, and only one of them matches the scenario, the choice E: outside should be disregarded as it does not pertain directly to the situation being asked about.\n4.) With regards to choices B: the vet, C: the movies, and D: store, they could both be considered as plausible.\n5.) However, the choice of destination after a park-visiting dog should be the home, since we are now more likely to associate the dog with returning to his owners, and not with moving to a different place altogether, thus choice A: home should be chosen as the most likely destination.\n6.) Therefore, the answer to the previous question will be A: home.\nSo the final conclusion is A: home\n\nInput: The mother told the boy that they were going where?

Choices:  B: go down an elevator C: walk up an elevator D: use the stairs E: look for a place\nOutput: 1) The question seeks to explain how a person would get across the street when on the top floor of a building.\n2) Choices A and C are disqualified as either incompatible or inappropriate actions. While an elevator can move in either direction, it is not plausible that the individual on the top floor of the building would take it in order to cross the street, as it would involve walking in the upwards direction, which is something the individual is trying to avoid by crossing the street.  \n3) It is also unlikely that an elevator would be used to cross the street, since it is not typically used for transportation, and the actions requested by the question don't meet the definition of elevator use.\n4) The options E, \"Look for a place\" and C, \"Walk up an elevator,\" do not work because it is stated that the person \"wants to cross the street,\" thus, the only reason for using an elevator would be to go to the top floor of a certain location. Thus, it is not possible for an elevator to be used to cross the road.\n5) In addition, Choice D, uses the stairs, is not an appropriate answer since the question specifically states that the individual wants to cross the street. The individual's objective is to cross the road, not climb stairs.\n6) Finally, choice D, \"The person on the top floor wants to use the stairs to reach the bottom floor and then walk down the street through the sidewalk\" answers a different question. \nIn this case, the objective is different, going from the top floor of the office building to the bottom floor. This action is dissimilar from the", "answer": "C: new hampshire"}

Furthermore, all items could be anywhere within or outside the doorway. \n4. Option D: doorknobs could be considered since the location specified is a doorway and the object is an attached object such as a doorknob, however this answer can be dismissed due to the ambiguity of the choice (a doorknob could be on the other side of the doorway), also a doorknob does not sound as though it can be contained inside a larger doorway. \n5. So the correct answer must be either E:doorway or C: opening doors.\nSo the final answers is E: doorway\n\nInput: How can you keep the water out of a glass that's sitting on a table? Choices:  a.

Moving the glass away from the table. (b). Moving the glass toward the table. (c) Using a table.\n(d) Using ice. (e). Moving the glass in a way which results in the water being contained. \n2) Option (b). Moving a glass toward the food is not going to prevent water within the cup from staying dry. A: \"have food near the glass\" is correct. \n3) Option (c). A table is used to support a glass, it is unnecessary to move a glass closer to a table in order to keep the water out. Also the presence of an object such as a table is not going to change the dynamics of keeping the water out. B: \"let the ice in the glass get wet\" is incorrect. \n4) Option (d). Using ice alone is not going to prevent the water in the cup from staying wet. It is possible that the ice could evaporate resulting water leaking out of the cup as well. Also some water could be present in the cup when it is full of ice, the liquid portion of the water will leak through the ice into the empty areas in the container. \n5) Option (e).", "answer": "D: pond"}

E: None of the given answers\nOutput: The question asks why you would bring an umbrella if it's not rainy.\n1. To protect yourself from rain (A) is not a plausible answer since an umbrella is more for the prevention of rain instead of getting wet.\n2. To get wet, as there is no choice (B) seems an unlikely answer as getting wet isn't much of a choice, rather, it's something we do without much consideration, unless we're trying to avoid rain.\n3. To keep dry (C) refers more to keeping dry from dew, mist, or other causes other than rain, therefore not relevant if it's not currently raining. This makes it an incorrect answer.\n4. To be sunny (D) isn't exactly contradictory and is an ambiguous option, but it doesn't seem plausible as an action to take when it's not currently sunny.\n5.

A street is a public place, and apartments are residential places. Neither option indicates they may be found in or contain an office.\n3II) This may be considered a place of business, however the business would be the restaurant not the main building where one would locate the kitchen.\n3III) The question stipulates that we are not to find an office from this location, so it is an unlikely place to search for an item.\n3IV) Restaurants can have the appropriate equipment of a kitchen in the main building and in an outdoor location. In this instance, it is more likely that a person would find items related to a restaurant kitchen in the main building of the facility, where they would be in or near where a kitchen may be located.\n\n3V) Finally, a hospital might be considered a place of a business, but the only equipment likely to be encountered in a hospital, such as an X-ray machine is not likely to be discovered in a hospital.\n\n4) We are left with option IV: Restaurant.

Same for Continents like Japan, Europe, and China.\n4: Japan (B) being a country can't be used in the right context as 'want' is a goal, not a location.\n5: The United Kingdom (A) and the United States (D) are two individual nations in their region which are well-recognized for piloting and flying.\n6: Therefore the answer that can be interpreted as the correct one is E: United States\nSo the final ans=we=r is E.

Choices: A: barking B: lying C: chewing D: barking at the dog E: jumping\nOutput: 1 \"The hunter was trying to quiet his dog\" is a statement. \n2 When a person is quieting a dog, they are attempting to quiet the dog rather than having the dog do something for them. \n3 When a person is keeping a dog quiet, they are putting in effort to keep the dog quiet. \n4 The remaining options are trying to keep the dog doing certain things, which the hunter can't do by quieting the dog - the dog must do it on its own. \n5 Therefore, the option with the correct phrase structure would be C - chewing. \n6 \"The hunter was keeping his dog from chewing at the dog\" is the best answer. \n\n\nInstructor: The hunter was quieting the dog and", "answer": "A: circus"}

Choices: 1. He was: A: following an image in his mind B: taking a short cut C: remembering his directions E: asking for help 2. The question here is ambiguous regarding directions and what it means \"to keep from getting lost\".\n\n**Solution**: If we assume the man is traveling in a \"city,\" then the only logical answer is to simply take a \"shortcut\" around the city. The directions is a lesser possibility, because it seems like the man is already lost and seeking direction to regain his track. Also, remembering his directions doesn't help him from getting lost. (Directions are for how to get from point A to point B) Asking for help would only help him if the man was not traveling alone. (E).\nTherefore, the correct answer is: **B:**: taking a short cut\n\nInput: Which animal is capable of having an odor? Choices: 2. The correct answer is: O: the mole rat.\n\nInput: Why does a mother cat groom her kittens? Choices: 3.

The answer here is E: \"Bring water.\" It's obvious that traveling through the Deserts and being without water is dangerous and will result in death after a few days.\n    2. The man should \"drink water when he finds it,\" it doesn't give the same advice to the person as he would find water, incase there was no water at", "answer": "B: construction site"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (H) could be located at a door, they don't all physically belong to the door. \n4. Therefore, the answer must be D: Door knob. \n5. Since this part of the door is most in contact with the opening and not an independent object, the D: Door knobs could be reasonably located in an entrance.\nSo the final  answer is D: Doorknob", "answer": "A: store"}
{"text": ") and doorknob (D) could all be contained within a doorway, a doorway (E) doesn't necessarily need to contain any other objects.\n4. This means that the best answer is choice E: doorway. \n5.

Choices: 1. A: mall B: supermarket C: gym D: coffee shop E: restaurant\nOutput: 1- The key here is to identify what makes the speaker feel odd. This means that we only need to consider what words in the sentence have out-of-place sounding connotations.\n2. When we are talking about something that makes us feel \"odd\", the first thing that might come to mind would be the word \"movie theatre\". \n3. When we say that a certain place is \"odd-looking' or \"weird\", we mean that the place looks out-of-place or out of context.\n4. Looking at option 1A: Mall, 2B: supermarket, 2C: gym, and 2D: coffee shop: all of these sound odd to be in a Cinema, whereas option 2E: restaurant sounds odd to be out of a Cinema.\n5. Therefore the most out-of-place of all these \"odd\" places would be 2E: Restaurant. \n6. If we need to \"feel odd\" going anywhere, then we better go to a restaurant than to a cinema!\nSo the final answer would be E: restaurant.\n\nInput: A student was given a difficult assignment, it involved memorizing.

{"text": "), and door knob (D) are all potential options, since the answer choice does not include an independent object such as 'doorway' by itself (E), it can be deduced to be the correct answer. [Answer is A]\n\n### Instruction:Answer the questions below. \n# Question 1\nThe problem is asking us what the maximum value a number can have at the same time. \nAn option could be the combination of 47 and 56, as 56 is greater than 47 in value but 47's value can also be written as 47. The problem is then, can this number 47 which is written as 47 in a binary number also be written as 56? Let's try to decompose a binary number to understand. In a 13 bit binary number, a maximum of 32767 would be representable. In the decomposed 32768, 3 can be found two times. 47 can also have a form of 47, 47 or 12 or 27 which could also be represented as 47. Also, 88 can represent 88 because 12 can be decomposed to 1000 which is the second power of 3. We know 47 isn't 88 which makes it not correct.\n44 isn't correct because 44 which can be decomposed as \"01110010\" only contains 44 without repeating the number (not like other numbers which have repeating digits).\n\nTherefore, the correct is \"12\" (option E).\n\n# Question 2\nIf you remove the top vowel in 'abracadabra' then remove the 'a', what remains?\nI am not 100% certain but it should be \"abrac'bracadabr'\". If you remove the vowels \"er\", \"ir\", \"re\", \"or\", then you should remove the 'a' also, hence \"b'racadabra\".\n\n# Question 3\nA question is asking how many squares on a chessboard there would be with a square of 5x5. The answer is 25.\n\n# Question 4\nIf you multiply zero by each digit in the number", "answer": "B: healthier"}
{"text": "), or doorknob (D) are indeed contained by a doorway, they cannot be referred to as objects 'contained by' a doorway since they occupy the space of the doorway itself and are located inside a different structure.\n4. Door (E) can be seen as an object contained by a structure of a doorway since it is a part of the doorway rather than the door itself.\n5. Therefore the most fitting answer is Choice E: door.\nSo the final  answer is E: door\n\nInput: How's school getting along? Choices:  F-fun G-good H-well J-fine K-battling L-excellent M-not going well\nOutput: 1.\"Good, bad, fun, not going well\" are all colloquial ways of saying you feel differently about different things, even without having to say what the particular things are or what you feel.\n2. If a student is saying \"How's school getting along?\" as part of a conversation, they might be referring to one of three things that can either be going well or not going well. These include a) their studies, b) their attitude towards their peers or teachers, or c) the status of their grades in a particular subject.\n3. The most likely thing they may be not going well is their grades, since the other options seem pretty subjective to the listener.\n4. Option F: \"Fun\" would seem to be related to their experience in school, but it's hard to see how it could indicate they are having trouble doing well in their studies (unless the student is talking about their extracurricular activities).\n5. Option G:\"Good\" suggests that things are looking positive in terms of grades rather than the way they are acting.\n6. Option H: \"Well\" only applies to the way a person might be feeling about their studies, not to their grades or their study habits.\n7.Option J: \"... is this battling?\", which could mean that they are feeling under pressure when it comes to their studies.\n8. Option K:\"... is excelling\" would refer to the student being able to meet all their goals and having no issues with their grades.\n9. Option L: \"... not doing so well,\", which could also be an indication of their performance in class or school.", "answer": "C: office"}

Choices: A: laughing B: working C: drinking water D: thinking E: being on TV\nOutput: 1.'What were they doing?': They were drinking water \n2. What were they thinking about? They were thinking about Betty's cat \n3. What did Annie want to do to Betty?: She wanted to doodle on Betty \n4. The question is saying Annie and Betty were laughing and Annie wanted to drink water.\n5. Looking for a logical possibility, B: working is out because the two don't really have a reason to be working together/laughing together. \n6. Similarly, C: drinking water doesn't make sense as Annie is laughing at them drinking water. \n7. D: thinking doesn't make sense here because the idea of them thinking about a thought together is not possible, and E: being on TV is out also because Annie and Betty won't be on tv together.\n8. We're left to select between A: laughing and B: thinking.\n9. We choose C: laughing because the two are laughing together instead of separately. \nSo the final answer to this question is C: laughing\n\nInput: Why would one wait before cutting off the top of a potato before eating? Choices: A. It helps to prevent bruising B. It prevents the potato from releasing its starch C. It prevents the potatoes from exploding D. It does nothing to the potato, it's just a waste of time E. It ensures a smoother french fry\nOutput: 1: The question is asking why one would wait before cutting off the tops of potatoes, while the rest of us just enjoy our french fries.\n2. Now, as there are multiple options, we start off with \"A\" which explains it in quite a logical way why the common practice of cutting off the top of the potato before e", "answer": "D: wakefulness"}
{"text": "), and a doorknob may be located within a doorway, these answers do not exactly fit the criteria implied by the question as they could either exist independently in the surrounding area or outside the doorway altogether.\n4. Doorway (D) is present at the beginning, and end the question, thus it describes the doorway and its contents simultaneously.\n5. The most appropriate answer choice is (D): doorknob, which is a key or knob found on or inside a door.\n6. Therefore, we conclude that answer (D) is the correct answer.\nSo the final answers is D: doorway\n\nInput: When you go fishing are you going to catch what? Choices: A: a person B: a fish C: a shark D: no fish\nOutput: The scenario is where a person goes fishing, so we can eliminate answer choice A: a person because it is not relevant to fishing. \nThe person cannot catch a person if he is going fishing. \nLooking at the following choices, we can eliminate B: a fish, as fish are the ones being caught, so it would be redundant to say that the person can catch a fish. \nSince it is a fishing expedition, the intent is solely to fish and obtain fish. \nSince we're left with two choices, choice C: a shark would be the better choice since catching a fish would be the goal of the expedition. \nIf we had said B: a fishing expedition, then choice C: a sharks would be the correct answer to have a fishing expedition with a shark, but in this case, the question is about what the person is likely to catch when they go fishing. \nTherefore, the choice is C: a shark.\n\nInput: You want to write your mother a letter, why is it important to take something with you?

{"text": "), and door knob (D) may be contained within a doorway, the 'object' implied in the question is a person not the other object mentioned, hence these can be eliminated from consideration.\n4. Looking at choice E: doorway it is clear that the doorway serves as a structure containing the door itself which in turn contains the doorknob.\n5. Hence the correct answer is E: doorway.\nSo the final answe is E: doorway\n\nInput: If I am hungry, what would you do? Choices: 1: have something to eat 2: make a plan 3: be productive 4: work hard 5: have time for yourself\nOutput: 1: Since the question is asking what you would do, it implies the respondent is asking what you should do if you are hungry.\n\t 2: Having something to eat or making a plan are not options applicable in every possible scenario. 3: Even if we choose to work hard or not to work hard as a response, these are personal decisions. Having time for oneself is very subjective; if we are not comfortable spending more time alone or being alone, it may not be applicable to us.\n\t 4: Similarly, work hard being an objective could be seen as applicable to several situations as an appropriate answer. \n\t 5: Working productively implies you are working towards a goal. Hence it may be acceptable in some situations for hungry people but not for others who may be having a regular 9am 5pm schedule.\n\t\t 6: The best answer is: have time for yourself.\n\t\tIt is the most suitable answer for the given context.\n\t\tIt includes the two answers that I would pick most in the given contexts: working hard, having something to eat or working out.\nSo the final responds is: have time for oneself\n\nInput: What can you not find in any type of store?

{"text": ") and a doorknob (D) could all be classified as 'contained by' objects, it is unlikely that they are in a structure, or contained by a doorway, if they are located in front of, away from or inside the doorway. \n4. This narrows down our choices to A and E, where a television could be located by a doorway, however, E refers to a building structure itself so a doorway would not necessarily be a part of the object that is contained by the doorway in E.\n5. Since the doorway is specific to the location where the object is located, and if we know that a television is located somewhere near a doorway, then the answer to this question would be A: television. \n6. Since the answer is A, the final answer will be A as well.\nSo the final answers are:\n\nA: Grabbing a television from a doorway where it may be located\n\n```\nNote: \nTelevision was chosen as an example object to highlight that the chosen objects for answer must be a single independent item, and not a collection of items e.g. \"A pen\", \"A shirt\", \"A table\".\n```\n\n\nInput: What are they saying if you are reading and they are reading too?

Hence, the correct answer is D: Doorway\nSo the final answer to this question is D: doorway.\n\nInput: The house was built around a large tree. Choices:  A. in spite of B. because of C. as a consequence of D. because of the fact that E. because of so\nOutput: 1: If I were to ask you about the construction of a home in a natural setting, what would be the appropriate way to answer?\n2. It would be a consequence, not In spite of, or because of,\n\n3. If it's necessary because of the fact that the tree is in the way, then I would answer because of that fact. Not because of the fact that.\n\n4. The phrase 'In spite of' is correct if the other factors have something to do with the fact that the tree in this house is big, it won't be 'because of' or 'because the fact'.\n\n5. If someone answered because of that fact, it could be an additional reason for the house, which is not the case here.

Choices: A: their hat B: their wand C: anything D: no one E: themselves **Note:** **The answer is provided with the question.**\nOutput: 1) We can eliminate choices D: No one and E: themselves as both of these options are clearly unacceptable.\n2) Choice A: their hat looks most plausible at first, but there are at least three problems with this option \n   - The wizard is not wearing the hat, but using the wand.\n   - The wizards might have trouble seeing in the dark, but as stated in the original question, the wizard can no longer see. Therefore, a dark room or night sky is not likely to be an issue for him.\n   - The hat is on the hat rack and not worn by the wizard, eliminating this possibility too.\n3) This suggests that the wizard can see everything but his own wand. However, this does not seem to be true if you take into consideration the above reasons.\n4) We can cross out more options until we get a single choice which seems to explain the wizard\u2019s inability to see his wand. This leaves us with Choice B: their wand.\n5) As the title indicates, the correct answer is B.\nSo the final and correct answer is B: their wand.", "answer": "A: burlap sack"}

Choices:  B: cooking requires an investment C: cooking requires special kitchen skills D: cooking tastes good E: cooking is messy F: cooking is simple when done right\nOutput: 1.'making music' cannot be compared with 'cooking', as the skill sets required for the two are different.\n2. Investment and kitchen skills does not make musical skill and cooking skill similar, as the scenarios being compared here are not similar enough to the original statement.\n3. 'cooking tastes good' in some cases, but it does not make it a universal statement. Therefore, it cannot be the correct one.\n4. Cooking being messy might be the case in some cases, but not in all, thus cannot be a correct answer.\n5.'cooking is simple when done properly' and'making music' cannot be concluded as similar as they are independent statements.\n6.'making music' being simple only when done properly can be understood in a way that cooking can also be simple when done properly, as well. Therefore, it is the best option to choose. The correct answer is F: cooking is easy when it is done the right way.\nSo the final step of solving the problem is F: cooking easy when it is done correctly.\n\n### **Part 2: Suggested solutions**\n \nInput: The city of Chicago has many bridges, which are also a popular tourist attraction.

The gargoyle was still there iii. Gargoyle shattered iv. Gargoyle wasn't there\nOutput: 1: The question is asking us about what happened to the gargoyle after its fall.\n\n2: We eliminate option i as the gargoyle is not alive, so it couldn't be 'crushed'.\n\n3: Similarly, option iii cannot be correct as there is no information about the state of the gargoyle and how it shattered.\n\n4: As for choice iv, the gargoyle might not be present because it could have fell anywhere and that location might not be easily discernible.\n\n5: We are left with choice ii as it clearly states that the gargoyle 'fell', with no specification about its current location.\n\ntherefore, the final answer is ii: Gargoyle was still there.\n\nInput: At what part of the process is the planking done?

Choices:  F: country store G: rodeo H: saloon J: bank\nOutput: 1) In the context of the western movie genre, a cowboy typically works on a ranch or farm and rides horses. \n2) A saloon, however, has little to do with the lives of cowboys and is, in fact, an entirely different setting from a ranch. \n3) The question thus asks us to identify where, in a western movie, a cowboy would most likely not be and hence, to choose the opposite choice of where the cowboy could be.\n4) A bank (J) is thus the correct answer.\nSo the answer to the question is J: bank\n\nInput: When would you be most likely to find snow leopards in the wild?

Choices: 1. A: if he's angry with you 2. B: if he doesn't care 3. C: if you're his best friend 4. D: if he's a big guy 5. E: if you're a woman\nOutput: 1: The question involves saying something to someone's face that you wouldn't (couldn't) say to their back.\n2: This indicates that you're not supposed to say it face-to-face, which in this case would be an act of aggression that you wouldn't need to do if the person doesn't care.\n3: So, the choice would be C: if you'd his best friend. Best friends are more likely to open up to each other, including the chance of offense, so it's safe to say in front of your best friend that you do something that he would react poorly to him if he found out later.\n4: D: if he'd a big guy is incorrect primarily because it's too general, and a big guy could have all sorts of reactions to what you say. However, if the man's face-to-face reaction is based on him being big, it might be difficult for you to talk to him face-to-face if his height is intact.\n5: E: if you are woman is incorrect because the premise of the question is that one can say something to a man face to face, but you wouldn't do so face to face. If it's too delicate to talk to him directly, then the choice would be to talk to him from behind.\n6: The correct response would be A: If he's angry with me, because this scenario would", "answer": "C: american city"}
{"text": "), and a doorknob (D) could all be contained by a doorway, we must be careful to consider the phrase in its entirety. If we consider the entire sentence and eliminate the wrong choices, we find that the phrase \"an object contained by a door\" is a misleading phrase that does not make sense.\n4. Therefore, option E: doorway does not contain the correct logical reasoning behind this phrase and is an appropriate answer.\n5. So the final answer is E : doorway.\nSo the final choice is E: doorway\n\nInput: You can use your hands to wash. Choices:  A : fingernails B : fist C : arm D : palm E : head\nOutput: 1: There's the word 'wash', which does not apply to fingernails because you can't use your fingernails to wash anything other than your fingernails.\n2: There's also the word 'you', which can be applied to any individual's hand.\n3: We have narrowed the answers down by ruling out choices D and E which refer to body parts other than hands and don't really make any sense.\n4: Looking at choice C - arm, it wouldn't really make sense to wash an arm, as arms aren't something meant to be washed.\n5: The final answer, hence, is B : fist.\nSo the final response is B : fist\n\nInput: Where you are from determines what race.

Choices:  A- her name is Mary B- her father is also in the house C- she can walk into the kitchen D- she has been sleeping alone for years E- she will not use the back stairs\nOutput: 1.) The context in which Mary wakes up refers to a place where she sleeps, which is likely where her home is.\n2.) The lady has always known or assumed two things to be true and in the context of Mary's morning routines, these two things are not directly related to her home, Mary herself, or any other place she normally visits.\n3.) Options C & D may seem plausible, but they do not explain Mary's routine of using the backstairs instead of the front ones.\n4.) Looking at the given choices A- her name is Maria B- her father is in the house only seem to be true statements, not part of an assumed routine.\n5.) The best answer that fits the context is E: she will not use the stairs as it refers to Mary's routine.\n6.)

E: You couldn\u2019t find parking\nOutput: 1) The context of the question indicates that we are likely talking about an event with a specific location and time. 2) This rules out option B: 'The event wasn't local' as the location should not matter if attendees can reach it regardless of location. 3) Option C: 'you were out of", "answer": "C: pond"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) can all be contained by a doorway, doorknob does not fit the definition of containing; hence it can be eliminated from the choices.\n4. We can also eliminate option D: doors because the question does not ask which door to grab the object from, and it's clear that the object is contained by a doorway and not a door.\n5. This leaves us with two valid options: B: control panel, and E: doorway.\n6. Looking into why the control panel would be an invalid answer, it turns out that its presence inside the doorway doesn't necessarily imply that one can't grab it. This is an acceptable outcome to some people. \n7. However, according to the question, grabbing an object which is contained by a door implies that you can only grab it with the door closed. This makes it impossible to grab a control panel from inside a doorway if the door was closed, as the door would be blocking you from being able to grab the control panel.\n8. On the other hand, doorway (E) fits the conditions set out in the question, as it is an inward opening doorway that allows the person inside the room to grab the object contained by the door without being obstructed.\n9. Therefore, the most appropriate answer choice is E: doorway. \nSo the final answer  is E: doorway\n\nInput: In a bar a patron will find what?

Cash is unlikely to be located in a bar and is excluded from the correct answer.\n3. It's quite likely that both A: tap and B: pool will be found in a bar. \n4. D: Liquor is also very likely to be present in a bar. 5. E: cash is already ruled out.\n6. However, C: Bard is another likely answer; however, there are other types of bars that might also be used in the question as an example. \n7. There is a pool bar, a tap bar, and so on. \n8.

Choices: \tA: heal B: help toothless C: fall out D: hurt someone E: hurt the baby\nOutput: 1: The question asks what happens to the tooth once it's pulled out.\n2: It's given that the tooth is that of a baby, and we know that it\u2019s not the baby\u2019s primary tooth as it\u2019s stated in the question itself. \n3: The baby's primary tooth fall out by themselves.\n4: Looking at the following choices from A to E, choice A: \"Heal\" is too broad as it can heal the baby and the tooth. \n5: Likewise, choice B: \"Help toothless\" does not state the specific baby\u2019s tooth, and it cannot be inferred that it is primary tooth.\n6: Choice C:\"fall out\" doesn't relate to a particular baby's tooth pulled out.\n7: Choice D: \"Hurt someone.\" refers to the baby whose tooth's pulled out and it can be either hurt or help.\n8: Hence, choice E:\"Hurt the baby\" is the correct answer. \nSo the final answer will be choice E:Hurt the baby\n\nInput: A _________ man was driving recklessly. Choices:\tA: ruff A: manly B: dangerous C: kind D: rough\nOutput: 1) The question states that the man was driving recklessly, hence we can infer that he was probably driving fast. \n2) Though man is referred as male here, it could also mean that the man referred is actually a woman. \n3) Looking at the given choices form A to D, choices A: ruff has no relation to the context of the question and it cannot be infer that he is manly.

Option E refers only to an open doorway and not the object that's contained inside the doorway.\n5. We can eliminate options C and B as they do not adequately match the given question.\n6. We can eliminate option B because they would not be accessible while you're outside the doorway or even in another location of the house.\n7. Doorways are not the typical location for a 'control panel'.\n8. Option D 'a doorknob' does not indicate the specific location but can be used as a generic term in any part of the door.\n9. Choice A - 'television' has a specific area, but not within a doorway.\n10. Choice E is the correct answer because it is the only option that corresponds to a contained object within a doorway.  Option E' refers to the entire doorway itself rather than the doorway containing an object.\nSo the final choice is E: doorway.", "answer": "D: movie"}

In most cases, if you're searching for something, you will need additional tools and technology to narrow your search and maximize efficiency.\n2. This can be based on a lack of preparation, not knowing where to look, or maybe having other individuals using the area where the items may be located.\n3. This can also be an issue of misplaced items or items not being in the expected place.\n4. This can be because of competition or someone else using the item already.\n5. This can be due to an unfamiliar environment, where you might be able to identify potential items but have trouble retrieving them.\n6. In this case, you might not know how to use the item, and additional tools or instructions in order.\n7. This can also be based on the complexity of the item you're looking for, or the additional time it would take to find it via traditional methods.\n\n8.

In this context, the given choices are all related to seasons. \n5. Summer B: Winter C. Spring, and E: Sometime during the spring are incorrect as \"Spring\" is associated with all the spring season and it cannot be specific about the month of spring.\n6. Choice A: Summer does not apply because sand tends to dry quickly in the summer heat, making it difficult to write things in sand during this time of year.\n7. Similarly, D: Autumn or B: Winter cannot be reasonably considered, as these seasons are also known for having less precipitation, which makes it difficult to write in the sand.\n8.

We then look at options A, B, C & D.\n6.) Out of these options, A and C seem the most plausible.\n7.) A seems like the place for the paint to be applied, but when we look at the context of the question, we see that the paint is put on the room as a whole, not in a particular place.\n8.) So, the only plausible answer is C.\n9.) The paint has been put on the walls.\nSo the final choice is: option C.", "answer": "D: death"}

Choices: 1. A: by honking 2. B: by shouting 3. C: by singing 4. D: by tweeting 5. E: by crying\nOutput: 1: The bird's attempt to communicate with the dog may involve making a sound, which would be referred to as 'Honking' (A) or possibly'shouting' (B).\n2. It's possible that the bird is singing (C), but that isn't relevant to the situation.\n3. 'Tweeting' (D) doesn't make sense because birds don't 'tweet'.\n4. The term 'crying' (E) refers to a behavior involving upset tears. This does not apply in this scenario.\n5. The correct answer is #1: 'By honking'.\nInput: Which of the following is more common in an apartment? Choices: 6. A: bed 7. B: bathtub 8. C: bedroom 9. D: bedroom set 10. E: window sill\nOutput: 10. From the options given, an apartment would only contain a bedroom set (D) and a window sill (E) if they were bought to move into the apartment, not built into the apartment itself.\n2. Thus, option A: bed (as in a person who is sleeping in the bed) is not likely to occur in an apartment.\n3. Option B is incorrect because a bathtub would likely be in the bathroom, not the apartment.\n4. Option A is incorrect since a bedroom could also indicate the room is a bed & breakfast inn or AirBNB rental, and A, as a person, doesn't move between them.\n5. Option C is not relevant as 'bedroom", "answer": "D: pleasure"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) could all be considered within the structure of the room and located within a doorway, a doorway (E) is more likely the correct answer.\n4. Option E is very broad and could refer to any doorway in place. Option D is also too narrow as the object would have to be contained within the door handle.\n5. Option C is quite far-fetched, as a door usually does not contain opening doors and only handles.\n6. Option B is likely irrelevant due to the small size of the control panel.\n7. Therefore the final and correct answer is E: doorway.\nSo the final and correct answer", "answer": "B: piggy bank"}
{"text": "), or doorway (E) can all be contained within the doorway, only option D: doorknobs fits the criteria of being 'contained'.\n4.

Choices: \nA: resting B: typing C: writing D: reading E: drinking water\nOutput: 1) The question asks where a pencil would be while a person is working.\n2) Let's analyze each choice:\n\nA - Resting: A person typically doesn't rest with a pencil in hand.\n\nB - Typing: While writing on a keyboard or typing notes using the keyboard can be considered 'working' but it is still a form of writing, which means that we are looking for choices that describe objects which are not used for writing or for the process of writing.\n\nC - Writing: Correct! It should be 'writing'.\n\nD - Reading: Reading can be considered a part of the reading process which can be a part but not all of the working process. So, it's not a plausible choice.\n\nE - Drinking Water: Correct! It should by 'drinking water'.\n\nWe can now choose the correct answer from the remaining 2 options, which are B: typing and C: writing.\nSince we have 2 options from which to choose, we can use elimination by choosing the correct answer first, then going to the remaining choice which will always be the incorrect one.\nHence, eliminating the incorrect choice (B - typing) leaves us with only choice C - writing. The only choice which is specifically for not used for writing is writing itself, hence B can be eliminated. \nWe can now reason the statement that a 'person might be holding a pencil while a person is working'. \nWhile someone could be working by typing or reading, this question also implies that it does not matter if the person is holding on to a pencil or not during the work time.\n\n3) Therefore, the correct response is C - writing. \nSo the final answer would be C: writing\n\nInput: What's something you can do to make a place where you live more comfortable?

Choices:  B: bathrooms C: tables D: bed E: kitchen\nOutput: 1 The question is asking us for a place where a person might eat.\n2. Places where a person may eat include the kitchen, bathroom, bed, table, and any place else a person decides to eat.\n3. However, eating on a public restroom or a bathroom is discouraged.\n4. The options that are given are B: bathrooms, C: tables, D: bed, E: kitchen.\n5. One of the options that is given, B: bathrooms, is a location where one could eat.\n6. However, the other choices (C: tables, D: Bed, E: Kitchen are places where one could eat) as well.\n7. Therefore the choice that provides both locations and is correct is, \"C: Table\"\nSo the final answer to this scenario is C: Table", "answer": "A: soccer game"}
{"text": ") might be within a doorway, they would typically not be contained by it; hence they can be eliminated. \n4. Similarly, a doorknob (E), although an object found within a doorway, it does not specifically mean that it must be 'contained by' as an item in the doorway. \n5. Hence, the two remaining options to consider are: doorknob (D) and doorway (E). \n6. Doorknob is the correct answer as it is an object within a doorway that is also contained by it. A doorway is the frame of an entrance to a room where the object itself, whether a doorknob or other is in.\nSo the final answers are:\n\n   1. Doorknob, and\n\n   2. Doorway\n\n\nInput: Which of the following is important or necessary for making it to a desired destination? Choices: 1 A: destination B: road C: transportation D: car E: driver\nOutput: 1: Which of the following do you need for making it to a destined location?\nTo go to a destination, one needs to have a road to travel on, means of travel, and travel companions (be them automated or human).\nA road is usually made by humans to connect two locations, and a destination is a specific location that one is trying to get to.\nA road needs some sort of transportation, whether automated or human, for it to be usable for travel.\nThe desired place is the destination.\nWhen we refer to transportation, we are often referring to the vehicle one is using to travel, such as a car.\nFinally, to be able to reach a destination, one needs a driver for the car; however the car can sometimes also travel automatically without a driver.\n\n \nThere are 3 parts to this question that must be answered. We'll start with an overview of the entire passage to find the answer to the first part.\n\n>  A: destination -> B: road -> C: transportation -> D: car -> E: driver\n> \n\n1. We can eliminate answer 'A' as destination is redundant in the context of this question.\n2. We must take a closer look at options 'B' and 'C'. Option B: road is not necessary as it is a given that", "answer": "B: symphony orchestra"}
{"text": "), and a doorknob(D) could all be within the doorway; they don't contain the whole object.\n4. The best option in this context is E; Doorway.\n5. The doorway will be the largest container that will fully encompass the whole object. \n6. So the most fitting option in this context is the doorway itself (E)\nSo the final answer us E: Doorway\n\nInput: If you are thinking, where can you move a large amount of objects into? Choices:  M: cabinets B: cars G: living room C: bedrooms D: attic F: closets \nOutput: 1) We can eliminate M. A cabinet can only hold a limited amount of objects. \n2)  F is not correct. If you're moving a lot of objects into a location, you only want to do that when the location is clear and available. However, having a lot of objects in a location makes it impractical to use that location. \n3) C is incorrect. A bedroom is a small room with a specific function. It would not make sense to move the objects into a bedroom unless they functioned the same way.\n4) We can rule out G. Living rooms are relatively empty in the first place. \n5) Car, although being a large room, would not necessarily be a suitable option for this kind of activity. Cars do not have designated areas and can be moved around a lot. \n6) This is incorrect, because you'd be moving the objects into the attic, not in the attic.\n7) This is a logical choice. An attic is a great place to move objects. It is large, can be emptied to make room, and is out of the way of daily activities and traffic. However, you shouldn't move 30 people into the attic or any other location. It would make no sense to do more than you needed to.\nSo we can eliminate all the options except F.\n\"Where can you move a large number of objects into?\" \"The attic\"\nSo the correct answer is G.\n\nInput: You see a truck on the way to work, which of the following is it most associated with?

Choice:  A: on the bathroom floor B: in a river C: in a glass D: on the table E: in a lake\nOutput: 1: The context of the question is to find water when thirst. \n2. Any choice may be used to quench thirst. \n3. Only B - 'in a river' and E - 'in a lake' would provide plenty of water, while A - 'on the bathroom floor', C - 'in a glass', and D - 'on the table' could be very small sources of water. \n4. Therefore, B - 'in a water source' can be deduced as the correct answer.\nSo the final true answer is Choice: A: on the bath room floor.\n\nInput: How about an egg, where does it lay? Choices: 1. A: in the basket 2. B: on the kitchen counter 3. C: in the oven 4. D: in a pan\nOutput: 1) Lay is a verb used for animals\n2) A basket is a container, it may contain eggs but not lay eggs and also can't lay eggs.\n3) An oven is a vessel, it may contain eggs and eggs may be eaten, but it can't lay eggs\n4) A pan is made to contain eggs and eggs may cook in a pan, but it can' t lay eggs\n5)The correct answer is: eggs are laid in an egg lay and hens lay eggs, it means only a hen can lay eggs, we may eat eggs, we may cook eggs but eggs should not be allowed to lay themselves as this way they will only destroy themselves since there is 0 hens to lay eggs\nSo the final true and correct answer is hen.\n\nInput: Who might enjoy eating a bagel?

On a pencil B. in a notepad C. under a table D. in a bed E. in a box\nOutput: 1; The question is asking for the location of a pencil that doesn't appear to be visually accessible. \n2. While the other choices may be plausible with other scenarios, they don't fit with the context of the question, which is where can you locate a pencil if it is not out in the open.\n3. The only choice that applies in this scenario is E: In a box. \n4. Therefore, the only choice that fits best is E: in a box.\nSo the finalanswer is E: in a", "answer": "E: splats"}

A: walk everywhere instead of taking the bus 2. B: train to use their arms to walk 3. C: wear a splint 4. D: practice doing the splits 5. E: be born without a disability\nOutput:1. The question asks how a person can improve their walking.\n2. The first part of our answer will not directly answer the question because this part is a suggestion rather than advice. \n3. Walking requires that the individual be able to control their legs for balance, coordination, and muscle function. So having more experience walking can be beneficial for improving one's mobility. \n4. A splint is designed to support an injured ankle, not to improve walking. \n5. A person cannot be born with a disability unless they're born with a brain injury or a birth defect. \n6. The correct answer is most likely one of the options to encourage the individual to continue walking and build on the strength and balance in their legs. \n7. D: practice doing splits, since it would require the individual to improve their leg strength and balance and build confidence in their walking technique so that they feel better equipped to walk.\nSo the final results are D: practice doing the split.\n\nInput: What was more likely to be in the house of someone in London, England?

Choices: A: food (a shark) B: danger (a shark) C: safety (a shark) D: an underwater cave E: an area with fish\nOutput: 1) This seems like an easy scenario but if you look at it closely, you will find an error.\n2) We know that a shark eats other animals for food. So food is the answer to this problem.\n3) The other answers of danger and safety have been derived from the context because of the red marking in the fin. \n4) Danger could be dangerous to the shark and safety may mean that the red mark provides safety from other animals. \n5) These terms are too broad for the option to be correct. \n6) Therefore we conclude that the answer is B: danger.\nSo the final solution is B: danger\n\nInput: The old man wanted to know about his family's past.

Chooses:  A: water B: coffee C: wine D: air E: water bottle\nOutput: 1The question asks us about what one wouldn't drink if they aren't thirsty. \n2. Looking at the choices, we know that 'water' and 'water bottle' are incorrect answers as 'thirsty' means that the person already wants and needs to drink water. \n3. 'Coffee' could be a correct answer if it was watered down, but 'wine' is incorrect because it wouldn't be consumed as a beverage if one isn't thirsty; they would drink water. \n4. 'Air' is incorrect because we can't be sure if the person is not thirsty that they won't drink water or not, \nand this wouldn't be the only activity they would engage in. \n 5. Therefore, the only plausible answer is B: coffee.\nSo the final Answer is B: coffee\n\nInput: You would not want to eat what when it's rotten? Choices:  C: fruits D: beans E: vegetables F: dairy products G: eggs\nOutput: 1'Rotten' means it has gone bad. \n2.

Fruits, veggies, beans, and dairy products can be consumed or at least made edible through preparation, but eggs and meat would be unfit for consumption.\n5. Looking further at the choices, it's clear that choice E: vegetables can be safely consumed even when rotten.\n6. Choices A: fruits, D: beans, C: dairy products and F", "answer": "C: great outdoors"}
{"text": "), door (D), and doorway (E) are all considered objects, only the door (D) and doorway (E), have an explicit location that could describe them as a container.\n4. The television could be found in a basement or closet, the control panel may or may not be contained by the doorway. But, most likely is not contained within the doorway. \n5. Similarly, the opening doors may be outside of the doorway, a swinging door on a hinged door, or doors in an elevator. \n6. Option E, doorway, may be the correct answer, but since it includes a verb in the form of 'grab' which seems more suitable to a human action, the answer may be inapplicable to this question.\n7. Looking at Choice D: Doorknob, this may very well be the answer required. In our context, doorknob could be considered to be an object located in the doorway, hence making it a container or 'containing' the door. As such, the correct answer is D: Doorknub\nSo the final answer would be D:Doorknob\n\nInput: What didn't you bring when you walked outside without your jacket? Choices:  C: wallet B: gloves E: shoes A: umbrella F: keys D: cellphone\nOutput: 1: The question refers to when you walked outside without a jacket. \n2. Since walking outside usually involves movement, not carrying something with you would then lead to the exclusion of all the objects that the person was most likely carrying with him or her when going out.\n3. So, we end up with the following:\n\t5. A: Umbrella; If you are walking outside, you don't use your umbrella.\n\t6. B: Gloves; if you are walking outside, gloves would most likely be part of an outfit to protect you from the weather. \n\t7. C: Wallet; If you are walking out, you most likely have some money on you. This money, in case you need cash on your wallet in case, you decide to use an ATM. \n\t8.

The bakery does not require the phone number if they have a website; where the number is already in a website's URL or easily accessible by the user.\n2) Let's analyse each of the options:\n3) Option A (basket) - bakeries are typically stand-alone businesses and not part of shopping carts or such, and using baskets as a means of transporting items might be impractical.\n4) Option C (Sign) - If a business has a physical address, it is not necessarily impractical for it to display a physical sign at the entrance. Many bakeries these days have mobile apps, websites, social media pages, or phone numbers easily accessible on physical storefront, or online. This shows you that we need to go past merely determining what might not have to be put on the shop's door, but also what might only have to be put on some other platform or in some other part of the shop.\n5) Option E (Cake) - a baking place might not put their phone number on their cake.

C: curator 3. D: security guard E: owner\nOutput: 1, 2, 3. The question is asking who could be found working at a museum. \n2. Patrons visiting a museum, such as a general public, would not be expected to work there. \n3. Curators may sometimes carry out tasks such as monitoring exhibits, but their primary role is typically to study artifacts and interpret their significance.\n4. A museum curator may not be the best selection at all times, as their duties depend on the type of museum where they work. Museums don't always require a person responsible for interpreting artifacts. \n5. Security guards are expected to monitor and protect museum buildings, visitors, works of art, and other objects.

Choices: 1. Early 2. Beginning 3. Starting 4. Midway 5. Along the way 6. Arriving\nOutput: 10. The question asks when the person began their drive to work. \n2. Since 'either the beginning or the midway point' is correct, option 2 must be eliminated.  \n3. The choice 3 is incorrect because'starting' doesn't mean the beginning of the trip. \n4. The choice 4 doesn't make sense as either'midway' or 'beginning' will fit the context of the question. \n5. The choice 5 doesn't make sense because a person wouldn't be 'working' in their car after arriving to work, unless they're the 'owner' or a'manager'. \n6. The choice 6 also doesn't make sense, as a person driving to work wouldn't be performing 'work' midway.  \n7. As both 'at the very start' and at 'the very end' fit the context, both fit the question and hence option 10 is the correct choice since it has both answers at the same time.\nSo the final correct choice is 10, which is when did they begin their drive?\n\nInput: What is a man saying, he has it made?

These are the locations one would typically learn to type on a computer keyboard but since that is not the question, we move to the next step. \n3. Eliminate the choices A: college and E: computer.\n4. We see that A: school, and E: home contain the keyword \"place,\" so they don't fit the question. \n5. This leaves B: workplace and D: home as the possible answer locations as they do not contain \"place,\" the keyword in the question. \n6. The workplace would not provide a learning environment because it could be anywhere, so it can be ruled out. \n7. Lastly, we can conclude that D: home is the correct answer because it would be the most feasible and personal appropriate environment when one want to learn how to type.\nSo the final answers is B: workplace and C: school\n\nInput: Where is the most logical place for a person to place a piece of writing they've completed?

For this answer, we can use the context clues to eliminate incompatible answers.\n3. We know that the meal has already been eaten, so shower would come after it.\n4. In this scenario, a shower would be the next step, and it would come immediately after the meal (2). \n5. After the dinner drinks would come first, then the meal, according to the context clues. \n6. The answer that would come after the meal is E: bed. \nSo the final answer to this question is E: bed\n\nInput: When someone says \"you too,\" what are they usually referring to? Choices: \n1.

Choices:  shoes boots pants sandals baton books\nOutput: 1: The word \"setting\" indicates a place where the story happens and not a foot. The only part of the body in need of a foot in the given choices is the story itself, as it would be a foot without something on which to stand.\n2: Other than shoes, boots, and sandals, the others are not related to footwear.\n3: We know that books or stories are made up of words that can be read. So, a foot or footwear is not needed to read it.\n4: Similarly, a person can read something without any", "answer": "E: happen anywhere"}
{"text": ") and a doorknob (E) are not appropriate answers due to the fact that they are not 'contained' within the doorway, and do not contain any objects, only option D: the doorknob would be most appropriate.\n4. We can eliminate option E, as the doorknob does not serve to contain objects. \n5. Although option B could function as a possible answer, it might be more correct to assume that the object is contained within a doorway, rather than just being a control panel within the doorway. \n6. Given these reasons, the answer would be D: door way. \nSo the final answer would be D: the doorway\n\nInput: The lady and man were heading to the party for the bachelor and bachelorette, where were they going? Choices: \tA: the mall B: the store C: the movie D: the dinner E: the church\nOutput: 1) The question asks the destination of a lady and a man heading for a bachelor and bacherlorette party. \n2) We can eliminate each of the given options as they are all not the correct answer to the question:\n\na) A: The mall: The man and woman don't go to a mall to celebrate a bachelor or bacherlorette party - rather they are going to party with the bride and groom to be.\n\nb) B: The store: A store is not a place to make a visit for a bachelor or a bachelorette party.\n\nc) C: The movie: Watching a movie with the rest of the attendees is not usually an activity in a bachelor or or bachelorette party, they will generally have a pre-party celebration.\n\nd) D: The dinner: Similar to watching a movie, this option is too specific for the context of the question, the party typically doesn't have dinner prior to or after it.\n\ne) E: Church: Churches are not suitable for bachelor or bachelorette parties, they are reserved for important occasions and generally not celebratory events.\n\n3) Choice E is incorrect, as the church is not suitable for any celebrations such as this. \n4) Choice A is also incorrect, the mall is not a suitable destination", "answer": "B: whorehouse"}

{"text": ") and door knob (D) could potentially be objects contained by a doorway, if they were actually contained, the placement of the object would have to be restricted/determined by the interior of the doorway, not the other way around. \n\n4. Therefore the only choice that can be an object contained by a doorknob is E: doorway itself.\n5. The object is contained by the doorknob, restricting its position to a specific area inside the doorway.\n6. So, the answer is E: doorway. \n7. The doorway is the only choice that makes the correct sense.\nSo the final  answer is E: door", "answer": "C: disparagement"}

She should have instead of that what? Choices: A: used a tougher test B: given more problems C: asked him to work D: used more words E: worked with him\nOutput: 1.) The question asks what the teacher should have done differently instead of explaining the problem to be 'all too difficult'. \n2. The solution can be found by analyzing the given choices. \n3. A: The teacher didn't need to use a tougher test because the question wasn't about how to get better at math. \n4. B: In most cases, giving more problems wouldn't help the child because the issue was the comprehension, not a matter of practice.\n5. C: Working with him isn't the answer either because the teacher herself was involved in the work that had resulted in her stating that the problem was all too difficult.\n6. Therefore, it stands out that D: using more words is the only correct choice because when more information or explanation is needed to solve a problem, it is a good idea to use more words.\nSo the final choice is D: use more words.", "answer": "B: cash in"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (E) could all be 'contained by' a doorway, they're likely not all within it.\n4. The correct answer, as per choice D, is the 'doorway'. A 'doorway' is considered a distinct structure that is separate from the door itself and is typically where one would get the door from.\n5. Hence, it makes more sense to say that you would grab an object from a different structure adjacent to a door than a door itself.\n6. Therefore, choice D - 'doorway' is the best answer.\nSo the final correct answer is D: doorway\n\nInput: What is a place to play chess? Choices:  B: the living room C: outside D: home E: the bar\nOutput: 1) The question asks which choice would fit into to play chess.\n2) Choice letter and number pairs are always chosen to be different in a multiple-choice question, and the options always fit the given choices.\n3) To better understand the choice letter and number pairs, we can consider them as pairs as numbers and letters will most likely not be consecutive, and the options will always fit the given choices, so we can ignore them.\n4) Choice letter \u2018A\u2019, in this case, \u2018B\u2019 has been paired with letter \u2018B\u2019 and number \u20184\u2019.\n5) Therefore, if we want to understand the answer, we should analyze each of the numbers and letters with the following pairs:\n  - Choice letter B with letter C, which doesn\u2019t fit as C is not a place to play. \n  - Choice letters D and E which are words that can be considered an optional answer for the question.\n  - Choice number 4 which clearly indicates that \u2018B\u2019 is the correct answer.\n\n6) Therefore, the answer to the question is B: the living room.\nSo the final final answer is B: the livingroom\n\nInput: Why do we need food to stay alive?

{"text": "), doorknob (D) and doorway (E) could be all be contained by the doorway as doors can cover entire walls, they are not the most logical choices, and can be eliminated. \n4. We can assume that the object contained by the doorway must be located within the 2D spatial plane of the doorway itself. \n5. Looking at the remaining two options, it seems that E: doorway has to be the answer as any item (D: doorknob) located within the doorway would be contained by the same.\n6. Moreover, an object 'contained by' a place must also have a location of its own apart from the place where it is contained, which it will continue to have regardless of getting contained by the doorway. \n7. Since, according to the question, the object is contained by the doorway and the location of the object outside of the doorway has to continue, then that object has to remain in the same place. \n8. This indicates that all that has to change is the object's state due to the context change, which will make the object cease to be contained by the door, but remain where it was before.\n9. The only logical choice that fits this description is option E: doorway. \n10. Therefore, the answer here would be E: doorway.\nSo the final answers is E: doorway\n\nInput: The bear's favorite food was which of these? Choices: 1. A: fruit \n2. B: vegetable \n3. C: meat \n4.

{"text": "), and doorknob (D) could all potentially be within the doorway, none of the four can be said to be contained by the doorway. \n4. Therefore, the answer must be E: doorway because of the phrase 'contained by'. This is a place in which objects that are within the doorway are contained to the space.\n5. This means that no objects are contained by the doorway, thus the object we are searching for is most likely not within the doorway itself. \n6. The only object contained by the doorway that would apply to the context of the text is a human. \n7. Therefore, a person would be the correct answer in this case.\n8. So the final answer is E; doorway.\nSo the final answers is E: doorway", "answer": "A: learning"}
{"text": "), doorknob(D), and doorway (E) could all technically be placed by a doorway, only option D 'doorknob' seems to apply as it could reasonably be reached or grasped by hand from within a doorway.\n4.

Overall  E. In terms\nOutput: 1) Witches are more evil: The word 'evil' has a strong negative connotation. \n2) In terms of evil: This phrasing implies the comparison of 'good' and 'evil', placing  the witches' evil on the same scale as vampires. \n3) Better than: The word 'better' implies the comparison of two things, one of which can be considered 'better' than the other. This indicates that  witches are not considered 'evil' in the eyes of all people.\n4) Even than: This statement shows the 'even' comparison, and does not imply the comparison of 'good', 'better' or 'evil'. \n5) In general: This statement indicates that the comparison is based on a general view, implying that witches can be considered 'bad' in general.\n6) In overall: similar to 'in terms' and 'in general', this indicates a general comparison of good and evil. \n7) In absolute terms: This statement implies that the comparison is based solely on the view of a group of people.\n8) In absolute terms: The word 'absolute' indicates an absolute or a universal truth. \n9) As such: The phrasing 'as such' implies that a comparison and judgement of good and evil has already been made.\n10) As a whole: Similar to 'in terms' the implies another absolute truth. \n11) As a whole: In terms of witches being considered 'evil' as a whole and not in all cases.\n\nSo the final answer that makes sense is 1) Witchs are more evil\n\nInput: Which could possibly be a bad feeling about the job you are at currently?

Choices:  True A: see the door B: they are not there C: they don't come to parties D: look for signs E: don't text\nOutput: 1) This is an unambiguous grammar type question asking if a person could not know if their friend is at the party using some way of knowing if they are. 2) It is important to understand this phrase'see' as \"observe or be aware of\" since the question is asking to find an answer to'see' rather than only'see the door'. 3) Since we can either 'look for signs' or 'don't text', it is important to look for signs which can help confirm whether their friend is at the place or not. 4) Therefore, the correct answer is B: they do not go to parties.\nSo the final choice is B: they do go to parties.\n\nInput: Which way would be the best to get to a concert if you're in a car? Choices: 1. Go right. 2. Go straight. 3. Go left. 4. Go U-turn. 5. No turning. 6. Go round the block.\nOutput: 1: This is irrelevant because the question is asking whether a person would drive to the concert which is not the same as 'going right' or 'going left'. 2: Again, irrelevant because the question is about driving to the concert. 3: It can be assumed that this is the correct option because it is the only option that is not a straight line. 4: This option cannot be considered because it does not apply to the given context. However, it can apply if the person were on foot instead of in a car. 5: As this option is the only other option that does not feature a straight line, this can be considered a valid choice. 6: Irrelevant - as the question is asking about driving to the concert, this", "answer": "A: in cinema"}

Choices: \nA: water B: food C: glass D: hair\nOutput: 1) The word 'body' in the question implies that the answer should be something that is an object (as opposed to some intangible entity like emotions or thought) \nand hence does not include the things like emotions, though a person can have emotions (that is not an object) inside them.\n2) Choice A: water cannot be found in a human body because while water can exist inside a body (in lungs or stomach for example), it cannot be found, i.e. it cannot be seen.\n3) Choices B, C, and D are all objects, so they can be found in the human bodies as the question asks. \nTherefore, the correct answer is D: hair.\nSo the final result is D: hair. \n\nInput: When might someone find a tree by a river?

{"text": "), doorknob (D), and doorway (E) are all things that could be found in a doorway, two of them - the television and the control panel - are not contained within a doorway (or can be considered to be outside a doorway - for the control panel). The doorknob of an inner door could be within a doorway, but the doorknob of a gate, which is typically on the outside, could not.\n4. Choices A and D do not make sense for the same reason (television and doorway), so they are eliminated.\n5. Of the choices left, the only reasonable answer is E: doorway. The doorknob (as a term) is always associated with the door itself, and the remaining four options do not contain a doorknob.\n6. The final answer is E: door.\nSo the final answers is E: door\n\nInput: Where do you find paper with a logo and that is made from wood?

Which is the only reason why option I: grocery shop can make more sense than option B: stationary store. \n6) Eliminate D: back of desks, from the answer choices, as per the given question the paper has to be made from wood.\n7) Hence, option B: stationery store make more sense as the answer to the given question. \nSo the final answer option B: Stationery store\n\nInput: What is the difference between a door and a doorway?Choices:  I: doorframes J: nothing at all", "answer": "A: cash register"}

Only doorway (E) itself can be viewed as an object contained within a doorway that requires reaching out for when opening it. \n5. Therefore, an object contained by a 'doorway' can only be accessed through a 'doorway' and not in any other manner. \n6. This leaves us with choice E as the only feasible answer to the question asking where to look for an object contained by a doorknob.\nSo the final answers is E: doorway \n\nInput: You could have seen the hunter, what was the hunter watching a deer? Choices:  a) the sky b) a tree branch c) shadows d) grass e) his dog\nOutput: 1) The question is regarding a hunter who watched a deer.\n2) It's important to understand the structure of the question and context of the sentence to determine the correct response. \n3) Each word and each individual part of the sentence holds a specific context and meaning which helps us understand the question. \n4) This means that when trying to determine the correct answer, we need to look at the correct response in the context of this same sentence. \n5) In this sentence, we have the word 'you' which indicates that you could be the one who'saw the hunter'. \n6) The key thing to take note of here is that we could only see another person/object in front of us or behind us, not beside us.\n7) Considering the word'saw' here, we can then eliminate the choice B - 'a tree branch'. It is unlikely that we'd see a 'tree branch' that's'moving' if the hunter is the one who is watching it.\n8) Another phrase that does not have much relevance to this scenario is choice C -'shadows'. Shadows on their own don't really move and don't really indicate the presence of anyone else unless they are created by someone moving through/around a physical form.\n9) Choice D- 'grass' presents an unlikely context as well. A hunter doesn't watch grass as it wouldn't be likely for him/her to see it moving.\n10) This", "answer": "A: contagious"}

Choices:  A. yes B. no C. true D. false\nOutput: 1.\"It can be a possessive word.\" as possessive means that you are taking what belongs to you and not necessarily something you own.\n2. The same goes for a deficient word, but a deficient noun can only answer what you do not have, not what belongs to you.\n3. Only 'a' is the correct answer, as it can be both a possessive and a decient word.\nSo the final outcome is A.", "answer": "C: playroom"}
{"text": ") and door knob (D) could all be items that are possibly contained by a doorway, the choice that best fits the given context of this question is E: door way. \n4. Doorways are a distinct structure within their own right which serves a certain purpose. Since they contain objects within their frame, it would be more apt to use the word \"doorway\" to describe the action of grabbing the object that lies within the doorway. \n5. Therefore, we would choose E - the doorway. 7. The word doorway is already a noun, so it is unnecessary to put an apostrophe before it.\nSo the final alternative is E: doorway\n\nInput: The person ran away from where? Choices: A: the situation B: the person C: the world D: the man E: the problem\nOutput: Here the question is \u201cThe person ran away from what?\u201d or \u201cWhere did the person run off to?\u201d 1. To answer these questions, the given choices need to be narrowed down. 2. The choices include situation, person, world, man, and problem. 3. \u201cThe situation\u201d and \u201cThe world\u201d cannot be ruled out, we are not told the actual situation and world, so while they are technically correct, we cannot tell if these are true or not without more information. Since we don\u2019t know what the situation is, technically the person could be running from anything, or it could be the situation itself that she actually ran away from. Likewise since we don\u2019t know the world the person is in, we cannot make the same decision for \u201cThe world\u201d. 4. \u201cThe person\u201d could be correct for two reasons. First, if this is an abstract question and not a personal question, then the correct answer would be the person, but this is not specified. Second, if we take the question literally, then all of the following questions are to be asked in relation to the person, then running away from themselves does not make sense as they can\u2019t technically even run away from themselves. Finally, \u201cThe man\u201d and \u201cThe problem\u201d are both the most correct answers to the question. When using a gendered pronoun as a subject, it should go with a gendered noun. \u201cThe Man\u201d makes sense as \u201cMan\u201d is a gendered noun and \u201cThe person\u201d is a genderless noun.

A pencil is an item that is necessary for learning and is widely used in schools. A knife is used for personal defense and cutting as needed. A bed is not used as a learning aid or for personal defense but instead is used for sleeping.\n3. Pencil (A), television (B) and bed (C) are all commonly found in a household as an essential that is important to use. Chair (D) may not be strictly a commonplace essential due but it is highly likely to be found in a household as is the case with a kitchen pantry, which would be necessary for a household to cook. \n4. Therefore, the word that does not belong to the category 'Household staple' is Pencil (A). So the final answer is A.\n\nInput: In terms of what, one ought to put a spider's web in which container?

Therefore the most fitting answer is (D) Doorway.\nSo the final correct answer is A: doorway\n\nInput: Where most would find a person who is looking for help with their homework? Choices:  G: dorm B: library C: classroom D: restaurant E: store\nOutput: 1 The question is asking \"Where most would find a person looking for help with their Homework\"\n2 The question implies that most people who are facing homework issues would look for help in the places where they find people.\n3 The correct answer should be given in terms of the places that people most commonly visit. For example, libraries, classrooms, restaurants, etc. \n4 Although dorms are usually frequented by students, the word \"most\" implies that homework is something that more students, rather than college-goers visit.\n5. Therefore dorms cannot be considered a place to find students looking for help with their studies.\n6 Similarly, restaurants are too far-fetched to be the answer because not everyone seeking school help will be able to afford such a facility.\n7 The only plausible answer is (E) a store. As this is a place where most students visit in their daily lives, seeking assistance with their studies will not feel out of place.\n8 So, the final answer will be (E) a store\n\nInput: Where often you will find a person who is walking? Choices:  F: behind G: in the E: in front of H: around\nOutput: 1 F: This answer is incorrect because it is an abstract noun, not a description of a person who is walking.\n2 G: H: Incorrect; although in a certain context G or H can be used to indicate a location in which the subject would typically be found, they are not the correct response options.\n3 E: Answer E indicates the person in front of you, not the person you would find walking.\n4 H: The answer is not specific enough to make a determination that the location would be more likely to be", "answer": "C: meow"}
{"text": "), or doorknob (D) could technically be contained by a doorway, the correct option to choose in this scenario would be E: doorway. \n4. The doorway is the most probable object from which someone could grab a contained object, given its structure; it has the most accessible space in comparison to the other objects. \n5. Therefore, option E: doorway, is the correct answer. \nSo the final answer I'm giving is E: doorway.\n\nInput: There is a difference between, which one? Choices:  I can walk to the library, and so I can I can't walk to the library, so I do I walk to the library, but I can't so I don't I walk to the library but I can so I do\nOutput: This is a grammar-based question that tests the understanding of correct sentence structure.\nOption A: \"I can walk to the library\" does not make sense, as walking to a location would normally require one to be able to actually do so.\nOption B: It would be better to use 'could' instead of 'can' to convey the intended meaning.\nOption C: Does not make sense, in that it is not possible to 'do something' (walk) if you cannot do it (walk).\nOption D: \"I walk\" implies that \"I can walk\" so the sentence should actually read, 'I walk to the library, I can so I do'.\nThis is the correct answer.\nSo the final choice is D: I walk to the library I can so I do \n\nInput: What can we do when we have leftover food? Choices:  Throw it away Eat it Give it Away Donate it\nOutput: 1) Throw it away: It would be throwing away the food, and not using it. \n2) Eat it: This is the correct answer. If we have leftovers, we can eat it, instead of wasting it or throwing it away.\n3) Give it away: If we have lef overs, maybe we can use them to feed children or people who are starving, instead of throwing it away. This is a donation.\n4) Donate it: If we donate it, we are not using it.\nThus, we get the answer to be E: Eat", "answer": "E: rain forest"}

While we consider option (E) 'doorway', 'doorway' is a broader term that includes the doorframe, jambs, sills, etc.\n5. Therefore based on the given context, option (E) 'Doorway' is the most appropriate answer.\nSo the final awnser is E: Doorway\n```", "answer": "A: middle east"}
{"text": "), or doorknob (D) might all be contained by a doorway, they are not the likely choice here since they are a part of the doorway rather than an object contained by the doorway. \n4. Therefore, we can safely exclude options A, B, and C from the choices.\n5. Looking next at option D, the doorknob would not be contained by the doorway since it would be contained by the object within the doorway.  Also consider that it might not even be on the door, for example on a door frame.\n6. Finally, option E refers to the doorway itself; it is not an object 'contained' within the doorway.\n7. The correct answer here is E: doorway.\nSo the final solution is E: doorway\n\nInput: What do we normally see on the tip of the nose? Choices: \n A: ears B: cheeks C: lips D: nose E: jaw\nOutput: 1) The question is about what we see on the tip of our nose and the choices provide us with the locations. \n2) Option C 'lips' doesn't adequately explain the correct answer because the tip of our nose could have other parts of itself that could be called lips.\n3) Option D'nose' isn't the correct answer either since it implies that we see other parts inside a nose other than the tip of the nose. \n4) Option A 'ears' isn't an uncommon reaction, but doesn't adequate describe what we see on the nose.\n\n5) Option B 'cheeks' is a popular belief, but a cheek isn't a part of the tip of the nose; however, a nose is, so it's the wrong response.\n\n6) The only correct response here is option E'jaw' because we see the jaw of the nose when looking at the tip of the nose, and it is part of that nasal tip.\nSo the final conclusion is that the answer to the question is E: jaw\n\nInput: John likes to bake bread, he enjoys smelling what?

Choices:  C: Cash D: With a card E: Credit card F: Vouchers G: Traveler's check\nOutput: 1) It can be assumed that as of the time being, one of the options does not apply and the correct answer will always be in bold.\n2. Cash, D, and E are all types of'money'.\n3. Vouchers are cards that are used in place of cash or money.\n4. Travellers should be able to pay with cards and if they can't, they would need to use cash or vouchers instead.\n5. Travellers check is a traditional form of payment which has little to no use in a place like a fast-food joint.\n6. F is obviously incorrect because it was already included in traveler's check.\n7. Travellers could technically pay using a card, but it would be improbable considering it was being offered by a guy who was serving hamburgers.\n8.

Therefore, the correct answer is E: doorway.\nSo the final is E: doorway\n\nInput: Where is it possible to put a tray on a table? Choices: 1. A: above B: next to C: right D: left E: both\n2. A: above - A tray is a broad surface with a rim along the edges, not something that would fit on top of a table unless it was smaller than the table. However, a tray could fit next to the table, or next to another tray (both of which are options). \n3. B: next to - A tray can fit next to a table, but it can't be above the table like option A describes. Likewise, it can't be on the right but only on the left. The correct answer is C: next to.\nSo the final solution is C: next to \n\nInput: With which animal does the human race share DNA with? Choices:  a. tigers b. giraffes c. lions d. birds e. bunny\nOutput: Option b seems more likely because DNA is passed down over thousands of years. As for the remaining choices, which are all animals of the cat family, it seems that, from an evolutionary point of view, dogs have existed for far longer than the human race so it's more likely for them to share the most in common, thus, choosing option A, 'Dogs' is a better answer than the remaining choices.", "answer": "E: eat plants"}

It's a valid possibility that someone could approach a doorway expecting a specific package that they want to use or open, like a birthday gift or an envelope.\n5. Therefore the answer is E: an independent object like a package.\nSo the final outcome is to say: E: independent object like a package \n\nInput: When working in the office, what would an employee not be doing? Choices: 1. A: resting 2: B: working 3. C: thinking 4: D: drinking 5: E: eating\nOutput: 1) The office environment provides employees with a place where they can perform all sorts of tasks - not just one! \n2) Let's analyze each choice:\n\n   - a) Resting - incorrect because it's a part of working - being at desk, not doing nothing.\n   \n   b) Working - incorrect option because it's an activity, not a part of working. \n   \n   c) Thinking - incorrect choice because it represents the result of the work performed by the employees without specifying whether it's part of work. \n   \n  - d) Drinking - incorrect because it'd be more likely to drink at home rather than in the office. \n   \n - e) Eating - incorrect because it' not necessary to eat at office while working - they'd do it before or after work. \n    - 3. Therefore, the correct answer choice is e) eating.

Choices:  A. flying B. parking C. boarding D. waiting\nOutput: 1 A large number of Americans is doing what, so there's a lot of traffic at the airports, right? 2. Choice A: flying doesn't match the description because the number of people flying is not the main determiner of increased traffic, in fact, it's the opposite. 3. Choice B: parking does not match the description either because parking is not a popular use of airports among all americans. 4. Choice C: boarding is incorrect because the Americans that board is not necessarily the most relevant factor in increased airport traffic. 5. Choice D: Waiting is the correct answer because it is the one that best describes the scenario given. In the words of the question, it refers to \"the weekend\" in which \"a large number of Americans enjoy traveling\". 6. The correct answer, therefore, is D: waiting.

The most probable answer that makes sense is E: door.\n5. Since we're to consider the door to be a part of the doorway, the natural thing to do would be to make the entire door a part of the door frame, rather than some specific parts of it like the doorknob.\n6. We can also consider that grabbing the door would make a stronger physical connection than the other given choice options as it would involve more 'containment' and effort on the person's behalf compared to touching the doorknob for example.\n7. Therefore the answer to this question is E: doorway.\nSo the final answers is E: doorway\n\nInput: What occurs when you find that you lost your car keys? Choices: 1. A: frustration 2. B: fear 3. C: sadness 4. D: happiness 5. E: hope\nOutput: 1) If the person finds that they have lost their car keys, frustration is the most likely response. 2) option B, fear is a natural response to losing something valuable. \n\nThis is especially true for car keys that provide access to a vehicle. 3) Option C, \"sadness\" might also be a possibility, but sadness typically occurs when one has lost something that is irreplaceable, such as a family member or a loved one. \n4) Option D, \"happiness\" is unlikely given the scenario of losing car keys. 5) Option E, \"hope\" is not an appropriate response as it implies a belief in the possibility of finding the keys again. So the final answer is A. \n\n\n\n\nInput: Who would get upset if you asked for food after they ate?

Choices:  Push A: forward B: backward C: towards E: sideways\nOutput: 1) The key here is to analyze the context and the given options. \n2) The phrase \"exchange of position\" provides an indication that we should be looking for an action that happens when two passing trains change their position relative to each other. \n3) Now that we understand the context of the question and have a bit of an idea about what's required, the next step is to eliminate our incorrect choices. \n4) The initial idea that comes to mind is that the two trains are reversing their positions or switching directions. This is a correct instinct, however, the answer does not require this. \n5) Therefore, we can eliminate options C & E as they are incorrect because they do not involve a change of position.\n6) We can also eliminate option B, since the answer does not require us to change the locomotive's direction of travel. \n7) Lastly, we are left with option A, which is correct.\nSo, the final answer is A.\n\nInput: The person is doing what with a person who is walking by them?

We can eliminate option C: 'opening doors' because opening doors isn't something you can grab while doing so.\n5. We similarly eliminate option D: 'Doorknob' because the question specifically asks \"Contained by\", hence it excludes an object on the side of the doorway.\n6. This leaves us with option B: 'control panel' and E: 'doorway'.\n7. Option B: 'Control panel' can possibly be part of the doorway, but that would mean that the control panel would have to be physically located on the doorway itself, which is not the case.\n8. The only remaining option now is E: 'doorway' itself. \n9. Therefore, the correct answer is E: doorway.\nSo the final, correct answer is E: Doorway!", "answer": "D: wall"}

Moreover, the object and doors aren't required to 'contain' one another, which eliminates option B: control panel. \n5. Finally, option C: opening doors doesn't indicate the object is contained by the doorway so this option can't be the right answer.\n6. We are left with options E: doorway, A: television, and D: doorknobs - as D: door and E: doorway could both be considered to contain objects as well, the answer to the question should be one of these two and not option A and B.\n7. Based on this, the most feasible answer would be D: doorknobb.\nSo the final answers are D: doorknbb\n\nInput: How do you get to the airport?

Option A: Bus. The bunk beds cannot fly or have wheels, therefore it cannot be a bus.\n5. Option B: Boat. Even if this were a boat that had passengers sleeping aboard, it's highly unlikely that bunk beds would be inside.\n6. Even though option C: Train could be considered, since it's traveling, but not in the air, a plane would still be more appropriate answer in this context.\n7. Choice D: Plane. If the bunk beds actually belonged to a plane they would likely be located in the passenger section, the plane is too big for the bunk beds to be stored inside somewhere else without affecting passenger experience in a way.\n8.

Choices E: doorway and F: wall are both incorrect because they refer to the structure of the door itself.\n5. Option E: doorway refers to where someone could grab the object contained within the door or doorway, whereas the question asked instead for the actual object.\n6. Option F: Wall refers to where the object contained within the structure could be located, whether inside or outside the doorway.\n7. While option G: floor could be a fitting answer, it doesn't have the contextual relevance of referring to 'contained by a doorway'.\n8. The only choice that clearly refers to an object that is 'contained' within the doorway is C: opening doors.\n9. Therefore the answer is C: opening doors, as they are part of the overall structure of the doorway.\nSo the final is A: opening doors\n\nInput: If someone is trying to sell a stolen painting, what would they say in their ad? Choices: 1. A: This painting was once in my possession 2. B: I paid the full price for the painting 3. C: It was stolen three times before 4. D: It was owned by an old woman 5. E: It is mine and I will never sell it\nOutput: 1&2. \nThe questions asks to identify what a person would say in an ad for selling a stolen painting. \n2. All options here involve some form of dishonest salesmanship, which suggests that they would not be the preferred options as it is unlikely that someone would sell a stolen item in an open and transparent manner.\n3. Option C: It was stollen three times before is an interesting choice, but the question specifically asks how they would describe it in the ads, and this option goes into detail about the painting's history rather than the way it would be described in an advertisement.\n4. Option D: It was owned before: An old woman is a highly inaccurate description considering  the question doesn't ask about the painting's possession by an old woman but merely about how the seller would describe it to the buyer.\n5", "answer": "B: pantry"}

Choices:  B: a plate C: a dish D: a tasty snack E: dessert\nOutput: 1 The context in this question is for a man who has 2 forks in his hand and wants to eat something; hence he can't eat plain with both. \n2. We eliminate option A: a sandwich, as the man could instead eat both of the two forks if it were just a sandwich.\n3. We eliminate option B: a plate and option D: a tastty snack because both are items with which one could eat.\n4. A dish (C) is something to be eaten with silverware, and a dessert (E) isn't generally eaten with silverware. A dish or a dessert are not the man's main course of food as indicated by 2 forks. \n5. There is only one choice in the question that the man could be eating; that is, option E: a dessert.\nSo the final choice is E: a dessert\n\nInput: Where is a person supposed to be when they use the restroom? Choices:  C: work D: hospital E: school F: restaurant\nOutput: 1 This question is asking which place a person should be when they go the restroom\n2.

There are many more places such as school, hospital etc\n3. Let's analyse the rest of the possible choices\n\n   - Choice C: Work is a place where a person goes to work, which does not answer the question. The person goes to the toilet, but they do not do their normal work.\n   \n     - Choice D: Hospital is a place where a patient goes to visit a hospital, not restroom, like we don\u2019t", "answer": "C: control children"}

Choices:A: new salesmen B: veteran salesmen C: potential salesmen D: current salesmen E: new customers\nOutput: 1) First, we will figure out the question type, there are two possible choices, a) a situation to a name, and b) a name to a situation.\n2) The question appears to be a name to a situation, so it is important to determine what type of manager Samantha is to determine who she will help. \n3) There are only two plausible answers that fit the situation- new salesman, or a new customer. Based on this alone, the answer can be guessed to be b) new salesman. \n4) However, we need to be sure that Samantha is in fact a manager. \n5) The clues provided do not fully describe the name (Samantha could be anyone) but it is quite clear that she \"would help\" or assist the salesmen. Based on this, the correct answer is E: new customers.\nSo the final choices are: E: new customers", "answer": "D: sporting goods store"}

Choices:  E: broke the leash A: jumped fences B: climbed trees C: made the noise D: was a guard dog\nOutput: 1.) Breaking a leash is illegal in some places. \n2.) Being a guard dog is illegal in some places as well.\n3.) Climbing trees is not typically illegal unless specified otherwise. \n4.) However, jumping over fences is considered a trespass and is often illegal. \n5.) A dog's noise might violate a noise ordinance, but it is not illegal itself.\n6.) The only scenario where an activity of a dog could be illegal is if it were a guard dog. \n7.) Given that law enforcement officers patrol neighborhoods and buildings, having a guard dog would be illegal.\n8.) However, a dog barking could be considered a noise violation, and that could make it illegal. \n9.) It is the activity of the dog, and not necessarily the dog itself, that is illegal.\n10.) Therefore, an answer choice wherein the dog's activity is illegal would be a good fit.\n11.) The only choice that describes the illegal activity as the dog breaking the leash as opposed to the dog's bark, which might not be as illegal.\n12.) Hence, the correct answer is B: jumped fences.\nSo the final answere is 1) E: broke the lease and 2) B: jumped fence\n\nInput: The cat was eating what from a bag during the dog's bedtime?

If he's taking a trip, he may be driving. There's a lot of things that can hurt this dog even while he has a seat belt. Dogs like to get out and sniff for their own reasons. Dogs like to snuggle with the other passengers in the car. Dogs don't know what a mall is or why he would be interested in going. A dog park has rules, like stay off of the benches. Most restaurants have no-pet rules. The dog on a leash needs to be concerned that he's on a leash. He can get snagged on a door or step into a hole in the ground. He may get lost. He'll have to go potty at the car. He'll need clean water. He may even get distracted by other dogs in a park.

{"text": "), or doorknob (D) are all possible options for an object contained within a doorway, the placement of the doors suggest that the correct choice must be E: doorway. \n4. This is because the doors are located towards the middle of the doorway, which means that they must be contained within the doorway itself, as opposed to being something on a wall next to it or outside of it. \n5. Therefore, if you were to grab an object contained within a specific doorway, the most natural place to grab it would be the doorway itself rather than the surrounding area. \n6. In other words, the correct choice is E: doorway, as it refers to the main structure of the doorway itself rather any of the surrounding details or objects.\nSo the final choice is E: door way.\n\nInput: Would a cat sleep on top of a bed or under the bed? Choices: \n1. A: yes, it doesn't matter 2. B: bed 3. C: blankets 4. D: bedsheets 5. E: carpet\nOutput: A cat would more likely sleep under the bed. Cats typically rest on the floor, and beds are placed on top of the floor. However, they don't like to sleep in the bed because they tend to claw the carpet.\nSo the final option is under the bed.\n\nInput: An ice cream cone is made of what? Choices:\n1. A: ice cubes\n2.

This eliminates the answers A, and B, narrowing the options down to C and E. \n5. An opening door doesn't physically allow the object to be grasped by the door's structure. The 'contained' in the question implies that the object must physically be within the doorway's structure.\n6. However, the object may still be available 'contained' in a doorway, for example, behind a closed door. \n7. Therefore, this scenario leaves us with choice C: within the doorway, as the object could be retrieved within the doorway' structure. \n8.

{"text": "), and a door knob (D) aren't a problem, the \"doorway\" (E) is wrong because it's the whole building that contains something (an object is not a whole thing), not a doorway or its components.\n4. Option E is incorrect. \n5. Therefore, it must be one of the three other options. \n6. The choice between A, B and C is difficult to make without additional context. \n7. The choice between A and C is likely correct because it's a structure that is not open to the weather; it's closed (has a door), while the other two are in the open.\n8. If the structure is closed, then the only objects in the doorway would be a door (D) or a door knob (B). \n9. Therefore the answer would be A.\nSo the final answers are A: Door C: Doorknob\n\nInput: Which of these words goes with the pictures if a person is going in? Choices:  I. front door A. exit B. front doorway C. entry D. back door E. front Egress\nOutput: 1) The question asks for an accurate identification of the related word with respect to four pictures presented. \n2) The given choice are as follows: I. 'front door', A. 'exit', B. 'front door way', C. 'entry' and D. 'back door'. \n3) The first picture depicts a person leaving a structure (building) by an exit. Only A is the right choice here. \n4) The second picture indicates a person entering a structure through a door. Options C and B are wrong because the person depicted isn't entering the structure; instead, she is walking through the doorway. \n5) The third picture shows a person in front of a doorway. 6) The fourth picture shows a person in a structure's front door. Again, B, C and D do not have the correct association here because they suggest the door being closed or in use. 'Back door' isn't a relevant word here. \n6) Looking just at the first and third pictures, there's no particular word that can be used to describe the two pictures. \n7) However, in the third and fourth pictures, we can determine that the person in the third picture is entering", "answer": "A: perfume"}
{"text": "), doorknob (D), or doorway (E) could all contain an object, option D is specifically mentioned in that the 'doorknob' is not specified as another object or as another form of the doorknob. \n4. We can eliminate other options because of the word 'contained'. Doors require the doorknob to be operational. Control panels require buttons to be pushed. And televisions require the control panel to be present.\n5. Therefore option D: doorknobs or doorway are the correct answer, however, option D: doorkns might be more apt as it specifies that the doorknob is part of the doorway.\nSo the final answe is D: doorway\n\nInput: Where does a bird sit?

No birds sit in bushes or trees close to the ground. 2 is incorrect.\n3. The bird sits in the open fields in the wind and no place else.\n4. A bird sits in any of the items mentioned. Any of the items mentioned in choice 4 is a possible answer.\nSo the final answ is 1. The bird sits only in high trees high up.\n\nInput: I like reading where it is a nice place to have coffee where?

So the answer is C: in the home.\n\nInput: The lady is talking with a man that loves to cook what? Choices: A. Food B. Family. C. Cats D. Horses. E.

{"text": "), and the doorknob (D) may all be located within the doorway, they don't directly answer our question, hence they are all incorrect.\n4. The doorway object contained within the doorway has to be an independently existing object, which means that the object must be contained by a different doorway, one that is distinct from the doorway that contains this object.\n5. This conclusion leaves us with only choice E: doorway, which implies that you would grab the doorway object contained within another doorway.\n6. Therefore, option E: doorway is the correct answer.\nSo the final answered should be E: doorway.\n\nInput: You will only need one set of directions to get where you're going if you're.? Choices:  A) In a city B) on a city street C) in the suburbs D) on the road E) traveling on the road\nOutput: Answer: C - In the suburbs, road: If you are walking in the suburbs, you can't just rely on the directions on the road. There will be buildings, other animals, people, etc. that will interfere with your path, making your progress slower and more complicated.\nIn the city, there isn't much that could stop you from getting where you're going. So, the shortest path is the best path. On a city street, we can see that it could be blocked by buildings interfering with your path. In other words, the path may not be a simple line connecting two points.\nTraveling on the road: Traveling on the road would be ideal where there's no traffic, no accidents, etc. You would be able to move as fast as you like to get to the other side. If the street had a lot of traffic, you could follow the directions like walking along the road. However, this would mean that you'd be taking much longer to get to the other\nSo the final answer should be C - In the suburb, because if you're traveling in the suburb. it is very slow due to the obstacles in the environment that might be hard to cross.\n\nInput: Who is the best candidate from this group of people to perform the task requested?

This is because of the placement of the object inside the doorway which is located somewhere along the doorway, so the door must also be included. \n6. Furthermore, there cannot be more than one doorway - that is, doors cannot be separate. \n7. Therefore, there is only one doorway that contains the object mentioned in the question, making AE the answer.\nSo the final answers are A and E: doorway.\n\nInput: Which country would a dog be on the menu of?

Looking at the given options, option D 'Russia' does not have 'dog on its menu' as we are told that a dog's menu in Russia would include the dog itself.\n3. This leaves us with having to choose between options C, B and E, as all of these options clearly do include dogs on their menus.\n4. Option B Japan has no animals on its menus, while option C England only includes fish on its menus.\n5. This leaves with E: France, given that a dog is an animal and most French people eat meat.\nSo the final country from the given set of options is E: France\n\nInput: If a man were making a paper boat out of stiff card, what would he add?

Choices:  B: not eating fast food C: eat in the car D: arrive early\nOutput: 1: The question states that there are ways to prepare before entering a place that offers some form of healthy food.\n2: The question does not provide further information about these methods.\n3: Let's analyze the given choices.\n4: Options C, A: Eating in a car and arriving early do not prepare you to enter a place that offers healthier options.\n5: Option D: eating in the car is eating in an auto, which offers healthy options. However, this does not require being prepared to enter a place offering something healthy.\n6: Therefore, the only option that could be the correct answer is B: Not eating fast food.\nSo a conclusion is that the final answer is B, is: not eating fast \n\n## Question 7\nInput: What can we find at a place where the price is different?

{"text": ") and doorknob (E) are possible places where you could grab an object, they are not actually contained by a doorway instead, they are a separate structure that doesn't necessarily have to contain objects or people.\n4. Choices D'doorknob' and A'television' require objects to be grabbed by hand, which is inapplicable since the question specifies that the location must contain objects.\n5. Looking again at A'television' and B'control panel', both of these are objects inside the doorway, so they can't be chosen as the correct location.\n6. Looking again at option C'opening doors', we notice that although it's an object that's present within the doorway, it cannot be grabbed to pick up anything, therefore making it ineligible.\n7. The two remaining options here are A'television' (which is inapplicable) and E'doorway'.\n8. Since option E'doorway' mentions both the object and 'contained by' which we have established must be present in the correct answer, it is most likely that the correct choice should be E'doorway'. \n9. Thus, the answer is E: doorway. \nSo the final answer would be E: doorway\n\nInput: What can be used to light up a cave?

{"text": "), or doorknob (D) could all reasonably be located inside a doorframe or doorjamb, the choice that describes a door in the best way possible is E: doorway.\n4. There're many potential objects that could be located inside a doorway. A door is typically placed in the entrance of a room and serves as a barrier/barrierless exit/entrance to the building.\n5. Additionally, doors are typically used for security and to separate one space from another.\n6. A door can provide you access to a whole different room (space) and it can also be a way of keeping something within a certain space (e.g. a door prevents people from entering the area behind it when it is locked). \n7. Therefore, this makes the choice which answers the question best E: doorway. \n8. So, the final answer is E : doorway.", "answer": "C: hockey game"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) are all possible elements to 'contain' a thing, the question asked where you would 'grab' the object, implying that the object is not just something that is contained but also something that is accessible.\n4. 'Grabbing' is not a plausible action for any of the options described in the choices, with the exception of door (E). This is a logical extension as someone could grab objects they find inside the doorway while simultaneously opening or closing the door.\n5. The answer, therefore, is C: opening doors. \n6. This means the object could be inside a purse under the door before you close the doorway, or on a shelf inside the doorway.\nSo the final choice is C: Opening Doors \n\nInput: What is a place to spend the night, if you must be dry? Choices:  a) a tent b) dry c) sleep d) wet\nOutput: 1) What is a place to stay overnight? \n2) The question asks where one would stay if they wanted to be dry, but the given choices don't necessarily convey that sense of dryness; the words 'wet' or 'dry' aren't stated in the choices.\n3) Looking closely at the words used in the given choices, options a) 'a tent', b) 'dry', c)'sleep', and d) 'wet', it can be inferred that they are not ideal places to be dry as they do not involve being indoors.\n4) This leaves us with only one applicable choice of C) Sleep, as this is the sole choice that could be considered an extension of sleeping in which one would not be wet or dry.\n5) Based on this logic, we can say that the correct answer to this question is C) Sleep.", "answer": "E: control"}
{"text": "), doorknob (D), and doorway (E) could all be considered a part of various doorways, it is clear that the object is in the doorway and not outside.\n4. Choices A, B & D do not specifically indicate the part of the doorway to which the object is 'contained by'. Therefore, they cannot be considered correct responses. \n5. Hence, the most appropriate response is E: doorway.\nSo the final solution to \"Where would you grab an object that is contained by a doorway?\" is E: doorway\n\nInput: Who made the sandwich that I ate?

C: have them for a snack 4. D: give them 5. E: be generous\nOutput: 1.- A: eat them is incorrect because: 1) You can't buy peanuts just to eat them and 2) It's not necessary to mention eating in the same context as buying. \n2. B: make someones happy is incorrect because you can't make someone happy buying peanuts. You could, but that's not the specific intention expressed in the question.\n3. C: have it as a snack can't be the answer because you don't buy something to have it as a snacks, you prepare it in advance or buy a store-bought item.\n4. D: give someone doesn't explain how you could buy those peanuts. That's what you do: give something away.\n5. E: bee generous could apply, but it sounds more like giving them away and doesn't specify buying them.\n6. Therefore, A: eat them is the best answer.\nSo the final answre is A: eat them\n\nInput: A good place to hide a kitten is where?

Choices: 1 A: in front of. 2: behind the car. 3: at a distance. 4: not sure 5: behind 6: walk by car.\nOutput: 1: The question is asking if a person wants to get from a store to another store quicker, what should he do; he should either walk in front of or follow behind a car. 2: Walking in front of a car, and walking behind a car are both possible methods that a person could use to reach the store quickly if a car is around. 3: If there are two stores, there would be no need to walk in the middle between them. 4: Not sure/none of the above is the most appropriate answer. 5: walking behind a car is the most preferred way to reach the store quick. 6: the question does not contain information about the 'other store'\nSo the final answer here would be C: walking behind the car or D: walk at a close distance\n\nInput: What is it called when you drive in an automobile, especially at night? Choices: A: steering B: street C: traffic D: freeway E: parking\n\nOutput: 1 B: Steer: v. Move in an intended direction by turning the front wheels of a motor vehicle. Choices: 1. A: steering is not the most appropriate answer. It is just an action that happens in an automobile. \n2. C: Traffic and D: Freeway are too broad; they can't be specific to just an automobile. 3. E: Parking is not a very common practice, especially at night. So it is likely to be incorrect for the question.\n4.

Choices:  A. play music B. play baseball C. have a meal D. have a talk E. do anything\nOutput: 1) \"The use of \"it is difficult\" and \"will\" implies that we are discussing the future. \n2. Since the question is worded in past-tense, it means the action has already happened and we are in the present. The past tense word \"was\" is not used. \n3. Therefore, we know that the action of the question is in the present (it is happening right now). \n4. Since we know the situation has not already happened, we must determine what is happening at the present time.\n5. To understand what kind of activity is happening, we look at the present tense word \"are\", which helps us to understand which activity is happening. \n6. That indicates \"having fun\" is the present action. \n7. The question gives a hint as to what one will do when one is having fun- it is impossible to know. \n8. By this time, all other activities are complete. \n9. To understand what kind fun is, we look at \"out-door\" which is describing where they are having fun: it is outdoors. \n10. To understand which part of having fun is being described, we look at the prepositional phrase \"it is difficult to\" which begins with \"to\" suggesting that the activity we are describing is directly related to the verb \"determine\" because it follows the verb \"do\". \n11. By combining the information we have gathered through out this process we know that we are describing what one does to determine fun. \n12. Since the question states what one will do, we must assume the verb for the sentence will be \"do\". \nThat leaves us with the answer \"do anything\".\n\nInput: Who would work from home? Choices: 1.

Doorknobs are not a common option for grabbing objects in doors, and they do not have the same function as the actual door. \n4. Doors (C) and doorways (E) together allow us to determine that we would place our hands on the door surface to reach things contained within the door, rather than searching for other suitable options like door openings or a doorknob.\n5. Therefore the correct answer is E: doorway \nSo the final answer  is E : doorway\n\nInput: If the question, \"do you know?\" was asked of a student, what response would the student give to indicate that they knew the answer?

E: \"yes, I know something\".\nOutput: For this question, the answers that are correct are either a Yes or No depending on whether or not they know the question. \nIf they don't know the question, they will respond with something close to \"I don't know\", but this doesn't work for all types of questions.\nA: \"Maybe\" is not the right answer because it shows uncertainty. \nB: \"Oh yeah?\" has no relation to whether or not they know and should not be chosen. \nC: \"Maybe not\" means that they do know, but that answer does not show whether or not they know.\nD: \"Yes, sort of\" does not accurately reflect whether or not the student knows the answer.\nE: \"Yes, I know something\" is a valid answer and one of the few that can truly say whether the student knows if they know the answer. \nSo E: \"Yes, I Know Something\" should be the right answer choice.", "answer": "C: chicken"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) could all be 'contained by' a doorway, they could all be considered independent objects from the doorway and thus, not the correct response of choice.\n4. However, the option of an 'object' being 'contained by' the doorway does not necessarily relate to the overall shape or size of an object, but rather to its physical relationship with the doorway. \n5. Therefore, E: doorway is the correct response because the object is physically attached to this part of the doorway.\n6. So the final answer is E. doorway\n\nInput: Mary thought the weather was bad outside, and she wanted to stay home to avoid how it affected some people. What do you call someone who wants to get back outside? Choices:  person B: weather C: person who wants to get outside to go outside D: person who wants to go back outside E: person who wants to avoid going outside\nOutput: 1.) The weather that is affecting some people is an outside situation. \n2.) The question asks what to call a person who is not affected by the outside conditions and wants to go outside.\n3.) We know that Mary does not want to go outside, and she wants to avoid the outside because that could cause her harm. \n4.) Therefore, the correct answer choice is C: person who wants go outside. \n5.) So the final answer is C. person who wants go outside\n\nInput: The new store has an unusual doorway, where are they?

Looking at all the given choices based on the context in the question and what we know about man, he is attempting to remove something from truck. \n3. We know that man was carrying something that was too big for him to carry it in the palm of his hand. Therefore, we can eliminate choices A: A cup and B: Dishes as both are things that can be carried in a single hand that would be considered too small. \n4. We can also eliminate choice C: Counter top as it is in the wrong place and wrong dimension to serve as a good place for man to attempt to remove his big thing from the truck.\n5. Therefore we are left with choice D: Truck and choice E: Table.\n\n6.) Consider for example choice E: Table. A man trying to remove a table from a truck would make no sense at all. Hence table can also be eliminated. \n\n7.) Now it comes down to man trying to remove something from trucky. If the man is trying to remove something from his own truck he would not carry it in another truck. Hence we are narrowed down to one choice only and that choice is the correct response. \n\n8.)

{"text": "), and doorknob (D) can fit this specification, a doorway (E), by definition, is just a horizontal division between two spaces. Thus, option E would not be the correct response.\n4. That leaves us with two options, A and B. Looking at option A, a television is a fairly large object and it wouldn't be suitable to place on a doorway, rendering this option incorrect. This allows us to eliminate option A and focus on only option B. Considering that the doorway is already at an indoor location, the control panel (B) is a reasonable answer choice and the most appropriate choice according to that context for an object being \"grabbed\" by a doorway.\n5. Therefore option B is considered correct as the preferred answer.\nSo the final response is B: control panel\n\nInput: When would the boss make sure that employees are paying attention at work? Choices:  a. During a work presentation b. During business calls c. After a work presentation d. When the boss has an idea e. While the boss is at work\nOutput: 1) The boss does indeed make sure that employees are following a business presentation or participate in it, but they don't exactly have a presentation per se, but it doesn't make sense for the audience if they were not attending. \n2. As such, the choice (a) can't be the answer. \n\n3. Options b and c can be the answer. The way to differentiate between both of them is looking at choice c.\nIn boss' day(1), boss asks the employees to pay attention during the business call where they are being instructed to do something during the phone call. But the employees are expected to pay attention during the phone call. This means that boss is paying attention after the call.\n\n4. So, it's c, and employees are paying attention after the work presentation.\nSo from the question: When would the bosss make sure that employees are playing attention at work? Boss is in charge of a work presentation. So afterward, boss wants to make sure that the employees are paying attention.\n5. Therefore answer choice c is correct.\nSo the choice c is the correct answer for: When would the boshss make sure that employees pay attention to work? B: after work presentation.", "answer": "C: car show"}
{"text": "), door knob (D), or doorway (E) are all plausible locations for the object, option B control panel would not contain the object since it is more likely to be on the outside. \n4. In the given choices, option C opening doors would not contain the object either. It is an opening that leads from the outside to the inside, which means that it is more likely to have an object outside rather than inside. \n5. Therefore, option E doorway could contain the object inside it.\nSo the final objective is E: doorway.\n\nInput: You can do ____ in a library with computers, except ____.

Choices:  a) escaped b) was caught c) hid d) hid then escaped e) had babies\nOutput: 1: The cunning mouse found a way inside the house it was able to sneak inside safely while the homeowner was not around. \n2: The question asks when it's cunning mouse found a house \"hid\" it. \n3: Based on the description of the mouse's ability to sneak through safely and unnoticed, it's reasonable to believe the mouse hid itself to avoid being seen by the homeowner. \n4: The options to Hide (C) or Hide and Escape (E) are incorrect, as they involve actions that can't happen without the homeowner being present. The same goes for Caught (B). Even though hiding can in some situations be a prelude to escape, it's important that we first consider Hiding as its own action. \n5: The same goes for \"had babies\" (E). Baby mice are not born full-grown or ready to be parents; they are usually born blind and naked. \n6: Therefore, it's not possible for a cunning mouse to have babies when it sneaked inside the house. \n7: This leaves us with \"hid\" (D), hiding being the action. \n8: Therefore, the answer to this question is D: hid.\nSo the final choice is D: hid.", "answer": "B: ungulate"}

If the object is contained by the doorway, then it must be found within the structure of the building or doorway. \n6.

{"text": "), and doorknob (D) could technically be considered as objects contained by the doorway, they can fit the context of the question's statement \"I saw a man grab an object contained by the doorway and hold it for a moment\" only by their placement being within the doorway's structure.\n4. A television (A) can only be held for a moment if it is placed within the doorway' in which case we can consider A plausible answer. \n5. Control panel (B) can be considered too broad as it can contain a wide variety of functions and elements that may be contained by the doorway. \n6. The same can be said for option C 'opening doors'. \n7. It is implied by the context that the object is held for a moment, and the phrase 'within the doorway' suggests that the object's position cannot shift from within the doorway.  As a result, it is unlikely that B or C would be true interpretations of the given scenario.\n8. Therefore the correct answer to this question is D: doorknobs. \nOnly doorknobs are objects that can be found within the doorway' due to their position and that they are usually not far away from the doorframe. \nAlso, doorknobs usually are close enough to the doorframe in order to be grabbed with one hand.\n\nInput: What do you do if you run out of space for pens? Choices: \tA: throw them away B: buy cheaper pens C: buy more pens D: buy larger pens E: buy more desks\nOutput: 1.. In the question, the scenario given is 'running out of space for pens'.\n2. To run out of space for something does not make much sense unless there is more than one option for space.\n3. If the person has'more space for pens' such that, they could store more pens in the same space, it does not make sense to say 'you run out of space for the pens'.\n4. Assuming that there is only one space for pens, the options will apply to that particular space that needs more pens than it currently has.\n5.

A book title only\nOutput: 1) The given question asks about a cover, but not every book has a cover.\n2) A cover is generally used to protect the interior of the book.\n3) When we pick up a book to read, we often skip the cover and flip directly to the page we want.\n4) This implies that the book title and author's names (D) are very unlikely, because most people do not directly read the names on the covers.\n5) The title of the book (A) typically appears on the side of the book and doesn't necessarily need to be on the cover.\n6) The same applies to the page number (E).\n7) This leaves us with the book title and author name (C).\n8) The book's title (B) will also appear on the side of the books, along with the author name (C). However, the book name could also reside on the cover, so it is a plausible answer as well.\n9) The final choice we have to compare is the title (B) and the book title (C).\n10) The title is the subject of the book on its surface level, and not necessarily necessary for the book's functionality.\n11) On the other hand, the book title shows that the book may be a textbook in a school, whereas a textbook will always have the name of its author in addition to its book title.\n12) In summary, the book title is necessary for function, whereas only additional information of the book is necessary for its title.\n13) As a result, we are therefore left with choice B: the book's title.\n\nInput: A man has a car but doesn't have a driver's license", "answer": "B: fall asleep"}

Option B, box, is also ineligible as it would refer to a cat box instead of a \"box\".\n3. From a contextual standpoint, a cat would more likely be seen in a \"paw\".\n4. \"Trash\" and \"paws\" both make sense given the context, though \"trash\" is the most acceptable answer due to its close resemblance to something that could house a cat.\n5. Therefore the correct answer is D, trash.\nSo the final conclusion is D: trash\n\nInput: What makes a place, such as a home, look and feel different than a home in the eyes of visitors?

It's also important to note that choices A, B, C, and E all specify the same thing, namely, a 'TV', 'control panel', 'opening door' or 'doorknob' respectively, whereas D is an incompletely specified term, 'opening door', with no further details. \n5. Therefore, option D, 'doorknob', does not sufficiently specify the object within the given parameters and would be eliminated.\n6. We are now left with options A, B, C. All of those options imply movement, which contradicts the first sentence.\n7. It can be concluded that, the most appropriate answer is E: doorway. \nSo the final answer would be E: doorway", "answer": "C: intelligence"}

Choices:  C: dry and breezy day D: cold and chilly air E: damp and cloudy skies F: hot and sunny weather\nOutput: 1- The question asks the condition under which dust storms originate.\n2. We first eliminate 'cold' as the question talks only about 'dry hot air'.\n3. 'Dry hot air' doesn't necessarily mean sunny or the presence of sunshine but just the fact that it's hot, dry and dusty.\n4. 'Cold' is definitely eliminated, as this makes no sense at all in 'hot' 'dusty' conditions.\n5. 'Damp' is eliminated because the origin of dust storms has absolutely nothing to do with damp weather conditions in that scenario.\n6. 'Cloudy' also seems to rule out the origin of dust storm because dust storms need hot and dry conditions. This answer is eliminated also.\n7. 'Breezy day', although sounds fine to an untrained ear, is not the origin of dust storm; this is just a natural phenomena (wind) that dusty air is being swept by it. It can't be an origin of something.\n8. This leads us to the remaining one: 'dry hot' and 'hot dry'.\n9. Dry hot means dry, hot, warm, very hot days. This doesn't really answer the question.\n10. Hot dry indicates hot, dry conditions or dry, hot and dry conditions. These aren't weather conditions anymore.\n11. This leaves us, 'hot dry'\n12. And, since all the clues point out to dry conditions as a necessary cause for dust storms to occur, we can take hot dry for the origin of dust storm.\n13. Therefore, the right answer is 'hot dry'\nSo the final answer to the question \"what weather condition does dust storm originate\" is 'hot dry'.\n\nInput: What was the main motivation", "answer": "B: kentucky derby"}

The answer is option A: soda - this is because no one wants a soda if they want a drink to get drunk.\n2) Option B: non - alcohlic beer - this is incorrect because only a person under the minimum age (which is typically 21) or who wants to remain sober needs a non - alcoholic drink at a bar.\n3) Option C: vodka, in general, you could drink a vodka at a bar and call it a martini but you probably wouldn't have it as a vodka on its own.\n4) Option D: martini. A Martin could be served with vodka or could be non alcoholic itself.\n5) Option E: A cocktail could be a martini and could even have soda in is.\n\n6) The correct answer is option B: non - alcohoiic beer. \nSo the final answer option B: non-alcoholic beer\n\n### Instruction: Answer the following multiple choice question\nInput: Where would someone who is searching for something typically go?Choices: 1. a) downhill\n2. b) back to the street\n3. c) down the main road \n4. d) in the center of town\n5. e) in the middle of town\nOutput: The sentence asks where one would normally search\n\n   1.

Choices: 1. A cookie 2. A lunchbox B. A cookie 3. A bagel lunchbox C. No food bagel. D. A bagel-filled lunchbox.\nOutput: 1).

Choices:  C: sunsets D: fireflies E: nighttime F: cloudy days\nOutput: 1: The question is asking about the place where lighting often occurs at sunset.\n\n2. The question specifies that it's referring to Sun Sets thus we can eliminate B: fireflies.\n\n3. We can also eliminate A: clouds.\n\n4.

{"text": "), and doorknob (D) would all typically be located near a doorway in a room, all choices are still too broad. \n4. There must be a more specific option that applies to the context, and this option is option E: doorway. \n5. That makes option E the most fitting answer.\n6. Therefore, option E is the correct answer - you'd grab an object contained by the doorway by grabbing the doorway itself.\nSo the final correct answer is option E: door.\n\nInput: What place are you likely to find a reptile in the mountains? Choices: \n A: a river B: a zoo C: a beach D: a desert E: a waterfall\nOutput: 1) The question is asking where we are likely to find a reptaile in mountains. \n2) We analyze each option -\n2.1) Option A: A river means this location is too broad in terms of mountains, since there are mountain rivers all around the globe. In addition, desert reptiles may be found near rivers in particular, which eliminates option D. It is possible to find some species at beach, but it wouldn't make sense in the context of the question; thus this option is also not correct. \n2.2) Option B: As we can see, the question talks about a reptile living in a mountain in general, not in a zoo, so this choice does not apply. \n2.3) Option C: The desert (C): There can be desert reptiles living there or in the mountains. It is more likely that if we're in the mountains, we won't find desert reptiles there, and also there is always a possibility to go to the desert from the mountains. So this does not apply to the questions. \n2.4) Option E: As we can see in many films and books, the reptiles live near a waterfall. This is true, but here we're focusing on mountains, so option E is not correct.\n2.5) Therefore, option B is out of place here, and thus the correct answer is E: A waterfall.\nSo the final and correct answer is B: a waterfall.\n\nInput: Which of these is more important in a house - the dishes or the beds?

{"text": "), or door knob (D), could all plausibly be within a doorway, the given context strongly favours the idea of doorway (E) as the correct response.\n4. This becomes evident when examining the question in combination with the answer choices again. \n5. The question states where the object of interest should be located, with regards to the door. All the given choices are placed outside of the door.\n6. From this interpretation, the most logical answer choice is E: doorway, which should be placed inside the structure of the door.\nSo the final correct answer is E: doorway\n\nInput: Are dogs ever sick? Choices: 1. Yes B: No E: Of course C: Maybe D: Nope\nOutput: 1) The question asks if dogs will be sick.\n2) Options 'no' and 'nope' don't fit the grammar of a question, as they would be considered wrong answers.\n3) 'Dogs are never sick' means the author is excluding it as a valid response altogether.\n4) 'Dogs may be sick' would be an incorrect response since this implies they might be sick but haven't been or aren't at that exact moment.\n5) The only correct option is 'Yes', which states that dogs may be sick.\nSo the final answers is answer: yes", "answer": "C: snoring"}

The question asks \"what is the most likely reason\", which implies that there could be one or many reasons for walking.\n3. Based on this information, the question is narrowed to one reason. \n4. Looking at the given options, A: get new shoeshould be eliminated because it does not sound logical that the purpose of obtaining another pair of shoes would cause someone to walk, rather get in a car and drive.\n5. Option C: go to the gym can be eliminated because the purpose of going to the gym is usually to ride an exercise bike, run on a treadmill, use the gym equipment, or perform other activities that do not involve walking.\n6. Option D: to have a destination sounds reasonable for this question since, according to the information provided in the question, someone might walk to a destination for enjoyment.\n7. The only answer that sounds feasible is E: enjoyment.\nTherefore, enjoyment is the answer to this question \nSo the final answer for this question is E: enjoyment\n\nInput: Where a man or woman should not be found at is in the bed. Choices:  A:-doors B: bedroom C: door D: bed E: doorway\n Output:- 1. The key to solving this riddle is to understand the general meaning within the given context of the four options.\n2. A bed is normally not a public space, and therefore, one shouldn't find people sitting or standing on a bed.\n3. Option A: Doors, although possible within a room, does not make sense because if a man or woman were sitting, standing, or lying in the door, they likely would have had some difficulty in getting into the room.\n4. Option B: Bedroom has been eliminated", "answer": "D: big city"}

Pneumonia D. Doctor E. 75-year old F. 75-old G. Paperwork H. Emergency room\nOutput for this challenge: 1. From the clues in the paragraph, we learn that the narrative is about a 75-yearold lady who went to the hospital to see a doctor but accidentally ended up in the emergency room instead. \n2. The hospital has a receptionist who takes the lady's paper work and brings her to the emergency department, where she is finally diagnosed with pneumona.\n3. From the context clues we can figure out the right answer is C: Pneumonia.\nThe right answer is always the answer which is being used to describe or explain the narrative.", "answer": "C: ignorance"}

B: dirty clothes 3. C: good grades D: misbehavior 4. E: no homework\nOutput: 1.. The question is about potential ways a teacher might notice their students misbehaving.\n2. A teacher might suspect that their students are misbehaving if they show up to school with dirty clothes or bad mood, and a bad mood could be a sign of misbehavior before or after school.\n3. A teacher may not always get a good grade on assignments when they have actually been doing their homework, and thus good grades do not always signify that the student has been behaving. \n4. A teacher could not notice no homework without first looking through the students' homework assignments. \n5. While teachers could observe their students during the class, they may not consider the time outside of the classroom when students are considered out of their supervision.\n6. There is no clear answer to this question, but we can eliminate options B: dirty clothes, C: good grades, and D: misbehavior. \n7. Because the answer choice for B, dirty clothes is too broad and doesn't necessarily show misbehavior on the part of the student. A student could be misbehaving while not wearing dirty clothes, so this answer's relevance to this question is unclear.\n8. Students could be misbehaved before or after the school day, so this answer'ss relevance to the question is also unclear. We can also eliminate option D's significance as they are not strictly relevant to the scenario of misbehaving students.\n9. If the teacher doesn't notice students' homework, it may be because they never checked it or it's simply missed, and this can be confirmed on the assignment itself", "answer": "C: body armor"}

The doorway itself (E) is something that could contain something within.\n5. Option C: Opening Doors is the most likely answer since you would use opening doors to enter a doorway.  Option B: control panel - The control panel could be on a door or door knob but it doesn't have to be located there, it could be somewhere else.\n6. Option A: TV is not contained by a doorway, instead it stands on the ground. This would be used to enter a doorway if there is a shelf mounted on the doorway. \n7. Therefore, according to the question, the answer to the question must be doorway, which is indicated by option E.\nSo the final question is E: doorway\n\nInput: How would you ask a customer if they wish to have an ice-cream cone with no sprinkles or cherries?

D: Would you prefer having no cherries or no sprinkles in your ice-creams? 5. E: Would you prefer no cherries or no more sprinkles in your vanilla cone?\n\nOutput:  1. The question is stating that you would ask a customer \"with no sprinkles or\ncherries\" at the end of their ice cream cone, but we aren't supposed to give up and\nanswer what this person might prefer.\n\n   We then should know what the end of an ice cream cone means,\nwhich should be that it has been eaten, not a pile of ice cream. There is\nusually no such thing as an ice cream cone with a lot of it left. \n\n   Now let's look at the given choices and what they say at the end of a cone.\n\n    A: Would you prefer to have no sprinkles or have no cherries in your vanilla cone\n   B: Do you want the", "answer": "C: repair shop"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) are found inside a doorway, none of them is contained within it because they are separate from the doorway itself and independent of it.\n4. As the question specifies that the object must be 'contained by a doorway', these choices are inapplicable. \n5. Doorway itself is an independent object that can be found inside a doorway and is also contained within it. This makes it the only choice that fits the scenario.\n6. Hence, the most appropriate answer is E: doorway.\nSo the final  answer is E: door\n\nInput: Derek is a person that could be seen in an environment, but not in a setting.

The other choices can be ruled out as they either refer to items outside the structure of the door itself or are not within it.\nSo the final option is B: control panel\n\nInput: Where must you have a passport to go? Choices: 1) A: across the border B: around the world C: into the city D: on a trip\nOutput: 1.) This question is asking where you must have a passport to travel. \n2.) A passport is a document used to establish identity and nationality, and to show that a person who is traveling to another country is either a native or a permanent citizen of the country. \n3.) Therefore, according to the question, you need a passport to travel to another country outside of your own country. \n4.) Based on this understanding, the answer that best suits the context of this question is B: across the border.\nSo the final choice is 2.) B: across the border\n\nInput: Where have you seen a flag with 80 stars on it? Choices: 3.) Alaska State Flag\n 4.) Hawaii State Flag\n 5.) U.S. Federal Flag\n 6.)

S. on July 4th, 1960. \n3) Therefore, there have only been 50 U.S. states since July 4th,1960. Since that date, no other states have joined the union. \n4) So, it is most likely a U.S. state (a non-federal government) that the context mentions. This would exclude all federal flags and is narrowed down to six different state flags. These are listed in the choices as they are the only non-federal U.", "answer": "C: inspiration"}
{"text": "), or doorknob (E) could all be physically contained by a doorway, the answer (D) 'a doorknob' would be an incorrect response because that's specifically one type of doorknob that is contained by the doorway. \n4. Doorknobs are typically not a thing contained by a doorway as they serve as a means of opening a door independently of the doorway itself. This is unlike the other choices provided (TV, control panel, opening doors, etc.).\n5. Therefore, by ruling out these 4 choices, the answer that fits best would be D: doorknobs\nSo the final answer D: doorknobb", "answer": "B: office"}

The question asks you for what object does one put into a wall or a door. \n3. Out of all the given options, nail and doorknob are only plausible for a door. 4. As the question specifies the 'wall and a door' both nail and doorknock can not be considered 5. Bolt holds a door and door holds bolt 6.

Choices:   A: A barking dog doesn't bite B: A silent dog doesn't bark C: Dogs don't bite when they're barking D: A barking or silent dog doesn't bit E: A barking silent dog doesn't itter\nOutput: 1 & 2. The phrase 'A barking seldom bite', when read closely, is unintentionally self-contradicting i.e. the second half of the sentence is a negation to the first.\n3. However, this doesn't stop it from making sense grammatically.\n4. This phrasing can be broken down to: \n\n   - [A] [seldom] [bite]\n \n   - [barking] [dog] [doesn't] [bite] \n\n5. The question asks which of the following statements that are the interpretation of that phrase are true.\n6. Let's examine each of the options: \n\n  - Option A [A] [sildom] [bite]; doesn't indicate a barking dog doesn\u2019t bite when he's barking. \n  - Option B: [A] [silent] [dog] [bark]; implies that a dog will bark when he\u2019s silent, therefore this option is false.\n  - Option C [B] [barking] doesn't indicate a dog doesn\u2019t bark when he\u2019ll bark.\n  - Option D [B] [bite] doesn't indicate if a dog bites when he's bidding or not.\n  - Option E [B] [bait] doesn't imply that a dog doesn\u2019t bites when they don\u2019t bark.\n7. Therefore we know that options A,B and E are all false which", "answer": "A: humidifier"}

The question asks where you can find a variety of cranberry juice without any allergens (such as fruit) included that would be suitable for those who don't have fruit allergies.\n2.) If you have fruit allergies, you might think you could avoid cranberries. However, cranberries are not actually considered to be a fruit, but rather an edible, juicy, round seed pod. \n3.) It's likely that the person asking this question knows fruit, juice, and cranberries as terms that are interlinked. \n4.) Looking at the given choices that could be found in this situation is:\n    * A: tree- A fruit tree such as apple, peach, etc would likely contain fruit, making them not suitable for someone with fruit allergies. Although cranberries do not occur naturally on a tree, they can be grown as a crop in a garden.\n    * B: Cranberries- This is the most probable choice. While cranberries may occur in fruit mixtures or fruit juices in some circumstances, it's reasonable to assume that the question may be asking where one could find cranberries that are not mixed with any fruit. \n    * C: Wine- While wine could be made with cranberries being a primary ingredient, there wouldn't typically be fruit allergies associated with it, therefore this is not the correct answer choice.\n    * D: Water- There is a possibility that water could include certain chemicals that could cause a", "answer": "B: frustration"}

It indicates that a dog might need to be washed, which would mean following a proper washing procedure.\n3) The options given in the question involve some of the ways a dog could be washed.\n4) The first option suggests putting the dog on a table which wouldn't apply to a situation where a dog needs to be washed.\n5) The fifth option suggests filling his water bowl, which could potentially apply in the case where a dog needs to drink water after being washed.\n6) The second option suggests giving him medicine, which could potentially apply to a situation where the dog requires medication due to an ailment or injury.\n7) The last option suggests taking him for a walk, which implies that the dog requires exercise and isn't confined to an indoor location (such as a cage or house).\n8) This leaves us with only one option (option 3) which is properly filling a dog's water bowl.\nSo the final choice is 1) Proper: Fill his water dish.\n\nInput: What did Sally and Betty do to their baby chicken?

We're left to choose from options E: doorway, which is self-explanatory and B: control panel. \n6. A control panel would likely be attached to an item within the structure of a doorway, as they usually accompany electronic devices. \n7. We can eliminate options C: opening doors and D: doorknobs on that basis. \n8.

A rude person is generally considered to be unattractive in social situations. \n3. This conclusion can be derived from the fact that the term 'rude' implies lack of manners, politeness, and lack of respect. \n4. The given choices have the following attributes: \n\n   a) Honest (honest people are sometimes considered rude because of their straight-forward and blunt nature).\n   b) Powerful (powerful people can also be sometimes deemed rude due to their boisterous and arrogant nature).\n   c) Wealthy (wealthy people are sometimes perceived rudely if they are seen as arrogant or boasters due to their financial status).\n   d) Attractive (attractive people are rude if they are shown to be impolite or conceited).\n   e) Interesting (interesting people can be deemed rude, but not necessarily for the same reasons mentioned above).\n\n5.

{"text": "), door knob (D), doorway (E), or a book (F) could all potentially be contained in a doorway, it might become a bit more difficult to pull the object that was contained out of the doorway.\n4. In addition, all of these options might not fit the context of where you would grab an item in a doorway.\n5. Therefore the options that are most likely to fit the context and suit the question are \nOption F: Book and Option E: Doorway.\n6. Option F: Book also makes the most sense given that a doorway is primarily a structure to enter or exit a place, however a book wouldn't make much sense to be present within such a structure.\n7. Also, Option E: Door makes complete sense as an object contained within a doorway would obviously be in the doorway itself unless it were contained within the door (this option C: Opening Doors is incorrect).\n8. Therefore the most logical answer is option E: Doorway\n\n# Example 3\nInput: Where one would find an octopus? Choices:  I don't know A: ocean floor B: deep sea C: aquarium D: in water E: in salt water\nOutput: 1) The question is asking where the octopus would be most likely to be found?\n2) There are several places where an octopus might be found, but some of the options provided might not be the ideal choice (a) In ocean floor - The ocean floor does not typically have much plant and animal life, so this is not the ideal option, (b) In deep sea- an octopus is not usually found in deep sea ( c) In aquarium  - An aquarium has little or no moving water and typically only one octopus at a time so this also is not the ideal place. (c) In the water - This is also not an ideal place because most aquariums and other public places with octopuses have freshwater (not salty) but an octopus can survive in salt water. (d) In salt water- This is the most likely place to find an octopus. So, the answer is (D) in salt water.\nSo the final conclusion is D: in salt water.\n\nInput: The boss asked her, where were you, she told him in the park. Which of these park items did she have?

{"text": "), doorknob (D), and doorway (E) might all be contained by a doorway, in this case, the object being grabbed needs to be contained by the doorway.\n4. If the point of grabbing the object is to use it in a game of catch with someone, it makes more sense to have a catching mechanism within doorway. \n5. Thus, the answer must be B: Control panel. \n6. If the object were on top of the doorway rather than being found within it, you wouldn't be able to place your hand over the control panel of a video game console when attempting to grab it. \n7. Control panels are usually located in the living room, where you can catch a ball thrown from outside; they're not inside the doorway. While you might be able to catch a ball outside the doorway and use its control panel, it wouldn't be contained by the door.\n\nInput: What is a mundane way of saying your mother?

Looking at choices F: carrots, I: beans, J: broccoli, K: rice, and M: peas, we can eliminate options which do not use vegetables. \n4. Choice M: peas is not a vegetable, as its a type of legume. \n5. Choice F: carrots is not in the specified category of vegetable because it is not a salad ingredient. \n6. We can also eliminate choice J: broccoli and K: rice as they require some form of cooking, while the question asks for a vegetable that can be used as is. \n7. The only option remaining is choice I: beans, as they can be used without any cooking beforehand. \n8. Therefore, I: beans is the correct answer. \nSo the final answer I: beans", "answer": "D: carry people"}

This choice involves what type of communication? Choices: 1: written communication 2: oral communication 3: public speaking 4: visual communication\nOutput: 1, 4, 2, and 3 are all forms of communication, but the question asks for \"this choice\" of communication, where \"choice\" is an indication of more than one choice being in play.\n2. Based on this contextual clues, we can cross out written communication as there is more than one option provided for the communication method, and visual communication as there is more to choice than noticing visual cues.\n3. Oral communication can take place either by selecting a number by calling out, or by saying nothing, so we can cross it as well.\n4. The remaining options, public speaking and option 1, can indicate more than one choice. However, considering public speaking only involves multiple individuals, it cannot be the correct answer. \n1. This leaves us with option 2: oral Communication.\nSo the final choice is E: oral communication", "answer": "E: hands"}

When people brush their teeth daily, where do most toothbrushes reside? \n3. This is an everyday occurrence since children typically start brushing their teeth when they're 2-3 years old. \n4. Toothbrush use isn't limited to a few specific rooms or places, rather a person can be brushing their teeth in literally anywhere. A bedroom, a bathroom, a kitchen, while traveling, a car, etc... \n5. Options C: bedroom, and option D: dental office are incorrect as they are narrow in their descriptions. In order to describe where people keep these everyday items, you need to describe these places to include every possibility. \n6. This means that options B: bathrooms, and E: medicine cabinets fit the requirement of this question because they describe places where people have the option to keep their toothbrushes.\n7. Therefore the answer that satisfies the requirements best is that option E: medicine cabinets.\nSo the final answwe is E: medicine cabinets", "answer": "E: read book"}
{"text": ") and doorknob (E) could all be located within a doorway, they are not contained or surrounded by a doorway.\n4. The phrase 'doorway' by itself does not adequately describe the location - rather, it is a generic term for door entrances and exits. \n5. Thus, we eliminate all choices except choice D: Doorknob. \n6. Doorknobs are usually located centrally on top of a door and can be grabbed and used to easily access or exit a door. \n7. Therefore, choice D: Doorkno is the correct answer.\nSo the final answers is D: Doorknub\n\nInput: If you put a strap on a shopping cart, what would it do? Choices: 1. Become straight 2.

Become circular in shape\nOutput: 1) The question asks what will happen if a strap is put on a shopping cart 2) The term 'flat' does not have a specific geometric meaning, and is thus too vague \n3) The term'square-shaped' isn't descriptive enough, as it can equally apply to other geometric shapes. \n4) Option 7: 'round' is the most descriptive answer, as the word refers to any shape that is circular, such as a circle, sphere, ellipse and torus. \n5) Option 4:'square' applies to all squares, cubes, rectangles and other two-dimensional figures. \n6) Option 8: 'circular in shape' is not descriptive enough, as any other shape could be classified as circular. Only option 7: 'round'.\nSo the final answers are 7: Become circular, and 4: Become square-shapes\n\nInput: At many airports, the main part of the terminal is inside the air-conditioned building.

{"text": "), doorknob (D), or doorway (E) could be anywhere in the space enclosed by doorways, they must be contained by doorways to be relevant to this question. \n4. While looking at each of the options, option A: television is not necessarily contained by doorways since the television could be placed anywhere in the enclosed space and be independent of it in some contextual situations.\n5. Similarly, option B: Control panel could be anywhere on the door, on the wall somewhere nearby, etc. This is why it cannot be placed in the correct answer choice. \n6. However, option C: opening doors contains a word ( 'opening ') that implies that it's relative to a doorway, but it does not tell us specifically that it is contained by a doorway, thereby making this not a plausible answer for the question. \n7. In conclusion, we can eliminate options A, B, and C from the choices.\n8. Moving towards doors, and looking at option D: doorknobs, it can be possible for a doorknob to be contained by doorways, especially if the doorway is a door where it would be placed in the hinge, and if it is then that would make option D: doorknow the most plausible answer choice.\n9. Finally, with regards to the context clues and meaning of the question, option E: doorway is the only choice that would fully fit the criteria of 'contained by' as it is a doorway itself, so option E: doorway would be the correct answer. \nSo the final answer would be E: doorway.\n\nInput: What do all three questions have in common?

{"text": ") are not necessarily within the doorway, option D, the doorknob, is within the doorway, and E, the doorway, is obviously within the doorway itself.\n4. There is one other option: Option D, the doorknoob, is within the doorknob itself. The doorknoob is a small piece of wood or metal used to turn a lock or pull a door, therefore by grabbing it you could inadvertently grab the object contained within the doorway.\n5. This leaves us with answer E: doorway.\n6. You could not grab the object contained by the doorway unless the object was also within the doorway, e.g., a piece of furniture such as a chair or a sofa. \nSo the final answer this question would be E: doorway", "answer": "C: honest"}
{"text": ") and a doorknob (D) could all be considered to be 'contained' within a doorway structure, they are not contained 'by a door' therefore cannot be considered as correct answers to the question. \n4.

This would be more appropriate when making fresh cheese from milk. \n5- D: The milk carton also does not match the question. This would be appropriate for people going to get a gallon of milk but that's not what's being asked.\n6- B: At the grocery store is the correct answer. It refers to where a consumer typically goes to get their milk and fits within the context of the question.\nSo the final correct answer is B: At the grocer", "answer": "A: holding"}

'Opening doors' is also redundant as the opening refers to the space between two hinged door frames that form an opening when they are unhinged and swung open.  \n7. Moreover, 'Opening' does not contain the meaning of physical grasping or holding onto an object. \n8. Option C: 'control panel' is a misnomer; it is a group of buttons, switches, and digital displays that are situated on the front of the door frame and not contained within it.\n9. Option E: 'doorknob' could be understood as within the space of the doorway, thus an incorrect answer.\n10. Therefore, only option D: 'doorknobs' is the correct answer.\nSo the final answers are D: doorway and doorknobs\n\nInput: What do the first five numbers for the GEICO Gecko?

The correct answer choice is C - the first five digits in the phone number (89192). This answers C: 891-92.", "answer": "B: nodding"}
{"text": "), doorknob (D), and doorway (E) are all possible contained objects in a doorway, they generally are not part of the doorway itself.\n4. The option which is within the structure of the entire doorway and not of an individual part of it is E: doorway.\n5. Therefore the answer is E: doorway\nSo the final answer E: doorway\n\nInput: What was the outcome for two players who had a game of Monopoly? Choices: A: one left angry. B: one had more money C: were not satisfied D: were sad E: played a game of chess.\nOutput: 1: The question is asking us which answer reflects the proper outcome for two individuals that just finished playing a game of Monopol.\n2. We don't know enough from the context to assume who was the winner, the loser, or were they tied. \n3. It's up to us to decide which option is the proper outcome for each of these choices. \n4. Some of the options, like B: has more money, can't work because there is no specific person to attach the money too.\n5. Therefore we conclude the following: \n6. Choices B: one has more money and C: weren\u2019t satisfied is correct because the winner doesn't get angry about winning, unless they lose, and the other player is going to be upset because they are going to loose money.\n7. Option E: Played a game of chess doesn't directly relate to this either, but it can be added as an extra bit of information on the question.\n8. Option A: One left angry is not correct since they would likely need to do this AFTER the game is over and it's possible that the other person still has money or is being a good sport.\n9. Option D: Were sad is not an appropriate outcome either because as long as they don't get angry, they shouldn't be sad about it either.\n10. Therefore we can conclude that an appropriate outcome for two players that just finished playing a Monopoly game is B.\nSo the final conclusion is Monopoly.\n\nInput: Which is the most reasonable way to eat an animal, while still alive?

{"text": "), and door knob (D) could all be in a building and thus could be an object contained by a building's doorway, doorway itself (E) is not a structural component of a door, rather an opening or path that allows people and objects to pass through it.\n4. Therefore, the correct answer to this question is option E - doorway.\nSo the final answers is E: doorway\n\nInput: Which might I avoid in my work? Choices:  Choices: A: rush B: distractions C: lack of focus D: procrastination E: time\nOutput: 1: The question is asking which of the given options might I avoid in my professional work.\n2. We need to consider what work in this context may mean; likely professional work or work at the office rather than homework or a hobby.\n3. Options C and D, \"lack of focus\" and \"procrastination\" are possible distractions at work but they are not necessarily things we need to avoid.\n4. Option A \"rush\" could be avoided if you try to avoid distractions, but there's nothing that specifically prevents you from achieving your goals if you take your time and follow a structured approach.\n5. Option B \"distractions\" is the most relevant to office work, we can then eliminate option D \"lack of focus\".\n6. Choice E is \"time\" which can be used in many ways to achieve different outcomes and thus is not specifically related to \"avoiding rush or distractions.\"\n7. Option C \"focus\" is a possibility, but even the statement \"I would like to stay focused on my work today\" is used to describe things which are important to you and don't focus on staying out of distractions\n8. Therefore, we can narrow our choices to B: distractions and C: lack of focus and the most appropriate answer to that question would be \"C\".\nSo the final answer to this question is C: lack of focus.\nBut then question number 12 has \"What would I want less of in my work?\" So we need to change this answer to \"E: time\" and this can be confirmed in the answer to question number 12, the correct answer is \"B\" and not \"C\".\nInput: Where am I most likely find paper?", "answer": "A: strain"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) could all theoretically be within the area of the doorframe, the question is asking where you'd \"grab\" an object, indicating some kind of action.\n4. This means that option B: control panel is the most reasonable choice, as you could use your hands to open it if necessary.\n5. The same applies to option C: opening doors, however these would be an unlikely place to grab an object because they would be locked or secured. \n6. Option E is not the final answer because it's asking for a place where to grab, while the question is asking for an object within the doorway.\n7. Option F does not make sense as a question-answer pair because an object would not be 'grabbed by' the doorway.\n8. Therefore the final answer is B control panel.\nSo the final answers is B: control panel\n\nInput: When would you expect a man to use a mirror?

It is a common practice for men to groom in the morning and evening, typically using a toothbrush, razor, shaver, etc.\n3. This means they may use a mirror as part of their grooming routine.\n4. The key is to understand \"to watch tv\" does not fit the description\n5. Based on the given choices, the correct answer is a combination of X and X: in a malls ALEXZ.\n6. Based on the options, the correct answers are H: at night, Z: to watch tv and X: in a bathroom\n7. Therefore,", "answer": "B: large room"}
{"text": "), or a door knob (D) could all be contained by a doorway, none of these options are unique to a doorway.\n4. Looking at choice E: Doorway, we can see that it specifically refers to the object being contained by a doorway as it states \"where would you grab an object CONTAINED by a doorway?\" \n5. This makes E the most suitable choice as the correct answer.\nSo the final Answer is E: Doorway\n\nInput: Which would be considered the best? Choices: 1: Coffee 2: Beer 3: Soft drinks 4: Drink water 5: Paint E: What the people say\nOutput: 1: This is a classic idiomatic phrase that implies that water is the greatest thing to drink. The answer is 5: Paint. The questioner is suggesting an alternative, a bad argument for something that isn't true. The people who question this are idiots, who should be mocked not considered.\n2: Soft drinks are bad for your health. They are full of sugar and harmful chemicals. \n3: Beer is really bad for your health. It contains a lot of sugar, fat, and alcohol, all of which are bad for your health and make you fat. \n4: Drink water; water is the best thing to drink, better than anything else! \n5: Paint; painting your walls or windows is the best thing you could do to your house, it will make it look much better. \nInput: If you like a friend and they don\u2019t like you, who should you be friends with?

This option is supported by previous option - the door is a part of a doorway, which is where you would grab any object held within a doorway.\n6. Therefore, 'doorway' is the correct answer.\nSo the final awnswer is E: doorway\n\nInput: I was at the mall looking at clothes and saw a girl eating cotton candy. She asked me if I wanted some. Choices:  A::::  Yes, I want some. B:  No thanks, I'll pass. C:  What flavor? D:  No, I'm not interested. E:  Sure!\nOutput: 1) The question in the above task provides a scenario in which a girl offering a bowl of cotton candy to the speaker. \n2) One of the key aspects of this scenario is that the speaker saw the girl holding the bowl of cotton candies.\n3) So, the speaker would be responding from the premise that he already saw the girl with the bowl of cottton candy.\n4) Let's analyze choice C, What flavor?\n5) Choice C: What flavor? doesn't address the scenario, it is just a simple question that could be spoken in many situations.\n6) Another reason why option C: What flavor might not be the correct response is because the scenario doesn't specify if the speaker is interested in cotton candy in general or if he is interested in the specific flavor that was being proposed to him.\n7) Choice D, No, I'm Not Interested, doesn't really match the scenario as that doesn't indicate that the speaker is already aware of the girl holding a bowl of cotttton candy.\n8) The responses in the other options are all related to the situation at hand which is the girl offering cotton candy to him. The most appropriate response would be option A: Yes, I want some, since it is the most concise and clear answer given the context of the scenario.\n9) Based on these reasonings and analysis, the correct answer is A, Yes, I", "answer": "E: eyes opening"}
{"text": "), and 'doorknob (D) could be held or grabbed. If you were standing within the door frame, then none of these options would be applicable to the scenario described.\n4. To make this question easier, let's imagine that you are physically inside the door frame, and this is the way the door frame is structured to allow you to hold or grab an object.\n5. We can eliminate D: doorknobs as doorknobs are not large, and holding a small object like a doorknob and then grabbing an object in the doorway would be very difficult.\n6. Choice C: open doors would be applicable to someone who is already outside the door frame structure holding open a door.\n7. Choicing E: doorway is too broad of an answer, and we can make a similar structure for our situation by imagining a small area within the door frame where objects could be grabbed.\n8. Therefore A: television stands out as the best-suited answer.\nSo the final is A: television.\n\nInput: The woman is afraid of what, her boyfriend? Choices:  I: dog II: monster III: bird IV: man V: tree VI: snake\nOutput: 1-In the original text\nA woman is afraid of what kind of man can make you cry?\n\n2-The context clues and key words provided indicate that the woman is asking the question out of concern for herself. She is afraid of'man' and not specifically fearful of her 'boyfriend'.\n3. The options provided do not suggest that a specific man could make her cry, but their association with the word'man' does.\n4. The options provide some sort of physical evidence that would make the woman afraid.\n5. Eliminating options I: Dog, II: Monster, and IV: Man, the only available answer is choice B: 'What kind of man?' which is the best answer in context.\n6. We can further narrow this answer to V: Man as the woman is more likely fearful of a man than any other entity.\nSo the final answers are B: What kind of man, C: Man, D: Man\n\nInput: Where do you find the most books?

{"text": "), doorknob (D), and doorway (E) all are found within a doorframe structure, the correct answer is chosen from them according to the context clues provided within the question itself. \n4. Choice A: television is a plausible option but it would be more likely to be an object used for security rather than for convenience. \n5. Choice B: control panel is also unlikely as it implies that a door would be in a more technical setting where a control panel would be needed to operate it, which does not fit with the context of the question. \n6. Choice C: opening doors indicates the presence of other doors that could be used as an alternative to reaching an object within a doorframe.\n7. Choice D: doorknobs are commonly used for opening doors; they are found in nearly every house and can be an object that's easily grabbed within a doorframe setup.\n8. Choice E: doorway is unlikely to contain any objects that can be grabbed because it is just a passageway to move through. \n9. Option B, Control panels can be seen as containing objects. But since there is no control panel in the question, choice A is selected.  \n10. Therefore, the answer would be B: control panel\nSo the final answer b A control panel\n\nInput: What can be done to a honeybee to remove all of the stings that it can inflict upon an individual? Choices:  a: sting someone B: remove honey C: kill bees D: chop off wings E: cut bees\nOutput: \nThe question \"What can be done to a (single) honeybee to completely prevent it from inflicting stings on someone who wishes to swat the bee?\" has an incorrect answer of A: Sting someone. \n\nA single honeybee can sting more than one, while only one person may swat a single honeybee. Stinging is the main means of defense for honey bees, and removing a honeybee\u2019s stinger (to prevent it from sucking out the victim\u2019s blood) will leave the bee severely wounded and unable to fly or continue being a pest. \n\n\nThe answer then is E: Cut bees.\n\n\nThe answer is then", "answer": "A: zoo"}

Choices:  True or False True False\nOutput: 1. The question is asking what the most appropriate response is to the given situation. \n2. The police officer was able apprehend the murder, in this case yes, the information he was given, no. \n3. This means the correct response is False. \n4. For this type of questions, it's important not to get stuck on the 'did he?' part of the question and focus only on the 'apprehend the murderer?' part instead. \n5. Therefore, it is FALSE. \nSo the final incorrect answer is False.\n\nInput: The cat and the dog was the most intelligent of all the animals Choices:  A dog B A cat C A dog C A dog\nOutput: 1 We can eliminate A cat. We know that if the dog and cat were both intelligent, that would mean the dog and the cat are both equally intelligent.\n2. If we look at the second part of the choice, if the dog and cat are both intelligent, then this would mean the cat cannot be the most intelligent, and therefore we can eliminate C again.\n3. Eliminating the choice A cat, we cannot use the elimination rule on itself, and so we must ask ourselves the next logical question, is the dog the most intelligent animal?\n4. The dog is the most intelligent as it can use logic to figure out that A cat = A dog + 1, \n5. In terms of the statement made when this was used. \nA cat (A) is the most intelligent, however, dogs (B) are intelligent. Therefore, the correct choice is A cat. \nSo the correct answer is A cat.\n\nInput: If not, where did the dog decide to get rid of the cat after a short period of time?

{"text": ") and doorknob (D) could all be within the confines of the doorway, the word 'contained' implies that their location must be inside the doorway rather than outside of it.\n4. The object (doorway) must be on one end of the selection and cannot overlap the selection.\n5. A doorway also contains the structure of a doorway. So A or D are correct answers.\n6.

C: copper coil 4. D: brass plate 5. E: steel wire\nOutput: 1, 3 - metal plates and copper coils are examples of what we might put inside a doorbell.\n2. Electric wires would not be inside the doorbell.\n5. Brass plate would not be inside a doorbell. It would be inside a doorknob.\n\nInput: Which type of animal has legs that grow longer as they reach adulthood? Choices: 6. A: bullfrog 7. b: lobster 8. C: snake 9. chameleon \nOutput: 9.

Choices:  Liquids always occupy space (which is incorrect). A: it has weight B: cannot be compressed C: moves if poured D: floats E: mixes with other liquids F: cannot be stretched\nOutput: 1.-1.The question is asking how you can tell if something is a 'liquid' so:\n\n2.- The first step is to determine if this is a scientific or general question. In this case, it should be a general question, meaning it does not require any background knowledge or specific terms to understand.\n3.- In this case, the context clues provided by the question and the options given are all about liquids.\n4.- Let's analyze the options provided:\n\n   - Option A has two inaccurate premises.\n     - It says 'the first requirement' for a something to be a liquid is that 'it has a specific weight'. We can say that, as liquids always occupy space and have their own volume (measured in units like milliliters), the fact that they have weight would also be true.\n     - It also claims that 'the object exists at the space it occupies' which is not necessarily possible for liquids. For example, water cannot exactly fit at its place.\n \n    - Option B has both false concepts in it.\n     - It claims that 'liquids cannot be compressed' so, what they are saying is that something is actually being compressed when it is compressed, which makes no sense.\n     - Liquids can be compressed with high pressure or heat, just like any other substance. If you put one liter of water in a one-liter bottle and close the lid of the bottle, you would be compressing that volume of water.\n \n    Option C is accurate\n \n    Option D is generally inaccurate, because even nonliquids can float on water.\n \n   The best answer to this is B: \"does not mix with other elements\". It is the only answer that", "answer": "D: television"}
{"text": "), and door knob (D) could all be located within a doorway, they are not limited to a doorway, so they wouldn't fit the context of this question.\n4. 'Doorway' (E) is a structure that contains an opening into which we can insert a door.\n5. Since we are talking about picking things from doorways, it could be relevant to locate one's possessions within the doorway. Items which could possibly fit this description would be keys, smartphones, or other personal objects that are often placed where one can'see' them without really accessing them.\n6. In conclusion, the choice which fits the context most closely is B: control panel, as these are objects which are used to 'open' doors and are contained by the doorway, therefore answering the question.\nSo the final choice is A: control panel.\n\nInput: What isn't a person supposed to buy in an electronics store? Choices:  a) television b) control panel c) opening doors d) doorknob e) doorway\nOutput: Answer a is television because, as with other items, the context of the question suggests that a television is something you buy, not something you find in a store. \nSimilarly for answers b and c, which do not fit the context of this example.\nAnswer d is doorknob because it\u2019s the door that allows you to enter the store. \nFinally, option e is a doorway, which you\u2019re trying to enter into, not leave.\nSo the final option is e: doorway.\n\nInput: While doing errands, what does one not do? Choices: 1. Go home 2. Stay put 3. Drive around 4. Pick up laundry 5. Use money\nOutput: While doing errands in a place like a grocery store, one doesn't drive around. This isn't an activity that one does while running errands. \nIn answer choice 2, the sentence that one chooses to ignore isn't the focus of the question, so it's not something that one doesn't do during errands. \nIt's safe to assume that while doing errands, one doesn't use money in a place like a checkout lane, so the answer choice is B: stay put.\n\nInput", "answer": "D: business sector"}
{"text": "), doorknob (D), or a doorway (E) could be used by someone to grab an object from somewhere outside a doorway, this is not what is being described in the question. \n4. For example, if the object is an umbrella, you cannot grab it if it is sitting on the table in the living room outside of a doorway.\n5. Since the TV (A), control panel(B), opening doors (D) don't fall under the'structure of the doorway' we can eliminate those from our answer choices.\n6. It is also possible that the person is searching for the object in the doorway. \n7. For example, if they are trying to get a key out of their pocket and find it at the bottom of a purse.\n8. Looking at A: doorway, B: doorknob, and E: doorway, all three of these answers are possible.\n9. However, A: doorway is the most specific to the question since this is the only answer that does not require the object to be within the structure of a doorway. 10. For an object to be located within a doorway would need to fit tightly within the structure (A), or could be considered a doorway feature (E). \n11. It could fit into (B, C) as well, but these are not the main ideas being expressed in the question (the structure of the doorway is, instead.) \n12. Therefore, the best fit is A: doorway. \n13. So, the final answer is A. \n\nInput: If someone bought a new hat and a new sweater, what season would it be? Choices:  * A: Spring  * B: Summer\nOutput: 1) The sentence implies that the seasons are in the past when someone bought something.\n2) The person already has a hat and a sweater, hence would not be buying a new one. \n3) Since hat and sweater were used as descriptors to indicate winter, it must be spring or summer or fall.\n4) We can eliminate fall, as hat and sweater don't really relate to fall weather. So, all that we have is spring and summer.\n5) The answer that makes most sense is B: summer. That's because it's the season when most people", "answer": "A: loss of heat"}

Option D - doorknob, is a plausible answer, as it implies you can grab an object in that location, however, from the choice options, the given prompt gives more contextual clues implying that the given object must be contained by a door or doorway.\n5. Therefore the most fitting response for this input is B: control panel.\nSo the final choice is B: control panel\n\nInput: Which food group does the fruit orange belong to? Choices: 1. A: vegetable 2. B: fruit 3. C: nut 4. D: candy 5. E: none\nOutput: 1.'orange' is a fruit and not a vegetable.\n2. 'berry' is a type of fruit (fruit contains berry, berry also contains orange)\n3. 'nuts' are a type of food (food contains nuts, nuts also contain orange)\n4. 'candy' is a category that would contain orange if it were not a fruit.\n5. 'none' is an invalid choice, because 'b' and 'c' are both food categories containing orange (fruit or berries), hence 'none' is excluded, by implication.\n6. Therefore, it's clear the answer is B: fruit.\nSo the final option is B: fruit\n\nInput: How soon before the flight is the hotel supposed to be packed up? Choices: 7. A: immediately B: as soon as C: by the time the plane lands D: before the plane lands E: after the plane lands\nOutput: The question implies that the flight's arrival time affects the timeline for packing up the hotel.\n\n7. 'packed up' implies that the hotel staff need to make preparations for the hotel's departure.  So the timeline implied by choice D 'before the plane lands' is not acceptable as the preparations for the airport departure must happen once the room has been vacated.\n8. 'as soon as' and 'immediately' are the only choices that consider a timeline and are plausible.\n9", "answer": "D: take money"}
{"text": "), and doorway itself (E) are contained by a door, it is unlikely that the question refers to them. \n4. This observation leaves two choices: D: doorknobs and B: control panel. \n5. D: doorknobreason because the word 'knob' implies a specific structure on a door. \n6. In contrast, B: control panelis unlikely because it does not refer to a specific object that is a door-related item to be grabbed and used.\n7. Therefore. the answer is C: opening doors.\nSo the final solution is C: opening doors\n\nInput: What could make a place seem like home? Choices: 1. A: smell 2. B: sound 3. C: feel 4. D: taste E: love\nOutput: 1: The question asks \"what would make a place seem like a home?\" 2. The phrase'seem like home' implies something that is different from actual home. \n3. This suggests that any item in a place could make it seem like a person's home, not necessarily a home. \n4. In contrast to the notion of 'home' that refers to an independent property, the concept of 'home' could be different for individuals. \n5. This observation leads us to answer 3, 'Feel.' \n6. 'Feel' has a metaphorical connotation that refers to the sense of feeling like one belongs at a place. \n7. Feeling like one belongs to a place could be induced by a person's experience, as in 'I felt at home at my aunt's house,' \n\nInput: What doesn't change in the environment when it thaws outside? Choices: 4. A: temperature 5. B: atmosphere 6. C: weather 7. D: humidity 8. E: air\nOutput: 1.'Thaws outside' indicates that the environment is frozen and warming. \n2. There are multiple environmental factors and variables that are likely to change when an environment \nthaws; this makes the options in this question all valid and plausible. 3. It is difficult to distinguish between A: temperature, B: atmosphere, C: weather, \nD: humidity, and E: air because they are all environmental factors", "answer": "A: television"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) can all be considered as objects contained within a doorway, the word doorknob suggests that it is to be grasped to open the door and is not 'contained by' the doorway.\n4. Option E: Doorway does not directly mean that the object can be grabbed by a doorway, since the object is being grasped or taken by a person rather than by the doorway itself.\n5. So the final answer is A, \"television\". This is because an object within the doorway can be reached out and grabbed (television in the given scenario).\n\nInput: The carpenter would fix the house if it leaked from where?

There are multiple factors which are taken into consideration when the carpenter fixes the house in case a leak has been detected from any of the given places.\n1c. A carpenter will fix if there is water leaking from roof, B: roof.\n1d. A carpenter can also fix if there is water leakage from the hole in wall, C: hole in wall.\n1e. If the leakage is from a crack in ceiling then a carpenter can fix A: ceiling but in this case, if the leakage has come from roof then fixing ceiling may not be applicable.\n1f. Similarly, fixing the floor when there is leakage from it can also be effective as it may be easier to fix.\n1g. A leak in the pipe is less likely because it requires a bit more fixing.\n2. So the final answer would be the place which is the most feasible in fixing a leak and that is C.\nSo the final answers is C: hole in wall \n\nInput: I could not speak with my brother until I found out what?

Based on these interpretations, the most apt answer appears to be E.\n   5. However, we could also interpret the question to be asking for the object \"contained inside a doorway\" instead of \"contained by a doorway\". \n    6. This might give rise to other options such as C and D as the item might then be 'contained in' the opening doors or in the door itself as a doorknob.\n7. However, this approach should still point us to the conclusion that A (television) or E (doorway) is most suitable based on context clues because doors are typically more likely to contain an object than a control panel or opening doors.\n8. In conclusion, the most applicable answer is E: doorway.\nSo the final conclusion is E: doorway\n\nInput: An apple tastes delicious and sweet, which of the following is related to our taste buds?

C: America bakery. 4. D: American. 5. E: Italy bakery. 6. F: Italy.\nOutput: 1 \n\nThe answer is (B). France does not have \"the best\" bakers, since it's impossible to assign rank to every single person in a country. Each country has multiple bakers that range from \"the best\" to \"the worst\" in terms of quality.\n\n2 \n\nThe answer cannot be (D). America has too many bread shops to determine one \"best baker.\"\n\n3 \n\n(E) is incorrect because Italy bakeries are not located in Italy. This means that the best baker would be located inside an Italian bakery. However, an Italian bakery is not necessarily the \"the best\" in terms of providing baked goods.\n\n4 \n\n(F) is incorrect because Italy is an actual country, and it's where you will find the best bakers.\n\n5 \n (D) is incorrect, since France is a country and not a bakery.\n\n6 \n The correct response is (B). France has \"the best\" bakeries that could be the destination of bread addicts.", "answer": "D: street"}

Choices:  a: eat a snack b: drink some water c: think about what happened d: stay up all night e: turn on their phone for the last time\nOutput: 1: The question is about what people do before sleeping in order to rest. \n2. The phrase 'turn on the phone' is more related to switching it off, so C is incorrect.\n3. Although B 'drink some water' can be used as a pre-sleep ritual, the other options in this answer make it too broad.\n4.'stay up all night' is too unlikely a scenario for 'normally'.\n5. Option D can be eliminated as this activity would be a part of the night, rather than before/during sleep.\n6. The answer that is unlikely to be a part of the scenario is E answer: turn on their phone one last time.\n7.

The options A, B, and C could all qualify, though only control panel (B) seems to align well with the context.\n5. For the last option, (E), the word 'inside' would be a better option than 'contained' as it better indicates that the object is not independent but part of the object being contained.  \n6. Therefore, when you are choosing what object to use in case of an emergency, the safest option is C: 'control panel'.  \n7. The word contained by should give you a better sense of what part of the structure of the door is supposed to be contained.\n8.

The loggers heard it 3. The woodpeckers stopped 4. Nothing, just some silence 5. It didn't matter because no one heard it\nOutput: 1.\"A tree fell in a forest\" essentially indicates the scenario of an isolated forest that has now fallen victim to a falling tree which is typically the source of the sound created upon hitting the ground. \n2. The loggers are not forest dependent, but they are wood dependent. They are a part of the forest that is dependent on its resources and would therefore be more likely to be located near the falling tree. \n3. Similarly, woodpeckers are forest dependent and might have left a forest before the falling tree. Their presence is not guaranteed and if it was the case, they most likely would not be the first ones to detect the falling tree. 4. Silence is generally not something that would be desired in a forest; its purpose is to be the source of the sound that the tree will make upon falling and not make a sound itself. Therefore, silence is the opposite of what would naturally be expected in the forest. 5. This answer best fits the question.", "answer": "D: missing out"}

Choice A: restrooms is the wrong answer as a restroom is not one place that a whole shopping centre would allow you to use your phone. \n3. This gives us options B C D E; mall, bathroom, walkways, food court.\n4. It is evident from the context that shopping malls are a place where people go to shop, eat, and visit other stores.\n5. Shoppers going to mall often have a lot to do and a lot of ground to cover.\n6. They often run from store to store, take the elevator, and check on their phone.\n7. With a crowded phone schedule, shopping malls allow shoppes to use their phone throughout the mall. \n8.

To understand the question properly, we need to firstly understand what a horror film is.\n3. A horror film is a film in which a character or characters are being terrorized (the main objective of a horror film is to frighten the audience).\n   - An earthquake and bolt of lightning are not meant to scare the audience. This information directly helps us in elimination the two options- B-bolt of lightning and E-another part of the creature.\n4.

E: maybe\nOutput:1.The question is whether or not if sunlight is coming in through an opening, then the rays of light are also coming in. \n2.Looking at the given choices, we cannot take 'no' as the answer since it's quite a broad statement to say that, without understanding the context, as 'rays of light' could mean different things within a specific scenario. \n3. Similarly, with the statements'sometimes' and'maybes', it's too broad to understand what the options could mean for a specific context. \n4. The statement 'C: sometimes' is similar to'maybes', which implies that these could be accurate and inaccurate statements depending on where the sunlight is entering through an opening. Hence this statement alone wouldn't suffice. \n5. 'A: yes' as the answer choice is not supported by the context either, since the context clues imply that as opposed to rays of light, \nsunlight may or may not enter through an opening when it is moving.\n6. As the other answer choices are not well supported and defined, we can infer that the answer should be 'E: maybe'.\n7. Hence,  the correct answer is 'E: maybe'.

Choices: A: your home B: your basement C: a storage room D: a closet\nOutput: 1 and 2: The question asks where would you store your emergency kit. \n3. Checking the given choices, option A doesn't make sense, because home, by definition, is the place of residence, thus it's unlikely the emergency kit would be stored in home. \n4. Option B doesn't make sense because basement is not a place to store emergency kit.\n5. Option C makes sense because storage room is a place to store things and to be prepared, the emergency kit may fit well with that description. However, we can eliminate option C because it may be located in a storage room, i.e. a place you may not use much. \n6. Option D, a closet, makes sense but we can eliminate it as an answer because it's a small space that may be difficult to navigate, and may be packed with other things. \n7. When considering what fits the description best, option D, is chosen, making it unlikely to be in a closet. \n8. Therefore, we can say that options C and B can be eliminated. The question remains what is likely to be found in a closet.\n9. When considering that, option A, home may be the only choice left. \n10. Since we have determined the question as where to store emergency kits, option B, basement, would be an appropriate answer. B: basement\n\nInput: Where does a person find the biggest amount of water?

There could be a possibility for some of these parts to be relevant, such as C: shoulder could be used for carrying the head, but it is not clear from the question.\n3: The choice E: legs is incorrect because legs cannot be held as the head.\n4: The choice D: feet is incorrect because one does not typically keep their feet on their head.\n5: The answer B: chest is incorrect, as there are other parts in the body that could contain the head, such as the shoulders.\n6: The answer 1: face is incorrect, as the head could be held by other parts of the anatomy, such as the hair.\n7: The only correct answer choice is Answer 2: A: head.\nso the final answer is A : head\n\nInput: How do you know who is calling by just hearing the phone ring?

{"text": "), and a doorknob (E) could all be located in a doorway, they are not the correct answer.\n4. 'Object contained by the doorway', does not describe the doorknob itself, but the way the door is positioned when closed that would allow you to grab the doorknob when the door is not open.\n5. Doorways have the tendency to stand in a closed position, which would not allow you grab the doorknib unless the door is open.\n6. Therefore, we end up with a conclusion that Choice D: Doorway is correct answer.\n7. So the final answer is D : doorway", "answer": "A: hair salon"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) could each be 'contained by' a doorway, the 'object' refers to a specific shape such as a doorknob. Not any arbitrary shape.\n4. Option E: doorway doesn\u2019t really make sense since doorways are not objects, more so doorways are just spaces in a doorway.\n5. Thus, the most fitting answer among the given choices is \"E: doorway.\"\nSo the final answer was E: doorway\n\nInput: What is the name of the first bird we see in the morning? Choices: 1: rooster 2: finch 3: hawk 4: chicken 5: ostrich 6: duck 7: goose 8: dove 9: crow 10: owl 11: pigeon\nOutput: 1-11: Birds are animals with feathers. They all have some shared characteristics such as laying eggs.\n2. The question is asking about the bird we see in the *morning*.\n3. The birds in the list are seen most in the morning are:\n    1. Rooster\n    2. Finch\n    3. Hawk\n4. Rooster is not a morning bird.\n5. Finch can be seen anytime of the day, but more in the morning.\n6. Hawk can be seen anytime, any weather.\n7. Chicken is not a morning bird, at best they are early birds.\n8. Ostrich can be seen anytime.\n9. Duck can be seen anytime\n10. Goose and Owl can be seen anytime as long as the weather is not bad.\n11. Pigeon can be seen anytime it's not bad weather.\n\nSo with that, I come to the final answer 6: Hawk is the most appropriate answer.", "answer": "C: outside"}
{"text": "), and a doorknob (D) could potentially be found in a room that has a doorway. The question states that one of them must be 'contained by' the doorway.\n4. This means the object must be located behind or inside the doorway itself, not in some other part of the room.\n5. Therefore based on the context clues provided by this question, the only choice that meets all the pre-requisites is E: 'doorway'.\nSo the final choice is E: doorway\n\nInput: This man is in high spirits, he is excited about what?

C: A porch 4. D: The living room 5. E: A garage\nOutput: 1) It is unlikely that the front desk would remain a stable structure of a house, at least as far as residential houses are concerned.\n2) Kitchens in these countries usually feature stoves rather than gas or electric ones.\n3) Porches can be found on both residential and non-residential buildings in the US.\n4) The front door of the house would feature the living room rather than the actual living room of the house which is likely on the second or third floor.\n5) Garages are typically attached to house rather than being an entirely different structure that is separate from the house. \n6) Given the characteristics of the options provided, the most likely feature of houses in the United States would be the kitchen.\nSo the final answering is B: The kitchen\n\nInput: How could a student improve the class?

Choices: 1. a book A: being read B: being read C: being written D: being edited E: being studied 2. a movie  A: being watched B: being watched C: being seen D: being watched E: being filmed\nOutput: 1) The scenario given involves a doctor's office, where the expectation is to receive medical attention and advice related to one's health.\n2. It is unlikely that books or movies would take the center stage, as it would be a distraction from the main purpose of the visit, which is to seek medical relief.\n3. The given options all involve some form of 'watching'. However, choices A: being read, and D: being watched, don't make sense in this scenario. \n4. It's more likely one would hear a book being read in a library or a movie being watched at home rather than in a doctor's office.\n5. Additionally, choice E: films being watched would not apply in this scenario.\n6. Therefore, options A: being written and B: being written are incorrect as they are also related to the act or past actions of 'writing.' \n7. The most appropriate choice is option C: being studied.\nSo the final correct choice is D: being studied\n\nInput: What is a word used to describe the act of finding objects with a flashlight? Choices:  E: discovery F: exploration G: revelation H: excavation\nOutput: 1.) The question asks what the word used to describe the process of finding objects with a torch or flashlight. \n2.) The important points to remember here are that there are four given choices, and none of them are used to describe any of the words 'torch' or 'flashlight.'\n3.) All of the choices given could have been used to describe a lamp. \n4.) Looking carefully,'revelation' has the word 'lamp' hidden inside of", "answer": "B: lie down"}
{"text": "), and door knob (D) could also be considered part of the doorway, we can eliminate these options because they do not meet the criteria of 'contained by'. \n4. 'Doorway' itself could also qualify, if taken as a name or descriptive adjective, however, this phrase can't be directly interpreted as a name of the 'place' where an object is contained. \n5. Therefore, E option 'doorknob', is the most suitable choice.\nSo the final choice is E: doorknob \n\nInput: If a person is a plumber, they would repair a toilet in which? Choices: 1. A: toilet B: bathroom C: faucet D: wall 2. A: pipe B: shower \nOutput: 1st Answer: The question is asking what would be repaired by a plumber. \n2. The answer choice to consider first is option D, 'wall'. Being a house structure, it's unlikely that a plumber would work on a structure outside the bathroom.\n3. Another option worth considering is A, 'toilet', although this is plausible, a plumber would most likely repair the broken part of the toilet that has a leak.\n4. That leaves us with options B (bathroom) and C (faucet).\n\n5. Option B, the 'bathroom', seems like a good idea, as the plumber could repair the toilet that he is currently repairing. However, when we consider the phrase,'repair a toilet', this indicates that damage to the toilet is being repaired. In a bathroom, there are other faucets and fixtures that could be damaged, aside from the toilet itself.\n\n6. That leaves option C, 'faucet'. This is the best choice. When a plumber fixes a toilet, he or she would most likely have to look at the faucet as the toilet and sink are generally connected by the faucet. Therefore the correct answer is C. Faucet\n\nInput: Where do you find the water you're using to wash your hands? Choices: \n1. A: faucet \n2. B: sink \n3. C:", "answer": "B: polished"}

A: walls 2. B: kitchen 3. C: front yard 4. D: basement 5. E: floor\nOutput: 1: The best possible outcome for this question would be to have all the choices available, meaning I might be able to find dirt in any room in a house. \n2: The second possible outcome is where dirt is impossible to find, therefore the choices might be A and B only.\n  3: A similar case to the previous outcome, but dirt may be present instead in the basement or in the front yard instead.\n  4: Similar to the last outcome, with all rooms except for the floor as well.\n5: Similar to the last one, but with the possibility of having dirt in the floor of the house, with the exclusion of the basement \n6: Similar to the last conclusion but with the possibility of not finding dirt in the floor.\n7: Having the exclusion of the kitchen, the floor and the basement from the locations where dirt could be found. \n8: Now, excluding the kitchen from the other rooms, means that dirt could easily be present in the basement and/or the floor. \n9: Now, excluding dirt from being present in the floor or the basement \n10: Similar to the previous outcome, with dirt being restricted to the kitchen and the front yard.\n11: Dirt could be present only in the kitchen or in the front yard. \n12: Now, dirt might be able to be found in the basement and in the kitchen with the front yard being excluded. \n13: dirt could be present in the bas,ement, the kitchen or in the floor \n14: dirt might be present in the baseme\nnt where dirt is impossible.\n15: dirt might not be possible in any room at", "answer": "B: city"}

D: hair hat 5. E: sweater\nOutput: 1) The objective is to keep one's heat when it's cool. This means keeping the body warm, not just the head.\n2) Hats, scarves, wig, and hair hats can keep one's head or hair warm, but do not work when one is keeping their whole body warm.\n3) Sweater is not a type of head covering or something meant to keep one's whole body warm. \n4) Hair hat would keep one's head and face warm, but not the rest of the body, making this a poor choice. \n5) Therefore, the best choice is headed to sweaters and head wear instead of hair hats or other head and body coverings.\nSo the final choice is E: sweater\n\nInput: A cowboy was given a horse by someone he didn't know, what does horse usually mean?

Or is it implied that the doorway must be empty and not contain anything? \n4. The context clues do not provide a clear idea of what is meant by 'contained by', so we can consider only the literal meaning of the words. \n5. If we look at the four options E: doorway as a choice, it's the only one that is an actual physical location which can accommodate the object if the doorway is empty and void of objects. \n6. Thus, the most appropriate answer is E: doorway.\nSo the final word to describe where we can grab an object contained by the doorway is E: doorway", "answer": "C: dress himself"}

Choices:  C: blinds D: fans E: glass F: openings\nOutput: 1 \"When a hurricane comes in by\" means that the building may not have had windows when the hurricane came.\n2 \"to have\" (the word does not make sense if we choose to have any.)\n3 The hurricane did not knock down all windows.\n4 Blinds (C) - when the hurricane comes in from the side, they will stay where they are. They might be broken, but will still remain where they are.\n5 Fans (E) - because it is not related to hurricanes and windows, thus it does not work as the answer.\n6 'Glass' (F) and 'openings' (F) - when the hustle comes from the side, broken glass can remain on the window frame with dust covering them and make them look like a gap or openings to the eye. So it would not tell that there are no windows there.\n7 When the hurricane comes by, \"the windows that wouldn't have\" (D) are just the broken windows.\n8 The question asks in which room will any window there be.\n9 'The' indicates there is a single room.\n10 So, the windows \"would not have\" (D) in the room.\n11 When a HURRICANE comes from the side, they would be able to move windows.\n12 So the final answer is D - the windows will not have.\n\nInput: If someone had a lot of time, what could be possible to do?

Therefore, this is the correct answer.\nSo the final choice is E: doorway\n\nInput: How would we describe someone who has no friends? Choices: 1. socially awkward 2. shy 3. introvert 4. extrovert 5. nerds\nOutput:1. The meaning of the word'socially awkward' suggests that a person who is'socially awkward has difficulty in social situations,' which is contradictory to the statement of having no friends.\n2. A shy person may prefer to avoid social situations, leading to isolation in the long run, creating the circumstance of having no friends. \n3. An introvert usually prefers to spend time alone rather than in social gatherings. However, this does not necessarily imply the lack of relationships, in the absence of having friends, a person can still be an introvert.\n4. An extrovert, on the other hand, is usually sociable, outgoing, and loves socializing. Having no friends would contradict the statement.\n5. Nerds implies that the person might be smart or intelligent, but it does not really describe whether the person has friends or not, since it's pretty common for nerds to have friends.\n6. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that the most apt option to describe someone who has no friend is 'introvert'.\nSo the final choice would be: answer would be 2. shy.\n\nInput: What might come after the word before?

When looking at the given choices in option B: kitchen, C: laundryroom, D: bathroom and E: hallway the choice most directly related to such a setting is B: kitchen.\n3. Kitchen contains major appliances such as refrigerator, stove/oven, microwave etc. which can directly influence the requirement of air conditioning.\n4.

The cats' home is inside a house, while the birds' home is outside the house.\n2 & 4. A forest is not birds\u2019 (or cats\u2019) home, as it is too remote and dangerous for them to survive. Trees, however, are often home to cats and birds because they provide shelter and food.\n3. A tree is not home to cats and outside home to birds. The question specifically excludes cats, but it does not mention birds. Furthermore, cats do not typically inhabit trees.\n2. Inside a house is birds\u2019 home and outside home for cats only.

{"text": "), and doorknob (E) are objects contained by doorways, they are too generic.\n4. The word 'doorknob' (E) itself is too narrow, as it excludes other types of knobs and latches, as well as locks on doors, which are also considered objects to be contained within doorways.\n5. Therefore it cannot be the correct answer. \n6. Looking at choice D 'opening doors', it would typically imply the structure of the door itself instead of other parts of the doorframe or doorway. \n7. Choice C 'control panel' describes the interior of the door, and not the object contained by it. \n8. Looking at choice B 'door panel\", this can't be right either, as it implies a panel made for the door itself. It's not really the object contained by the doorway.\n9. So, the answer that fits the question best is B: Door frame\n10. So the final answer is B : Door frame.\n\nInput: If someone is not home, where might you find a key to their home?

The answer options include B: rumbling, C: garden, D: barrow, E: both, and F: pail.\n3. The first three options are all inaccurate as a wheelbarrow does not have a wheelbarrow in it.\n4. The fourth option of both does not make sense when referring to a singular item since if an item has a similar name to itself, it would not be an accurate representation of what is being asked.\n5.

The word \"amassed\" is synonymous with the word \"accumulating\" which is an acceptable definition.\n3. In terms of semantics, the word \"accumulate\" is synonymous with \"collecting\" and \"gathering\".\n4. Looking at the given list, choice B \"acquiring\" is not a valid meaning of `amassed` as the word \"acquire\" can also be used to refer to obtaining objects, assets, or ownership. \n5. However, this meaning does not apply to the context of the given question.\n6.

{"text": "), doorknob (E) or doorway could be held within a doorway, it's likely that people will not try to grab these objects because they are contained by the doorway, meaning that an independent object (not a part of the doorway) such as a book (D) will be more likely to be held within a doorframe.\n4. While answer choices A, C, and E are incorrect, they may still be plausible locations for object, however, given that there is also an option for holding an independent object, we will exclude them from our analysis. \n5. Moving on to choice options B, and D. Control panel doesn't seem to fit for this query as there isn't an obvious plausible circumstance in which this item would be present beside a doorway.\n6. As for choice D, door, the object should be in an area where people can easily access, hence a door is a better fit for it than a doorway.\n7.

A can be an astronaut if they have the ability to pilot an aircraft or can be trained to pilot an aircraft or spacecraft.\n3. B can be an astronaut, even if he or she is primarily interested in outer space and not spacecrafts.\n4. C can be an astronaut even without being a human-like being.\n5. Even though a person who wants to be an astronaut may want a human to go to space, that doesn't mean said person does not have the capability of becoming an astronaut, as it is not a prerequisite.\n6. Therefore, only option E: the ability to not do mathematics can be ruled out as a possible reason for not wanting to be an astronaut, based on the provided context clues. \n7.

The question mentions a delay which would explain why the bus didn't come from the terminal directly.\n  Option B: City B, Bus Terminal, would fit if the person had already traveled to City B before waiting at the end of the Road. \n  Option D: City B, Behind Stadium would indicate that the person is waiting near a stadium, hence this does not fit the context of a person waiting for a bus at a specific terminal.\n    So the answer is A: Bus Terminal, City A.\n     So the final answer was is A: Bus Terminal", "answer": "A: open meadow"}

The question then seems to be asking you to pick between a 'doorknob' and a 'doorway', where the doorknob must provide a more 'direct' connection to the object it is linked to. \n5. We can eliminate option D: doorknobs since it is quite possible to access the object contained by a door without the need for a doorknob.\n6. We can eliminate option B: control panels since these panels are typically not located within doorways (instead of adjacent to them) and also they do not make direct connections to objects contained by a doorway (unlike doorknobs). \n7. The remaining answer, then, is a doorway (E).\nSo the final answer must be option E: doorway.\n\nInput: What can you see in a glass of water?

Choices:  The answer is: A: party B: their bedroom C: closet D: dressing room E: mirrors\nOutput: 1- 'Party' refers to an event, which we're told is already in the past (from 'thought about').\n2- There's been no mention of where exactly they were (in the bedroom? in a car?), so this is not a clue.\n3- Neither of the remaining choices are relevant to answering the question. No party, no relevant details to think about.\n4- The only logical answer is 'the party'.\nSo the final word is 'the party'\n\nInput: What wasn't the dog doing when a neighbor came by? Choices:  the sound of a dog B: eating C: walking D: chewing on a bone E: lying on the sofa\nOutput: 1.- The question is about a dog (indicates that there were more than one dog, or that the narrator is speaking about their dog or the dog of their neighbor)\n2.- He is not doing the sound of a dog.\n3.- The neighbor did not say that it was chewing on a bones. It is eating a meal right now and he did not hear a sound (or that the sound was the meal: it's a noisy activity :D)\n4.- He was not eating at that time.\n5.- He was not sleeping at the time of the narration.\n6.- The dog was not on the sofa.\n7.- The dog was just laying on the ground.\nSo the narrator's dog was lying on the ground because the neighbor came by.\n\nInput: The boy was too nervous to talk to the girl, what was his response?

{"text": "), and a doorknob (D) could be related to doorways, they also have a range of other possible locations within their respective structures, therefore making them too vague or broad.\n4. Since these three options could theoretically be contained in the doorway, we must eliminate these.\n5. Option E: doorway - is a term used to denote the entire structure that contains a door; however, the question could be looking for an interior portion of this structure; to determine which portion, we must consider the next word 'contained'.\n6. Now, consider 'contained by' again - Does the interior portion contain an object? Yes, that would be the case if the interior portion of the doorway contained objects or items.\n7. Looking next at the doorway description, we find that it was designed to offer access to a building - In other words, it is used to let people through it, not hold objects.\n8. We must conclude that the only possible interior portion of the door structure could be a door itself.\n9. To determine which door, we must also look at the word 'grab' - It indicates some form of physical contact between hand and the door, therefore we can eliminate the control panel because that would only involve contact with a touchscreen.\n10. Looking at the doorway description again, we see that it offers access - in other words, it does not have locks or anything like that on it.\n11. We don't have to open the door to grab at it then, we could simply reach in and grab it at that stage.\n12. For those reasons, we now have confirmed that the only true answer that fits the question is A: television.\nSo the final, correct answer is A: television", "answer": "E: medicine cabinet"}

There's a high possibility that a hiker might have a backpack with a few objects that aren't too heavy, these could include food, water, a first aid kit, a pen, a small notebook, etc. \n6. We can eliminate Doorway (E) because it doesn't specify what the object contained within the doorway is and could include people as well.\n7. Since a person is traveling through the wilderness, food and water can be assumed to be the objects he or she is carrying.\n8. Therefore the most plausible answer is C: door knob.\nSo the final answers is C: doorknob\n\nInput: What is a place to get a newspaper? Choices: 1. Coffee Shops\n\nOutput: 1-7.

Option (D): control panel could fit in theory, as these are often located inside doorways, however, in some circumstances, they can be found in open spaces such as on the wall or in another room.\n5. Option (D): doorway cannot be the answer as this is the general location of the door/doorway, and is not an object as such.\n6. Option (E): a Doorway cannot contain an object and would only ever surround an object or the entrance of a room.\n7. Option (B): control panel (suspected to be inside the doorway) also cannot be the answer, as it often includes other items also such as an On and Off switch.\n8. This leaves us with options (A), (C) and (E). All these options include the word 'door' as opposed to 'doorway', so the simplest answer that makes sense in this context would be (E) doorway. \n9. Therefore, the correct answer is E: doorway.\nSo the final correct answer is E:doorway\n\n\nInput: What does an empty tire stand for or represent? Choices:  The tire has no air in it or is deflated.\nOutput: 1) There is no correct answer to this. The question is incomplete and the answer is subjective.\n2) The literal, most common, and logical meaning of it is that it represents a tire that does not have any air in the tube. But in some instances this does not make sense because the tire may not be flat/defiated as it may have air in it but no pressure in it.\n3) The logical meaning can be interpreted in ways such as the tire represents something someone is currently trying to replace.\n4) It may also represent a tire someone lost. \n5) It may also represent something someone wants to change.\n6) It may also represent the tire is damaged.\n7) It may also represent that the tire could have been put back on.\n\nThis question had so many possible answers that it is impossible to answer.

It's just saying that people are banned from camping in the canyon in general, not that no one wants to camp in the canyon\n6 - Since the author never said that the canyon was windy, there's no contradiction\n7 - While we agree with the choice, we haven't contradicted anything\n8 - No contradiction\n9 - The author never said it was a clear day, we only contradict the choice if it said it was a cloudy day with the passage that says no fires\n10 - Fires are permitted and allowed even in such dry conditions, because", "answer": "A: restaurant"}

Choices: \nA: closet B: kitchen C: living room D: washer/dryer E: upstairs\nOutput: 1.) The question asks, what is the place in the living room that you would find your mother. 2.) Given that it is a mother we are looking for, the word we will want to focus our search to would be the word 'place' and what place our mother is most likely to be in. 3.) 'Place' is a specific place, not just a room, it would have to specify what kind of place in the room she is in or this question and answer is too broad. 4.) As we are looking for a specific place we can reject C) 'Kitchen' because our mother is not cooking food and we are not looking for a place to cook food which is only done in a kitchen so the kitchen does not meet the requirement for this specific question. 5.) Because we are looking for a 'place' in a 'room'. We have to look for rooms that would have a 'place' in these rooms. E) 'Upstairs' can be ruled out quickly because our mother does not live in a house with stairs going up. 6.) In terms of a place in a room there are two rooms that would have a place in these rooms and they are 'Bathroom' and 'Bedroom'. Bathroom: You would not find a mother going into the bathroom of the room unless you were looking for her inside of the bathroom itself or you were looking for her to wash the sink and she was in the sink herself. Bathroom would be a waste of time. 7.) Now we have left just two choices, 'Bedroom' and 'Living Room'. 8.) In terms of Bedrooms - If your mother has a bed and she is in the bed then you would be looking inside the bed. In other words 'Inside the bed'", "answer": "C: san francisco"}
{"text": ") and a doorknob (D) can indeed be inside a doorway, it is the 'doorknob' (D) which best fits that answer. \n4. Option E: Is out of scope, as it refers to the overall property of doorway as a place, and not an object inside the doorway. \n5. An example of an object that we would reach to from a doorknob is a doorbell or an object that the person may want to retrieve from the space between the two walls. \n6.

Option 1: Fisherman's wound is correct as it means an attack by the shark on the person, but the question is not asking for the wound, rather it asks about the type of wound made by the shark by attacking the fisherman.\n4. Option 2: Shark wound is incorrect because it would not make sense as the person cannot get wound on the shark. \n5. The shark is not a person and is not capable of wounding in the same manner as a human.\n6. Option 3: Fatal is an incorrect answer choice as it is not related to the question asked, which is about the type of wounds that a shark attacking the fisherman would make. Option 3 also makes no sense.\n7. Option 4: Serious is incorrect because such a wound could be made by something that is not from a shark attacking someone. \n8. Option 5: None. The question asks about the type of attack that would be made by a shark attacking him, but it does not ask for a wound on the fisherman. This is why the answer option is incorrect.\n9.

Option 1: dimmer: a dimmer is an electrical switch that reduces and increases the amount of lighting and not one that produces excess bright light.\n4. Option 2: piano: piano is an instrument, not something that would produce light.\n5. Option 3: spotlight: a spot light is a specialized light and it may be used to shine light, but it does not itself produce light, rather it reflects light from another source.\n6. Thus, option 4: Nightlight is the correct answer.\nSo the final choice is Option 4: Nightlight.\nInput: The dog was trained, but he's still excited to see what?

Therefore, these answers can be discarded. 2. The answer to this is choice 4 since it is the only one that refers to a particular group. This group is people who elect a leader. 3. 3 isn\u2019t relevant since the question asks why people should vote, not whether they vote. 4.

While doors have doorknobs, and the doorway also has a door, the presence of these options alone does not indicate that it's plausible that an object would be inside the doorway, but we also have to look at the other options to verify this information.\n5. Given that the question asks about 'grabbing' an object, option A: television, D: doorknobs, E: doorway options would not be suitable as they are items that can't be 'grabbed'.\n6. This leaves us with options B: control panel, C: doors, and E: doorway. \n7. B: control pad would not be a suitable option because this is not a part of a doorway and does not seem to be related to it, and E: doorways don't necessarily have doors, therefore, this would not be a suitable answer either.\n8. Option E: doorways, however, do include the actual door, which can be grabbed, therefore if we are asked to grab an object contained by the doorway, this would be the logical answer.\nSo the final choice is E: doorway.\n\nInput: Choose the correct statement about a person who lives in a cold climate.

Choices: A: go right B: turn back C: go through the intersection D: pull back E: make a left turn\nOutput: 1) Objective of the question: 'If you were on a road and came a crossroad?'\n2) The question is posing us with 2 scenarios: (i) You are on a road and (ii) you come to a crossroad.\n3) For option A, 'if you were on a road\",  it does not matter where you are on a road, it could be on any curve or stretch of road. If it were on an uphill stretch, the person would not make a left turn but a right because of downhill. The same goes for if it's on a downhill track. Hence, Option A is incorrect.\n4) Option B is incorrect because there is no option to turn back at a crossroad. The only option is to go through the intersection and hence option B is out.\n5) Option C is incorrect because of the road junction.  As per basic traffic rules, the only option at a crossroad is to go through the crossroad as seen to be the case for Option D.\n6) Option E could only be plausible if he comes to a crossroads and is driving, he has to make a left turn.\n7) The only choice left for the  question is Option D as there is only 1 correct option among all the options provided.

{"text": "), and door handle (D) could all be part of a doorway in different ways, they are not contained within it. \n4. Therefore, the answer must be 'contained by'.\n5. Since the choice E: doorway implies that the object contained within it is within the doorway, it qualifies as the correct response.\n6. So the final answer is E:'doorway'.\nSo the final statement is E: doorway\n\nInput: Where can one find an empty space? Choices: 1: A: room B: backpack C: home D: attic E: house F: bedroom G: pantry door\nOutput: 1: The question is asking Where can one find an EMPTY space? \n2. The statement contains the word 'EMPTY', which means a space that is devoid of contents.\n3. Based on this, the answer must be BACKPACK, for it is the only choice that fits this definition.\n4. The other remaining choices are either places where things are kept, or simply are not relevant. \n5. Therefore, all remaining choices are removed, leaving option BACKPACK the sole contender. \n6. So the answer is BACKPACK.\nSo the final statement answer is B: Backpack\n\nInput: I thought he wouldn't be in a good mood, but it turned out. Choices: 1.

{"text": ") and a doorknob (D) could all be items within a doorway, the doorways themselves are too broad for what the question asks, as it excludes them from the choices.\n4. Choices E: doorway and B: control panel would both mean that the object is not a structure of the doorway but something outside of it. \n5. Therefore, these two are also incorrect answers.\n6. The only plausible answer is C: Opening door.\nSo the final choice is C: opening doors\n\nInput: I didn't know the dog in the house before it started barking, it was quiet by then. Choices:  A) sound B) behavior C) size D) hair E) temperature\nOutput: 1) The question is about a period when a dog was quiet following an earlier period when it was barking. \n2) The dog's behavior is not an appropriate choice.\n3) The dog's size was not related to the barking or the quiet period.\n4) The dog's hair was not relevant to the scenario.\n5) Temperature was not associated with the barking or quiet periods either.\n6) The statement \"I didn't know the sound\" suggests that the dog was quiet, either from beginning or from a distance (for example, to hear it bark).\n7) The question implies that the dog was not barking when you encountered it, making the dog's behavior irrelevant to the case. \n8) Therefore, the most appropriate choice is A) sound.\nSo the final option is A) sound\n\nInput: John went down to breakfast and there he was, what might he be referring to? Choices: \n A: John B: bacon C: chicken Eggs D: bread C 11: cheese E: butter\nOutput: 1). In the provided context, \"There I was\" should refer to either a situation or a person.\n2). Option A: John is a common English word, so there are chances the context clues could be misleading us to think that John refers to him but that is just a case where John could have been added into the sentence as a third-person pronoun.\n3). Option B. \"Bacon\" or \"bacon\" does not make sense in the given sentence as it", "answer": "B: movies"}
{"text": "), and door (D) all fall within the doorway, the word 'doorknob' implies that it must also be contained within the doorway. \n4. This narrows down the options to A: television, B: control panel, D: door, and E: doorway since there's no other object in either scenario that could be contained within the door.\n5. Choices B, D, and E don't make sense in the question since they could be found at any structure, while choice A 'television' seems to be the most appropriate answer.\n6. Choice C: opening doors (or its synonym 'a door') is redundant and a possible word repetoire to describe what could be meant when describing an object contained within a doorway, thus it can be rejected as part of this exercise. \n7. Therefore, option A: television is the only logical answer among the given options.\nSo the final choice is A: television.\n\nInput: Which would not be used to cleanse a room? Choices:  a) air freshener b) dryer c) bathroom fan d) air purifier e) scented oil\nOutput: 1). Air fresheners are used to mask offensive odors.\n2. A dryer could be used to dry clothes, not a room.\n3. A bathroom fan is often used to ventilate smells and smoke from the room.\n4. An air purifier removes pollutants and viruses from the air.\n5. A scented oil is used to scent the air.\n6. The correct answer, therefore, is d : air purifier.\nSo the final choise is d: air purifier.\n\nInput: If a child can't find a way to open the locked door, where could they find a key? Choices: 1.

{"text": "), and even doorknob (D), could potentially be located in a doorway, all four of them don't appear to meet the word boundary.\n4. The question mentions a 'doorway', and doorways are typically a part of walls, so answer E doesn't appear to be suitable.\n5. Therefore the most suitable answer for this question is C: Doorknob(s).\nSo the final answer are Choices:  C: Doorknobs.\n\nInput: What food can you put on the side? Choices:  I: bread II: cheese III: butter IV: jam V: jelly VI: cream VII: mayonnaise VIII: mustard IX: ketchup X: chutney XI: salad dressing XII: sauce XIII: onions\nOutput: 1.) Here we have to decide between 13 options and rank them in order from the most valuable to the least valuable.\n2.) It is important to follow in the words of Aristotle that \"in arranging facts we should think of the end of the chain.\" In this case, it is important to look at the whole question in its context and then look at each option for relevancy. Since the question is asking about the side which would fit an entr\u00e9e, it's plausible that the answer should be given in a logical order: one that starts after and ends before the entr\u00e9e.\n3.) This means that option 1, bread, can be eliminated since the entr\u00e9e is a sandwich.\n4) Moving on, we look to eliminate the items that are neither an appropriate side for a sandwich, nor an appropriate main course for a sandwich. To do this, we follow Aristotle's advice of choosing the option that is \"furthest removed from that which is first established.\" Since the question is looking for a side that is appropriate for a sandwich, it's safe to eliminate all items, bar the one that is most relevant to the entr\u00e9e.\n5. Since the question is looking to determine the least significant of items on the \"side\", and \"sandwich\" is our entr\u00e9e, we should therefore choose the item least relevant to \"sandwich\" to serve as our entr\u00e9e.\n6. Therefore we should not choose choice B but should go all the way down to our entr\u00e9e which is option III - \"butter", "answer": "C: london"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (E) are possible options, they do not meet the criteria set by the question. \n4.

Choices: A: you are bored B: you are depressed C: you are an introvert D: you are very bubbly E: you have too much energy\nOutput: The objective of the question is to explain why a person would be doing so many different things, and none of these things have to be related. \nLooking at the possible choices, the answers B: depressed and E: bubbly are incorrect as they do not explain why someone would be doing so many things, regardless of whether they relate to each other. A: bored and D: very bubbly are not explanations either, they just refer to the way a person acts. \nThe choice that best answers the question is A: you are boring. \nSo the answer is A: boring.\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\nInput: The boyfriend bought the gift, and he was waiting for his girlfriend to get home.

The key to this question is understanding where the object is likely going to be located: in the doorway. \n5. 'Doorway' is the only choice that mentions the object's location, while the other choices are more vague and do not directly imply it. \n6. Hence, the most viable answer to the question would be E:doorway. \nSo the final answer to this question is: E:doorway.\n\nInput: What might a bunny do if he is frightened? Choices: 1. A: cry 2. B: hunt 3. C: run away 4. D: eat 5. E: sleep\nOutput: 10. When a rabbit feels scared or threatened, he may try to hide his true emotions and pretend that everything is okay. This is called \"freezing.\" In addition, they may display signs of alertness and vigilance, such as twitching their ears or standing still. \n27. If a bunny were to see a potential danger, it would likely try to disappear and run away. \n49. The \"fight or flight\" theory holds that when a bunny senses danger, it either flees or fights for survival. \n61. When a bunny encounters a predator or dangerous situation, it may try to flee by using its powerful legs to speedily escape.\nSo the final answers are A and C, and D, B is incorrect\nSo the final answers to this question are A: freezing, B: run away, and D: flee.\n\nInput: Why does the woman in the cage have a big smile?

Choices: A: think B: understand C: respond D: ask again E: think faster\nOutput: 1.'Who was the lady?' is a question in its own right, with the objective of getting the answer to a question, namely that of the lady asking.\n2. By asking who the lady was, he is demonstrating his comprehension of the phrase. He is not doing this out of obligation or as a reply - he is doing it willingly and to comprehend the meaning.\n3. Since the question is who the lady was, and the boy's response didn't answer that, then the boy didn't do what it takes to reach the answer.\n4. Option A: Think. The object of the man asking the question is to demonstrate the boy's intelligence and show that he thinks before answering a question. If the boy replied by saying he couldn't think for a moment because of the other questions on the quiz before, which was not the context of the sentence, then he wouldn't demonstrate his intelligence, and thus couldn't answer the man's question.\n5. Option B: Understand - is also not a response and not the correct answer.\n\n6. Option C: Respond is the right answer. Respond means to do or say something in answer to a question or request.\n\n7. Option D: Asking again is an action, not a response. So, D is not the right answer.\n\n8. Option E: Thinking Faster is also incorrect. It is not a response, but an action.\n\n9.

A: first\nOutput: 1 The question is looking at the difference between a common individual (person - Choice A: 'person') and an inventor (inventor - Choice B: 'inventors').\n2. Inventors are typically associated with the invention process itself.\n3. Likewise, individuals are generally more concerned with their role as a person rather than an inventor.\n4. Inventors may have many inventions or may identify as being inventors rather than individuals.\n5. Inventors are likely to be more concerned with innovating in the industry of invention and inventorship.\n6.

{"text": "), or door knob (D) can be found within a doorway, the 'doorway' itself (E is not included in the given options).\n4. This excludes the possibility of E: doorway.\n5. Considering option C: opening doors, we could reasonably say they are found within a doorway. When we consider the other options that could be contained by a doorway-door knob, control panel, and television. Looking at a door knob, the word 'doorway' can still mean both the door and the opening/space where the door opens-thus it can also be considered as an object contained by a 'door' and as an object contained by an 'opening' both of which could be within a doorway.\n6. Based on the context, the possibility of an object being within a doorway includes the possibility it to be within the door, opening or both.\n7. That makes all possible answer choices plausible, which leads to the conclusion that this question does not have a definitive answer - which is indicated by having the option as 'All of the above' in the given choices.\n8. The answer to this question is the 'All of the above'.\nSo the final answers, in this case, is All of the above.", "answer": "E: bus stop"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) could all be found on a door, they are not contained by a doorway - i.e., they have a different location.\n4.

Therefore the answer is E: doorway.\nSo the final answers is E: doorway\n\nInput: The store is on the corner of what street intersection? Choices: 1. A: Northwest Avenue  B: Central Street C: South Ridge Drive D: Sun Street E: Main East Avenue\nOutput: 1.\"The store is located on the corner of\", indicates that the store has a corner and cannot be on an avenue, hence eliminating A, C and E.\n2. \"What streety intersection\", indicated that we are talking about streets and eliminating D and E.\n3. Choices B and D does not have a common intersection, therefore eliminating both.\n4. \"The store is on the corner\", eliminates choice D since store cannot be at intersection.\n5. Choices B and A are both possible answers, but we can eliminate B due to the presence of Northwest, which indicates a western direction, as we know, there are four major directions.\n6.\"The store is located at the corner of\", eliminates choice A, as they are talking about the same store at same location.\n7.\"A store called Smithies is on the corner\", has given us additional piece of information which we cannot ignore, which eliminates choice D, since we know that the store is Smithies.\n8. At this point, the answer becomes clear, as there is only one option left with all the correct clues, and that is E: \"Main Avenue East\".\nSo the final answer would be E: Main Avenue East", "answer": "C: corner"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) could be defined as being within a doorway, the correct answer is E: doorway.\n4. This means that you would grab the object from within the structure of the actual doorway itself.\n5. This is why it's not correct to assume that you would grab a 'control panel' from 'doorway' as the control panel does not form part of the doorway itself.\n6. Or you'd grab the object from 'opening doors' as it doesn't necessarily have to be within the doorway; it needn't be within the physical structure itself.\n7. Therefore the correct answer is E, doorway, where you would actually grab the object from within its own structure, not in a part outside its structure.\nSo the final accurate answer is E: door.\n\nInput: What might you find attached to the front door of your home?

{"text": "), and doorknob (D) could possibly be classified as objects contained by a doorway, they don't fit the intended meaning of the expression as given.\n4. With limited answers, it's safe to assume that an item contained by a doorway falls within the category of doorway furniture, so the answer might involve grasping one of these furnishings.\n5. In this case, it is reasonable to include option E, doorway, as the furniture within a doorway does imply that the answer we're looking for is found in or around the doorway. \n6. This eliminates options A, B, and D as our answer. \n7. Therefore, our answer is C, open doors, since the furnishing contained within them might prove advantageous when grabbing a specific object.\nSo the final solution is C: open doors\n\nInput: What did the guy ask the woman for after she got up from a dinner table? Choices:  Fruit A: napkins B: her phone C: more food D: a pencil E: her name\nOutput: 1: Dinner is generally eaten in a sitting posture as opposed to standing up. \n2: The question is asking us for what the man wanted from the woman after she got up from the dinner table. \n3: Let's look at the given options to see if any of them fit the situation. \n4: Option A: napkins wouldn't be appropriate as napkins are used for wiping the face instead of containing and bringing away food. \n5: Option B: asking her for her phone doesn't seem relevant to the context of the question. \n6: Option C: asking for more food isn't an appropriate response to her standing up. \n7: Only option D: asking for a pencil follows the appropriate response. \n8: This is further reiterated by the fact that the man asked for her name. \n9: Therefore, the correct option is D: pencil.\nSo the final choice is D: pencils\n\nInput: Can an item be considered useful if it is on a table and underneath its user?

Choices: 1: Bread 2: Meat 3: Cheese 4: Cabbage 5: Tomato 6: Carry 7: Money 8: Ketchup 9: Kebab 10: Salt\nOutput: 1) The question 'What did you not give when asked for a sandwich,' refers to the fact that we can ask for a sandwich without giving all of the ingredients from a sandwich.\n2) We can eliminate some inappropriate options. For instance, 'carry' (7) or'money' (8) do not fit the context of the question.\n3) We can also eliminate some relevant options, as some of the ingredients listed can be assumed to be taken for granted.\n4) Some of the ingredients, like 'cabbage' and 'tomato,' could be taken as optional ingredients.\n5) Let's look at the other options. We can eliminate option '9', which refers to 'kabab,' because this is not a commonly used word in English and is therefore irrelevant here.\n6) Similarly, option '7' refers to 'kebab,' which may be a word used in some dialects in some parts of the world but is definitely not an international word or widely used outside particular parts of the world.\n7) Now that we have eliminated non-useful options, we can look at the choices that we will consider for the final answer.\n8) Looking at the remaining options, both 1 and 10 make sense. You need 'bread' and'salt' for a sandwich; however, you cannot ask for one without'meat' and 'cheese'.\n9) Looking at the options, meat, tomato, and ketchup can be considered to be important ingredients to a sandwich. You can ask for any kind of meat in a sandwich, however, certain meats like 'beef' are more expensive than others such as 'cottage cheese", "answer": "B: feel more comfortable"}
{"text": ") and the doorknob (D) represent objects of a room that are not necessarily 'contained' by the doorway, only the choice E: doorway can fit the requirement.\n4. Therefore, the correct answer is E: doorway.\nSo the final Answer is E: doorway\n\nInput: A lamppost is where one can find what? Choices: A: stairs B: trash C: light D: darkness E: light bulb\nOutput: 1 This question asks us to identify the'something' at the lamppost which could be of interest.\n2 Looking at the given options, we can eliminate choices B: Trash and D: Darkness as it doesn't really make sense what is there in such a scenario \n3 Choices A: Lamp Post and B: Lamp can also be eliminated from being the correct answer since they're not really in-line with the 'interest' sense they convey\n4 Choices C: Light doesn't really answer the question adequately since the given sentence didn't really imply that the light can help one to find something of interest and a lamp post is not usually the best place to find light\n5 Given this scenario, choice E: Light Bulb could be a potential answer, as the light bulb serves two functions: providing light and serving a point of reference that could help one locate and identify what they're after.\n6 Therefore, the answer is: E: Light Bulb. \nSo the final answer would be: E: Light Bulbs\n\n\nInput: When should a person take a test? Choices: A during the day B during the night C when they are studying D after lunch E when they are hungry F after being fed\nOutput: 1 Given the question, there are a few clues that point to the time when the test should be taken - during the day, while studying and after lunch. \n2 The choice for: \"When they are hungry\" doesn' know when the test is to be taken, so it can be eliminated \n3 \"after they are fed\" also doesn't directly lead to taking a test, so it can be removed as well \n4 The choice for: \"after being fed\" might also be eligible since the test might be taken when the person has had meal/snacks and is in the state", "answer": "A: driving"}
{"text": "), and television (D) could all fit the criteria, we can eliminate them by considering the question at hand. From 1 to 3, a television is a flat rectangle (a one-dimensional object) and thus does not fit the question since its dimensions would not align with the door's size.  While control panel (B) can be within a doorway, it's a set of controls with multiple dimensions instead of a single two-dimensional flat rectangle, which is required to fit by the doorway.\n4. Also, open doors (C) cannot fit inside a doorway as they are open (unclosed). Doorknobs (E), as well, are typically not within the doorway but in an adjacent place (on the other side of the door) that you can grab to open the door.\n5. We then analyze options D: \"Doorway\", and A: \"Television\" - which could arguably be considered part of the doorway.\n6. The answer is that we can grab an object contained by the doorway directly. \n So the final answer is A - \"Television\"\n \n\n10/11. The following questions contain blanks that must be filled in with words/phrases from the options provided. Select one of the options and fill in the blank(s) with the blank-filling option(s) for that blank.\n\nInput: The group leader ______ for the members of the group to follow him/her. Choices:  A 1. leading 2. follows  3. 4.\nOutput: 1) The question asks us to identify how the Group Leader would tell the group members that they must follow him/her. \n2. We can infer the group Leader may use one of the given choices: follows, leading, and 4. By implication, the members following the leader will lead to the group being successful.\n \n3. Considering the context of the question, the choice that fits best is A: leading as it's not likely they all \"follows\" at once and \"4.\" suggests group success.\nSo the final answers are A: leading\n\nInput: What are the two main reasons why people don't like to wait? Choices: 1) A: Telling lies 2) B: Wasting energy 3) C: Spending", "answer": "E: class room"}
{"text": "), and door knob (D) are often found or located in the vicinity of a door, they are not necessarily contained by the structure of the door. \n4. Doorways and door frames typically include one or more surfaces, such as a frame, sliding panel, or hinges, which can be grabbed and constitute the actual doorway. \n5. By process of elimination, this leads us to choice (E) doorway.\n6. Therefore, when grabbing an object contained by a structure such as a door, the best place to grab it on would be the doorway.\nSo the final correct answer is E: doorway\n\nInput: She bought an expensive coffee maker and couldn't resist trying it at home. From which she was pleased. Choices:  A coffee shop B: The living room C: Dining room D: Her kitchen E: Her workplace\nOutput: 1: The question asks why did the woman not resist trying the expensive coffee maker at home and why was she pleased from that.\n2: The context of the question indicates we are answering about the woman. \n3: We know that her living room, dining room, kitchen, and workplace were too far away for her to use the expensive coffee making machine that she brought back home.\n4: We also know the woman had no workplace near her home.\n5: Option A coffee shop is not relevant, as she went there for getting an expensive coffee machine.\n6: Option B: Living room is not correct, as she can prepare coffee for herself at any time in her living room.\n7: Option C: Dining room is not correct, it is also not a permanent place for her to prepare her coffee.\n8: Option D: Kitchen is not correct, there are better cooking appliances in her kitchen compared to coffee maker.\n9: Therefore, only option E: her workplace is a proper answer which is correct.\nSo the final choice is E: Her workplace.\n\nInput: She had her own special tea and she made it every morning. What did she have tea? Choices:  her tea B: her tea shop C: her caf\u00e9 D: her tea place E: her neighborhood coffee shop\nOutput: 1 : She had her own specialty tea. \n2: Specialty tea can refer to customized reci", "answer": "B: plane"}
{"text": "), or door knob (D), and doorway (E) could all be located within the frame of a doorway, they are all external objects.\n4. Therefore, the most logical answer is C: opening doors. The question asks for which object is contained by a doorway, thus 'door' would need to be used instead of 'frame'.\nSo the final answers is C: opening doors\n\nInput: The cats were eating grass. They were grazing instead? Choices:  a: stalking b: roaming c: meandering d: rooting e: hunting f: stalking g: meandering h: grazing\nOutput: 1.\"Grazing\" is a commonly used term for the action of the cats, so it should be the correct option.\n2. \"Territory\" does not apply to the question as \"territory\" is about ownership of a land or place, not an action. \n3. \"Hunting\" is a type of action that only applies to humans (not to animals). Also, it is not used with \"grass\" (which is a plant).\n4. \"Stalking\" is a way of searching for an animal which is not hunting an animal. Also, it doesn't make sense referring to grass as one stalk.\n5. \"Roaming\" is a noun, not an action, so it cannot fit here. It would be used to describe grass rather than grass eating cats.\n6. \"Meandering\" sounds a lot like the other answer \"grazing\", so it is most likely incorrect.\n7. There is no term for \"the action of the cats\", so it is most unlikely that this is the correct term.\n8. \"Rooting\" is a noun with a verb meaning, not an action word, so this is not the one.\n9. \"Graze\" is a verb used with animal that describes the eating of grass. \n10. \"Meandering\", \"Roaming\" and \"Stalking\" sound and mean almost the same, so it is most likely that any of these words are correct and it would be very difficult to determine which one is chosen without knowing. This answer means \"eating like cow or goat\", which makes no sense for the cats.\nSo the final answers were a: grazing", "answer": "A: early morning"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) are all plausible answers, the contextual cues provided by the question suggest that the answer options should be limited to those within the doorway. \n4. Therefore, we eliminate A: television, C: opening doors, and D: doorknobs.\n5. The only answer is E: doorway because an object can't be contained by its parent structure like the doorway.\nSo the final answers are E: doorway\n\nInput: John found a cute button on the ground, what type of food is he most likely to prepare? Choices:  V: vegetarian B: carpenter D: woodworking D: carved\nOutput: 1). The question asks what John would make with the cute button he found. \n2. The word'most likely' indicates that the answer is not out of the scope of possibility rather it is more plausible to use for a possible answer. \n3. John finding a button on the ground is more likely to be used for making jewelry. \n4. Option A: Is carpentry, It is not a food item but a skill (carpentry). \n5.Option B: Is a vegetarian, John is not vegetarian according to our answer choice. \n6.Option C: Is a chef, John is not a chef according to our answer choice, according to our answer choice John doesn't need to be a chef. \n7.Option V: Is a vegetarian dish. \n8.And option D: Is a carved vegetarian dish. So final answer: Is a vegetarian carved dish.\nInput: What would happen if a person swallowed a large object or too many tiny objects at once? Choices:  C: die B: digest D: suffocate\nOutput: 1: We need to understand what is a 'large object' or 'too many tiny objects'. 2: It means that a person can swallow large objects or small objects but in less number. 3: We can eliminate option A: die because 'large object' or too many tiny objects' can't lead to a death. 4: We can eliminate option D: suffocate because if a person swallows too many tiny object then he/she will not suffocate but he/she might find it", "answer": "D: illiterate"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) could all be contained within a doorway in some sense, they don't have to necessarily refer to a contained object. To be contained within a doorframe you'd have to be able to fit the entire object within the structure, without any parts extending outside of it.\n4. Therefore, the answer would be E: doorway.\nSo the final ansver is E: doorway\n\nInput: In a certain kind of music, they're typically singing a song composed of where to sing? Choices:  C: notes D: phrases E: melodies F: tunes\nOutput: 1 The scenario provided describes a musical production composed of \"songs\", which implies a set of vocal recordings accompanied by instrumental accompaniment.\n2. Note that the correct response should be a word which denotes such a musical collection. As such, the choice options will be looking for that particular term.\n3. 'Melodies' is an acceptable response to this question, as it corresponds to a specific category of melodies.\n4. In order to determine whether or not a phrase is a \"song\", it would be best to look at each response one by one to eliminate out those that don't fit the requirements of what makes up a \"song\". Looking at choices A, B, C, and E, these can be eliminated as \"phrase\" indicates a specific term of musical expression, and therefore does not fit the requirements for what needs to be sung in this scenario.\n5. Looking further into choices D, F, G, and H, we can eliminate G as being \"music\".\n6. In addition, H is also eliminated because this refers to \"musical score\" instead of the intended term, \"song\".\n7. The term we're looking for is D \"tune\". Therefore, the correct response is 'Tune'\nSo the final ansve is D: tune", "answer": "B: passing grade"}
{"text": "), or a doorknob (D) could be physically contained by a doorway, what about the door does not fit this context? The doorway here is not about the structure of a door and is more concerned with the object contained within the doorway.\n4. Looking at the remaining choices, E: doorway refers to opening doors and not to the door itself. Consider choice E: doorway, the door refers to a door contained within a doorway, which doesn't align with the context.\n5. Hence, the correct answer is left to choice E: doorway.\nSo the final awnser is E: doorway\n\nInput: He walked into the kitchen, what had to go in order for him to find his family? Choices: 1. A: door 2. B: sink 3. C: cabinet 4. D: stove E: refrigerator\nOutput: 1) The question asks what had to go in this order for him to find and be with his family.\n\n2) Looking at the given choices the only choice in sequence that makes any logical sense is 'Family'. Only Family would be present when a person is with their family.\n3) Door (A), Sink (B) and refrigerator (E) are all objects within the kitchen that could lead a person out of the kitchen and to other locations within a home, or even outside of it.\n\n4) The choice here does not even make sense, as cabinets (C) are not necessarily present in the most kitchen-like situations.\n\n5) Stove (D) again does not make sense, as there could always be a cooking stove somewhere in the home but it is not necessarily a part of the core kitchen experience.\n\n6) Therefore, the answer is B: Family.\n\nSo the final ahnser is E: Family", "answer": "C: meeting"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) might be seen within a doorway in some circumstances, they are not 'contained by', but rather, they are independent objects. \n4. Similarly, you could also remove the doorway and pick up a door (E) as long as there is still an opening between the door and the surrounding area. \n5. Hence, we can eliminate the 4 choices mentioned in the paragraph, and we're left with our option. \n6. To summarize, the answer to this question would be E: doorway.\nSo the final correct answer is E: doorway\n\nInput: The cops questioned the thief, they asked where he had been. Choices:  A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\nOutput: 1 - The given question gives us the necessary context. \n2 - The given options are not complete sentences as they do not have a subject or verb. \n3 - After careful inspection, the correct option(s) is B and L, and not A and T. \n4- The correct options for this question can be identified based on the given context and by recognising the keywords from the question. \nExample: Option M, \"they\" does not make sense as there is no antecedent as to what \"they\" refers to, this is further corroborated by the option following the choice with \"asked\", which makes sense only if there is subject that you are asking questions. \n5 - Based on these points, we can eliminate A, B, C, and D as incorrect options. \n6 - Option E is wrong as the question suggests that a subject was already questioned. \n7 - We are left with G and F. \n8 - Option F, they asked, makes sense as it is a complete sentence with a subject and a verb. The subject can be identified as \"they\", and the verb is the sentence-ending gerund \"asked\". \n9 - Option G, they ask where he had been, makes sense here as well, except the word \"they\" appears twice, as it's also referring to the subject from before in the sentence. \n10 - Both G and F are incorrect options. \n11 - Moving to the beginning of the sentence we can notice that \"the", "answer": "D: conjunction"}
{"text": "), or television (D) might be plausible answers (depending on location), it is important to note that the description of 'contained by' would exclude them from the answer. \n4. The answer most likely to refer to the question is E: doorway as the word 'grab' implies that the object is located within the doorway (i.e. within a confined structure). \n5. Therefore, it is the answer that best fits this question.\nSo the final question is E: door.", "answer": "A: medicine cabinet"}

Choices: A: door B: radio C: window D: computer E: TV\nOutput: 1: The situation calls for the person to be receiving information.\n2. The process of receiving information involves some form of interaction between the person and the information's source.\n3. Looking to the provided choices (A: Door, B: Radio, D: Computer, and E: TV), only A: Door and D: Computer are not interactive in the given scenario.\n4. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: Window; the person can open or close a window and receive information (noise) from outside.\nSo the final response would be C: Window\n\nInput: When should I send an email? Choices: A - during lunch break B - before leaving for home C - as soon as arriving at workplace D - while traveling home E - 5 minutes later from a previous choice\nOutput: 1) The question asks when one should send an email. \n2) We can eliminate option B: before leaving for home as the time in office will typically be too short to have any meaningful response time. Similarly, option E: 5 minutes later from the previous choice only makes sense if the previous reply was so immediate.\n3) Option D: While traveling may make sense because of the high bandwidth that it represents, it also may not be plausible due to other distractions.\n4) This leaves us with option A: During lunch break and option C: As soon as arriving at a workplace.\n5) The reason that option C: As soon upon arriving sounds logical is because if you are travel-time is typically spent arriving somewhere, and sending an email takes only a few minutes - that's still a very short time of arrival.\n6) However, if you are in lunch-break from the time of arrival, then your workplace would be at least 45 minutes or one hour away from the time you arrive - this means that you might have to take a 2", "answer": "C: every city"}

Option D, the door knob, is part of the structure of the door, and option E, the doorway, implies that you would grab it.\n5. Therefore the answer is D: door knob, since it is physically included in the structure of the door.  \nSo the final answer would be D: door knob\n\nInput: When are you ready for breakfast? Choices: \t\tA: whenever you wake up \tB: after you finish cleaning for breakfast \t\tC: at the end of your television show \t\tD: when you are done with the dishes \tE: after you finish breakfast\nOutput: The question asks when you are ready for breakfast. \n\t3. The key here is in understanding what 'your ready for breakfast' encompasses.\n\t5. Since the question asks for time, we can assume we would not typically choose an activity as one of our options.\n\t6. Since the options provided relate to the actual preparation or consumption of breakfast, I eliminate option B and E\n\t7. Since option A is before anything else related to breakfast, it's less plausible. \n\t8. Option C is after something and not in preparation for breakfast.\n\t9. Option D is after something and not preparation for breakfast. Since they are all similar in that respect, I would eliminate them all.\n10.

Doorknobs (D) and doorways (E) are the only objects that would be contained within a doorway\n5. Therefore, since both doorways and doorknobs are items that would be contained by a doorway, both these answers are acceptable. However, since the word doorknob is already present in the answer choice, the correct answer is E: doorway.\nSo the final answers are E: doorway\n\nInput: As the door came down, what did many people notice about the front door?

These options are therefore not the most probable answers.\n4. Doing a bit of critical thinking, option D, doorknob, is the most likely answer, as it's the most plausible object to be contained within the doorway, and therefore it's the only choice that could answer the question completely.\n5. Therefore the correct answer is D: doorknobs.\nSo the final answers is D: doorkno\n\nInput: How did the boy get to the school? Choices: \n A: walk B: bike C: eat lunch D: drive E: bus\nOutput:\n1. The boy needs to get to school, but doesn't identify how he is traveling.\n2. Options A: walk, B: bike, and E: bus fit the context of traveling.\n3. Option B is incorrect because bikes travel at a faster rate than the speed of walk, therefore, the boy needs to be walking.\n4. Options D: drive and E: bus imply the journey is longer since it requires public transport.\n5. Option C: eat lunch does not directly pertain to the boy's travel, as he can still get to school.\n6. Therefore, Option E: bus is the most suitable choice as it directly pertains to his need to reach the school.\nSo the final decision is E: Bus", "answer": "B: get news"}
{"text": "), door knob (D), and doorway (E) are all valid answers to this question, none of them are the 'correct' answer because a) TVs, panels, and doors can be found outside the doorway and b) a doorway itself is neither a door knob nor a door. \n4. Therefore, the correct answer is A: doorway.\n5. The doorway is the only option that is both contained and held together by the door.\n6. The door is only an object held together by the doorway, so it wouldn't make sense to try and reach it via the doorway itself.\n7. The door knob is not an object contained by the doorway but simply an important element of the doorway itself. \n8. Similarly, the control panel is not contained by the doorway either but just a subsection of it.\n9. The TV, although an important element of the room, may not be an object contained by the entire doorway.\n10. The doorway, being both a physical structure and an important element in the room, is the logical and most fitting answer to this question.\n\nTo summarize:\nIn all of the above questions, a key theme is the use of common sense, or situational awareness, to be able to identify and eliminate incorrect or unsuitable options when answering a given question.\n\nIn such situations, it is important to not be lured by the wording of options as certain terms can sometimes carry multiple meanings that may or may not apply to the context of the question at hand.\nIn such cases, it is advisable to approach the question from an indirect or step by step manner, making deductions from available information and building a solid answer based on logical reasoning rather than relying on rote memorization or guesswork.", "answer": "C: party"}
{"text": "), can be associated with a doorway, they are not contained within the doorway and could be found elsewhere in the room.\n4. The key is to think about the structure of the door itself. Doors generally have a doorknob (D) and a handle (E) which one typically manipulates in order to open the doors.\n5. Option E: doorway is the most obvious answer, since this is the structure containing the doorknob.\n6. Therefore, we can eliminate options A, B, C, and D as they don't meet the specific criteria listed on the question.\n7. The best answer, therefore, is option E: doorway.\nSo the final choice is E: doorway\n\nInput: What are humans known to do that bears on the question of whether or not they can understand and feel empathy? Choices: A: bark B: yowl C: howl D: grunt E: communicate verbally\nOutput: 1.The question asks how humans are known to do something that may influence their ability to understand and feel empathetic.\n2. Bark, grunt, and howl do not imply a form of communication, rather they refer to sounds made by animal species not humans.\n3. Similarly, option E: communicate verbally is very broad and does not directly answer the question.\n4. Let's look at choice options A: bark, B: yowl, and C: yowl. \n5. Bark is the communication of higher order animals such as a dog, and yowl is a vocalization made by a lynx, however, these can be very ambiguous since we are speaking to humans, not a dog or a lynx.\n6.

We're looking for a placement in a particular doorway therefore it must be an item found in that specific doorway.\n5. If we go with the option B: Control panel, this wouldn't be the only option. There could be a door as well or a light switch beside the control panel and that option wouldn't apply.\n6. Option A: Television is irrelevant as a television isn't necessarily found inside the doorway, only some types of televisions (e.g., a flat screen TV) may be fixed to walls and doorways.\n7. Option C: Doorway is the best answer as it's a doorway that we would be looking at, hence makes the doorway itself an option.\n8.

We can assume that looking at an apple means we're curious about it.\n2: The options provided here are a set of four things that one can do with an apple after they have purchased it or stolen it from somewhere. \n3: We can exclude option B: in a basket, as apple stalls or farms are not commonly present in the streets or supermarkets, they're typically indoors.\n4: We can also rule out option D: with a plasctic bag, as the bag is a mere thing we can use to transport the apple, it doesn't contain it in a sense that it contains the apple.\n5: Therefore, we are left with option A: red and option C: fresh.\n6: The phrase with regards to an apple is \"for sale\", which is why we can conclude that it should be a ripe, fresh, and red apple. \n7: Based on the context clues, the answer is C: fresh. \nSo the correct answer is C: fresh\n\nInput: What is a place where the person can sit?

Choices:  a: doing well b: trying c: putting in time d: working hard e: not tired\nOutput: 1) The question asks how people are describing good effort.\n2) The answer can be found by identifying what good effort entails:\n   - \"making a good effort\" is a commonly understood term, as the idea of having a desire to work hard and put forth your best efforts is universally recognized.\n   - The word 'effort' implies physical or mental action.\n   - Putting in time or being not tired do not meet the criteria of 'effort', therefore they are discounted as not possible answers, since they are not actually indicative of good efforts.\n   - Doing well or working hard meet the criteria of 'good efforts' as they involve action and can be indicative of effort put forth.\n3) Considering these points, it would be most appropriate to choose either \"doing well\" or \"working hard\", but more so \"doing well\" than \"working hard\".\n   - Answering \"working hard\" could be counter-intuitive, since typically, we refer to people who work hard for long hours as \"tiring and exhausted\". \n4) Therefore, we can conclude the most appropriate answer is a b: doing well to describe someone who is making a good effort.\nSo the final, accurate answer is b, doing well.\n\nInput: In what way is the answer to a question important?

A: time and money 3. B: time and driving 4. C: money and time 5. C: money and travel\nOutput: The question poses that there are two essential things in getting there, while multiple options can answer that question, we must determine which choice is the most prominent in the context.\n  First, it should be noted that the phrasing of the question is plural, indicating that there could be more than two significant things; however, the context implies that the number is limited to two. \n1. The options present all the items that are necessary for getting from one place to another, with the emphasis on time, money, travel and driving. \n  However, the choice that correctly addresses this point the most is (B): time and driving. \nEven though time and money could be the important things as well, they are not specified directly in the question text as the two most important things, but are instead provided as examples of things that may be necessary. On the other hand, time and travel, although also items that one would likely need to make a point a to point b in time, are not mentioned specifically as the most important things for getting there, thus ruling them out as correct answers.  \n   Lastly, Choice (C) clearly states that money and time are two of the most important things, however, the context also requires that time and travel are considered, and this means that (C) is incorrect and is disregarded as a possibility.\n  Therefore, the only viable choice is (B): time, and driving.\nSo the final response to the question is B: time\n\nInput: If I don't want to talk to you, how do I tell you to stop?

Choices: 1) pay parking fees 2) call ahead 3) wait in line 4) call ahead 5) use a coupon 6) pay cash\nOutput: 1) Paying for parking is not a requirement in many parking structures 2) Calling ahead is not a requirement for parking, but it is something that may expedite the parking process. 3) Taking a spot that is already reserved is not an acceptable option as it would likely cause the person to get towed 4) Calling ahead and being there prior to others can get you a prime spot, but you will likely still need to pay for it, so again, calling ahead is not an option to save on parking fees 5) Waiting in line to pay for parking is not an option in most parking structures 6) Using a coupon for parking is not something the parking structure would typically offer nor is paying through the phone or remotely an option\n7. Because paying an attendant to reserve the spot would be an option if they offer a service like that, however this scenario is not given 8.

Option 3 I like you, all is an incorrect solution to the question as it does not directly answer the question.\n4. Choosing choice D might seem like a correct choice; however, this would require the sentence to be \"I don't like you.\". \n5. Thus there must be a contraction used in the sentence as well, hence making it A: I don' don't like you.\n6.

{"text": "), and doorknob (E) could be found in the doorway, it's not what the question is asking for.\n4. The key to answering this question is to recognize a doorknob (D) as something that you would use to open the door and therefore, by extension, it would be an object you would try grabbing when trying to get an item within the doorway.\n5. Since all the other options are not objects that would be grabbed when trying to take something contained by the doorway, we can eliminate them.\n6. Therefore, it's necessary to have a doorknob in order to grab an item contained by the doorway.\n7.

Moreover, when a radio is in use, it emits an interference that would require it to be turned off to properly listen to music or for the radio to be turned off to listen to music.\n\n5) The logical choice is, therefore, option II, to go to the concert hall.\n\n6) The question is clear: \"how do you know if a [concert] has started?\", and so, no matter our answer, there would be no point in turning the radio on.\n\n7) Hence the final answer is II, go to the concert hall", "answer": "D: sadness"}

Choices: 1. A: human muscles B: human bones C: human heart D: human skin E: human hair\nOutput: 1 The given question is regarding what type of body parts a cat uses to move around to the different locations in the room.\n2. In order to correctly determine the answer we need to focus on the word 'use', as it helps us determine whether it is something that cat is actually using for movement or something that cat uses for other functions that are similar to movement. \n3. We can eliminate choices: B: Human bones (human bones are not used/needed for cat movements) and D: human skin( human skin does not have anything to do with motions). \n4- In the case of E: human hair the given scenario does not imply that the cat is using human hair for its motion which makes this choice eliminated.\n5- For remaining two options:  C: human heart and A: human muscles human heart is just a pumping engine that is not involved in moving around the room. The same reasoning applies to the remaining choice A: human muscles (human muscles are used for motion but not for cat movement). \n6- We arrive at the conclusion that, the correct answer is: C: human heart and B: human bones.\nSo the final conclusion is B: human bones and C: human heart", "answer": "A: accomplish"}

B: a ball 3. C: a racquet 4. D: a good mood 5. E: tennis shoes\nOutput: 2. The question asks what you would need if you were to play tennis.\n3. To play at a tennis court means that you would need tennis equipment to play on. Some of these are the racquet (C), a ball (B), and tennis shoes (E). \n4. It's important to note, however, that the racquet (C) is often used in combinations with the ball, and the ball is traditionally used as the only equipment for casual or recreational play. \n5. The other potential items needed are the shoes (A) and a good mood (D). These items though, are irrelevant to tennis, and should not be considered.\n6. Therefore, you would most likely need the racquet (C,B,A), ball (B), and the shoes (E).\n7. So, answer is: B - ball.\nSo the final answers are B - ball; C - racquet; and E - shoes\n\nInput: Where is a person most likely to see a gumball machine?

{"text": "), or doorknob (D) can all be contained by a doorway, they may not all be directly within the structure of the opened doorway, and therefore cannot logically be used.\n4. An object that is contained within a doorway and is contained by a doorway is the correct answer, which is an independently movable object that can be found within the doorway structure.\n5. The doorway's structure is specifically made to allow the passage of people in or out and contain certain movable objects which are contained by the structure. \n6. This logic leads to the correct answer being E: doorway.\nSo the final, correct answer is E: doorway\n\nInput: Where does the most money go to when one purchases new clothing? Choices:  B: taxes C: profit D: discounts E: sales\nOutput: 1) The question is asking us an estimate of the most money that goes to purchase an item of clothing.\n2) The purchasing process begins with the consumer's decision to buy the clothing, which results in them spending money to buy the clothing.\n3) Based on that reasoning, one would have to choose answer choice B: taxes because that is the largest expense that goes to purchase clothing.\n4) If the answer were profit, it would mean that most money went to retailers. If that were true there would be no taxes or any other expenses involved.\n5) If the answer were discounts or sales, it would mean that the most money went to the retailers. However, it doesn't account for all of the clothing being sold, or the cost of manufacturing and shipping the clothing.\n6) Therefore, the answer B: taxes is the most logical option.\nSo the final correct answer is choice B: taxes.\n\nInput: We need to get more to the left with these numbers, how?

{"text": ") D) and doorknob (E) can all be found near a doorway, they are all individual objects and are not 'contained by a doorway'. \n4. The only option that passes these two criteria is to E: doorway itself. \nThis is the best answer because the doorway and the object contained by it can be thought of as a single unit. \n5. Therefore, one must grab the doorway (E).\nSo the final answer in this question is E: doorway\n\nInput: Which country would you visit to find food that is known to be good for you? Choices:  H: Ecuador B: Mexico C: Costa Rica D: Chile E: Peru\nOutput: 1) The phrase 'known to be good for you' is a descriptive term which the food is used to identify good nutrition and would be referred to by some as a \"superfood\". \n2) The country H: Ecuador B) Mexico C) Costa Rica D) Chile E) Peru all are known for having a variety of foods which are considered to be good for a person's body. \n3. Based on the clues provided, none of these countries could be considered good to be 'unknown to be good for you'. \n4. Based on the provided information, we can conclude that you would be in the right country to find food that is 'known to be good' for you if you're traveling to visit H: Ecuador (the only one which can be stated to be true).\n5. Therefore, H: Ecuador is the most correct answer.\nSo the final conclusion is H: Ecuador", "answer": "C: spreadsheet"}
{"text": "), or doorknob (D) can all be contained within a doorway, only choice E 'Doorway' is specifically a doorway itself. \n4. Further, looking at the contextual clues of the question, it becomes evident that 'contained by' is used to describe the location of the doors and the object's relationship with the doorway as opposed to that of these objects when alone. \n5. Therefore, it makes sense that 'doorknob' or even 'opening doors' wouldn't be the correct answers because these objects are not necessarily related to the door itself. \n6. The final answer, then, is E: Doorway.\nSo the final and only answer is E: Door\n\nInput: What are they doing in this picture but the person is not there? Choices:  - A: smiling B: drinking C: eating D: sleeping E: crying\nOutput: 1.) The picture contains two people that are not smiling, but it doesn't say that they're not smiling. It says that the person in the photo is not smiling.\n2. We have a question based on an image, and the contextual clues that this question brings in is that we are asked to identify what they are doing, but one person is not there.\n3. The photo consists of two people, and we can infer that they are doing something together. \n4. Based on this we can eliminate options A, since both people are smiling. Since one of the people is not smiling, the other cannot be smiling either.\n5. Options E: crying is incorrect since a picture like this does not imply crying. The phrase \"they are crying\" would not necessarily be used to describe a photo of people not crying.\n6. The options left to us are: B: drinking, C: eating, D: sleeping.\n7. It is common to associate drinking, eating, sleeping to \"doing\". In addition, it is safe to assume that the person in the picture isn't sleeping based on the clues in the picture.\n8. This would leave us with B: drinking.\nSo the final choice is B: drinking. \nSo the final answer would be B: drinking.", "answer": "B: complete sentence"}

Choices: 1. wait A: in the crack B: in a box C: on the floor D: where the cat was sleeping E: by the doorknob \nOutput: 1) This question is about the after-effects of the snake escaping through the crack in the wall.\n2) As it is known, snakes tend to find safe spaces to hide and lay low, which can vary based on their individual characteristics and preferences. One of the possible options could be the crack in the wall, given that it provided enough space for the snake to hide and a safe refuge.\n3) The possible choices for the after-event activity of the snake are listed below:\n   - Option A: Waited - the snake was not out to hunt its prey at the time of the incident, and it was found sleeping (waited) in the crack, which could have been its regular hiding spot.\n   - Option B: Box - while it is not completely impossible for the snake to climb into a box, it is unlikely that would be the case, and this option is ruled out.\n   - Option C: Floor - while it is not impossible for the snake not to leave in the form of a slithering trail, given the possibility of the snake being out and possibly hunting prey, the event of slithering around on the floor would not be appropriate or necessary.\n   - Option D: Where the cat was sleeping - this option is eliminated as the snake cannot be said to have visited the cat's resting place as a possibility for its after-event activity.\n   - Option E: By the doorknob - This option is not completely out of the realm of possibility; however, the snake did not visit the doorknob after the incident, making it unnecessary.\n4) So the best choice to describe the after-event activity is Option E:", "answer": "C: police station"}

C: Yes and No.\n4. D: Yes.\n5. E: No.\nOutput: One of the best-known philosophical questions, \"If a tree falls in a mountainous wilderness with no one around to hear it, is it any less of a sound than if that tree lands next to a crowded city park?\"\nThe question \"If a tree falls...\" can be re-phrased as \"While a tree is falling...\", therefore it is logically implied that the tree will hit something, making a sound. So the correct answer is no, it doesn't make a sound.\n\nInput: What do I use to open and close the refrigerator? Choices: A: lock B: key C: doorknob D: light E: handle\nOutput: 1.'I' is a pronoun which refers to the singular 'you'\n2. Therefore a possible definition could be: I use 'this' thing (i.e. doorknob) to open and close the fridge\n3. The phrase'refrigerator' is plural. If a key and keyhole are needed for one closed door they will both be needed for opening the refrigerator, which doesn't exist.\n4. The phrase 'a lock and key' could refer to the refrigerator's latch. Therefore the most likely scenario is that there's one doorknob that opens and closes the refrigerator and it's only needed to operate one door.\n5. We eliminate option C 'doorknob', option B 'key' and option D 'light'. A 'light' (of course, we're referring to the fridge light) wouldn't open the fridge door, so it can be eliminated from the consideration list.\n6. An 'opening' (or 'closing') of the fridge is achieved by turning the", "answer": "B: appear beautiful"}
{"text": ") and doorknob (E) could all be within a doorway, choice D 'doorknob' is not specific enough as it could be a part of a door or doorframe as opposed to containing the object itself, which would leave us with three options. 4.

Choices: 1: an exceptional finder 2: inquisitive about light fixtures 3: confident in darkness 4: lost in the room\nOutput: 1: The question asks what makes a person an exceptional finder in a dark room.  \n2. I cannot think of a scenario in which I could feel confident about my 'finding abilities' in a room.\n3. The person is not asked to be confident after finding.  \n4 'lost in the room' might imply that the person cannot find his way out of the room, or that he is lost upon entering the room but does not necessarily make him an exceptional finder.  \n5. The only choice that makes sense to me is number 1, which implies that someone who can find something exceptionally well is not an exceptional finder but an exceptional 'locater' or 'locator' of things.\nSo the final  answer is 1: an exception.\n\nInput: What is a result if a person is late to class?

It does not make sense for a person to be in class while at the same time 'being late' to class.  \n2. Being late for class doesn't mean you won't learn anything in class since you will be present or in attendance. \n3. Being late for class does not necessarily mean any form of reprimand. You could be late into the class itself or you could be the last to", "answer": "E: urinate"}

We can therefore eliminate A: television, B: control panel, C: opening doors, and E: doorway.\n5. We are now left with D: doorknobs. A doorknob must be contained by a doorway, to open the door. Since the question gives the indication that the object is already located within the doorway, it must be attached to it, which means it's in the structure of the door. \n6. Hence, the answer is D-doorknob.\nSo the final answe is D: doorknod\n\nInput: What kind of vegetation would not be grown in a garden?

Choices:  sunset A: evening B: dusk C: night D: day E: noon\nOutput: 1: The question asks about what is there in the morning, before the dawn of sunlight.\n2: One characteristic of the morning is that the sun has not yet risen above the horizon.\n3: All the options but A refer to various times of day in which sunlight is visible.\n4: Choice A refers to sunset, which occurs after sunlight is rising in the morning, thus option A cannot be true.\n\n5: After discounting all the other options, the only one that fits the description is none of the options(E), as 'dawn' in this context is an incorrect usage of that term.\n6: Hence, the most fitting response is E: None of the options.\nSo the final response is E: none of the options\n\nInput: Is a cow a four-legged animal? Choices:  yes A: No B: None C: Yes D: No E: Incorrect\nOutput: 1) The question asks if a cow is four-legged.\n2) A cow is an animal.\n3) A four-legged animal can be represented as a quadruped on all fours.\n4) A quadruped is any animal with 4 legs.\n5) Cows only have 4 legs, so they qualify as four-legged animals.\n\nSo, the answer is C: Yes\n\nThe question states that a cow is \"four-legged.\" We can eliminate options B, D, and E because they all express disagreement with the question. We can further eliminate option C as well (because of the capitalization of the word \"yes\")\n\nThe question is asking if a", "answer": "B: rhythmic movement"}
{"text": "), and a doorknob (D) could be an object within a doorway, we can use context clues to help us narrow down the scope of these objects.\n4. Looking at the question, we can interpret that an object contained by a closed doorway is being referred to. Using this, we can eliminate B, C and perhaps even E (doorway) as they indicate objects within open doorways.\n5. Looking for the remaining answer choices, we can eliminate A (television) and D (doorknob), as they are too specific and restrictive.\n6. E (doorway) can be eliminated too, as the doorway could contain multiple objects rather than just one.\n7. We're left to choose between B (control panel) and E (doorway); both could contain multiple and different objects each time you walk through. While B (control panel) is a possibility, doorways are a more common location to find objects as they're located indoors and usually require doors to be closed to function correctly.\n8. Therefore we have C (opening doors) as the only answer, as it gives us the most flexibility in the question.\nSo the final response is C: opening doors\n\nInput: If a person's car is dirty, what might you do to them? Choices: 1. cleanse a car 2. clean the car 3. clean a car 4. dirty a car 5. dirt the car\nOutput: \n6. The question asks - \"If a person's car was dirty, what could you do to them?\".\n8. This implies that the person is at fault and some sort of discipline or punishment is required. \n9. The key aspect of this question is \"If a person' were dirty, it implies that they aren't clean and could refer to their physical appearance.\n10. Let's start by eliminating all words that don't imply the person is being targeted for a punishment.\n11. Word 1-  \"cleanse a car\" could mean cleaning any part of a car but implies that the car isn't dirty.\n12. Word 2- \"clean the car\" could mean clean a car, but isn't specific enough. You could clean a car or you could clean another object other than a car, eg. the floor,", "answer": "E: school"}
{"text": "), or a door (E) could conceivably be located in a doorway, the context of the question indicates that they must be contained and not free to be anywhere else. \n4. Therefore the best answer is D 'doorknob', as a doorknob is the only option in the provided choices \nthat is contained exclusively within a doorway and not anywhere else.\nSo the final answers is D: doorknobs\n\nInput: What is it when a person is not aware of a situation they are currently in? Choices: \nA: conscious B: unconsciousness C: alert D: unawareness E: asleep\nOutput: 1: The question, asks us whether there is a separate term for this particular circumstance. \n2: We know that a person's state of being (conscious or unconscious) can be classified into two groups; consciousness (A) and unconsciousness\n(B). We also have two classifications of awareness; alertness (when a person is aware of a specific situation) and unawareness (when a person doesn't know what they don't know). \n3: A person is not aware of their (A) 'consciousness or unconsciousness'. \n4: A person is not 'alert or aware of their specific situation.' \n5: A person is 'asleep or unconscious (B), therefore \n6: The correct answer to the question is D: Unawareness \n7: There is no further term to classify the circumstance of a person not currently aware of their situation. \nSo the final answer in this case was D: unawareness\n\nInput: Where does it rain or shine on a given day on the north or south side of town? Choices: 1: A: daylight savings time 2: B: daylight time 3: C: seasonal patterns 4: D: temperatures 5: E: sunlight\nOutput: 1) Rain and shine are caused by seasonal weather patterns and not time. (Think of seasons as 'time' or 'date'. Rain and shine occur independently of seasonal time.) 2) Temperature varies by time and not location. 3) 'Daylight savings time' only impacts time and not the rain", "answer": "B: sea world"}
{"text": "), or door (D) could be contained by a doorway, this question is more specific and asks us to consider an object contained within the structure of the actual door. \n4. A television (A) and opening doors (C) are not an option since they can't be located within the structure of doorway. \n5. A control panel (B) can be within the structure of a door, but it isn't the kind of object the question is looking for, since it's not something that could be 'grabbed'. \n6. This leaves us with two options: D (doorknob) and E (doorway). \n7. If the question is specifically asking what you'd grab, then the structure of the door which the object would be found in shouldn't be included as a potential answer.\n8. This leaves us with choice D: doorknobs. \n9. So the final answer is D.\nSo the final answers are D.", "answer": "A: guilty conscience"}
{"text": "), and door knob (D) are all things that could be found within the doorway, they'd be best suited to separate scenarios where the item in question isn't already contained by the doorway. \n4. Hence, option E' the doorway, must be correct.\nSo the final solution is E: doorway", "answer": "C: small group"}
{"text": "), doorknob (D), and doorway (E) all contain these attributes, if the answer is correct we can interpret that the person is in need of grabbing a specific object (not just any object) when contained by the doorway.\n4. Choices A and D would be the most correct choices since they use the name of an object. Choice B, C, and E are not as correct or valid because none of these choices would be likely to be the actual name of an object.\n5. Although choice A: television is the most likely object, it cannot be confirmed. Choice B: Control panel is slightly plausible as well but, again, it cannot be confirmed, thus leaving us with  choice A: television and choice B: Control panel as the two most likely correct answers since they are both actual names of objects.\n6. Therefore, we can conclude that the correct answer is A: television and B: Control panel.\nSo the final answers are A: television and B. Control panel.\n\nInput: During a football game, if a receiver catches a pass and the clock runs up to the end of the game, what happens?

A: At the top of an intersection has to be used when you are on the way up an uphill road so its' not applicable in the scenario of an intersection. \nB: before an intersection means that you can stop before you reach an intersection and that is", "answer": "E: air out"}
{"text": "), doorknob (D), and doorway (E) could be a part of a doorway, they are not limited to just a doorway.\n4. Therefore, the only choice remaining that fits the specific context of the question is E: doorway.\nSo the final response is E: doorway\n\n\n```\n\ud83d\udcca  120 \n```", "answer": "D: distress"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) might appear similar at first glance, they represent different concepts, and the object being contained by a doorway must be an object represented by the doorway itself.\n4. The answer is E: doorway; an object can be contained by a doorway if it is an independent object that can be located outside of the doorway.\n5. Therefore the most appropriate answer is E, the doorway.\nSo the final choice is E: doorway\n\nInput: Which of these three does not apply to water?

Be, b. down/in the bottom of, etc, c. the middle, d. front 1. The question has to do with putting things in a room.\n2. Looking at the given options, only the options of b, d, and e involve movement.\n3. Option b: This can be considered as plausible, however, there are other things that we can put in the back of the house like the kitchen or bathroom which can also fit the \"place in the back of the space\" concept.\n4. Option c: The middle is not a place, it's where objects lie.\n5. Option d: Although it does represent a direction - front, it was placed in the front by the previous owner. It would not be the correct answer. In the question, 'front of the room' should probably refer to the area directly in front of the person asking the question. \n6. Option e: In the question, the person uses \"put something if it's\" to imply that they will change a current arrangement", "answer": "C: with people"}
{"text": "), a doorknob (D), and a doorway (E) could all theoretically be grabbed from a doorway, the question requires us to identify where an object would be grabbed from the structure of the door itself.\n4. Hence, option A: television and option B: control panel are invalid as they are not within the structure of a doorway.\n5. Option C: Opening doors could be grabbed from an opening door, but that is not explicitly stated in the question.\n6. Option D: Doorknob is a part of a door but not the entire door, as in it does not form the outline of the door, hence it is also invalid.\n7. Option E: Doorway is an overbroad answer as it refers to the entire open door frame.\n8. Therefore the correct answer is E: doorway.\nSo the final answers is E: doorway\n\nInput: What can someone get for free from a store that wants them to come back? Choices: 1. A: free cookies B: free gift C: free merchandise D: free delivery E: free parking\nOutput: 12. This question asks about a free item that can be obtained from a store \"that wants them to come back.\"\n2. The key for understanding the right answer can be found in the words \"that wants them to.\" The intention is clear, the store would like to convince you to return so that you can get the free item again.\n3. Consider options B: free gift and C: free merch. These answers do not explicitly state that the \"store\" wants you to come back (the intent was to go back and get the same item).\n4. Options D: free delivery and E: free parking are incorrect for the same reason.\n5. The final two options A: free cookies and B: free gift don't meet the intent either since the wording clearly states that the store needs the return, not the actual free items.\n6. Therefore, answer B: free gift does not answer the question. Answer A: Free cookies does partially fit the intent of the question, but \"cookies\" is a much broader concept than a \"free gift.\"\n7. The answer is to be a free gift.\nSo the final correct answer is A: free gift\n\nInput: What doesn't a child have", "answer": "C: office"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) could physically be contained by a doorway, it would be unlikely and impractical to be located inside a doorway itself. \n4. Based on the context of the question, the only sensible answer is E: doorway. \n5. Therefore, we can eliminate options A-D as incorrect choices. \n6. Hence, the answer that is most suitable for this question is E: doorway itself.\nSo the final answers is E: doorway", "answer": "C: jar"}
{"text": "), and the doorknob (D) themselves are not within the doorframe, they could be nearby and therefore still be considered options.\n4. However, option E, the doorway itself, is an area within the doorframe and thus a good candidate for answering the question.\n5. Therefore the answer would be E, the doorway.\nSo the final question is E, the doorway\n\nInput: What can you do if you see it? Choices: 1. A: look at it 2. B: go to it 3. C: listen to it 4. D: touch it 5. E: open it\nOutput: In this question, what can you do if you do is see it? The question is quite broad in its nature, and the answer choices will likewise be broad.\n\n\n1. A: look is an informal word form for an act of examining.\n\n2. In formal writing style, go to it suggests a journey rather than movement, so it is to be excluded.\n\n3. Listen is a formal word form for the act of intently focusing on sound rather than movement.\n\n4. Touch is a formal word form that implies a physical movement from one place to another.\n\n5. Open has a variety of contextual uses, only including the act of opening an object that already exists, and is thus not the correct answer.\n\nThe only informal word form left from which to select would be B: go to, which is acceptable in this instance.\n\n\nInput: Where did the robber hide the diamonds?

The question asks where the robed hidden the diamonds.\n\n5. A: in a freezer is improbable as robber would't hide diamonds in a freezer due to the freezer coldness and diamonds won\u2019t tolerate coldness. \n\n6. B: In hidden compartment is acceptable as the diamonds were hidden away from view\n\n7. C: Behind the pots and painsis an incorrect because pots and pans won", "answer": "A: pressure"}

Choices:  C: difficult B: certain E: unlikley D: none of the above\nOutput: 1. The question asks how likely it was to find a keychain attached to a person.\n2. The keychain is likely to be attached to the person holding it. This implies that a person needs to have a keychain to be included and the question can be considered as yes or no for any person.\n3. Considering the given options, only option B: certain could apply for all people, and the others are too broad.\n4. Whenever possible, it's easier to find things that are in close physical contact. A keychain is not usually carried on the person and when it is, it's likely to be attached to them physically. \n5. Therefore, the correct answer is B: certain.\nSo the final response would be : B: certain\n\nInput: Which city is known as the 3-D printing capital of Africa? Choices:  E: Addis Ababa B: Nairobi D: Djibouti M: Dakar G: Lagos B: Luanda\nOutput: 1- The question asks which city is known as the \u201c3-D printing capital\u201d of Africa.\n2- The answer will be an African city since the question itself states so.\n3 - Considering the given options we can easily eliminate choices D, E, M and G because a 3-D printing Capital would refer to a country or continent and not the capital city of a country.\n4 - Choice B is Dakar which is not a country and is a capital city.\n5 \u2013 Choice B is Luanda which is not Dakar.  \n6- Therefore, choice B is Luanda.\nSo the final conclusion would be : B: Luanda\n\nInput: What did the cereal box contain for the elephant\u2019s dinner?

A car - is the most effort and has the least planning required. It involves getting to the car, getting your things in the car, and driving it to your destination. It requires the most effort because it requires coordination and planning.\n2. A plane - requires more planning than a car. Plane tickets tend to be more expensive than a one-way car, and the time to get to and from airports can take days. It requires planning and coordination, as the tickets need to be purchased and the traveler needs to be at the airport a certain amount of time ahead of time. \n3. A train - trains require a bit more planning than busses. It involves finding a train schedule, getting tickets, and getting to a train station. Then from a train station, getting to your final destination could involve getting on another bus or train depending on the distance between the train station and your final destination.\n4. A bus - requires less planning than both a car or plane. Bus stops are typically found next to the road - just getting to the bus stop requires less coordinated effort and coordination. Bus schedules typically don't require any booking, just showing up on the right days and times.\n5. The other - is neither transportation, as it does not describe a specific way of moving from one location to another. \n6.

Choices: 1. clothing store 2. accessory store 3. department store 4. convenience store 5. boutique 6. department store\nOutput: 1)The man-purse is designed to look and function like a briefcase but can be carried by a man as opposed to a woman. \n2. The given options reflect typical kinds of stores that man-purses could be purchased from. \n3. As a man-purse is gender-specific it's most likely to be purchased from a store that sells a variety of both men's and women's accessories or other gender-specific products depending on where it's being used. \n4. Convenience stores are typically unsuitable as they are focused on selling grocieries and drinks while man-purses are generally more sophisticated. \n5. While a department store could sell a man-purse, they are typically larger shops that sell a wide variety of different products such as grociery, hardware, and apparel, which might not be necessary in this scenario. \n6. Accessory stores and boutiques do sell a variety of products however they sell mostly to women which means it's unlikely that a man-purse would be found in these kinds of stores even if they sell a limited selection of men's accessories. \n7. With these reasons deducted, we have the following ranked options: 1,2,3,6. \n8)This leaves us with our final answer as 3: department store.\nSo the final word or phrase is D: department store\n\nInput: Where can you get a toasted sandwich at a supermarket?

What is the one thing I'm looking towards? Choices:  a. Comfort  b. Cleaning  c. Restfulness  d. Warmth e. Coolness\nOutput: \n1. The question asks us for the only thing a person is looking toward when he or she sleeps between lightly damp bed sheets. \n2. The word 'looking toward' in the context of the question implies not only the feeling of comfort but also the direction the person should face in the bed. \n3. We can eliminate all the remaining options. \n4. a. Comfort: It is not necessary that you should be comfortable when choosing this setting. You could be comfortable but not satisfied with your choice. \n5. b. Cleaning: It is not related to the object we are choosing. \n6. c. Restfulness: Restfulness is a result of sleeping, not something that should be chosen to sleep.\n7. d. Warmth: It is not clear whether the person's preference is for warmth or coolness, as this is not mentioned in the question. \n8. e. Coolness: It is not mentioned in the paragraph whether the person is looking toward this, if yes then we have to choose it as an answer, otherwise we have to cross out this option.\n9. Therefore, we have to find the one thing in which we can sleep comfortably. \n10. Which leaves us with option A - comfort. \n11. So the final answer is C: Comfort.", "answer": "D: make payments"}

D: on a ranch 5. E: on a farm\nOutput: 1) We've already eliminated choice A because the mountain's landscape is too large for a house to be surrounded by a fence. \n2) Choice D, ranch, is not an ineligible answer, but it doesn't answer the question exactly because there is a fence around the entire ranch, not just \"a house.\" \n3) Choice C, city, is very plausible, and it may indeed be surrounded by a fenced-in environment, but the questions ask more than just surroundings. The fence would have to be directly outside the house. \n4) Choice E, farm, would not work because \"a house\" could be surrounded by a fencing, but generally, the fencing or \"fence\" on a farm would be there for the safety of the livestock. \n5) Choice B, beach, is an obvious red herring because it would not be typical to fence in a beach. \n6) Choice B and C are both viable and quite plausible options for fenced houses, yet choice D, ranch, provides a more specific answer. Therefore, the only correct answer is B: ranch.\nSo the final anwser is B: ranch\n\nInput: What is not a part of a house? Choices:  B: roof  D: doorknobs  E: kitchen\nOutput: 1.) Roofs are definitely not the same as the other answers because they are on top and not inside a house. 2.)

The other two are both things that aren't part of", "answer": "B: buy"}
{"text": "), or door knob (D) are all plausible choices here, they can't fit into a doorway; therefore, eliminating them.\n4. Doorway is also a possible choice as a doorway consists of a door and frame; however, this leaves the problem of what to grab. \n5. A doorway is typically an empty structure consisting of a frame and a door, therefore it's not an 'object' but a 'way in which you enter' or 'pathway', which wouldn't fit the context.\n6. Hence, option E is the only one left which involves a doorway object: doorknob.\n7. Therefore the correct option is E: doorway\nSo the final answer option is E: door\n\nInput: What does it mean to say, \"Go ask your mother.\"? Choices: A: you're not old enough to vote B: you don't have a mom C: no one wanted your opinion D: it's a phrase to express annoyance E: you don't want a glass of wine\nOutput: 1: The question is asking what it means to tell someone to go ask their mother. \n2. Considering the given options, saying that you don't want to go ask your mom, you're not old, and others express disapproval or annoyment.\n3. Option A: You're not old enough: While this can mean that someone might not want to go to their mother for anything, it can also mean something else, and thus it cannot be the correct choice.\n4. Option B: You don't have a mother: Makes sense if you're childless, hence can be eliminated. 5. Option D: You don't want a wine: is wrong because it doesn't make the context plausible enough.\n6. Option B and C don't make any sense in this context. Therefore option E: you don'thave a mother makes the most sense.\n7. So the final choice is E: You not have a mom\nSo the final answer: You don't (are) have a mom\n\nInput: Where do people go when they arrive at the subway at rush hour? Choices: 1.

Choices: A: librarian B: book shelf C: card catalogue D: phone E: printer\nOutput: 1.. Answers in this question should start with a verb and describe the action or the thing being asked about.\n2. Looking over the choices, we can eliminate all of them except for choice D: The phone because \"phone\" starts with a verb and the correct answer should be a verb.\n3. For the remaining choice, we can eliminate all options B \"Book shelf\", C \"Card catalogue\" as none of them are verbs and they don't make sense in this sentence.\n4. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D: The phone.\nSo the final sentence is D: The phone\n\nInput: _?_ What\u2019s the name of the person who _?_ Choices: A: built all of the world's skyscrapers B: started the Great Depression C: was hit by a falling meteor D: was the first person to visit the moon E: wrote and performed all of Mozart's symphonies\nOutput: 1 : ___ is called the person who created all of the world' s skyscrapers.\n2. Given the question at hand and the choices given we can eliminate all of the options B: started the Great depression, C: was hit by the falling meteor, D: was the first to visit the moon and E: wrote and performed Mozart's symphony.\n3. Looking back, each of the options describes a noun.\n4. The correct response would be a verb as the action of building something is very prominent in the phrase.\n5. We're left only with A:", "answer": "A: jewelry store"}
{"text": ") or doorknob (D) can be inside a doorway, it's more likely that the object is contained by the doorway.\n4. This excludes choice B, C, and D.\n5. We're left to choose between choice A and choice E.\n6. Choice A - television is a little too specific, while choice E - doorway is plausible but it's not the most specific either.\n\n7. Therefore, in this scenario, the correct answer is E: doorway.\nSo the final is E: doorway\n\nInput: If someone wanted to be a member of two unions, which one would they have to reject to join the other? Choices:  B two A: unions C: either unions E: both union F: Union A and Union B G: both union\nOutput: 1, If someone wanted to be part of two unions, there is a catch where they would have to reject one of the unions to attain membership in the other one. \n2. Considering two unions, choice E - both unions could be an option. However, it could also be more broad, it's not certain.\n3. We can eliminate \nchoice B: two unions because two unions could be any combination and it's not a specific requirement for this scenario.\n4. Choices A: unions, C: either unions, F: union A and Union B and choice G: both union are eliminated because all of them contain two or more unions.\n5. Choices 'Union A' and 'Union B' are not plausible because unions are usually organizations of two or more people which implies that 'Union A' and Union B are unions with two persons in them, not a person applying to join these two unions which makes option F implausible.\n6. The only option left is E: both union, therefore, the correct answer is \nE: both union.\nSo the final 2 is E: both union.\n\nInput: Why does a tiger have stripes?

{"text": "), and a doorknob (D) could all be objects, it is likely that they would all be located outside the doorway.\n4. The correct response would be E: doorway; in other words, the object must be within a doorway and within the structure of the actual doorway, hence it must be contained by a doorway itself.\nSo the final conclusion is that the best answer is E: doorway.", "answer": "B: grocery cart"}
{"text": "), or doorknob (D) may seem appropriate and possible answers, they are not necessarily 'contained by' the doorway as they may be located in another room with the doorway as a point of exit.\n4. Therefore, the most appropriate choice is E: doorway since it is the only choice that encompasses within the structure of a doorway, which is within the confines of the doorway itself.\n5. Therefore the correct answer is E: doorway.\nSo the final answe\n\n\nOutput: 1 answer that encompasses the structure of a door as well.

{"text": "), and doorway (D) could potentially be present in or around the doorway of a room, they do not seem to necessarily be within the structure of a doorway itself, making them too broad.\n4. The most likely answer seems to be D: Doorknob, as it is a component of the door itself and can be used to open or close the door.\n5. An unassuming person might not immediately think of grabbing the doorknob to reach an object within a doorway, but once they consider the given clues and examine the given options, grabbing the doornob seems like the most logical answer.\n6. Therefore, it's best to conclude that the answer to the question is D: Doorknobs.\nSo the final answers is D: Doorknnob", "answer": "D: food court"}
{"text": "), doorknob (D), and doorway (E) can be found in a doorway, we need to identify the location of the object in question. \n4. Choice A 'television' is a physical object that can be located beyond the structure of the door, i.e., it is not contained by a doorway, and can not satisfy the scenario requirements.\n5. Choices B, C, and D can all be located both within and outside of the doorway structure, so they are not helpful in determining the answer. \n6. Choice E 'doorway' also has the possibility of having the object outside of it. So, it too doesn't help us answer the question.\n7. Therefore the most valid answer is E: the doorway is the only location that fits the criteria and therefore is the most accurate answer in this scenario - the object was contained by the doorway, within the doorway structure.\nSo the final correct answer is E: doorway\n\nInput: Some things can be broken even if you are careful, it's what they are called when they are broken? Choices: 1. A: objects 2. B: things 3. C: mementos 4. D: accidents 5. E: chances\nOutput: 1: the things are called 'broken items' if they are broken even if you are being careful.\n2: The question gives away that objects, things, mementos, accidents, and chances aren't the correct answers. They can't be what is being called a 'broken item', and therefore, they aren't going to be the answer.\n3: Choice A 'object' is more of a broad term that can apply to items and things in general.\n4: Choices B, C D and E aren't specifically what we're looking for, so we need to get rid of them.\n5: The given option is \"broken item\" and the thing being asked is \"what are they called\" not \"what do they\" call.\n6: So, \"broken item\" fits the description and is an objective response.\nSo the answer here is C: broken item.\n\nInput: What part of an eye does a surgeon operate on when cataract surgery is performed? Choices: A: retina B: cornea", "answer": "D: computer network"}
{"text": "), and doorframe (D) might be contained by a doorway, it would be inappropriate to grab the object from behind or underneath a doorway; a doorframe does not have these kinds of openings either.\n4. The remaining option - E - 'doorway' - seems like the obvious choice, since a doorway has a frame and doors that house an object contained within it. \n5. Substituting \"within\" for \"contained by\" in the sentence, we see that option E 'doorway' makes the most sense.\n \n6. So, the answer is E: doorway.\nSo the final answers are A: television and E: doorway\n\nInput: Where can you find people in the same room talking about the same topic? Choices: 1. A: class B: work C: same home address D: same zip code E: same zip code\nOutput: 1/2. The question is asking about where one can find multiple people in a room talking about the same subject.\n\n1. There are multiple ways to do this.\n2. A way can be to have conversations with two different people who both have the same home address.\n3. Another way can be to have a conversation with the same person and find out that they have a certain zip code.\n4. Another way can be discussing the same topic while in a class with people who all live in the same home.\n5. Another way could be to discuss the same topic with people who all work in the same workplace.\n6. The most efficient way however is having people who live in the same zip code which allows you to not only talk about the same topic with them but also the same home address. \n7. So, that means A or E is the answer.\n8. Option A is incorrect as it is the same as C and that will not fulfil the question.\n9. Now looking at Option E, it states people who are in the same zip code. \n10. A zip code is usually the same as a home address.\n11. So the answer to this question can be: 2. E: same zip code.\nSo the final two answers are A: same home address and E: same address\n\nInput: Is the following statement accurate or false?

{"text": "), and door knob (E) could all be located inside of a doorway, the given example and context clues lead us to believe that the object must be part of the doorframe or door.\n4. This eliminates option A: television, B: control panel, and E: doorway since they are independent objects and not part of a doorway.\n5. Option C: opening doors can also be removed as it doesn't make sense that they would be contained within a doorway (as that would interfere with opening and closing the door).\n6. Which leaves us with option D: doorknobs as the object can be seen as part of the door.\n7. Therefore the answer is D: doorknods.\nSo the final answers is D: doorkndobs\n\nInput: Where do people usually travel to get where they're going to move forward with a project? Choices:  Option A: where the project is Option B: where the project is not Option C: where the project will go to Option D: where to move\nOutput: 1 The key point to remember here is that people can travel to different places to get where they are going to move forward with project. \n2. However, we can eliminate options B: where the project isn't, D: where to move, as they do not refer to a place.\n3. We can also eliminate option C: where the project is going, this might technically be a place, but it would be an ambiguous place as it does not refer to any location, rather it refers to movement.\n4. The question is asking about where people typically travel to get where they are moving forward with a project. \n5. Therefore, this eliminates option A: where the project being at and option B: where the project was.\n6. So the final answer is E where that would.\nSo the final outcome is E: where that would.\n\nInput: Why are some people afraid to open the door to another if they are cold.

Choices: 1. A: bags B: jewelry C: money D: weapons E: none of the above\nOutput: 1, Police arresting criminals is an indication of successful operation by police. \n2. Question asks \"What were they carrying?\" meaning the criminals need not be carrying anything.\n3. Looking through the options (1: \"nothing\", 2: \"bags\", 3: \"jewelry\", 4: \"money\", 5: \"weapons\"), the meaning of the question can be narrowed to \" What were the men carrying?\". i.e. \"men\" is singular.\n4. Among the options, 'weapons' fits the choice of the question. Police often arrest criminals with weapons. Therefore, the correct answer is \"weapons\".\nSo the final answer choice is E: weapons\n\nInput: What can you find inside a clock? Choices:  C: hands D: battery E: dial F: pendulum \nOutput: 1) Look carefully: We can understand from the question that pendulum is an important component of a clock. We must find out what else can be associated with pendulum. \n2) Looking at the options; dial and pendulum are common parts of a clock. \n3) Now, looking at the options carefully, we can find the word \"inside\" - it is used where the object can be fitted or situated inside the clock. \n4) From the options: hands - cannot be fitted inside; battery cannot be inside as it does not fit the clock; pendulum and dial can be fitted inside. \n5) Therefore, C) Hands and D) Battery are out of contention. \n6) What else can be inside a clock? Pendulum and the", "answer": "C: saturated with water"}

Option D: doorknobs is incorrect as they are not contained by the doorway and their purpose is not to hold doors or objects. \n5. It can be determined that option E is the correct answer.\nSo the final correct response is E: doorway", "answer": "E: government"}
{"text": "), doorknob (D), and doorway (E) could hold an object, the question says 'contained by' instead of 'contained within'.\n4. Therefore, we can eliminate B (control panel), C (opening doors), D (doorknob).\n5. Now, let's look at options A (television) and E (doorway). Both are plausible contenders.\n6. Since the question doesn't make it clear that any particular object needs to be grabbed, we can accept either answer.\n7. Based on this reasoning, the two most fitting answers are A: television and E: doorway.\n8. However, the context (question) makes the doorway more obvious, so the better answer is E: doorway.  \nSo the final answer if E: doorway, which means a person can grab an object contained by the doorway.\n\nInput: In a school, where can you expect to find a library? Choices: 1)A: office 2) B: classroom 3)C: schoolyard 4)D: museum 5)E: cafeteria\nOutput: 1) The objective of the question is to identify where a library is situated in a school building.\n2) The question implies that a library has got to be present in a school building. Since it's given that the expected find in a school, we can eliminate options B: Classroom, C: schoolyard, 5: cafeteria, 4: museum.\n3) In the context of the school, a library exists in order to provide resources that help student learning and development. The library houses books and reference material, and offers access to various online resources.\n4) A library is typically found in a school building, such as a school, college, or university. \n5) Libraries serve different functions and are designed to meet the specific needs of their users. In a school, a library would focus on catering to the educational needs of students and teachers.\n6) The library would typically be part of the school's academic building and be used for research, reading, borrowing books and reading material, and accessing online resources and information. \n7) Thus, the most suitable answer is A: office as a library isn't a place you would usually find in an office setting.", "answer": "B: dangerous"}

{"text": "), and doorknob (D) could likely be contained by a doorway in theory, it would take some effort to find the exact objects. \n4. When an object is contained by a doorway, it means that the doorway is open and that the structure of the door itself, such as a door knob, or even the door handle is sufficient to reach the object using a quick or direct grabbing motion.\n5. Taking this into account, doorway (E) is the most suitable choice. \nSo the final answer given is answer (E), doorway.", "answer": "A: advisory"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) all have relevant associations with a doorway, their location within the doorway might be elsewhere than where the doorway is. \n4. Therefore, we are left with the only choice that meets this requirement - E: doorway.\nSo the final conclusion is that the object that we will grab is the doorway.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1: What kind of clothing might a hunter wear in the woods?\n\t\t\t1. The woods refers to a forest or other area that is inhabited by wildlife.\n       2. A hunter is a person who pursues game for the purpose of sport or food.\n       3. Clothing is the materials made of fabrics and accessories that are used to cover part or all of a person's body.\n       4. Example: a jacket.\n       5. Kind means the type of clothes a hunter might wear.\n       6. We need to identify the type of clothes a person who is pursuing game in the woods could plausibly wear.\n       7. Considering these constraints, it's plausible that a hunter might wear clothing which provides:\n       1. Covering and warmth: A hunter might wear a coat to keep warm in the woods, given its colder climate.\n       2. Protection: A hunter might also wear a coat to protect themselves from physical harm.\n       3. Camouflage: A hunter might dress in camouflage clothing to blend in with their environment.\n       4. Concealment: A hunter might carry weapons and weapons equipment that are concealed on their person to prevent them from being found easily.\n       5. Stealth: A hunter might use clothing (like camouflage) to blend in with the environment so they can avoid being seen easily.\n       6. The type of clothing a hunter might wear in the woods depends on many factors, including the climate, the type and environment of hunting in which they are engaged, and their own individual preferences.\n       7. Therefore, the correct answer is \"hunter wear in the woods could plaid a variety of clothing options to suit their needs and the environment they are hunting in.\"\n\n\n\nExample #2: What is the purpose of the brakes on most cars?", "answer": "C: frustration"}

D: taxi 5. E: public transport\nOutput: 1.\"The best choice of transportation,\" as stated in the question, is an indication that one option should be considered preferable over all the others.\n2. If a person has a hardtime moving, then clearly they cannot handle a motorcycle. This rules out choice B.\n3. Considering that a motorcycle can still be ridden on a hard surface but a truck cannot, it would be logical to conclude that trucks are preferable as transport for people with difficulty moving around.\n4. If a person has difficulty moving, taxis are likely to be too expensive. We also eliminate choice C: truck since it's already eliminated in step 3.\n5. Finally, public transport is preferable to taxi in that it can be more cost-effective and is more accessible, allowing those that have difficulty moving to travel with ease.\n6. There are many other reasons that might contribute to the choice of public transportation but these are the main 2 reasons that were given in the question.\n7.

Thus, the answer has to be either doorway or doorframe (E), as those two are only options that make sense in this context of being contained by a doorway system.\n5. Of choices A,B,C,D,E, doorknob (item itself, option D) is the only one that does not refer to any part of a doorway.\n6. Therefore, doorway (E) is the accurate answer and our final answer.\nSo the final answers are E: Both doorway and doorframe are used as metaphors for a single object, the door.\n\nInput: Which colorful object resembles both a shoe and a clock? Choices:  B: shoe A: clock C: wrist D: foot\nOutput: 1) The expression \"resembles both\" implies that the answer can either be shoe (A) or clock (B), or some third option that would fit that parameter; both A and B are correct answers but not exclusive ones.\n2) Object C, \"wrist\", does not resemble a clock and object D, \"foot\" does not resemble a shoe, so they are not the correct answers.\n3) Colorful objects A and B are very vague in this context and any colorful object could fit that description. The only real way to solve this question would be determining that both the objects A and B are footwear, and we achieve it when we know that C and D are inappropriate based on the description.\n4) Object C \"wrist\", like color A \"foot\" and object D \"foot\", like color B \"shoe\", resembles footgear and does not resemble a wristlet either.\n5) To sum up, the only colorful objects that could resemble all the mentioned objects are A \"shoe\" and B \"shoe\".\n6) Finally, the only reason why you could not choose A \"shoe\" as an answer is the fact that the expression \"both a shoe and a..\" implies that the shoe itself resembles both another object and that object and shoe also resemble each other, and that is correct for objects A and B", "answer": "D: heal"}

Choices: 1: early in the morning 2: first half of a day 3: midday 4: afternoon 5: late evening\nOutput: 1) The question is asking when customers who arrive at a business are probably most polite.\n2) A business environment can provide a lot of different signals to a customer, such as the time of day, the people they meet, the type of merchandise they encounter and the way a business welcomes them.\n3) We can eliminate choices 2,3 and 4 because business environments and the way they are run may vary based on those factors. \n4) However, choice 1 is highly appropriate. \n5) In many service sector-oriented retail and business environments, arriving at the place of business or shop early in the morning is a way of showing that the customer appreciates the employees' work and values their time spent waiting around for customers.\n6) In some environments, it may even be understood that any tardiness from the customers can be viewed as being rude. \n7) Similarly, choice 5 is also highly suitable because it shows how the customers are making an effort to show their appreciation and gratitude to the staff. \n8 ) Therefore, 1: early in a day and 5: late in the day are the correct choice.\nSo the final answers are 1: early in day and 5: in the late day.\n\n###### Test Case 1\n\nInput: Where should you go to find a person who can fix your flat tire?

Option D: door, is too vague, as there is no indication it that this is part of a doorway as opposed to being independent outside of that. \n7. Option B: control panel, is usually a part of a door, however it's possible it could be located elsewhere. There's no specificity regarding where the control panel was located. \n8. Option A: Television, is not an item that would be contained in a doorway at a given time.\n9.

Looking at what doesn't work: a tv is not an object within a doorway; it is a structure of a cabinet or wall/standing alone; similarly, the control panel is a functional unit on a cabinet, and not an independent entity contained within a doorway.  Doors (C) and doorknobs (D) are also not in a doorway; they are a part of a door.  A doorway is an opening.  A building might be a doorway, but it is not one itself.\n5. Therefore the only remaining choice is E: doorway. \n6. This is also true because it is the correct usage of adverb \u2018contained by\u2019.\nSo the final answers is E: doorway\n\nInput: After reading, I was motivated by what? Choices: A: the book B: a new book C: to buy another book D: another book E: the author\nOutput: 1) In this question, the author wants the person to read to find out what motivates them after reading a book.\n2. We have to infer from the text, what was the author\u2019s motive for writing this passage?\n3. After reading the passage, I was motivated to read another book, which is stated to be \"what motivate me after reading\"?\n4. Looking at the choices, only option C: buy another book is a reason to motivate us but is not what motivate us after reading. \n5. Although book B: a new is not in the text, it is an implication of the text which motivates a book is a great choice, motivated to buy another book.\n6. Since it\u2019s motivation, there is no need to buy a book, you\u2019re motivated to read another, so the answer is B: a new book.\n7. So the final answer is B. A new book\n\nInput: What might I think about before I try to open a jar lid? Choices: A) opening B) lid C) jar D) what am I going to do with jar", "answer": "C: fun"}
{"text": "), doorknob (D), and doorway (E) could be considered possible locations to grab an object, none of them fit the description of 'containing the object'. \n4. Considering the context clues of the question we can eliminate doorway as an option, as the question asks us to pick an object within the doorway and not outside of it.\n5. Option B, control panel, while could contain the object, wouldn't be an usual place to grab an object contained in it.\n6. So elimination of the options will result in A: television, D: doorknobs, and C: opening doors.\n7. Since A: television can't be the answer, and C: opening (doors) doesn't make any grammatical sense, we are left with D: doorknobi.\n8. Therefore the answer is D: doorknibi.\nSo the final solution is D: doorknobbi.\n\n---\n\n**Written by** <a href=\"https://gaoguan1975.github.io/#me\">Gao Guan</a> \n\n---", "answer": "B: satisfaction"}

{"text": "), and the doorknob (D) are part of the doorway, the doorway itself is not an object contained by the doorway and hence must be ruled out.\n4. Now looking at choice E, Doorway. The doorway cannot be moved to grab the object unless a second doorway is included as well to hold the door. \n5. Even if we assume a second doorway exists, it is not the same as the first doorway that is being discussed.\n6. Furthermore, a doorway is typically not an object that can be moved. It's more plausible to grab an object inside a doorway instead of the doorway itself.\n7. Hence, the answer is C, Opening doors.\nSo the final is C, Opening doo", "answer": "D: parking lot"}
{"text": "), or doorknob (D) might all be located close to the doorway, the key phrase \"contained by\" indicates that the answer must be \"within\" the door in order to meet the requirements of this question.\n4. Hence, option E is the most appropriate answer as it satisfies the context clues and indicates the contained object is located within the doorframe.\n5. Therefore the answer is E: doorway.\nSo the final statement is E: doorway\n\nInput: What did Sammy use in his speech? Choices: 1.  A: voice B: mouth 2.  C: words 3.  D: hands 4.  E: hands as a joke\nOutput: 1) Sammy uses his voice to make the speech.\n2) Sammy uses words in his speech.\n3) Sammy makes hand gestures/motions to aid in making his speech.\n4) Sammy uses his hands as a joke.\nWe see from the input given, Sammy use voice, words, and hands to make his speech, where we need to eliminate words as we can only use them to make speech.\nTherefore, we can assume, only Sammy use voice and hands for his speech.\nSo the option for this riddle is A: voice and B: hands.\n\nInput: After a long day at work, what is something that the person doesn't have the time for? Choices:  B: patience C: hobbies D: home cooked meal E: cleaning house\nOutput: 1: A person is \"Home\" after a long day at work.\n2.

Choices:  (A) anytime (B) any moment (C) day by day (D) at night (E) in a moment\nOutput: 1\" The question asks \"When you're going about a day, when will you make money?\" \n2. The answer is that you make money on a \"day by day\" basis. In this scenario, you are going about your day and each day will bring you a chance to earn money.\n3. This can be confirmed by eliminating incorrect answers B: any moment, D: at night, and E: in a moment.\n4. The remaining candidates are A: anytime and C: day by day, while \"anytime\" would be a good answer under certain circumstances, the answer doesn't apply to the question of \"making\" money as the earning will occur in a moment.\n5. Likewise, a \"moment\" is too short to make any real progress in earning, the money made in such instances would be in very small amounts.\n6. Therefore, what would be the best answer? A: Any time, as days bring you money, but you must keep in mind that if you're going about the day, your earning will most likely only occur within the given moment. Thus, the answer is C: day by day.\nSo the final choice is C.", "answer": "A: depressed"}

A: restaurant B: caf\u00e9 C: bookstore D: bakery E: airport\nOutput: 1 The question is \"In which of these places would you not find an espressoman?\" \n2. The word \"espressoman\" is an adjective that describes a person who prepares or serves espresso. \n3. There are plenty of stores, restaurants, etc. that serve espresso; however, there are not many places where the word espressoman is used, such as on resumes.\n4. Therefore, choosing a noun, rather than an adjective, is more appropriate.\n5. Options B: caf\u00e9, C: bookstore, and E: airport are nouns relating to locations, not jobs.\n6. Choice D: bakery: is similar to choice E: airport: in that \"bakery\" is a noun that is synonymous with \"job\", therefore, we can eliminate them as well.\n7. Therefore the only choice that is a noun, and not a job description, that can relate to \"espressoman\" (which is a description of a job, not a location) is choice A: restaurant.\n8. Because of this, the correct answer is A: restaurant.\nSo the final choice is is A: restaurant\n\nInput: Why are the lights flickering on my TV? Choices: \ud83d\udc4e 1.

Option A: power surge", "answer": "D: field of flowers"}
{"text": "), doorknob (D), and doorway (E) is an object that is usually found within a doorway, the question is more concerned with the process of accessing the object.\n4. Eliminating Choice A: television is correct because it cannot be accessed by reaching through a doorway to the other side. \n5. Similarly, choice D: doorknobs are typically not located on the opposite side of a doorway and thus do not qualify as valid options. \n6. Choice B: control panel would require more action than just accessing the object and can be eliminated on that basis. This brings our final choices to A: opening doors and E: doorway.\n7. Of the remaining choices, option E: doorway is the only option that allows you to access the object without any additional action or movement. Hence, the answer is E: doorway. \n8. So the final answer is E Doorway.\n\nInput: You might find an apple in a tree, not one growing on the ground.

{"text": "), and doorknob (D) could be contained by a doorway, all of these objects are independent of the doorway, hence they would not fit the context. \n4. Option E: 'doorway' would not describe an object completely contained by the doorway either, as a doorway is a physical structure. \n5. Therefore, of the given choices, the only option that would fit the description well would be option E: 'doorway'.\n6.

Choices:  B: kitchen C: bathroom D: computer E: desk F: drawer G: trashcan H: bedroom\nOutput: 1). The primary object of the question is to determine where the person might have seemingly left behind the pen. \n2). Based on the given context, the best answer would be C: bathroom. \n3). The reason the bathroom seems to be the correct choice is that most people keep pens and other personal items in their bathrooms for easy access, thus making it highly likely that they would either forget or be unable to find the pen upon returning from the bathroom. \n4). However, there are still scenarios where a person might accidentally leave their pen in a different room. For example, they may find that they used an old pen and have no idea where they put it.\n\nInput: If it snows, where do birds typically end up?

Therefore, option E: doorway is the correct answer\nSo the final answer to this question is E: doorway\n\nInput: When do people do things for a purpose? Choices: 1. A: when people try to find love 2. A: when people listen to music 3. A: when people look at movies 4. A: when people get coffee\n5. A: when people write poems 6. A: when people go hiking 7. A: when people eat burgers\nOutput: 1: When they buy burgers. A burger itself is an object, but the word 'burgers' is used in the question to encompass the action of purchasing or eating a burger.\n2: When they eat coffee. Coffee itself is an object but it's also a term that is used to describe the action of buying coffee or drinking it.\n3: When they buy music. Music, unlike Coffee, is a noun which can't be bought, however, the act of downloading or buying music or CDs is called 'buy music' or 'buy CDs' which is similar in meaning to the word 'getting music/buying CDs'.\n4: When they want to find love. Similarly to option 2, 'love' (the word) is a noun; however, the verb (do) to 'look for' indicates that you would look for something, like love and if you see or meet someone, the action of finding or looking for love would start. This action of looking for love is something which may be done for the purpose of finding love, so the act of looking can be a purpose in this case. Option 3 doesn't make sense considering the question. The word'read' is actually a verb which indicates an act and you would generally not read a movie to eat it.\n5,6,7: None of the options match the format of 'when [people] [", "answer": "E: neatness"}

It does not refer to the whole sentence.\nC: Conjunction - Conjunction refers to something that links words, phrases, or clauses. A conjunction doesn't just relate to one or two words, but the entire sentences of these words and phrases and clauses to each other.\nSo the final part is not C: conjunction\n  D: Punctuation punctuation - refers to the marks that are used to divide up sentences, paragraphs, and dialogue. \n  E: Verb Verb - The verb refers to the action word in a sentence.\n  F: Clause Clause - a clause represents a group of words.

The questions are asking what a cow is, not other mammals. The other mammals could have their own categories.\n5. You know what a cow is, just find the options that could be what the cat in question is.\n6. You know that it isn't pregnant or a female, so that leaves a male and a milkable.\n7.

Consider 'doorway', we can eliminate C and D as being plausible choices.\n6. When referring to the doorway, it would be unlikely for us to have use of more than one. As such, doorway (E), becomes the only choice.\n7. Therefore the answer is E: doorway\nSo the final answer would be E: doorway\n\nInput: What is a phrase used for one who can't see? Choices: A: blind B: partially sighted C: blindness D: myopic E: nearsighted\nOutput: 1)The phrase used for one who cannot see is \"myopic\" (E).\n2)Looking at the list of choices, a blind person is someone who has total or almost complete vision loss at all distances due to a medical condition, damage or disease. \n3)Partially sighted is someone who can only see part of an object but not its entirety.\n4)Blindness is for those who have complete vision loss at all range due to a medical condition or damage. \n5)Nearsightedness is for someone who can see an object nearby but not one far away, but it's more of a person who wears glasses than totally visually impaired. \n6)Blindness is a word used primarily for a medical condition, damage, or disease that causes total or almost complete vision impairment, and it can't be used for a person who is blind.\n7)Myopia is for people who are nearsighted, but it also includes people who are blind.\n8)Therefore the most fitting answer is C: \"myopic.\"\n9)So the final answer is C: \"Myopic\"\n\nInput: What do some call coughs?

{"text": "), and doorknob (D) could indeed be located in a doorway; they do not fulfill the intention of the question since they are not confined or contained by the doorway.\n4. They could be anywhere in the house, depending on the layout of the house and the way the object is stored or displayed. \n\n5. Doorknob (D) is not an ideal choice for several reasons:\n\nIt's implied that the object is contained by the doorway (therefore, would be grabbed by the doorknob, and not by the doorway itself). \nThe handle on the doorknob (which is what most people tend to grab) is meant to facilitate the person's use of the door. So the object's placement is not as important as its ease of access.\n6. Door (E) as a choice for the question is problematic since doors do not contain objects. They have openings instead.\n7. Taking a closer look at the available choices;\n\n  - Option C's 'opening doors' has two words which describe the door: it's an opening for you to pass through.\n  - Option D's 'doorknob' is mentioned in association with an opening, making the choice ambiguous. It does not explicitly convey either its meaning as part of the doorway.\n  - Choice B's 'control panel' is located outside of the doorway. It's a control or interface on the outside of the door to control the door from inside or out. \nIt can also be interpreted as part of the door itself if its description includes the door's frame and not only its surface.\n  - Choices A's 'television' and B's 'control' are inside the room. So neither of the two would be grabbed from or contained by a doorway, though they could be grabbed by a person when approaching the doorway.\n8. Therefore the correct answer is C: opening doors.\nSo the final is C: opening doors\n\nInput: If someone sees the best in their fellow man, what would that mean?

{"text": "), and doorknob (D), would all be valid options in theory (because they are within the structure of the doors), they are likely unlikely to be the answer the question is asking for. \n4. Option E: doorway, is the most likely answer; however, we can further refine our reasoning to support it: 'door' is most often referred to a part (or entrance point) that opens and shuts objects. \n5. In this context, the 'door' is considered the entire structure of the doorway as a whole. \n6. Thus, the answer is E: doorway. \nSo the final answer  is E: doorway\n\nInput: What is the most likely the location of the best place to buy a book? Choices:  D: bookstore E: library B: warehouse C: online store I: local store\nOutput: 1 - The question is asking \"the most likely the location of best place to buy a (fictional) book.\"\n2. The word \u2018likely\u2019 in the given question implies that more than one answer is possible.\n3. Looking closely at the book choices, \u2018library\u2019 and \u2018bookstore\u2019 are both plausible options, and would even be the correct answer in some cases, like \u2018library\u2019 and \u2018online store\u2019 because of its vast collections of books stored in the library.\n4. However, 'library' and 'online store' don't necessarily reflect the fact that the bookstore is likely the best place to buy one because of the nature of the question and the structure of the English language, where 'likely' modifies the verb 'the most likely'.\n5. This implies that what we need is that one option that makes the most sense of the entire question.\n6. As a result, the answer that makes the most sense is 'bookstore', meaning that 'bookstore' is most likely the correct answer to this question.\nSo the final correct answer: D: bookstore.\n\nInput: The best way to reach a man who is late for work is to? Choices:  B: tell him to hurry C: find him D: yell E: run after him\nOutput: 1 \u2013 The question is asking how to reach a person who is late for work.\n2 \u2013 The choices given offer several solutions to the problem of not reaching the late person, but also offer various solutions", "answer": "C: desk"}

Choices: 1: Tell them they're done with their break when they are. 2: Remind them that they have a break to take at some point. 3: Make a plan for a specific time. 4: Say it's time for their job 5: Ask if they would like to have a break\nOutput: 1: This is not how a person would say at work to take a break, as it would be inappropriate in most professional situations. 2: This is also not a suitable way to ask someone to take a break as it implies that they might not necessarily have to take one if they don't.\n3: This option involves making specific plans for the time that the person will take their break. This may be an appropriate way to do so in a particular situation, but it is not a general rule that one should follow when asking someone to take a break.\n4: This option is not grammatically correct, and it does not make sense to ask someone to take their break based on their job status. 5: This is also not an appropriate way to ask someone to have a break, as it implies that they may or may not need one.\n\nInput: What does the writer do in writing? Choices: 2: Make plans to attend a class 1: Tell other people what they're writing 3: Check what he or she already wrote\nOutput: 1 and choice 2: Neither of these options make sense. Making plans to attend a class would not necessarily be part of the writer's process in writing, and it would be odd to explain to others what the writer is writing.\n3: Checking what he or she already written would not be a step that the writer would take in writing since this would not be adding new material to the writing process.\n4: A mistake that many people make is assuming that the writer should check for his or her own errors in writing instead of a separate person. In actuality, most writers allow people they trust, usually", "answer": "C: street corner"}

Choices: \tA: sleepy B: bum C: lunch box D: newspaper E: sleep\nOutput: 1 The context of the question indicates that the person is riding on a public bus and looking for something to aid their sleep. 2. The choices available to us involve various objects or food that the passenger could be carrying in a bag or purse and might have already used during the journey 3. From the word 'home' in the sentence, we can determine that the person is probably not in an office environment or any other such setting.\n\n4. Therefore, of the given choices, the answer cannot be A: sleepy, B: bum, C: lunch box, D: newspaper as these relate to office workspaces more than being a passenger on a bus 5. We are left with a single choice: sleep.\n\n 6. Therefore, the only option that fits the context of the sentence is sleep. In the same sentence we are also told that the person is looking for something to aid sleep 7. Therefore, the answer must be A: sleepy.\n  So the correct answer is A: sleepy", "answer": "C: closer"}

{"text": "), doorknob (D), and doorway (E) could all be within a doorway, looking at option (A) and (D), it makes sense that (A) wouldn't be applicable as (D) states that the object would be \"contained by a doorway.\" \n4. Looking at options (B), (C), and (E), they all contain the word 'door' implying that the object could be a door or door-related structure, which cannot be the case in the context.\n5. There is only one remaining option, therefore, the correct answer is D: doorknobs.\nSo the final answered is D: doorknocks.", "answer": "E: getting good grades"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) are all components of the doorway, the given question restricts our answer to a location which the object could be found contained within.\n4. A doorway is designed to provide a passage from one space to another. It allows someone to move from one area to another. This implies that the doorway is not static, but is fluid, allowing an object to move through from one area to another as well.\n5. If an object is contained by a doorway, it implies that it is within the doorway and not elsewhere. \n6. Choice E: doorway is incorrect because the question asks \"Where would you grab an object CONTAINED by a doorway\". It cannot be the answer. \n7. Choice E: doorknob makes sense because a doorknob is an independent element that can be found in a doorway and could be attached to objects, thus being the answer to this question. \n 8. Therefore, it is the correct answer.\nSo the final 'answer is E: doorknub\n\nInput: If someone uses their smartphone to watch television, which of these is it?

The question asks which of the five options the person is watching television on. \n\nLet\u2019s start by looking at the first option on the list: a book. This doesn\u2019t make sense as a television is a visual medium, whereas a book is used largely for reading.\n2. ipads, 3. computers and 4. tv screens are all objects which could be used to watch television on.\nThis leaves us with the last option: a phone.\nTherefore, the correct answer is number 5: a phone.\nSo the correct answer is number E: phone\n\nInput: While in an ice cream shop, you see the owner, who was once a basketball player, and he asks what the two ice creams cost.

{"text": "), and door (D) could potentially be 'contained within', a doorknob (E), although a necessary object in a doorway, is too vague. It describes the material used to construct a door and does not provide sufficient information about its actual location.\n4. So, only options A and C are considered, leading to a shortlist of two choices, and leaving us with A: television. \n5. This answer makes sense, because a television is likely to be located inside a doorway due to its shape, allowing you to grasp it with ease.\n6. Therefore, we see that the answer is A: television.", "answer": "E: hand written"}
{"text": "), doorknob (D), and doorway (E) are all possible options, 'control panel' (B), 'opening doors' (C), and 'doorknob' (D) are more ambiguous than other choices as they could locate the object outside or within the doorway.\n4. The question also requires a 'doorway', as this indicates that the location that we are looking for is inside a building that has a door (and not open exterior).\nIn light of the given clues, the answer is E: doorway.\nSo the final answers is E: doorway\n\nInput: What do you do to create a paperclip on a word processing program?

Name folder\nOutput: 1: The question is asking about creating a paper clip on a word processing software.\n2: When you want to create a paper clip on the word processing program, you must open the document. There are multiple methods to open a document; for example, by pressing the Windows key '+' or you may click on the Start button, then 'All Apps', 'Office', and then 'Word'.\n3: Closing the document does not create a paper clip.\n4: Checking icon may not be the best way to create a paper clip for your document.\n5: Clicking on file menu has created some document properties like page number and margins. It does not help in creating a paper clip.\n6: Checking a box doesn't help you in creating a paper clip; it is used for multiple things, and it is quite irrelevant here.\n7: Type 'file' doesn't help you choose a document, you cannot create multiple choices of file for the same document; it doesn't help you access a particular file either.\n8: Type'save' will not create a paper clip, instead, it will save your present document.\n9: The box should open once you have created your document; then you can name the 'folder' and press the save button.\n10: Finally, click on the box, write the name of the folder, and press save. So the final answer is", "answer": "D: players"}
{"text": "), doorknob (D), and doorway (E) could all be within a doorway, some of these objects are not located in the doorway.\n4. Therefore, the answer must be within the doorway. Since it must be within the doorframe, we should exclude the word 'frame' as we know the answer is going to be within the doorway and not the doorframe which is the structure containing the door.\n5. This eliminates the possibility of choice B: Control panel. It is found within the doorframe but not in the doorway. Therefore, the answer can only be doorway.\nSo the final answers is E: doorway.\n\nInput: The cat will not drink at what altitude? Choices:  C: floor A: top B: table D: bottom C: staircase E: counter\nOutput: There is a cat at a restaurant on the table. It will not drink on the floor or the counter, as they do not have water there. \n1. The cat will not drink on the stairs or the table. It is on the table right now.\n2. If that is true, the cat will only drink if it is on the floor.\n3. So, the cat will drink at the floor, if it is at the table.\nSo the answer is C: Floor.\n\nInput: A bacteria is at room temp and its concentration doubles, in how many minutes will it hit what temp? Choices:  E: 254 F \nOutput: 14 min 54 sec\n2. A bacteria is a single-celled organism. \n3. It uses cell division to create more bacteria, which grows faster in the warmer temperature.\n4. Its concentration doubled in the warmer temp and will continue to do so until the temps get back to 68\u00b0F.\n5. At this temp, the bacteria will slow down and then stop growing.\nSo the answer should be E: 289 F.\nBut wait.. if it is doubling in 15 minutes, then how will it get to 148 min 54sec.\nThe answer is 41 \u00b0C.\n\nInput: I am getting a phone call.

Looking at the given choices the possible solutions would be A: Broom, this can work but we can conclude that the broom would not be suitable because it is not the traditional/recommended way of doing the same. \n2.) B: vacuum cleaning, although it's a good alternative option, the context of the answer is shelves and not carpet or floors. \n3.) C: Water Bottle, this is a possible alternative, but as long as the shelves are in line it doesn't remove any dust. \n4.)D: Book, while possible is not the ideal solution because books can be damaged while cleaning shelves. 5.)E: Spider, this option would only clean the shelves if it was a very small/tiny spider and not a big one and this option is also risky. \n6.)Therefore the best fitting option is D: Brooms. \nSo the correct answer is D: Brooms\n\nInput: If I wanted to reach the cash machine, which way would I go? Choices: \u200b A: left B: right C: go down the alley D: up the block E: back where I am now\nOutput: 1) First, we need to analyze the question by separating the subject from the object. \n\n2) The subject is the verb \"wanted to reach the cash\" and the object is \"machine\".

Choices:  \u0410: in the freezer B: out of the fridge C: in an ice box D: in the trunk E: under the kitchen sink\nOutput: 1, This question can be summarized as: \"Where can some people keep food?\" \n2, The answer to this question will consist of: \"Place name\". Since the answer should be specific enough to allow the person who asks the question to make the right determination about where he/she might keep his/her own food.\n3, The question is asking about specific foods that can be kept at a specific place. If the answer were to include more general things, such as: \"where does everyone keep their food, and how about me\", then it would not be specific enough.\n4, Based on the question at hand, it is evident that the answer can relate to particular foods.\n5, Based on the context of the question, we can determine that the answer must be specific enough to apply to individuals who ask the same question as the person who asked the question. \n6, In order to determine where some people keep their food, we first must determine where these same people keep a specific type of food. \n7, If the food stored at the same place as the general type of food is general food, then it does not constitute a specific answer. \n8, Examples of this include \"food in the refrigerator\" and \"food in the freezer\" for those who generally keep their food in the refrigerators and freezers, respectively. \n9, If the food stored in the same place as the person's food is a specific type of food, \nthen it does constitute a specific answer, example: \"their food in containers\". This means that", "answer": "E: car"}
{"text": "), or doorknob (D) could be contained by a doorway, the wording of the question doesn't fit the case of a doorway.\n4. Therefore, the answer would be E: doorway. \n5. Since we know that the correct choice only includes an object, we then examine those options and find the choice with the object that's not contained: doorknob (object found on the door). \n6. Therefore the correct response would be E: door, where you would grab or find the doorknob, which is an object contained by a room.\nSo the final score is E: doorway\n\nInput: A man needs to get to a store, when he finds it the direction is facing what? Choices: A: East B: Southeast C: Southwest D: Northwest E: downhill\nOutput: 1: The question asks about the direction the store is facing when the man arrives at it.\n2. The correct choice only includes directions that are either east or west.\n3. Looking again at the choices (A) East, (B) Southeast, (C) Southwest, (D) Northwest, (E) Downhill, only (A) east and (B) southeast are plausible options.\n4. However, due to the wording of the questions, option B is ruled out, since it refers to a compass direction which can either be east or west (when considering an old way of referencing north, south, east, west).\n5. Based on this information, the correct answer is option A: east.\nSo the final decision is A: east.\n\nInput: How would someone get to work?

A: book store D: school E: other\nOutput: 1 and 2 are incorrect because these choices don't necessarily pertain to finding the bible but simply a reference to the bible.\n3 can be eliminated because the question asked where one might find THEIR bible, not a BIBLE. This implies that the person already has a bible and is looking for their specific one.\n4 - church office is an incorrect answer because a church office would not have a bible. The correct answer is home.\nSo the final answers are E: other and A: home\n\nInput: A person would leave home and get in their car by doing what? Choices: A: opening a mailbox B: opening a door C: getting out of bed D: entering a home E: opening a front door\nOutput: A: opening a door; getting into their car by doing this.

It is not the process of performing magic. \n  E: Good outcome: Wizards and magic are intended to bring good outcomes, they are not used to make them. Therefore, this answer is incorrect. \nTherefore, the correct answer is 'D: Wonder'.\nSo the final choices are: D: Wonder\n\nInput: With a few exceptions, what is a crank? Choices: 2. A: wrench 3. B: lever 4. C: screwdriver 5. D: bicycle pump\nOutput: 1 To identify a crank, we need to understand the context in which it is used.\n2 A wrench (A), screwdriver (C), and bicycle pump (D) are cranks; however, a crank is specifically a hand-operated machinery that causes movement within a machine. \n3 A lever (B) is a tool used to change the orientation of an object or control a system of equipment. Although it could be part", "answer": "B: fun"}
{"text": "), and even a doorknub (D), are all objects contained by a doorway, this word does not make any sense when it's applied to a doorway itself. \n4. Therefore, the answer would be E: doorway.\nSo the final analysis is E: doorway\n\nInput: Where wouldn't you find a plumber if you were trying to find some? Choices:  a: gas station b: grocery store c: home d: restaurant e: oil refinery\nOutput: 1, The question asks where you wouldn't look for a plumber, i.e., some. \n2. The question indicates that we'd generally go to places that are not associated with plumbing to look for someone who could repair plumbing.\n3. Looking closely at the given options; we'd avoid going to any place that doesn't have anything to do with plumbing. Gas station (a), grocery store (b), restaurant(d) are the obvious choices of places that aren't plumbing related. \n4. option E: oil refineries, is plausible in the sense that a plumber would not be found here because the plumbing in oil refineries are of no use to a person who needs to repair their plumbing. \n5. Therefore, we can rule out all the options except option E: oil refinery.\nSo the final choice is E: oil refinerie\n\nInput: In the mountains, where are you more likely to find a camel? Choices: \na. desert b. meadow c. rocky terrain\nd. pond e. arctic tundra\nOutput: 1..In options (a to d), we only see the location of where the camel is more likely to be found.\n2. But what is it about those locations that contributes to a greater chance of finding the camel? It makes us think in terms of the terrain around that location, such as whether it is rocky, wet, or arctic. \n3. Given this observation, we can narrow down options to just rocky terrain(c), and arctic tundra(e) which seems like the most plausible options.\n4. Looking at choices A to D, we find that mountains are not necessarily associated with rocky terrain and are", "answer": "C: go on vacation"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) might belong to the door frame or door itself, they are not within the confines of the doorway itself i.e., 'contained by' the doorway.\n4. Looking at the choice options, choice E - doorway seems like the best fit for the answer. \n5. Therefore, we get the answer E: doorway.\nSo the final is E: doorway\n\nInput: What must you have if you wish to take the bus to church? Choices: 1. A: wallet 2. B: bus fare 3. C: money 4. D: credit card 5. E: card with credit limits\nOutput: 1) The question asks what you must have if you wish to *go* to church, not use the bus. Going to church requires travel, but traveling by bus cannot, and you can travel by bus without traveling to church. \n2) The choices are listed in order of most likely to least likely to be true, and option B: bus fare is definitely false.\n3) Option C: money is the best way to do anything involving finance, so it's the correct answer here.\n\nInput: What's a tool for cutting and trimming and has a serrated side? Choices: 5. A: knife B: chisel C: saw D: haircut E: scissors\nOutput: 1.) The question is asking about a tool with a serrated side, it is not asking for a tool that cuts and trims. \n2. The key point to consider here is what type of tool would a person need to cut and trim. \n3. A chisel, saw and haircut are all tools that help to shape, mend or even create, but they wouldn't be used for trimming, unless trimming involves shaping or mending. \n4. On the other hand, a knife (A) and scissors (E) are the only tools that are both used to cut and trim in common use. \n5. So the best answer is either A: knife or  E: scissors (based on the clue 'has a serrated side').\nSo the final answer would be A: knife.\n\nInput: In a hotel, the rooms with a", "answer": "B: woods"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) can be contained by a doorway, we only need one element to qualify as fit for this question. \n4.

{"text": "), or doorknob (D) could feasibly be located within a doorway, it is likely more likely that a doorway is housing an object contained by a wall. \n4. However, doorway (E) is the only possible correct answer. \n5. Therefore, it is the correct choice.\nSo the final choice is E: doorway", "answer": "D: toy store"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) could all be considered objects contained in a doorway, they do not meet the criterion of being grappled or gripped inside the doorway.\n4. The answer would likely be an object that is grappled inside the doorway, therefore, the answer would be E: doorway.\nSo the final answers is E: doorway.", "answer": "B: classroom"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) could easily be located elsewhere, the choice E: 'doorway' only applies to a structure to which a doorway is connected and doesn't specify a location for the contained object. \n4.

Choices:  C: road crossing A: down B: between \nD: under\nE: near\nOutput: 1) the picture and situation of a bear trying to cross a path presents a situation where no choice provides the exact correct answer for the given scenario. \n2. Bear has to cross the road and not just 'over' or 'across' or to 'visit' or any other of the choices in the given puzzle. \n3. Looking at option A \"down\", this choice indicates that the bear would have to go to the right, and the given situation presents a bear trying to cross the road back to the left, so down does not make sense. \n4. Looking at choice B \"between\", this choice suggests the bear would have to move within the gap between the trees on the right side of the picture. However, this choice also presents a problem, as the bear in the picture would have to traverse an area wide enough to accommodate both the bear and the car. \n5. Looking at choices C \"road crossing\", D \"under\", E \"near\", none of these choices present a situation that is consistent with the picture. \n6. The only situation that makes sense is when the bear is \"near\", as it is in the close vicinity of crossing the road, but it cannot be determined with certainty which spot on the road exactly should be marked. \n\nSo the bear can be anywhere nearby on the top of the table.\nSo the final solution is E: near", "answer": "B: house"}
{"text": "), doorknob (D) could all potentially be found within a doorway, a doorway is not in itself a container for different objects. \n4. This means that doorway (E) is the only choice that fits the description, making it the correct answer.\nSo the final response is E: doorway\n\nInput: What does a phoenix do when it is on fire? Choices: 1: It's always on. 2: It's always high. 3: It's always in the lead. 4: It's always out. 5: It can be anything.\nOutput: 1: Option 1 should be eliminated because the Phoenix is described as a mythical bird that transforms into a different form on its death. It was on fire when it burned, and it could be anything when it transforms. \n2: Option 2 should also be eliminated since the transformation happens at the moment of death. Phoenix never remains in a high position to begin with.  \n3: Option 3 should be eliminated since it is not at any disadvantage throughout its life. It is the opposite of that bird. \n4: Option 4 should be eliminated because nothing else says that it is on fire when it is out and it can never be anything.   \n5: Since none of the other options can be accepted as true, the Phoenix could do anything. \nSo the final response should be D: It can be anything\n\n\nInput: If it rains what happens to the flowers?

{"text": "), and door handle (D) could be contained within the doorway, they are all separate and independent objects in the actual doorway. \n4. The wording of the question suggests a single object contained by the doorway. \n5. Doorknob (E) is, therefore, the appropriate answer.\nSo the final analysis is 1. (A) 2. (B) 3. (C) 4. (D) 5. (E)\n\nInput: The girl's apartment was in an unknown part of Boston. At what might one go for coffee? Choices:  a: Starbucks b: Dunkin Donuts c: 7/11 d: corner market e: Tim Horton\nOutput: 1.'The girl\u2019s apartment' implies that the coffee shop options would also not be applicable to Boston as a whole as coffee is a relatively localized item.\n2. This is a fairly broad question, as the coffee places mentioned seem to cover large swaths of the city. The options do not seem to be specific enough.\n3. 'Starbucks' is a global coffee brand and not only associated with Boston.\n4. Similarly, although 'Dunkin Donuts' is also a globally recognized chain, it also does not fit the options needed - the girl could be elsewhere in Boston instead of the 'unknown' part of it.\n5. '7/11' is an international convenience store, thus it is not a very plausible option to fit the context of the question.\n6. 'Tim Horton' was a Canadian coffee chain with more than 4,800 locations, which exceeds the criteria of a coffee chain in an 'unknown' part of Boston, a girl specifically, and a localized item.\n7. The only option from the original four that fits the context is 'corner market'. \n8. Hence, the correct answer is 'corner market' as this is a localized and plausible option.\nSo the final evaluation is: \n1. (A) Starbucks 2. (B); Dunkin Donuts 3. (C); 7/11 4. (D); Tim Horton 5. (E); Corner market\n\nInput: What might someone have if she or he worked for a university? Choices:", "answer": "A: washing machine"}

C: after school 4. D: lunch 5. E: between lectures\nOutput: 1: A: during rest period is incorrect, since a rest period is typically between classes. However, a teacher may find the time in-between classes and some lunch periods during the middle of the day as an opportunity to take some free time, maybe to use the bathroom.\n2. B: free period is incorrect, since free periods are the time in-between certain classes. Although a teacher may have some extra breaks during free periods they are rarely long enough to do much.\n3. C: after-school is incorrect, a teacher's school day usually ends after finishing classes. However, there may be times throughout the day where the teacher may need to use the bathroom, in the evening, or after-school hours.\n4. D: luch is incorrect, since lunch is usually only taken in-between classes. It might actually disrupt a teacher's workday.\n5. E: between classes is incorrect, since there isn't a break between some classes since they're consecutive.\n6. Therefore, option E: between certain classes is correct, as this could refer to a teacher's break time in between classes.\nSo the final option is E: between certain classes\n\nInput: Is it better to live in a suburb or a city? Choices: \n A: suburb is not correct, since a suburb is typically an outer part of a city.\n B: city is correct, since cities are generally more populous and typically have greater job opportunities.\n C: more space is incorrect, since cities typically contain more space compared to suburbs.\n D: better job opportunity is incorrect, since there could be career opportunities in or around suburbs as well.\n\nSo the final answer will be B: city", "answer": "B: happiness"}

Choices:  Titan  Mars, Europa  Earth  Mars  Mercury\nOutput: 1 - The given question refers to the planet on which a large number of cratres would be found.\n2 - The correct answer is D - Mars. \n3 - An example of large craters could be the volcano's caldera. \n4 - For Earth option - Mars appears to have more volcanoes than Earth and a volcano is more likely to be accompanied by a collapsed caldera and thus more craters.\n5 - For Europa option - Europa has too less number of craters as compared to other planets as its crust is brittle. \n6 - For Titan option - Titan doesn't have any craters as its atmosphere is made of ice and not rock. \n7 - For Mercury option - Mercury's surface is covered with 6 craters per square mile as they were created in the solar system formation. \nSo the final answer choice is D - Mars.", "answer": "C: throne room"}
{"text": ") and doorknob (D) are all found within a doorway of some kind, the 'object' referred to in the question can be none of these but rather something smaller.\n4. Choices E: doorway and option D: doorknobs are irrelevant to the context of the question.\n5. This narrows things down to choices: C: opening doors and E: doorway because these options are the only ones where you could feasibly find the object being referred to in the question.\n6. However, we can quickly eliminate choice E: doorway because this contains many independent objects such as the actual door as well as the frame, the hinges, the latch etc. All these, along with others, could potentially contain the 'object' of the question.\n7. Hence, choice C: opening doors sounds like the most probable answer.\nSo the final solution is C: Opening Doors\n\n---\n## Solution 2\n```\nWhen a person is beginning work\n```\n```\n1. \n2.

A doorway itself is typically a hinged door-opening that leads to or from a room and can be where we grab objects contained within a doorway when we answer this question.\n5. Therefore the most fitting response is E: doorway, as it's defined in the context of the question.\nSo the final choice is E: doorway\n\nInput: If I wanted to buy something from a vintage store, where I would find it? Choices: \n A: in a regular store B: at the post office C: at a yard sale D: in the window E: at a bookstore\nOutput: 1) The context is specific to vintage stores. \n2) Choices A to E are not limited to vintage stores only. \n3) Choice A: In a regular store, refers to a new vintage store and not an old store selling old things. \n4) Choices B and C: At a yard sale, are not limited to vine stores. But since they do sell old stuff, it fits the context of the question better than D. Option D: At the post office is out of context and doesn't fit our requirements. \n5) Choice E: at a book store is limited to book stores and can be sold by a vintage store but is not a vintage store.\n6) So the final choice is B: at a yard sale. \nSo the final choice (B) is at a yard sale\n\nInput: When should I call my lawyer?

These phrases are vague and ambiguous, so it's unlikely to choose when you are in trouble or cannot handle everything alone as they can occur anytime in life. 2: It's quite obvious that people should reach out to lawyers when they're", "answer": "E: falling down"}
{"text": "), and more can all be located within a doorway, they do not necessarily appear within the structure of the physical door itself. \n4. A doorway in the simplest sense of the word refers to the area that you come through when entering or exiting a door. Therefore, doorknobs (D) and doors themselves (E) cannot fit the description of being contained by a doorway, as they aren't within the structure.\n5. Only option C: Opening door fits into the structure of a doorway and this implies the correct answer to be D: D oorknob \nSo the final answer here is D: doorknobb\n\n### Instruction:Answer the multiple choice question.\n### Input: Who would build the wall of a brick building?

Looking further at other options, A: a television or B: a control panel also makes little sense since these are large enough to stand without the frame of the doorway.\n6.

The most probable answer is that it would be 'contained by' the doorway. It wouldn't be in it.\n5. Therefore the most correct answer is D: doorway. \nSo the final answer would be D: doorway\n\nInput: Which of these would a person not be able to help them get in or out of the car? Choices:  B: gloves C: car door D: seat belt E: seat belt safety \nOutput: 1) The question is asking which of these options is not able to help them get into or out of the car. \n2) From the question, we know that each choice will have to be something that would help a person get into or out of a car. Since it can't be \"car door\" since one can't use that to get in or out of their car.\n3) Choice B: gloves: Gloves are something that is used to keep one's hands warm in colder climates, or with tasks that require fine movements. However, most gloves do NOT keep one's hands protected from injury, and a seat belt offers more protection than gloves.\n4) Choice C: car door. A door is not a protective piece, except for a door with locks on it to prevent someone from getting through. Door locks do not mean that they are safe for one to get into or out of.\n5) Choice D: seat belt. seat belt is an option that is clearly about getting into and out of a vehicle. It keeps you protected during an accident, it cannot be used to help you to get into a car.\n6) The only possible choice is E: seat belt safe. It's because a seat belt is meant to protect one when they're in an accident. So a person could be in a situation in which they're able to safely get out of their car in a crash and would need something to get out faster. So seat belt safe makes sense.\nSo the final correct answer is E: seat belts are safe.\n\n\n## Output:", "answer": "C: castle"}
{"text": "), doorknob (D), or doorway (E) can be an object contained by a structure, we need to select the option 'closest to the context of the question'. It's safe to say that the object contained by a particular doorway isn't a doorknob, nor a doorway; it's something within the inside of the doorway.\n4. Option E, doorway, is likely in the area that is within the doorway. Thus, we can throw options C, D, B, and A out. Option E is a plausible choice, but it's overly broad.\n5. Option E can only refer to the doorway itself, but we need to go deeper than the doorway as the object will likely be enclosed within the doorway.\n6. We can check other relevant options to understand which would fit the context best. For example, looking at option A 'television' we have to consider what part of the doorway would reasonably contain a television within a house; it would be at the bottom corner directly behind the door. This type of placement is unlikely to be appropriate as the object contained by a door can't be in the structure of the door itself. \n7. Option B 'control panel', similarly can't be an item contained by the door, due to the control panel being in the structure or framework of the door. Option B can't be the answer choice.\n8. Let's consider the choice C 'opening doors'. This is a plausible option. However, opening doors can be inside or out of the doorway; thus, we can throw this option out of consideration. Another relevant option is C 'doorknob'. The doorknob would be an element of the doorway. Therefore, the final answer will be C 'doorknub'.\nSo the final answers are C: doorknob.\n\nInput: What do sharps have to do with a song? Choices: 1.

Where can you find a cat? Choices: 1. Behind B. In front of E. A. C.\nOutput: 1 The question asks us to identify where a cat could be found while a dog is chasing its owner.\n2. \"In front of\" and \"behind\" are only plausible for an independent object that isn't attached to either the owner or the dog.\n3. If the cat were on the owner, it would be moving with the owner and it wouldn't be where he is.\n4. The three remaining possible locations for a cat are: A: in the owner's house, B: outside, and C: on the dog.\n5. The only option which involves two of these possibilities simultaneously is C: in the dog.\n6. Option A: not plausible. If in the house, the cat would move when it was safe to do so.\n7. Option B: outdoors. If a cat is outdoors when the dog starts pursuing its master, it is likely to flee.\n8. Option C: The only option where the cat could be placed that it would stay in place: in the dog. \n9. Therefor, the correct choice is C: in the Dog.\nSo the final result is C: in the dong\n\nInput: What is the name of the room where we'd be most comfortable? Choices: 2.

Choices: 1: you might be working with an AES 256-bit key 2:  There's a problem on a motherboard 3: Your CPU processor just shut down 4: Your system software crashed\nOutput: 1: This doesn't make sense, as I/O errors don't affect video. They are issues related to input and output, which are part of storage, not video. \n2: This doesn't seem like it would relate to a video error. It could simply describe the cause of an I/O error. \n3: This isn't related to a video error. \n4: This doesn't directly relate to a video error either - it's likely referring to a failure in the operating system (OS), rather than the video device.\n5: This choice also isn't related to I/O errors, which would be related to hardware, not CPU or software itself. \n6: This choice is about the graphics card, which is a hardware component, not the CPU or software. \n7: This choice describes an electrical error or a power surge, which likely wouldn't indicate a video problem either. \n8: This option relates to corrupted files, which wouldn't indicate a problem with a video device.   \n9: This option would be related to audio issues instead of video issues.  10: This option relates software to hardware, which is similar to the CPU shutdown issue.     \nTherefore, we can eliminate 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 choices. 1 : You might be working with an advanced encryption standard (AES) 2: 256-key is the minimum key length for AES, and a key isn't a video error.

Choices:  B: bend down C: ask nicely D: look up E: peer inside\nOutput: 1: The question asks how should a human look inside a person apartment. \n2: Consider the following: \n\n   - 'inside a person' : This phrase suggests that the person is already inside the apartment, meaning that the human being looking inside is already outside the apartment. \n\t\n   - To look inside, you would have to bend down. \n\n3: Based on these interpretations, we can eliminate options C: ask nicely, D: look up, and E: peer inside. \n\t\n4: The options left are then to be compared based on the degree of bending required. \n\n   - Aptitude of bending: Not everyone bends to the same degree. \n\n   A: bend down (11.3 cm) - A smaller difference in height, making it harder but not impossible \n\n   B: bend down (20.6 cm) - A steeper bend (or more extreme) making it a lot more difficult to do \n\n5: Based on the aforementioned reasoning, we can therefore conclude that the best fitting answer is A: bend down.\n\nSo the final answer 11.3 cm and 20.6 cm bends of 'bend down' bend is A: bend dow\n\n# Question 11\nInput: Do I need to have an account?

{"text": "), door handle (D) and doorway (E) could all be located within the structure of a doorway; only options B and E are relevant based on the context of the sentence.\n4. Option A: TV, is unrelated to a door, so it's not the most appropriate choice.\n5. Option B contains the keyword 'contained by' which makes it an applicable answer.\n6. Option D is a misnomer, since the correct term is 'doorknob'.\n7. Option E is the answer to the question.\nSo the final choice is B: control panel.\n\nInput: How can you determine where to put your seat on a train? Choices: \n A: how much space you have  B: by watching others C: by what their doing D: what the environment is E: how the trains going\nOutput: 1: The question asks \"How can you determine where to sit on a train?\" 2: To clarify on context; It's assumed the seat is free, and you are asking where you should sit.\n3: This implies you have limited options, in which case your choice would be based on whether to sit in a crowded or empty section of your train. This also implies seating is available and this is a place where it can be determined.\n4: As for the other seats, choices B: by watching others, C: by what their (sic) doing, D: what the environment (sic) is, E: how the trains (sic) going are unrelated to determining where you sit on a train car, as this is related to what your seats will be like rather than where you can determine to sit.\n5: In the end, the only choice that answers where you can decide to sit is option A: how much space (you) \nhave.   \n6: To clarify further, there are many seats on a train. Only if there wasn't any available seating would the question and answer change.   \n7: In this case, there are many seats, and one doesn't 'determine' where to sit before all is said and done, rather, where to sit is based on your environment, i.e., how much space you (or have, as seen in the answer) have.\nSo the final selection is A: how much space  you  have\n\nInput: Where can", "answer": "B: unbreakable"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) could all fall within this category, as they are contained within the doorway, they are not specific to the scenario described.\n4. An object within a doorway would have to be immediately visible, or easily visible from the doorway, but still be contained within the same space.\n5. The correct answer can be found in E: Doorway. We already know that the object is contained within the doorway structure and the only objects immediately visible from the doorway are the doorway itself, its surroundings (such as counters, walls, etc).\n6. Therefore, an object in front of the doorway wouldn't be able to be an object contained by the doorway.\n7. This leaves only doorways themselves as the only objects that can be contained by the doorway, making it E: Doorway our final answer.\nSo the final  answer is E: Doorway\n\nInput: Which of the following is the last place that a roach might be alive?

A roach is unlikely to survive on a countertop although it is not impossible, the roach would likely die within a short period of time.\n\nE. The last place one would expect to find a roach would be found dead or alive in trash.\n\nB. A dirty floor is a place you could find a dead roach. \n\nC. A countertop is a place where a roach could be found alive, where one could not find a dead roach, though it would likely not survive long on a countertop.\n\nD. Trash is the last place that one would normally expect a roach to be found dead", "answer": "C: space center"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) could potentially both be an object and be within a doorway, they are all too broad for our answer, as we are looking for a specific answer.\n4. The question is asking for a more specific answer, so we might eliminate doorknob (as the question says \"an object\" and doorknob does not immediately sound like an object).\n5. Therefore we are left with control panel (B) and opening doors (C) as the only correct and specific answers left.\n6. However, the question explicitly states that the object can be \"grabbed\" which infers that it must be within reach of the person.\n   \n7. Hence, option B, control panel, is incorrect as the person is able to reach the control panel.\n   \n8. Option C, opening doors, is the correct answer as it describes a situation in which the person is not actively moving or reaching, but within reach of the doorway. \n9. Therefore, the correct answer is option C, opening doors.\nSo the final answers is C: opening doors\n\nInput: What is a type of energy that a person feels? Choices: 1: emotions 2: excitement 3: warmth 4: energy 5: joy\nOutput: 1.\"emotions\" could be a feeling felt by the person.\n2.\"excitement\" could be a feeling that a person feels.\n3.\"warmth\" could be a feeling a person may feel.\n4.\"energy\" could be a feeling.\n5.\"joy\" also sounds like a valid option\n2. Choice 1 has been eliminated as emotions, although often can be felt by a person, \"a type of energy\" cannot be felt as energy.\n4. Eliminates 3 because although warmth can be a feeling, it is also energy.\n5. Eliminates 5 because joy can be a feeling but energy cannot.\n6. Eliminates 2 because excitement can be a feeling but can also be a general type of energy as well\n7. This leaves the sole option 4. The correct answer to the question is 4. \"energy\".\nSo the final answer us B: energy.\n\nInput: What did John say to Paul?

This leaves us with two remaining options: D: Doorknob and E: doorway. \n5. Doorknob is the physical opening which is located at the top of the doorway, so it is not the correct option, leaving us with our final answer - E: doorway.\nSo the final choice is E: doorway\n\nInput: What are the best ways to use a paperclip? Choices:  Pens C: keyboards B: scissors D: notebooks E: computer screens\nOutput: 1.) The question asks what are the best ways to utilize a paperclip.\n2.) Each of the choices given are objects, which do not include any form of motion and are not in the same category as a paperclip.\n3.) Out of these choices, B: scissor is the only choice in the same category as the paperclip as both are commonly used as tools to cut things \u2013 paper and string respectively. \n4.) Additionally, a computer screen is used to display images and videos, and a paperclip is not an implement used to display images and video. \n5.) This leaves us with two options: B: Scissor or D: Notebook.\n6.) However, option D: Notebook only talks about notebooks and not about best ways to use a notebook, thus option D: Notebook does not fully complete the task of best ways to use a pen, as it refers to only one of the ways.\n7.) Out of the remaining options, both A: Pens and C: Keyboards refer to physical items which are not in the same classification as paperclips (which is a small metal item shaped like a claw) which are used to combine or connect sheets of paper. \n8.) This means that out of the two remaining options \u2013 B: Scissor and D: Notebook \u2013 we should eliminate either A: Pens or C: Keyboards because they provide incomplete sentences. \n9.) This leaves us with B: Scissor & D: Notebook. \n10.) Now we have arrived at the final stage, where we select the best of the two remaining options to complete the sentence.\n11.)

Therefore; we can conclude that the correct answer is E: Doorway.\nSo the final response is E: Door\n\nInput: When you have to go down a slide, how must you go up? Choices:  a: by sliding down b: down c: up d: forward e: back\nOutput: 1.(a)The question is asking how one would get up after coming down a slide. It's important to note the phrase, \"how must you.\" The structure of the question implies that there is only one, definitive way to do this, and alternative ways are not acceptable. \n4. There are only two possible ways to get up after going down a slide. You can go up by sliding down or by going up. \n5. The phrase \"in order to\" highlights the importance of sliding down. While sliding down is the only way to go up and down a slide, it's not mentioned as a necessary requirement in the given choices. \n6. Choices B, D, and E have sliding down mentioned as a means for getting up. The correct response is choice A: by sliding down.\nSo the final choice is A: by sliding\n\nInput: If two people are talking in a small space, what does it get in the way of? Choices: 1. communication a. between them 2. clarity b. noise c. privacy 3. both conversations d. none of the above\nOutput: 4. The given question asks us what a small space can get in the way of. The obvious answer would be communication, as we don't want a small space to be in communication, but that's not what the question asks. \n5. If the small space is too small, it can potentially get in the way, in varying degrees, of clarity, privacy, conversations, and even none. \n6. But the key phrase here is 'between', which implies communication between people, and not communication between a space and a person.", "answer": "A: train station"}
{"text": ") and a door (D) could be considered as doorway components, they are not within the structure of the actual doorway; an object that falls within this description is the doorknob (E). \n4.

Since the answer must be either a or b, we can eliminate options c and d from the list of options as they are not vehicles that can be driven on land. 3. After eliminating options c, we have a choice between a) car and b) truck where we are asked if we need a license to drive those two vehicles. 4. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, a truck (a large motor vehicle for transporting goods) is classified as a vehicle, which indicates that we should select b) truck for the correct answer. But we can be more sure about this by using our common sense to determine that a truck is not a car, which makes b) truck the correct answer. So the final answer is B. So the final answer are b. truck\n\nInput: What could you use to help you when you are cold? Choices:  a: a coat b: blankets c: a dog d: a hat e: a fan\nOutput: 1.) We are asked to choose an answer from a list which has a variety of options; each item in the list represents a means to help us when we are cold. 2.) We can eliminate options b and d from the selection as they are nouns that do not function as helping tools or things that could be used to help us when we experience coldness. 3.) After eliminating options b and d, we have a choice of answers between a) coat, and c) dog. 4.) Options a and c are both verbs - action nouns that are verbs, not things that we could use to help us when we're cold. 5.) The correct answer should be one that is a thing we could use to", "answer": "A: look at"}

Choices:  A. flip switch B. flip circuit breaker C. flip circuit board D. flip power button E. none of these choices\nOutput: 1.\"One way to get a car switched on is to turn the switch\" would be a grammatically correct sentence, and this suggests one to use a switch to turn on a car.\n2. Although options B, D, and E can apply to a car in terms of switches, they are all incorrect here for the simple reason that to get a car started, one would simply flip a switch.\n3. Choice A: \"flip switch\" is the correct answer and corresponds to a switch as an answer.\nSo the final response is A: flip switch\n\nInput: The tune may get you some money, it's catchy. Choices:  O A catchy B catch B C catchy song D catch on E catch up \nOutput: 1: The tune is catchy, which means it is pleasing to listen to or watch.\n2. It doesn't get you any money; as it doesn't imply any kind of financial gain.\n3. It can't be a C catchy song as it would imply that the tune in itself is the thing that causes the person to get money.\n4. This means that the tune would need to cause somebody to do something and that person would then get money.\n5. Catch on can't be the answer as it would imply the person would have to do something to catch onto the tune.\n6. As it doesn't imply they have to do anything, the answer then would be B: catchy.\nSo the final correct answer is B: catchy\n\nInput: Why did the chicken cross the road? Choices: 1. Chase a car 2.

Choices:  Choices:  A. cook it all. B. bake it all. C. cook something made with it. C. bake something made with it. D. make bread. E. cook something, or bake something made with flour\nOutput: 1.`The definition of \"bake\" is 'to cook (food) by exposing it to dry heat in an oven, toast, etc.' So, when a recipe calls for flour, the flour must be exposed to the heat of the oven to \"cook\" it or \"bake\" it. `\n2.`In this context, the phrases `bake it all` and `cook it all` are interchangeable. `\n3.`A: \"Cook it all\" - A phrase that doesn't make sense in this context. \n4.`B: \"Bake it all\" - The only phrase that's logically correct at this point. \n5.`C: \"Cook something made with it\" - Cooking is a process involving heat whereas cooking something made with flour is a process involving flour. Therefore, the choice is incorrect.`\n6.`D: \"Make bread,\" - To make bread, flour is used as an ingredient. However, making bread is not the only possible outcome in this context. `\n7.`E: \"Cook something, or bake it\" - This is a phrase that can be re-phrased as \"cook something, or bake the item made with flour\". The phrase is incorrect because it implies that the baking process only involves the item made with flou \n8.`So, the final answer is B, bake it all.\nSo the final choice would be B: bake it all.", "answer": "B: motel room"}
{"text": "), doorknob (D), and doorway (E) can be all objects or items that could be considered being contained by a doorway, the answer can be eliminated and the most feasible answer can be found by eliminating the irrelevant items.\n4. Item E: doorway is a wrong statement as the question is asking for object contained by doorway and doorway cannot, by definition, contain object. \n5. The answer could be either item B: control panel or item C: opening doors as both can fit within the context. \n6. Item B: control panel can be eliminated as it is something you can only grab when the door is closed. You cannot reach something that is inside a structure and it's door is closed. \n7. Item D: doorknobs is not the correct answer either because although doorknobs can be easily grabbed it could also be considered not to be contained by the doorway. \n8. Based on the analysis above. the correct answer would be B: control panel as the option that does include the idea of controlled door movement without necessarily having to be able to reach the object as well.\nSo the final answered is B: control panel", "answer": "E: backpack"}

{"text": "), and the doorknob (D) are all objects that could physically pass through the doorway, these choices are either too specific to the question or inapplicable.\n4. A television is not an everyday object, and a control panel could be located elsewhere. \n5. Similarly, opening doors (C) is a task that requires many steps and would not fall under the category of 'grabbing an object'.\n6. A door is technically a portal and would not typically contain an object inside. Doorknobs (D) and doorways (E) do not fall under the category either, since any object that one grabs would be inside the doorway.\n7. The only choice that actually contains a physical object is doorway.\n8. Thus, the most appropriate answer to the question is 'doorway'. \nSo the final answer to the question is doorway\n\nInput: An avid gardener wouldn't plant seeds near what? Choices: A: garden B: door frame C: patio D: deck E: basement\nOutput: 1) The question asks where one would not plant seeds for their garden.\n2) Option E: Basement is incorrect because it does not apply to gardens. \n3) Option B: Door Frame is incorrect since one wouldn't plant seated near the door. Additionally, gardeneers do not typically plant seeds outside near their house anyway.\n4) Option D: Deck is incorrect since decking is typically too low as to obstruct a gardener from being able to plant seeds. \n5) Option A: Garden is incorrect because gardens are typically not in the basement, nor do they need sunlight so one could not plant seeds in the basment.\n6) Option C: Patio is incorrect because they're typically flat, and any planted seeds would typically go to waste in the case of uneven surfaces.\n7) Therefore, the correct response is 'Patio'.\n8) Since it is the only answer remaining.\n\nSo the final answer will be, 'Patio'\n\n<br>\n\n### Question 5.

Choices:  a) school dance b) office picnic c) class trip d) book club e) birthday party \nOutput: 1 a person is likely to have a good at a school function such as a dance because school functions are typically events that a group of people in a more casual setting than a party.\n2 A birthday party might be fun to attend, but if the person isn't going as a group or they aren't acquainted with the birthday celebrant, they are unlikely to enjoy themselves at the party.\n3 Class trips are often geared towards academic learning experiences and the participants are typically students or their teachers. This makes them unlikely to be a location for a good time.\n4 A book club meeting is not likely to be as enjoyable or as conducive to a good time as a social party held for the same goal.\n5 A picnic held in an office building most probably will be work-related, thereby resulting in a sub-par social atmosphere.\n6 A school dance is social event, which is more likely to be conducive to a positive interaction with others and a good time in comparison to the other options.\n7. Therefore the correct answer to this question is option A: school dance.\nSo the final answers is a: school dance", "answer": "B: raise"}

Cure makers are not licensed or qualified medical practitioners and may not perform many of the same tasks as licensed medical practitioners.\n5) Doctorate program teachers are not usually engaged in the daily work of diagnosing and treating a patient. Teachers who work at the doctorate level educate students; they may conduct scientific research but have typically not established themselves as licensed medical practictioners who diagnose and treat ills.\n6) CNA's in contrast to the other choices are caregivers.\nSo the final choices are Coding scientist and CNA", "answer": "E: get food"}

Choices:  (A) In any bookstore B (B) In any library C (C) at a grocery store D (D) at home  E (E) in a bistro\nOutput: 1) The question is asking where in a bookstore or library you would be able to find a book with a differently coloured spine. 2) Books usually don't have different colored spines. The most common examples I can think of are library books with a different color spines, so that you can differentiate between them being checked out or available to other patrons to be checked out. 3) I can't find many books in a grocery store, so this option doesn't work. I can think of children's books in a baby section of the grocery store, but they don't often have a different colored spine from other books on the shelf. 4) I can imagine rare books in private collections, but they would be unavailable for other people to read. 5) I can't imagine a book in a home having different colored spine. Most of the time books in homes are purchased new and don't have different colors spines. 6) In a bistro, I can't imagine the book having a different colored spine being a bistro book. Bistro books are often recipes or menus. Most likely they would have the bistro's name on the spine rather than a different color. 7-8) As a result I think B at any library is the best answer because it covers all the possibilities and has the most sense of possibility.\nSo the final choice is C) at a groc", "answer": "E: surf net"}

A: drive B: park C: go to town D: think of places E: look for places\nOutput: 1  The objective of this question is to choose an option that is not associated with getting food whilst travelling.\n2. Only option A: driving for food is not associated with getting the food.\n3. Option B - if the man is driving for food, option B cannot be the correct choice.\n4. Options C and D relate to choices that are necessary to find and get food.\n5. Option E is related to looking for places where you can get food.\n6.

{"text": "), and doorknob (D) are all objects in a doorway, they aren't contained as they are individual objects within a room. They're not entirely connected to the doorway.\n4. As an opening of a doorway (C) implies physical movement, it is therefore not a plausible answer choice.\n5. Taking into account the context of the answer (\"contained by\"), the only remaining answer is E: doorway.\n6. As it says, an object contained within a doorway must be in a doorway, and thus option E is the correct answer.\nSo the final answers is E: doorway\n\nInput: Who would a person speak to who has heard a man and lady say good morning? Choices:   A: person B: lady C: man D: neighbor E: stranger\nOutput: 1: The person speaking to the man and lady who have said good morning to each other has the potential to be the man or the lady themselves.\n2: Based on the given definition of good morning as a polite expression used when greeting someone you know, we can reasonably assume that it's used when meeting someone for the first time. \n3: The person could be a stranger if the lady and man have said good morning to a stranger in the past. In this case, the stranger would have to be a lady or a man. 4: This eliminates the possibility of the person in question being a lady, the man, or a neighbor. \n5: The question further states that the man and lady are aware of the person's gender through their greetings to that person. It is not explicitly stated that the lady and man know the person's gender, as mentioned in the question. \n6: The other remaining possibility would be the neighbour. \n7: The person could be the man if he knows the stranger through the lady and he knows the opposite gender's greetings (i.e. the lady would say good afternoon). \n8: This eliminates the possibilities of the stranger being a neighbor or the man (because the man knows the lady). \n9: The only remaining option would be the lady (stranger) and the neighbour. \n10: The lady would be speaking to a neighbor about her relationship with the man. \n11: Hence, the final answer would be A: person.\nSo the final", "answer": "D: dedication"}

Choices: 1. Window seat 2. Aisle seat\nOutput: 1.) The question is asking which of the two options for a seat on an airplane (window seat or aisle-seat) is more affordable. When looking at the choices available, it is clear that the aisle-seats cost more than the window seats, so the aisle-sections are more expensive to book with flights.\n2.) The aisles are more expensive due to the fact that passengers are more likely to walk past a passenger with an aisle-seating option, so they charge passengers a lot to make sure that they don't have empty aisles.\n3.) In addition, a window seat is likely to be seen as a more desired spot due to its access to the wall and larger amount of space.\n4.) Therefore, the window seats are more affordable due to these reasons and so the correct answer is 2, Aisle seat is the more expensive ticket. \nSo the answer for the given question is 2: Aisle seat.\n\nInput: Why do people try to avoid talking on a cell phone while shopping?

C: to get the children out of the house 4. D: to show off your money 5. E: to take action against deforestation\nOutput: 1 & 2. The question is asking what the primary reason you would go to a zoo would be. \n2. Based on the given choices \nA to see animals - this is a partial reason, as this applies to both the zoo and a zoo-like environment, such as a safari. To visit a zoo only for animal watching would not be sufficient. \nB to see the grounds - this refers to the landscaping, gardens, and other aspects of the zoo. \nC to get the children out - while this could be a reason for an adult to bring children to a zoo, it is also a reason to visit the zoo with children. \nD to show off your money - again, while this could be a factor for some, it is not the main reason to visit the zoo.\nE to take action against defoestedation - this is also a reason to go to a zoo; however, it is too specific to this particular context.\n3. While options B, C, and E could be plausible, they are not the only possible reasons for visiting a zoo. As the question only asks for one reason, and not multiple reasons, the most probable answer would be A 'to see animals' and B 'to see the grounds'.\nSo, the final answer is 1. TO SEE ANIMALS and 2.

Choices: 1. A: talk B: read C: write 2. D: pray E: meditate 3. F: sing 4. G: eat\nOutput: 1, 2. The objective of having dinner with others in a group is to engage in conversation and be attentive enough to avoid disturbing other diners. Thus, talking (A), singing, or meditation are not appropriate options, as those activities interfere with the conversation.\n 3, 4. One of the social cues is to follow the pace of the conversation, as being ahead of time or behind would be considered impolite. Thus, writing (C) and praying (D) would not be appropriate.\n \n5.

Choices:  1. A: bread 2. B: cheese 3. C: meat 4. D: cooked food 5. E: dairy products\nOutput: 1 and 2. To refrigerate bread or cheese would be a bad choice as these items do not require refrigeration and would therefore spoil if kept in the refrigerator, leading to a waste of resources and possibly financial loss.\n3. While meat does require refrigeration to preserve, it could be reasonably transported in cold temperatures, not freezing temperatures, as the question implies.\n4.

Choices:  C: pool A: house B: bed E: bathtub D: bedding\nOutput: 1.\"Putting your feet down/off\" and \"putting your feet in a place\" are two different actions. \n2. \"Pool\", \"bed\", and \"bedding\" are inanimate items with no ability to accommodate burnt feet and could potentially burn them further, and could also be used to relieve aches related to prolonged standing.  \n3. \"Bathtub\" is a container that can hold your feet. But there's no guarantee that the water in the tub will be too hot, in which case the water will burn your skin, not to mention you need to add soap/shampoo in there to make the water work well. \n4. \"House\" could refer to a building you own or rent, with no guarantee that you have enough money to have a house or that the property is free of harmful chemicals that could hurt your skin if you accidentally sit barefoot in them. \n5. \"A\" and \"E\" are irrelevant as they do not make any logical sense in the context of the question. \n6.

The question posed by the prompt is, however, about whether a person is in their home or not. And, if they are not in their home, their doorbell will probably be located elsewhere. Therefore, the correct answer is 1: ring to someone knock  door, because this option is most relevant and not too open-ended.\nSo the final response is 1: ringing to someone knocking on the front door", "answer": "E: formal garden"}
{"text": "), and a doorknob (D) can all be within a doorway, they are not objects that could be contained within the structure of a doorway.\n4.

Choices:  Option A: Church B: Museum C: Train Station D: Library E: Restaurant\nOutput: 1. The question asks which location you to locate people who are quiet at least for 3 consecutive minutes. \n2. The key point here is that people who are quiet need not be in the location itself, they need only be present in the same vicinity.\n3. There cannot be any silence in a Church; it can only be very quiet.\n4. Museums are places for appreciation of beautiful artworks and artifacts. Museums serve as educational and entertainment hubs and are generally loud and engaging places.\n5. Train stations are noisy and often congested places with announcements, conversations, and the hum of the machines.\n6. Libraries are quiet places but still relatively noisy. Even if people are quiet at any given point, they will likely soon start talking, reading, working on a laptop, etc.\n7. Finally, restaurants are typically noisy places with background music, conversations, servers, machines, etc.\n8. Based off these considerations, we can rule out options B: Museum, C: Train Station, and E: Restaurant as incorrect as they don't serve the purpose of the question.\n9. Option D: Library is not always 100% quiet. We have seen that when people are quiet, they are not always quiet at all times, and this is because they are humans and their actions cannot be regulated or controlled anyhow.\n10. Based on the considerations made, only Option A: Church is plausible as it is a place where people can possibly be quiet and for their silence to last at least for 3 minutes because the nature of a Church is calm and quiet.\n11. Since Churches also serve the purpose of gathering, people can be in a Church", "answer": "D: carpenter's shop"}

The object must be within the doorway, so no non-door related objects and non-door-independent actions or movements would be possible - hence option D: doorknobs and option E: doorways would be incorrect\n5. Therefore, we can narrow it down to A: television, B: control panel, or C: opening doors, but the only one that fits the context perfectly is C:opening doors. \n6. The most fitting answer therefore is C: opening doors.\nSo the final answers is C: opening doors\n\nInput: The doctor wants to help all her patients feel better, is working to improve the hospital an action? Choices:  yes, no A: yes B: no C: yes D: no E: yes\nOutput: 1 The objective here is to check if the doctor's intention of helping all her patients feel better can be defined as an 'action'. \n2. There are two primary categories for an 'action': it can be an inaction (where it is the intention of not doing something) or it can be an action (where it is the action towards accomplishing a task).\n3. For the given scenario, let's check the choice to understand the doctor's intention. \n4. Option A: yes, doesn't fit, as feeling better is not an action, but a feeling which isn't the doctor's intent. \n5. We can eliminate choices B: no and C: yes, as feeling better by the doctor would be inaction not an action. \n6. From the remaining two options, option D: no is incorrect as an action is an action towards something, and option E: yes, would fit as working towards accomplishing tasks is an action.\n7. Therefore the final answer is E : Yes.\nSo the final final answer is E : yes \n\n\n### Final\n\nInstruction:You've seen the examples.

Lava (A), sand (D), and salt (C) are not likely to be present in a dishwashed, since the dishwashed is a place.\n4. Water (B) and soap (E) would be necessary for the washing machine to work.\n5. So the correct answer is B.\nSo the final questions for the 'Answers' section is:\nWhat does a dishwashered clean for?\nWhat should you avoid doing in the dishwashered?.\nSo the correct sequence of questions and answers is\n1. What does a dishwashed clean?\n2. The dishwashed cleans dishes with water and soap.\n3. What should you avoid doing in a dishwished?.\nThe dishwashed should be kept dry; other ingredients could make it too messy, or prevent it from working.\n4. What would put in a dishwasht?\nYou should put water and soap in the dishwashed to clean the dishes, and avoid putting sand, lava, or other liquids.\n5. How does the dishwashed work?.", "answer": "A: utah"}

Choices: A: awoke B: awoke C: did not awoke D: awoke and did not awoke E: awoke and baked an apple pie\nOutput: 1.'Awoke' (verb) means to wake from sleep, while 'wake' (noun) is a device used to turn a circuit or electrical device on and off.\n2. Choices B: Awoke, C: Did not awoke, and D: Awoke and did not Awoke don't make sense in the given question; they aren't specific enough.\n3. Choices A: Woke, and E: Awoke and baked apple pie are only about wake/woke, not the action of a single cat.\n4. Therefore Choice E is accurate: After she awokes the cat, she does awoke and bakes an apple pie.\nSo the final decision is E: awoke\n\nInput: When he went for a walk, what may he be doing? Choices: 1. Looking for a house that he liked 2. Looking for a house he liked 3. Looking for a house for rent 4. Looking around for a house for rent\nOutput: 1-4 The question is asking what a man might be doing while out walking?\n2-3. These options do not make sense as it's not a typical daily action to be looking for and renting a house at the same time.\n4. There is no mention of having \"found\" a house that he likes so looking for a house that he lik is inaccurate.\n5. The sentence \"Looking for a house for rent\" stands alone but is still incorrect as the subject and verb are misaligned.\n6. Therefore, \"Looking around for the house for rent\" is the correct response.\nSo the answer is E: Looking around for the house for rents.\n\nInput: What are people with similar tast", "answer": "D: human being"}
{"text": "), and opening door handles (D) could all be considered as contained by a doorway, we must determine which of these choices would be the most likely choice of an audience for whom the question is intended. \n4. Looking at options A, C, and D, all of these are parts of the door, with options B and E being more independent and not necessarily as likely to be picked up by someone. \n5. Therefore, option D: Doorknob is the most reasonable answer choice as this is usually the part of the door that people use the most when opening and closing the door, hence it is the most probable object to be picked up.\n\nSo the final answer to this question is D: doorknobs\n\n##### Solution 3\n\nInput: A person who wanted to put things in order might have done what? Choices: A: organize them B: make them beautiful C: improve them D: sort them E: give up on them\nOutput: 1) The question asks who would organize things or put them in order. 2) This question can be interpreted in two ways. It can be asking a person who already has an order and is trying to find a way to put them in order. It can also be asking a question from a person who has a messy unorganized place and is trying to put it in order. 3) In relation to this question a 'person' could have done many things to help improve their order of things. For example, A) Organized, B) Made them beautiful, C) Improved, D) Sort, and E) Gave up. These options can be selected from either side of the coin. For example, A 'person' could have organized things, and E can be interpreted as a person giving up because either things could not be organized or maybe they want to give up on organizing and sorting out that chaotic place. 4) Looking at all the answers, option C) to improve things or improve them seems to be the best choice that explains the question the best. Option B) to make things beautiful is a possibility, but this does not necessarily mean it would help improve things. 5) Therefore, option C) improving things seems to be the most reasonable answer.", "answer": "E: drawer"}

Choices: 0.5 A: read B: meditate C: sleep D: lie down E: think\nOutput: 1.'Travel' in this context refers to any form of movement - whether physically, mentally or otherwise.\n2. Looking at the options, options A, C, and D cannot constitute 'travel' in this context.\n3. Option E : think is too broad as you can think about anything while you're still travelling.\n4. Option B : meditate might imply stillness.\n5. Considering that in the beginning of the paragraph, it says \"someone\", this is more likely to be a journey undertaken by someone than by oneself. \n6. Hence, the best choice is B: meditate.\nSo the final option is B: meditate", "answer": "A: drill"}
{"text": "), doorknob (D), and doorway (E) are all found within a doorway, none of them fit the context of 'contained by'.\n4. A television isn't contained by doors, a control panel isn't contained by a doorway either. \n5. Same with the opening doors and doorknob, except the former wouldn't be considered a doorway as well, while the latter doesn't fit the given context.\n6. Looking at the remaining option, E: doorway. \n7. We can tell that a doorway is the correct answer by how the description was specified in the context.\n8. The context indicates that 'contained by' and 'doors' should both be taken into consideration, while a TV, control panel, doors, doorknob, and doorway all fulfill this requirement. \n9. Thus, the answer is E: doorway.\nSo the final answers is E: doorway\n\nInput: How are you going to tell which direction is which on a map?

{"text": "), or door(knob) E doesn't seem to fit the given description, option D: 'doorknob' is the answer, as it is meant to be grabbed, and it is present within the doorway without being part of it.\n4. Option B (control panel) doesn't have 'grab' in their meaning and Option C: 'opening doors' is probably too vague for a given question.\n5. Therefore option D: 'doornob' is the most appropriate answer.\nSo the final solution is D: doorknub\n\n---\n## Challenge #4\n### Solution\n\nInput: The teacher handed the paper to the student, it's content was what? Choices: A: a story B: a song C: a diagram D: statistics E: a list\nOutput: 1, The question asks what kind of content was written on the paper handed to the student by his teacher.\n2. While we have a lot of possible answers and we can eliminate them one by one, it's important that we understand something about the way we understand language and communication in general.\n3. The sentence \"the teacher handed the paper to a student\" creates the understanding of a simple action being carried out. This is what we'll use to solve the question.\n4. The paper itself doesn't contain any information, we assume what's on the paper based on our assumption that it was handed to the student. This is what makes questions like this tricky to answer.\n5. However, the question states that the paper \"it's content was a...\"; this gives us two pieces of information:\n6. The paper is not a sentence. It was not handed to the student due to the sentence-like nature it had.\n7. Therefore option A: Story is quite likely to be the correct answer since the content on the paper is given.\n8. Now, let's eliminate some choices (as given below, in red text). \n9. So we have one possible answer left, and that is B: Song as we did not eliminate it, in green text. Now let's go through the reasoning that led to the final answer in another way.\n10. What does paper mean? Well, we can draw comparisons between a book, a musical score, a song, and a dance routine. In all these instances, a piece of paper", "answer": "C: glee"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) are all valid objects, they cannot be considered contained by a doorway, as they are too separate from the doorway itself for them to be within its structure. \n4. However, the answer (E) - doorway - is contained by the doorway structure itself, as the doorway comprises the walls of the doorway, its base, and the ceiling surrounding it, which would encompass the television. \n5. As a result, the correct response is E: doorway.\nSo the final Answer is E: doorway\n\nInput: What's a type of house that's not made of cement? Choices:  B: wood A: plastic D: glass E: brick\nOutput: 11. The question is what type of house isn't made of cement.\n2. Cement is a concrete-like material or the adhesive component of concrete, typically made of limestone, clay, and sand. \n3. Thus, houses made from concrete would have a high probability of being made from cement and those made from other materials would not.\n4. Since the types of houses that can be cement-made are listed in the given choices, the question can be narrowed down to types of houses that are not cement-made. \n5. Looking at the given options:  A, B, C, and E can each be made of cement as they represent types of houses made from the material. \n6. This leaves us with choice D: glass, which is not made of cement. \n7. Therefore, we have the answer D: glass as the house made of glass is not made from cement.\nSo the final ans is D: glass\n\nInput: From which of these places wouldn't you see a rainbow?  Choices:  A. Sun  B. Moon  C. Window  D. Roof  E. Thunderstorm\nOutput: 10. The question is from which of these places would you not see a rainbow. \n2. A rainbow is typically seen as an arc-shaped natural phenomenon appearing after rain in the sky. \n3. As rainbows are a direct result of precipitation, we would only not see a rainbow in these environments. \n4. Choice A: Sun -", "answer": "E: revolution"}
{"text": "), and doorway (D) may be located inside the doorway structure, the word \"contain\" in the given question suggests that we're looking for an object that is literally inside the doorway structure. \n4. Therefore, to make the question a little less ambiguous, we can say the object must be within or 'contained by' the actual doorway structure.\n5. This could be implied by eliminating options A: television, B: control panel, and C: opening doors.\n6. We are now left with options D: doorknobs and E: doorways.\n7. Doorknobs and doorways are too generic as they do not necessarily refer to a specific object that could be grabbed. \n8. We can infer that the object referenced in the question is a solid object that the person could hold or grab. Hence, D: doorknobb is a plausible answer choice.\n9. However, the object is contained by the doorway instead of occupying the doorway, so option E: doorway can also be inferred. \n10. It can be noted that the words \"grab an object\" indicate that the action refers to physical contact between the person and the object to be grabbed.\n11. The only two options that satisfy this context are the doorknob and the doorway structure itself; they are the two choices that satisfy both descriptions.\n12. Hence the answer is D: doorknobe.\nSo the final answers are D: doorknabe and E: doorway structure\n\nInput: Which body of water runs through the city of Minneapolis and Saint Paul? Choices:  Wabasha river A) Mississippi B) Minnesota C) Chippewa D) Saint Cloud E) St. Croix\nOutput: 1.'St.' in \"St.\" has a capital letter and is not pronounced, so it's more like \"Croix.\"\n2. Looking at the options, both of the first 3 options are rivers and begin with 'M' in the first letter, so they're more likely to be from the Midwest.\n3. A: Wabasha runs to Wisconsin and not through both the cities.\n4. B: Mississippi flows through Missouri, Tennessee, and some other states.\n5. C: Chippewa is also a river", "answer": "B: oxygen"}

D: outside 5. E: back of store 6. F: hallway\nOutput: \n 1. The question about 'where are stalls often found' is asking for the location of stalls.\n2. Choice 1, B: parking lot, means the stalls are in the parking lot but not the store itself. However, the question doesn't ask 'where else'.\n3. Choice 2, C: mall, is not in a store, a mall does not have stores, so it would not make sense.\n4. Choices 4 and 6, D: outdoors and F: hallway are not applicable since stalls are generally inside a store.\n5. Choices 3 and 6, Stores and malls have what is called as a 'department store', where products are arranged in sections so a customer is more likely to come across each section while browsing. Stalls found in departments are usually at the end of each department. These are called stores since they house various products, making it a place for people to shop.\n6. Therefore, 3 and 6 are likely the correct options, and answer C: Department is the answer.\nSo the final answr is C: department\n\nInput: Heather works at a hotel.

The final answer is E: door.\nSo the final answers are E: door, E: door\n\nInput: Who should be involved in the design process? Choices: 1. A: the client 2. B: anyone who thinks he can design 3. C: the designer 4. D: friends of the client 5. E: random people from Facebook\nOutput: 1- This question is about who should be involved in the creation process of something. \n2- It could be argued that anyone who thinks he or she can design the creation process should be involved.  \n3- In order for the designer to create a design that satisfies the client, the designer needs to be involved in the whole design process.\n4- The client doesn't usually know many people who are capable of designing. Having friends who aren't designers included in the creation process could cause issues.\n5- Most people don't know people on Facebook who can design. It's likely to disrupt the creation process.\n6- The first four choices all make sense. C: the designer is the most fitting choice.\nSo the final choice is 1- is the question about who should be involved, 2- C: the designer is most fitting.\n\nInput: What is more dangerous: being bitten by a poisonous snake or being bitten by a spider? Choices: 0. A: poisonous spider 1. B: poisonous snake 2. C: both are as dangerous 3. D: being bitten by an alligator 4. E: being bitten by mosquito\nOutput: 0. A is the only choice which can be considered more dangerous than B, since the main difference between these two options is whether the snake is poisonous.\n1. B is correct because the only other type of snake which is deadly is one that is venomous.\n2. C is false because while both poisonous and non-venomous snakes are potentially dangerous and can bite, there is an actual difference in", "answer": "E: celebrating"}
{"text": "), or a doorknob (D) could in fact be contained by a doorway, the question asks where you would 'grab an object'. \n4. An opening (C) or a doorknop (D) could be opened to retrieve an object, but an object contained by a doorknop or an opening is not something that is to be grabbed.\n5. Furthermore, the word 'contained' here is meant to indicate a physical connection between the object and the doorway, i.e. that the object is located 'under' the doorway instead of alongside the doorway.\n6. Therefore, among the given choices, only choice E: doorway would satisfy this requirement as it contains the word 'contained', and it is a part of the doorway itself, being the only suitable choice.\n7. Therefore - the answer is E.\nSo the final Answer is E: Doorway", "answer": "D: being happy"}
{"text": "), and doorknobs (D) can all technically be within a doorway, the word 'contained' means they are also contained elsewhere and may not be considered the correct answer.\n4.

Choices:  IA: bathroom IIB: sink IIIC: kitchen IVD: floor VIE: shower\nOutput: 1) The question provides a clue, in the form of the word 'place' in the question, that the answer should be a specific location for storing water.\n2) Looking at the given options, D: floor, and E: shower, both are not typical places to put water.\n3) For IA: bathroom and IIIC: kitchen, water is traditionally stored at those locations, but could likely also be stored elsewhere.\n4) IA and IIIC do not exclude each other, and the scenario could describe placing or storing water in either a bathroom or a kitchen.\n5) IVD: floor, and VIE: shower, both of these are inappropriate answers as they do not involve a specific location to store water, they only refer to locations that water 'could' be stored in.\n6) Therefore, since the description only involves 'putting' water and does not indicate a specific location to do so, we cannot eliminate any single choice.\n7) This means that, A: sink, and IIB: sink, are both potentially correct answers.\n8) However, they can easily differentiated by the word 'place' included in the sentence earlier, so 'place' should help point us to answer IIB which gives us B: sink.\nSo the final answe is B: sink\n\nInput: On what would someone use an ice pack after working, sweating or taking an exam? Choices: 1. A: body 2. B: cooler 3. C: cooling 4. D: freezer 5.

{"text": "), or doorknob (D) could logically fit the question, they're not all explicitly contained by the doorway.\n4. Choices E: doorway has a unique feature, a side panel that could reasonably be used to grab the object by hand. Since Doorknobs can be used in many different ways to open the door, they fall under the category of doorknob. \n5. Therefore, we conclude that choice E: doorway is the correct answer.\nSo the final argument is that E: doors answer is correct.\n\nInput: Which of these three things are not in nature? Choices:  natural selection A: fire B: water C: volcano D: Earth E: air\nOutput: 1 The question is asking about the three things presented: A) Natural selection. B) Water. C) Fire. D) Volcano. E) Earth\n2. When we look at the options, the word 'nature' is used to indicate that there is nothing that is not in nature. And to make sure it remains the same, choice 'a' is added among the other options.\n3. In this choice, 'natural selection' is out of the things which are already present in nature. Because all the choices given, are already things present in nature.\n4. The key here to understand why this answer is correct is that everything that we have mentioned above is a factor of nature, so the correct answer is 'nothing'.\n\n### Conclusion: \nSo our discussion over these few MCQs would help us understand the basic fundamentals of Logical Reasoning section.", "answer": "D: foot"}

So we move on to see what it is exactly that the human is picking up.\n6. Let's consider options again: A-E\n7. Looking at A: teleivision, this would likely involve the use of hands rather than a picking-up action from the inside of the doorway.\n8. B: control panel has numerous options of 'picks-up' but none of these would be from inside the doorway. \n9. C: opening doors are the only option of the available items that could be 'picked up' from the inside of the dorrway, however, there could be any number of reasons why this option is incorrect.\n10. We can then eliminate all other options, which would leave us with option E: doorway.\n11. Doorway fits the context (in terms of doorways being a part of the question) in addition to using 'picked-up' as the action rather than the objects picked-up, although this choice would not be clear without more information.\n12. So the answer is E: doorway.  \n\nSo, the final answer is E; Doorway", "answer": "E: card catalogue"}

The key is to go by the meaning of the words given in the sentence. Going by what sense makes sense is a common mistake that people make when answering multiple choice questions. \n5. Therefore, as the most plausible answer to the question, the doorway is the correct answer.\n\nSo the final answer to this question is E: doorway. \n\nInput: Wherever a train travels can be where any passenger travels to. Choices:  A) to a country B) to another train C) to work D) to some other place E) to the train\nOutput: 1) The question says \"Wherever a train travels\". By context, we know it travels from one place to another so the travel destination fits in with the question.\n\n2) Option A: To a country implies the place visited is different from the train's location. If we're looking for the destination, this would be the wrong one. \n\n3) Option B: To another train implies getting onto another train somewhere is the destination of the train. Again, we're not looking for the destination, more for the place it goes to, rather than the means of getting to it. \n\n4) Option D: To some other place, the same as (B), does not directly imply the destination is what we're looking for. \n\n5) Option C: To work, does not refer to the train, rather it refers to the destination of its passenger. Option (E) follows along the same lines. \n\n6) Therefore, the only answer that does not have the destination as part of its meaning is Option E: to the train.\n\nSo, the final answer is Option E: to The train.\n\nInput: Would you want someone to go to the park and throw baseballs?

The options given are all possible names that might reasonably be used to describe this location.\n3.) The choice C: fence post is not entirely wrong or an impossible option and can logically be called a fence post. However, we can't discount the possibility that a fence post wouldn't be the only correct answer.\n4.) The choice C: pole is possible as well since the post is a pole, however, it does not fit the specific description of 'fence post' which is mentioned in the question.\n5.) The choice C: gate is incorrect since it can't be described as a fence post.\n6.) Therefore, we are left with this choice B: barn. Barn is in the given list of options and is a possible answer. \nSo the final answer could be either B (barn) or C (fence post), however, option B is more logically acceptable than option C.\n\nInput: The doctor says you need to be on bed rest, the patient responds with what?

We check the choice to determine whether the first floor is higher than the second floor. \n3. Therefore, it's important that A is higher than B. \n4. However, option B is not higher than option A because the word choice refers to the floor height in a building and not in the ground. \n5. To get more accurate knowledge, let's analyze the remaining options. \n6. Option C is not enough information about the question that determines whether the first floor is high or not. \n7. Similarly, option D offers insufficient data that a person can use to determine if the object is higher or not. \n8. Among all the choices, option E - wall seems to be the most appropriate. \n9. So, with the available information, the choice (E) seems to be the best choice. \n10. Therefore, the highest floor is higher, and that floor is wall or A.\n11. Finally, the answer is (A). A. higher.\n\nInput: What are you required to provide when ordering a drink?

Choices: \t\tA: a radio broadcast B: someone to listen to C: a microphone D: someone to listen to you E: a speaker\nOutput: 1) The objective of the question is to determine what one may have to do to listen to a specific author - in this case, to listen to Ernest Hemingway. \n2) Looking at the choices, options A: radio broadcast can be eliminated, as this would not allow one to listen to Hemingway if they wanted to.\n\n\n\n3) Choice B: someone to listen is vague; it could refer to the author or to another listener. \n\n4) Choice C: microphone can be eliminated, since it doesn't directly relate to a radio broadcast or to an author's audible presence. \n5) Choice D: someone to listen for you may imply someone to listen to you specifically and can't be the right choice.\n6) Choice E: speaker is incorrect; this could imply speech or a public address and would not directly provide the listener with the opportunity to listen to Ernest Hemmingway.\n7) Therefore, the answer is choice F) speaker's radio.  This choice could allow one to listen to the author through his recorded voice. \n8) Therefore the final answer is F) A speaker's radio.\n\nInput: The woman's cat saw a bird, she wasn't watching or in the vicinity of the bird at which time?

Therefore the most fitting response to this question is E: doorway.\nSo the final answers is E: doorway", "answer": "E: children suffer"}
{"text": ") and Doorknob (D) could potentially be contained within the doorway, they are not typically considered 'objects' within a doorframe and therefore can not be selected as suitable answers.\n4. There are only two remaining options E and F, 'doorway' and 'doorway'. The first is the most specific and logical answer choice, hence it is more likely to be the correct one.\n5. Therefore the final answer is D.\nSo the final answers are A: television, B: control panel, C: opening doors, D: doorway, E: doorway, F: doorway\n\nInput: If you think a dog has worms what would you do? Choices: 2: kill the dog 3: take it to a vet 4: do nothing 5: call the pound 6: get a different dog\nOutput: 1: The question asks about what to do if you think a dog has a parasitic infestation known as 'worms'\n2: Kill the dog does not accurately reflect the scenario presented, whereby the person does not have the intention of killing the dog, only to ensure it is free of worms.\n3: Take it to a vet provides an excellent explanation of the action, where the person would take the dog to a vet to get better medical care.\n4: Do nothing is one of the wrong answers because it doesn't make sense, when it should be something like a vet to give your dog care.\n5: Call the pound this option is the wrong answer because there is no reason to call the pound in this scenario.\n6: Get a different dog this option is not suitable for the question because it has nothing to do with this scenario.\n7: Therefore, the correct answer choice is C: Take it to a Vet\nSo the final answer choice is C: take it to a Vet.\n\nInput: When buying real wood for a deck, what should one remember?

{"text": "), and a doorknob (D) could potentially be grabbed within a door structure, the phrase in question specifies the presence of an 'object', which can only be chosen from E: doorway, as doorway contains an 'object' and TV, control panel, opening doors, and doorknob are not 'objects'. \n4. Therefore, the correct answer is E: doorway.\nSo the final question is:  Where would you grab an 'object' contained by a doorway - it's E: doorway. \n\nInput: When on the phone would you tell someone you can't talk? Choices: 1. A: tomorrow B: sorry 2. C: sorry D: tomorrow E: yes\nOutput: The question asks when on the phone you would tell someone you can' not talk. \n1. The phrase 'on the phone' is usually spoken. \n2. The 'tell someone' is also usually spoken. \n3. While 'tell someone' can also be written, it is much less likely to be written than 'tell someone on the phone'. \n4. In context, the option D: tomorrow seems to be out of context, as it would not typically be the appropriate response to being asked for a call back in the first place.\n5. Additionally, the word 'tell someone' on its own, is usually heard without the use of the word'me', further making it unlikely to be chosen as the correct answer.\n\n6. The remaining three choices B: sorry, C: sorry, and E: yes contain the word'sorry' which is the appropriate response to an interruption, particularly when you are on the phone with someone. \n7. This is not a multiple choice question as an option; however, choosing a 'no' in this scenario would mean not being able to talk at all, and 'yes' might imply being available to talk immediately. \n8. The options B: sorry, C sorry, and E: sorry could all refer to a single correct answer which means the 'yes' response is not the sole correct answer, but it is an option that would be appropriate for different situations. \n9. Taking this into account, the most correct answer is C: sorry, as it is a generic response to unavailability and does not refer to a specific time frame, which", "answer": "D: space shuttle"}
{"text": ") and doorknob (D) could be relevant in different circumstances, they are not as relevant to a context that has a doorway that contains an item/object. \n4.

The answer that fits our clue is E: 'doorway'.\nSo the final choice is E: 'door'\n\nInput: One would not be inclined to put milk into which of the following foods? Choices:  a. a cake b. a cupboard c. a bag d. a box e. a spoon\nOutput: 1  One question is asking if you are inclined to put milk in certain foods.\n2. The choice words we can analyze are 'inclined' / 'put' /'milk' / 'putting' / 'not inclined'.\n3. Option A. a cake doesn't seem like the proper place for milk.\n4. Option B. a cupboard could be a proper place to put milk, but'milk' isn't a proper food for a cupboard. \n5. Options C and D are wrong in the same way.\n6. Option e. a spoon, could not contain milk and this doesn't seem like a proper food to put into a spoon. \n7. We are left with option E. a box. This is the only option that has a proper food (milk) that could be a proper food to put in the container (a box). \n8. Therefore, this is the correct option for our scenario.\nSo the final choice in this case is E: 'box' in the 'a box' option, it stands.\n\nInput: In which of these cities could you find the most cappuccinos?

{"text": "), and doorknob (D) could all contain such a thing, the thing is only contained by a doorway if it is within or on a door. \n4. Therefore, the answer to the question is E: doorway. The person would need to grab the object contained by the doorway, and what contains it is the doorway itself. \n5. The given choices might also suggest a room or something similar, but the context clues suggest that the object must only be contained by the doorway.\nSo the final answers is E: doorway\n\nInput: Where did the car get struck by a truck? Choices:  B: sidewalks C: lanes D: streets E: side of building \nOutput: 1: The car got struck by a truck while driving, so the location of the strike has to be on the road.\n2: The given choices C and D are correct in that these locations are all on the road.\n3: However, if the car did not get struck by the truck from behind, A must be eliminated.\nHence, the answer must be between B and E. \n4: If the car was struck from the side while crossing the road, a sidewalk can be crossed legally, hence A and B must be elminated.\n5: Even if the car got struck from behind and crossed the sidewalk, it still would not be able to cross lanes without permission. Hence, C is eliminated.\n6: This leaves us with only option D and option E. \n7: The context does not provide any additional information, except that the truck struck the car on the road.\n8: One of D and E must be the answer because car cannot park itself on the side of the building.\nTherefore, the answer is D.", "answer": "A: back pocket"}

While the given options could be possible circumstances in which the woman heard the baby cry, only answer B: baggage area was an exact location mentioned in the question. \n3. Therefore, A: airplane, B: on board A plane, C: truck, D: car, and E: bus may be possibilities, but answer B: baggagarea is a certainty. \nSo the correct option is B: baggage room.", "answer": "D: education"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (E) could be inside a doorway, it's unlikely that they would be located at such a level that a person could grab them.\n4. Doorknobs are also too high to quickly grab, and open doors cannot be grabbed due to their nature. \n5. Therefore, we can eliminate A, B, and C. \n6. Doorknobs require another action (reaction) to use:\n  - To use a door knob, a person needs to put their hand on it or twist it back or forward. This doesn't allow it to be the correct answer in this multiple choice question.\n7. Doorknobs themselves are too high up to grab from at a swift pace. For example, this is not possible for a small child. \n8. Doorknobs aren't often the most used feature of a doorway when it comes to grabbing something within it, this is typically done by a doorknob's holder or the door itself. The doorknob has some additional use like turning the door to open it.\n9. Also, the doorway itself is another feature of the doorway that a person can grab from and is quite suitable for holding something as well.\n10. Doorknobs and doors are a little redundant when considering that a doorknob can be considered a part of the door that is usually used to open it.\n11. Therefore, the most probable answer here is E: doorway.\nSo the final is E: doorway", "answer": "B: entertainment"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) could both be objects within a doorway, none of these answers specifically mention that the object must be contained within a doorway.\n4.

Hence, we can eliminate options A, B and C. \n5. For option D, the door is a place where you can grab the doorknob, but that is not an object contained by a specific doorway. \n6. So, you would grab an object from a doorway which is contained by a door. \n7. Therefore, you would grab an item from a doorway's interior, which is the doorway itself. \n8. Therefore, you would be grabbing a door. \n9. So, the correct answer would be E: doorway.\nSo the final answers is E: doorway\n\nInput: Where does it take place when you go to a store?

The act of shipping packages that are on their way into an area where they can be delivered in person.\nOutput: 1-2. These are the right answers\n3. Wrong answer is: Giving or sending goods to areas farther away from where the sells is. The term \"Inbound sales\" means to receive or process material that is shipped in, not to send or give material to customers. You can take the word \"inbound\" to mean to reach customers from closer to home rather than sending it to areas that are farther away.\n4.

Parents (A) are not directly involved in the child's activities. \n3. While siblings (C) are always present, they don't engage in the same activities or activities that are planned.\n4. Therefore, child (B) is more likely to be in the company of a childhood friend (D) than a sibling (C).\n5. A parent (A) is more likely to engage in children's activities than a teacher (B) who wouldn't normally be interacting with children in their personal capacity. \n6. The most appropriate answer would be (B) a teacher.\nSo the final conclusion would be: B: teach\n\nInput: Choose the lettered option that best describes the meaning of the highlighted word. \n 1.

Option b: Through the doors is the most suitable answer since an \"entrance\" by definition cannot encompass any options that involve movement through multiple doorways. \n3. Options a and c: Through the gates and Through the aisles do not involve an entrance at all but involve more of a movement pattern. \n4. Options B: Through the halls, D: Through the escalators are valid but are probably not as common as option b: Through the doors.\n5.

The only way you can eat good food in New York is to make a reservation in advance 2. The only way one can get a good table in NY is to make advance reservations 3. NY restaurants tend to sell out very fast and make appointments necessary 4. Nobody wants to sit by themselves at the bar in a fancy restaurant 5. No place is going to turn you away at the door if you are dressed properly\nOutput: 1: None of the above; 2: Any of the above.\n2. The question starts with why, hence, the given choices could be true, but there is a 'why' factor in the initial premise.\n3. Looking more closely, there seems to be some sort of implication in the premise that suggests that reservations are the only way someone can find a place to eat in New york. \n4. This does not necessarily follow. \n5. Nobody wants to be turned away at the door is the correct answer, however it is not specific enough as it is not guaranteed that making a reservation would guarantee entry, it may only assist in entry. \n6. Thus, the most appropriate answer is 5: \"Nobody wants to be turned around at the door\".\nTherefore, the answer is 5: Nobody wants to be Turned Around at the Door\n\nInput: Which is bigger 2426 or 6566?

{"text": "), and doorknob (D) might seem plausible answers, options E: doorway and F: closet fall under the given parameters for the question.\n4. Option F: closet involves taking the object from the inside of a building to another doorway. This is not a part of the question.\n5. Therefore we are left with five choices. Looking at choice A: television, this option is plausible; given that a television usually rests on a television stand/console placed in front of a doorway, it would make sense to grab it from this place.\n6. On the other hand, option B: control panel. This is not applicable to the question as it's not a part of a doorway but a piece of equipment within a building.\n7. Option C: opening doors does not fit the parameters of the question.\n8. This is because the question specifically states that the object is contained by the doorway, which indicates that the object is already found inside the doorway.\n9. Therefore, the least viable correct answer is B: Control panel, while the true answer is A: TV.\nSo the final choice is A: TV\n\nInput: What type of place would you go to get an infection checkup? Choices:  X-ray  A: hospital B: school C: mall D: office E: carnival F: clinic\nOutput : 1. The question requires a place where one can get an X-ray checkup after getting an infection. \n2. The given choices involve a variety of locations and types of places where a person could get an infection check-up.\n3. Choice A: Hospital, does not make sense as it only offers hospitalization and surgery, while Choice B: School, also does not make sense, as it's not normally a place that provides medical checkups.\n4. Choices C through F: Mall, office, and clinic could all theoretically have X-ray machines, so it's difficult to determine which choice would be correct.\n5. When reading the question carefully, it can be seen that the key is to identify the type of place, as the place to be visited is not necessarily where the X-ray machine could be located, but the question states it is where one could get an X-ray. \n6. We rule out choices X-ray", "answer": "A: cupboard"}

A captain of the ship (A) \n3. A fisherman (C)\n4. A sailor (D)\n5. A pirate (E)\nOutput: 1A:  A ship master (A) would help get a ship, a captain of the ship (B) would not since they are one in the same.\n2B: A captain of the ship is an option but would not have the authority or skill to help get a ship out dangerous waters. If a ship is in danger, the captain of the ship can't just go out and help get the ship out of the danger.\n3A: A fisherman (B) could help get a ship out but not typically in dangerous waters. Plus, fishermen do not typically work on ships that are too big or too small for them to maneuver.\n4A: A sailor (D), although they could help in navigating a ship out of dangerous water, they do not typically have the authority to override commands of the captain of the ship.\n5A: A pirate (A) would not help a captain of the ship get their ship out of dangerous waters since being a pirate typically involves breaking the law of the land, so they may not be able to receive the proper clearance and permissions from any higher authorities to help aid the ship.\n6B: The correct answer is B.\nSo the final awnser is B: A ship Master\n\nInput: What is the opposite of a spy?

This makes doorway E correct.\nSo the final Answer is E: doorway\n\nInput: How would I respond to one who is using the language I know? Choices: 1.A: with the same language B: with multiple languages C: in another language D: with a better understanding\n2.E: without knowing English\nOutput: 1) The question is asking how one would respond to another when speaking the language they know. \n2) Option A: with the same language does not fit the context as one cannot answer in the same language spoken by the other person. \n3) Option C: in another language is not logical because it requires one to understand another person speaking in another language, but using one\u2019s native language to respond doesn't require any knowledge of other languages.\n4) It might seem logical that option D: with a better understand would be the correct answer as the question states 'better understanding' in the context of the entire question. However, option D can also be an incorrect answer as it doesn't directly answer your response but rather your understanding, which the question does not explicitly ask for.\n5) Thus, the most logical answer to respond is B: with multiple languages and one should understand that the other person\u2019s knowledge of your native language and theirs are not interchangeable.\nSo the final response is B: with multiple language\n\nInput: How should a person handle a small dog that barks a lot?

If the person asking the question does not know their answer, they would have selected the option of not knowing (A: I don't KNOW).\n4. The last 3 choices are guesses as to whether the answer provided by the person asking the question is correct, or not. \n5. Choice C, no is incorrect, if the person asking did not know their answer, then they would select the 4th row as the correct answer.\n\n7. Therefore, all the remaining choices are valid guesses. \n8. It's most logically to select the best guess, which turns out to be Choice D, 'May be'.\nSo the final Answer in this question is C: No\n\nInput: Which of the following is not an example of the fallacy known as post hoc, ergo propter hoc?

Choices: 1. meet 2. go 3. buy 4. run into 5. chat with\nOutput: 1 The question is asking us what a person might do at a grocery store by saying \"I met a person at the store\".\n2. The possible answers here are 5 options in English grammar. The sentence \"I met a person\" is a phrase used to describe a meeting between persons, which may give the suggestion there is some sort of interaction happening between the two people. \n3. Looking at each of the possible answers as phrases, it is clear that they do not mean the same thing as 'I met a person'.\nThe other four phrases describe different actions in regard to the store, which can be summarized as follows:\n1. I bought (A): shopping or a new thing at the store.\n5. I chatted with (C): someone at the store.\n4/run into (D): something on the way and it's not likely \"I met a person\", since \"ran into\" doesn't mean the same as \"met\".\nBut in this case it's not necessary to look for another phrase. We can see the option is B: go, where the context in which'meet' is used can be seen.\n2. And since the person is at the store, the logical choice of action is B: go. This has happened because it can be stated as \"I met a person/person A at the grocery and I went/went shopping.\"\nThus the correct answer is (B: go).\nSo the final answer will be B: go\n\nInput: What could a man buy from a store that is not expensive if he has a coupon?

The doorknob (of the same door) can't be reached if no one is inside the door, as one does not reach out to a doorknob of their own front door to open the door.\n6.

Choices:  Sleep, Walk Away, Attack the hiker, Pounce at the hiker, Pace Away Choices:  A. A, B. B, C. C, D. D, E. E\nOutput: 1) After careful reading of the passage, the question appears to be describing the actions of a tiger in the given story.\n2) Looking at the question choices, we may eliminate options E, A, and C from this interpretation because they describe human actions.\n3) It's important to note these two clues: 'lurking' and 'careless'. \n4) The keyword here is 'lurking'. This implies the tiger is lying in wait, ready to strike at anytime and likely will do so when the conditions are right. \n5) This is also known as stalking. Therefore, we can rule out options B, A, and C because they describe actions of a tiger that doesn't stalk. \n6) Option D: Pounce at the hikers seems to indicate the tiger attacking the hiker, and therefore could be the right choice. However, given the information available to us, this answer may be overly broad and may not align with the other details provided.\n7) Taking the aforementioned clues into consideration we are left with the choice option:  \u200bA: Attack the hiker.\nSo the final right answer is A: Attack the hikers..\n\nInput: What did the dog do after the thief stole the dog's new dish?

{"text": "), and doorknob (D) could all be contained by a doorway, the question asks where you would 'grab' the object, thus the question is asking what part of the doorway you would use to grab an object rather than where the object is located. \n4. Based on the context clues mentioned before, doors may be made of different materials, so option (E) a 'doorway' does not offer any help as it does not indicate whether the given door is wooden, metal, or any other material. \n5. We are now left with the answer of option B: the door itself. This answers the question, 'where would you grab an object that is contained by a doorway'.\nSo the final result is B: the door.\n\nInput: A dog is standing in his doghouse, which is resting on the dog. What is being supported? Choices: \n A: himself B: doghouse C: ground D: dog\nOutput: 1) The dog in the question is standing in his dog house, 'on the dog' which is resting on 'the ground', implying that the dog house is made of wood or is covered in material that is fixed to wood, thereby resting on a piece of wood, in this case, the floor. \n2) If the dog house was to support the dog, then it would not be leaning up against the ground and the dog is standing on top, implying that it rests on the ground. \n3) D is not the right answer because it is the wrong subject-verb and wrong noun.\n4) If the 'ground' was supporting the dog house, then it would be on a piece of the floor that rests on the ground, such as the dog house would be resting on the ground but leaning against the house. This is not the right answer.\n5) A is the subject-verb-noun answer, the correct answer because 'himself' is the subject, 'himself' is a noun, and this is the verb.\nSo the final result of the sentence is A: himself. \n\nInput: If a trout is in a trout pond, then where wouldn't it be at that time?

Choices:  J: on the window sill K: on a bookshelf L: beneath the window M: on the light switches\nOutput:  A mirror is typically placed on a horizontal surface such as a wall or a table, rather than a vertical surface such as the side of a window frame or a bookshelf. This is the reason why options K: on a book shelf, L: beneath the window and M: On the light switches are incorrect.\nBased on this reasoning, we are left with options J: on the window/ door sill and our intuition tells us that it most probably isn't placed on a window/door frame.\nSo our final answer is (J), on the window sill.\n\nInput: If a company produces both clothing and kitchen items, what won't the public expect to find in the company's gift shop?

The question is asking what is the place where my friend is while watching my dog, inside or outside.\n2. The given options do not mention any place, therefore we need to eliminate them all. \n3. Looking at each option in detail, we can safely eliminate C, as it is too broad and does not indicate a precise place. \n4. The only option that could be possibly a place or a situation is B: inside. \n5. The context of the sentences suggests that my friend is supposed to be watching my dog in a place that is inside.

{"text": "), and a door knob (D) could all be classified as an object contained by a person, this would not necessarily be located within the doorway.\n4. Since the correct answer should include 'doorway' in its answer, it's easiest to cross out choices that don't have 'doorway'. The choices left are A, B, C, and D \n5. If we look at the context clues given, the doorway is a logical place to have a door knob and, on rare instances, a control panel as well, however, the doorway would not be considered part of a door either and hence these answers can't be correct. \n6. This narrows down the choices left to A, B, and D. \n7. Option A, television and B. control panel are too big and bulky, respectively, to be contained within the confines of a doorway. 8. Option C, doors are not necessarily always there, either there are open or the doors are missing. \n9. Option D, \u2018door\u2019 is the actual structure itself that is a door, so the doorway would not necessarily contain the door itself; rather, it would contain the doorway that is the door. \n10. Based on this insight, the final answer that best fits this question is D, doorway.\nSo the final question is:  Where would you grab an item when contained by a doorway Choices: doorway\nSo the final answer this question is: Doorway\n\nInput: What do you call someone who sells books? Choices: \n A: owner B: library C: bookstore D: printer E: writer\n Output: 1. I was a bit puzzled with this question because we'd all know that owner or printer (A B) would not be the correct answer. When asked for the description of the job 'book seller' the options would most surely be 'book store owner' (A), and 'book printer (B).\n2. But then, I realized that the question is not asking about the job, it asks about \"what do you call someone who does the job\".\n3, And to get the description of the person, we'd have to go to the list of choices (C-E) to decide how to answer the actual title of the job description.\n4.

Choices: \n A: Track B: Depot C: Doorway\n\\ D: Trolley E: Tunnel\nOutput: Track is 1. Choices A, C, and E are not related to a train and are not places of where the train starts to leave.\n2. This leaves us with B: Depot and D: Trolley.\nIf we look closely at each of these choices, we can quickly weed out the incorrect choice (B: Depot).\n3. Trolley refers to a system of rail transit which is powered by electricity and provides service within some areas of a local city.\n4. This indicates that Trolley is a type of train and not the place where the train starts to depart. Therefore, the correct response is D: Trolley (which refers to a type of train).\nSo the final sentence answers are D: Trolley\n# \u53e5\u5b50\u5199\u4f5c- 001\n\n**\u9898\u76ee:** There \u200bis something that \u200beveryone loves about summer camp and it just might be this.

That's because the answer to the whole question is not a fact, but opinion.\n5:Therefore, the answer to the question is A: Camel, it's bigger than a horse because it can carry more weight.\nSo the final result is A: Camel.\n\nInput: What might you find in a truck that is a large van? Choices: A-bed B-mattress C-dining table D-chairs E-chest \nOutput: \n1:The question asked what might be inside a truck that is of the size or shape of a big van.\n2:We eliminate A-bed and C-dining table because the shape and size of a big van is taller than the ground. Therefore one would find a mattress in a bed higher than the ground, and a dining table is just too big to fit in the inside of a big van. \n3:Next, we eliminate D-chairs and E-chest because one would not need chairs and a chest in the big van.\n4:Therefore, the correct response is B-mattress. A mattress would be fitting a van of this size/shape.\nSo the final solution is B-mattresses.\n\nInput: An architect can design a home that will protect its occupants from what?

The scenario describes you looking for materials for a project and trying to find the project plan to see if you have the materials you need.\n2. Going through a closet, or a notebook, doesn't provide the needed information regarding the materials.\n3. Opening a suitcase doesn't indicate the materials you are looking for, as suitcases typically are used to carry personal belongings, not supplies.\n4. Website searches are typically used for browsing and are not typically used to determine what you need.\n5. Checking a list in your head generally doesn't help you find information in your possessions.\n6. The given choices are in different locations and indicate different activities, so they cannot be used to determine if you have all the materials you need. \n7. The only possible choice that could indicate a method of discovery is A: Look in your Closet.\n8.

{"text": "), and doorknob (D) could be in a doorway, that doesn't make them part of it. The fact that the object is contained \"by the doorway\" makes it clear that this object is part of the doorway itself, and not an independent object.\n4.

We have to select the one that is the best in terms of quality.\n2) Book A is an anthology, that is, it contains various pieces of writing. Anthologies are a collection of articles or stories under a common theme. So this choice would be incorrect, as there exists no specific single theme under which the articles could be grouped.\n3) Books B C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, RS, T, TUV, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and ZZ are incorrect choices for the same reason as book A.\n4) Book PQ is an encyclopedic dictionary (a book containing information about any subject), so that is an incorrect choice too\n5) Book RS is a thesaurus (a book containing definitions and synonyms of words used)\n6) Book TUV is a pronouncing dictionary (a dictionary that lists words along with their pronunciation)\n\n7) Book WXYZ is an atlas of geographical maps, which would be incorrect choice as well.\n\n8) Book A is a collection of unrelated articles and texts.

He would be waiting 45 minutes to eat any food that he wanted. He might have a meal already made, or could grab something later.\n 3: He has to finish working. There is no additional information about what his work may entail, but he certainly couldn't leave.\n4: He is waiting to be given a sandwich. The sandwich may already be ready, or it may take him 45 minutes to make it.\n 5: He is waiting to consume something he has already prepared.\n 6: He is waiting for himself to become hungry.\n 7. He is waiting for others to wait with him so he can eat. There is no indication of any other person or people.

Options A, B, and C can be classified as objects that are contained outside of the doorway. Doorknobs (D) also don't fit, as it's not an independent object and would be assumed to already be captured within the doorway structure.\n5.

Choices:  a) the base of 2 and b) goes into 102 c) the base of 6 d) the base of 8 e) the base of 10\nOutput: 1.\u201cIn maths, what has the base of 2, which goes into 10?\u201d\n2.In decimals, base is base or a factor.\n3. The number 62 has a base of 6, as its base is 6. Therefore, this could likely be a possible option here. However, 6 cannot be the base in this context as the base would have to start from 2 (base of 2) or 8 (base of 8) that go into 100 (which is equal to 10 x 10).\n4. The decimal number 82 would have a base of 10 which could go into 102.\n5. So, the answer would be \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B.\u2019\nSo the final answer A or B.\n\n\nInput: What could you do to prevent your dog from taking all of the pills you gave him?

Also, choices D: museum, C: gas station and B: bakery are general places where chocolate is not commonly available.\n3. This leaves us with choice A: grocery. It could be any type of grocery like a grocery store, convenience store, farmer's market, or other grocery retailer.\n4. Similarly, choice E: museum is not a place where you can purchase chocolate and choice D: post office where chocolate might be available. This leaves us with A: grocery or B: bakery.\n5.

Choices:  B: bathrooms or storage closets D: trash cans E: closets or attics F: drawers\nOutput: 1) It's important to determine if the question is asking what places you wouldn't find by not looking in any other places at all, or if you wouldn't find those places at all. \n2) It's possible to find certain locations such as bathrooms or storage closet by looking in any other place. 3) The places which wouldn't have to be searched at all are the ones that aren't anywhere. \n4) So, we will disregard the places that need to be seen first as D) trash cans and E) closets or attics. 5) There may be some places which we wouldn't need to look in the trash can as they may be elsewhere. \n6) This leads us to C) drawers which wouldn't have the items hidden anyplace else and F) drawers as F is also a place where specific items may have been discarded or otherwise not there anyplace else. 7) We'll discard B) bathrooms and storage closets which could be in other places as well. \n8) So the final response is D) trash can and F) drawers. \n9) So the final response would be D: trash can and F: drawer\n\nInput: What are two sides that are opposites of each other like right and left?

Choices: A: train track B: railway C: crossing D: trolley station E: streetcar station\nOutput: 1.) The question is asking where a train whistle would be audible.\n2. The train whistle being audible indicates that the train is visible to sight or ear; therefore, answer choice A: train track would be ruled out. The train track may hold information about the train, but does not confirm whether the train is present or visible. Train tracks and their related components such as railway platforms, railway stations, and railway crossings, do not visibly confirm or audibly indicate trains in the vicinity. However, answer choice B: railway can be ruled out as well because although this might help indicate where a train can be, railway platforms and related structures by themselves do not confirm train presence.\nAlthough answer choice C: crossing would indicate presence of trains on the train track, this is not the preferred option. To answer the question completely, an indication of sight and sound would be preferable.\n3. Answer option D: trolley doesn't specifically confirm train presence. Though trolleys may indicate the presence of a train as trolley passengers use the train tracks to commute to the trolley station, the station alone does not indicate the presence of trains.\n4. Option E: streetcar will confirm the presence of trains as it does specifically indicate location of trolley passengers on tracks and trolley station.\n5. Therefore the correct answer would be E: streetcar.\nSo the final correct answer is E: Streetcar\n\nInput: What can you find on a bus? Choices: A. Driver B. Park C. Bus Stops D. Seat E.

The answer is given as potted plants. This answer is incorrect because potted plants or flower pots (B) could be below an open window.\n3. A garden (D) is also incorrect because not all gardens have a window underneath. \n4. A door (E) could also be seen below a window but the question does not specify a specific type of door.\n5. Door ways (E), potted plants (B), flower pots (B), gardens, and walks are all correct answers.\n6. The answer is a set of answers as it can't be isolated to any single answer from the options available.\nSo the finalanswer is that the answer is A: walkways.", "answer": "A: landscape"}

Choices:  a. yes b. no c. that depends on d. it is not necessary that both sides have a floor\nOutput: 1) The question asks if you need both sides of the wall to have a floor.\n2) Since we're not sure if the two walls are parallel, we cannot definitively say that it is necessary that both walls have a floor.\n3) We can only say 'it is not necessary that both walls have floors', and only that is an option in this case.\n4) Therefore, the correct answer is c. that depends on.\nSo the final answered can be c: that depends.\n\nInput: Which of the following isn't a characteristic of the Pacific Ocean, The Atlantic Ocean or the Indian Ocean Choices:  A.

The Indian Ocean is found to the east & south of Africa and Australia E. All the oceans have a different density\nOutput: 1: Let's analyze each choice:\n\n   - Option A: It's very specific information that the Pacific Ocean is North of the Atlantic Ocean, and not at all related to one of its characteristics. So, it can be eliminated\n\n   - Option B: It's also very specific information that the Atlantic Ocean is located on a certain side of the United States of America; it doesn't follow the format of a characteristic. So, it can also be eliminated\n\n2) With those two out, we're left with D: The Indian Ocean is found east and south of Africa and Australia. Since this is a characterization of the Indian Ocean only, it can be concluded as the answer.\nSo the final Answer can be c: The Indian Ocean is located on the Eastern side.\n\nInput: This is a quote from an old film", "answer": "C: freezer"}

Choices:  a. the man with the tiny house b. the man with the mansion c. the man with the garage d. the man who lives in a townhouse e. the man living in a shoe\nOutput: 1 - a and b: there is some grammatical error in both of their sentences. They either end with \"that\", and the only thing similar in both of the houses is that they are homes. So an appropriate sentence may be \"Who would have something similar in the house that is of normal size to him?\" 2. For c and d: the only thing that defines them a normal house, is their size, so they can't be a normal house.

Choices: A: your parents B: the government C: your friends D: your family E: your boss\nOutput: 1-2. This question is asking how much sleep one needs to have as a teenager.\n3. The primary issue in this question is the fact that the teenager is not completely independent. \n4. This means decisions by them, such as choosing how much sleep to get, is partially dependent on others, not completely self-contained decision making.\n5. When the person is an adult, they have more control and independence over their life than a teenager. \n6. Given the context of the question and answers, the correct response would be 'E: your boss'. \nSo the final answer for the questions is B: E: 'your boss'", "answer": "A: conquer opponent"}
{"text": "), and doorway (D) can provide a containment feature, they're not necessarily within the structure of a doorway and therefore would be considered too broad. \n4. This leaves us with choice E: doorknob - a doorknob is a part of the doorway and is therefore contained by that structure. \n5. Therefore, we can say that the answer is E: doorknub\nSo the final answer if E: doorknube\n\nInput: What doesn't a turtle do when they cross a road? Choice:  A: drive a car B: turn right C: turn left D: use a bridge E: play golf\nOutput: 1 The given word 'cross' implies that the turtles are traversing a road at a location where a roadway meeting a roadway with two lanes on a single side exists. \n2. Therefore, we can eliminate choices D: use a bridge and E: play golf because none of this would happen on a roadway with a single two-lane road; these actions can only take place on a roadway with multiple lanes on both sides.\n3. Looking further into the options given, we can say that Choice C: turn left doesn't sound like it would work either since the turtle would have to turn left onto a roadway's entrance or it would have to be on a side of the road where there's actually a lane to turn into.\n4. We can also state that choice A: drive a car doesn't fit because turtles are quite small, they do not have wheels or a motor, and they don't drive; therefore, the correct answer would need to be different.\n5. The final correct answer is B: turn right because turtles would need to be on the right side of the roadway when crossing it. \n6. So the final answer is B:'turn right'\n\n\n### Output:\n\nThe question is asking: \"Which answer choice best completes the following series?

Choices:  a) book b) spa c) a lamp d) a toothbrush e) a tray\nOutput: 1) The question is asking us what can be placed on the bookshelf if there isn' t room for one.\n2) To understand what might be placed, we must consider the constraints of having no room for a book, which is a long book-like object.\n3. Option D is a toothbrush, however, it's too small to fit the context.\n4) Option B is a spa. Although this could be a good fit, the description specifically states that we're looking for a shelf for an aesthetic item and not a functional one, so an option like a spa wouldn't fit.  \n5) Option A includes a book, but we're looking for what wouldn't be included, so this is removed.\n6) Option C is a lamp, which isn't a large enough object nor is it aesthetically pleasing and could be removed.  \n7) Option E is a tray and is aesthetic enough to be placed on the shelves. Hence it fits the given context the most and is the most logical choice.  \n8) Therefore, the answer is E: a tray.\nSo the final solution is E: a tracy\n\nInput: Which of these might you give an out-of-work person who wants a job?

Choices:  G: eat C: sleep B: prepare D: make E: travel\nOutput: 1) The question is asking where a person should go after they've had some rest. Looking at the choices, the options that make the most sense in this context are \"make\" and \"prepare.\" The question asks after a person gets some rest, so once they've recovered from their activity of choice, it would most likely be time to get ready to continue or complete that activity as the person is now in good enough condition to resume it. 2. Therefore, \"make\" and \"preparation\" for that activity are the most logical options to choose from. 3. Answer options that could also fit the context are \"travel\" and \"eat,\" but the rest of the options are not as likely to be appropriate as the ones we have left. 4. Looking at the final options that make the most logical sense, they are both \"preparation\" and \"making.\" They are both a form of action, and they both deal with the idea that after you've rested, you need to get ready to resume your activity. 5. The two answers that could best fit the question are \"preparation\" (answer option B) and \"making\" (answer option D).\nSo the final answer here  is B: prepare and D: make  \nSo the final answer that make most sense  is B: prepare\n\nInput: What is the best type of soil to plant flowers in that requires a small amount of water?

{"text": "), or door (E) make sense for some objects, it doesn't make sense for everything contained by a doorway as an answer. \n4. This is because a control panel, for example, contains electrical wiring, and the doorway wouldn't necessarily contain the same wiring. \n5. Looking at the other given answers, D: doorknobs would fit for an object that is not inside the doorway but is still within the building. \n6. Similarly, E: doorway answers the question well because it indicates that the whole structure of the doorway would be considered as the container in this context. \n7. Therefore, we can rule out A: television, B: Control panel, C: opening doors, and E: doorways as incorrect answers.\n8. The only remaining answer that fits this structure is D: doorknobe because it is a handle to open or close a door, which is usually located on the door itself. \n9. Therefore, the answer would be D: doorknobb. \n10. So finally the answer would be D.\n\nInput: The store employee said he liked this store as the prices were competitive, but he didn't seem to understand that these items cost how many dollars? Choices:  the price Choices:  A dollar B dollar fifty C dollar eighty D $500 \nOutput: 1) This store employee said he liked the items in the store because they had competitive prices.\n2) A competitive price means the price at which businesses offer a product or service to stay competitive rather than raising prices to attract customers than its competitors. To be competitive in business means to be one of the lowest-priced items in the market. \n3) The question asks, how many dollars an item costs at the store. \n4) He didn't seem to know that these items cost how much dollars; meaning he wasn't even aware that an item costs how many dollars. \n5) Based on the context, we can eliminate A: a dollar B: $ 80 C: a dollar fifty from the answer choice.\n6) There are only two answers are left, D: $500, and E: dollar eighty, which can be crossed out as we know the store employee didn't know prices of items and they must", "answer": "C: play piano"}
{"text": ") and a doorknob (D) may seem like appropriate objects, they aren't specific enough to be the answer to this question's intent.\n4. The object of choice for this question is E: doorway. \n5. A doorway is typically made up of two walls, a third surface in the form of a door, and a ceiling above. \n6. It also refers to the space between two walls. \n7. The object that would be found in the doorway is either the door itself, the surface/ceiling above, or anything else that could have been installed there.\nSo the final conclusion is that the answer to this question is E: Doorway. \n\nInput: Which word that's in this sentence could come before the word \"beauty\"? Choices:  A word that rhymes with Beauty B: Beauty Beauty Choices:  A rhyme C: Beaty D: Beauty\nOutput: 1) The whole question makes use of the term 'that's in this sentence'. Now, a singular \"that's\" is only ever used to refer to a single thing. We would never refer to the entire sentence as just \"that's\". We're just using that word to refer to the entire sentence. So, we would say \"Word that's in this entire sentence\".\n  2. There's already a word 'beauty' in the sentence (A). A \"Word that rhymes with beauty\" (B) cannot exist in the sentence, as beauty is already rhyming with itself. \n  3. A singular form of 'beauty' (C) cannot exist in a sentence that's using the word as part of its reference to a phrase already in the sentence (A), as singular forms are never used when referring to a noun as part of its reference. \n  4. The correct answer would be D: Beaty. \nSo the final answer choice is D: Beaty.\n\n\nInput: Where does a bird sleep in winter? Choices:  Where does this bird sleep?

Choices:  a: being a loner b: to be alone c: to block all sound d: because everyone knows you e: because you can't hear them\nOutput: 1 This question is asking 'Why' I like to sit somewhere where no one can talk to you. \n2. The word 'to do' has a future tense; hence the 'I like to sit\u2026' means present and not past.\n3. 'No one can talk to you' is wrong because no one is talking to us. We have blocked all talks.\n4. 'To... to' is a verb-form; hence the '..talk to..' should be verb-form also. \n5. \"To... you..\" is present as we want to block all talk to us but not to ourselves.\n6. \"To be alone\" is correct.\n7. 'Noone...'is not future as there is no future in present form. \nSo the answer should be 'c'.\n\nInput: What's the most likely place for someone looking for eggs? Choices: 1. Aisle  B. Shelf C.

Weed killer might help with weed control but it doesn't help a garden grow. \n     - It'd be more apt to choose the  garden weed killer rather than the more generic term used for weed killers in general. \n     - The question has already eliminated the term'soil' by asking which of those don't help a garden go and soil is a necessity for the growth of a garden.\n     - The term used for soil (D) in the question is 'dirt' which includes things like clay or sand or loam. Which might also have a negative effect on the growth of a garden if used as a soil in a too high quantity \n     - The terms used to describe the manure as an element which is vital to the growth of the garden is 'organic' which does imply that if manure is used, it has to be organic.\n  3) Looking at the remaining options,\n     - Seeds (1) is a key element of a garden.\n       - Seeds without good soil (D) will not grow\n       - But they are important to help a garden grow.\n       - The seed germination rate is around 50%\n         - But we can use good gardening practices, and good soil in order to improve that by \n         providing a good seed bed, watering it, keeping that moisture steady, maintaining the temperature (if it's cold or hot), and by", "answer": "D: gym"}
{"text": "), and doorknob (D) could all be located near a doorway, they are all part of the door or door knob itself and not 'contained within the door'.\n4. Furthermore, even if we can accept these options as the contextual answer, the description given in the question states that the object is \"contained by\". \n5. The only option left that meets the context clues of the question is E: doorway - the door is a structural component which contains the doorway, and the phrase \"object is contained by\".\n6. Thus the correct response is E: doorway.\nSo the final answers are and A- C- D- and E: doorway\n\nInput: She saw a group of seals sunbathing on the rocks, is this usual for seals? Choices:  Yes No A: No B: Sea C: Seal D: Seat E: Seat\nOutput: 1.'The question asks whether it is unusual for seals to sunbathe on the rocks. \n2. While the answer to the 'Is this usual for seals' is Yes or No, if the answer to the subsequent question 'Is this unusual for seals' is No, the contextual response to the first yes or no choice should be No. \n3. In the example, the wording'she saw a group of seas sunbathing on rocks' gives a different meaning (that seals are sunbathing) and should be ignored. \n4. When we read the question it shows that a group of seals are sunbating on the rocks. Which is incorrect since the correct sentence should read as below, \u201cShe saw a group of seal sunbating on the rock.\n5. We can eliminate three options B: Sea C:Seal D: Seat because the context gives the impression that seals are doing it(sunbating) on the rock. The remaining choices are A: No B:Yes.\n\nSo the final answer and the right answer should be A: No\n\nInput: Will a mouse climb a rope?

{"text": "), and doorknob (D) can be said to be contained by a doorway, a doorway does not contain all those objects; hence they are not correct. \n4. Choice E: doorway can be the most apt here given that if the doorway is the structure which is contained by the doorway, then the object within the doorway would be contained by the doorway as well.\n5. Based on these reason, the most accurate choice is E: doorknob. \n6. So the final answer is that you would grab the doorknob if you find it within the doorway.\n\nInput: I saw a big red truck, how tall are you? Choices:  X: 2 A: 3 B: 4 C: 5 D: 6 E: 7\nOutput: 1.\"I saw a big red trunk\" is telling that the speaker of this sentence is likely describing the truck's characteristics and therefore the choice describing its height isn't relevant.\n2. Choice C: 5 doesn't make sense, if the truck is red then the only red choice available would be B:4.\n3. Choice D: 6 is unlikely, as a tall person would not describe themselves as such. In this case, the 6th choice was chosen by likely a mistake or mistake by the AI engine (not intended to represent the choice in fact).\nHence, the correct answer is choice B: 4.\nSo the final correct answer is B: 4.", "answer": "E: garden of eden"}
{"text": "), and a doorknob (D) could fall into this category, it is much more likely for it to be a doorway.\n4. Doorways are the central structure of any building, and they are the first things people interact with after entering a room, whereas A, B, C, and D would not be the go-to objects for people in this respect.\n5. Furthermore, the verb 'grabbing' would fit with the idea of a doorway more than the previously mentioned items and we can be sure that it is not asking for the control panel and television to be grabbed and picked up or moved. \n6. So, the most fitting answer here is E: doorway.\nSo the final choice is E: doorway\n\nInput: Who might write their own poem? Choices:  Walt Whitman A: Emily Dickinson B: Allen Ginsberg C: John Milton D: Robert Frost E: Edgar Allan Poe\nOutput: 1) This question asks who would write their own poem.\n2) The question asks specifically for someone who wrote their own poem, however, it doesn't indicate what kind of poem.\n3) We can eliminate any person who doesn't write their own poems from consideration. \n4) Option A: Walt Whitman is not a possible answer because he was known for writing short poems like \"Leaves of Grass\".\n5. Option B: Allen Ginsburg cannot be the correct answer, because the question is not asking about someone writing their own poetry, but specifically writing a poetry of your own. \n6. Option C: John Milton cannot be the correct answer because he wrote poetry based on a specific theme with other people rather than just his ideas. \n7. It can be surmised that Option D: Robert Frost and Option E: Edgar Allen Poe are not correct choices because Robert Frost, known as \"The Poet of New England\" and \"The Bard of Vermont\", mostly used colloquial language and did not use traditional poetic forms or rhyme structures. \n8. Similarly, Edgar Allan Poes' poems mostly had themes like death or grief and were not typically found to be rhymed verse. \n9. The answer is, therefore, D: Robert Frost.\nSo the final option for consideration is", "answer": "B: hall"}

Choices:  a. listen carefully b. look around c. get a great idea d. stare long E. come up with a brilliant concept\nOutput: 1 A clear and concise explanation as to how an artist could ideate is required, as 'ideation' refers to processes of generating new ideas, concepts, or solutions. \n 2. Options A: listen carefully and B: look around might seem relevant at first, but when considering the specifics of the artistic industry such as music, movies, painting, etc., the process of generating an idea doesn't typically come from looking or listening intently. \n 3. Option C: Get a great idea might be valid in the case of drawing, but it's not very likely to apply to all forms of art. \n 4. Option D: Stare long might seem applicable to the context of artistic creation, but it's more of a description of the result of brainstorming rather than an explanation of the process. \n 5. Option E: come up with a brilliant solution is too vague to be an appropriate solution with so many factors that could contribute to the process.\n 6. Therefore, the option that fits the context best is C: get a great idea.\nSo the final option is C: get a \"great\" idea\n\nInput: What are people often doing when people are not being careful with a toddler?

A: count the number of choices in the options B: add the number 5 C: subtract the number 4 D: multiply the number 2 E: divide the number 3\nOutput: 1) 4 choices provided and 4 options chosen result in 0 choices since we have all 4 options, but we are given only 4 options. Therefore, the answer (if there are no more choices provided) is E: The options given are sufficient. 2) We don't know the quantity, so we can't reasonably assume whether or not there are more choices to come (there is only one scenario in which there are no more choices to follow, and we know what it looks like). In case more choices follow, we must proceed by counting, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing (depending on the quantity) in order to determine whether the quantity provided matches the number of given choices. \n\nInput: How many steps might take a person to travel from where they are in the building to the conference room that does not have stairs?

A: No gears B: No front brakes C: No rear brakes D: No chain E: No rear shocks F: No transmission\nOutput: 1 The question asks, \"What makes a dirt bikee not a dirt bikee?\" \n2. To determine whether a dirt bike isn't a dirt bike, you need to assess what distinguishes a dirt bike from a regular bike. For example, a regular bike would not have gears or a transmission, but a dirt bike may have these features. By analyzing these differentiating features, you can determine what makes a dirt bikey not a dirt bikey. \n3. Using this logic, Let's analyze the given options -\n4. Option A (No gears): Regular bike does not have gears, therefore this is unlikely to lead to the desired conclusion \n5. Option B (No front brakes): Dirt bike may have front brakes (or disc brakes) for safety when off-road which may or may not be present in a regular bike. Hence option B cannot be the answer. \n6. Option C (No rear brakes): Dirt bikes commonly have two brakes \u2013 a front hydraulic disc brake and a rear mechanical drum brake for safety. Hence this option is not an accurate representation of a dirt bike either. \n7.

The question is asking for the number of additional times the product of the multiplication can be less than 2140.\n\nThe answer is a number of times, so we need to use a method that gives the number of times. \n\nLet's use the prime factor analysis or prime factorization methods to answer this question.\n\n**Prime factorization of 2140**\n\nThere are 2 multiplicands, so we use 2 for a times.\n\n2 x 2040 is less than 2 x 2140 \nThus, we can multiply by 2 0 more times to make the product less than 2 x2140  \nAnswer: 0\n\n**Practise questions**\n\n1. What could you make less than one with?\n\n**The Answer**\n\nTo understand this question, it is very essential to understand the given phrase 'one with'\n\nTo make something less than one, we need to divide the number of times its product is less than 2340 by its prime factor. The factorization of 2340 equals: 2 x 2 x 270.\n\nThe minimum number of times you can multiply a number by one to get a product less than 2339 is 0. This means that the number can be made zero through the division method.\n\n2. How many more times can the product of 1384 and 157 be less than 1384?\n\n**Answer**\n\nTo determine how many times a number can be less than another, you need to multiply both quantities and subtract the two products. We can make it less", "answer": "A: school children"}
{"text": "), doorknob (D), and doorway (E) are all parts of a doorway structure, only D, the doorknob, can be grabbed directly from a doorway.\n4.

Based on the reasoning behind this question, it is unlikely that the object will be a freely hanging or dangling item in the doorway structure because option E: a doorway cannot imply freedom of movement.\n5. Therefore choosing among the options left - a doorknob, or an opening door, we can see a doorknob as more probable since a person typically has to grasp a doorknob in the doorway to open it (if a door closes on a finger, for example).\n6. Therefore, option C - the opening door is the correct answer.\nSo the final answers is: C: Open Door", "answer": "D: cleanliness"}

Rather, it sheds then grows back. Therefore, bird does not come back after getting hurt.  \n\nOption: Bird dies. Option E: Bird flies away.\n\nOption E: Bird flies is the correct answer.\n\nOption F: Bee flies away incorrect because a bee is not related to the injured bird.\n\nSo the answer is F: BEED flies away.\nSo the correct answer F: BEED flied away is the final answer.", "answer": "A: sit"}

Choices:  P: remove PE: put in E: take it out D: put A: dry\nOutput: \n1. The question is about what you should do with a wet piece of clothing before going indors. \n2. Going indoors means entering a building, where you can find a dryer in which to dry the clothing. \n3. An option which would involve taking the wet clothing out of the building is Option B: remove, however this is not a valid option as we already know that we need to dry the clothing, so the option P: remove is incorrect. \n\n4. The option D: put a dry would work but it is again a bit too broad as one has to be sure that the item would fit into the dryer before putting it in.\n\n5. Therefore, we can exclude options B and D as we want the answer to fit the context provided in the question and have to work with it. As we know that we have to dry the item, the only option that fits the question is option C: take it out. \n\n6. The only plausible answer is: P: remove, which would make option A: dry incorrect. \nSo the correct answer is P: remove.", "answer": "A: special"}

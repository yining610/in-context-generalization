Choices:  A: pets B: fills the pond C: attempt to fly D: school together E: breath in water<n>Output:		A: pets<n><n>#### Multiple Choice:<n><n>I believe in the power of the crowd. I've seen this work with my own eyes more than a few times. Just last month, I saw it work in my own backyard. <n><n>I had a great friend over as a guest to help me work on a project.  While I can think of a lot of different skills sets that he brings to the table, what he doesn't bring is the ability to operate a soldering iron.  As we went to work on this project, I watched in amazement as he went from being a complete novice of soldering to creating this amazing electrical circuit between the two boards.  He didn't have any training.  In fact, he is not really even that fond of the way I do electrical circuitry.  I was more of a spectator than a builder, while he was in the throes of learning and building.  It was amazing. <n><n>It is very hard for someone that isn't a doctor to tell whether or not someone is ill.  I can't tell the difference between illnesses that might require a trip to the emergency room and illnesses I could treat myself.  There is a doctor whose sole focus is the body.  If I have a question about whether or not I have the flu or if I have a bladder infection or why I am having severe stomach pains, I wouldn't even bother thinking about having my symptoms put to the test.  They would simply get diagnosed.  So, what in the world do you call the hundreds and hundreds of doctors or nurses who have seen, felt, heard and smelt many people with similar issues or health problems? A doctor's office or hospital floor is filled with doctors and nurses.  All these people and their combined backgrounds are the basis, the very foundation, of the doctor's diagnosis.  They all worked together to figure out the cause of what ails you.<n><n>So, what happens when you put many people with varying backgrounds together to work with a single project?  The crowd goes to work. <n><n>We have all been asked to solve similar problems when a team of people were put together and told they would have to work together.  They are each told their skill set is important and, combined with other team

Choices:  D: business sector or A: town B: hotel  C: mall  or E: yellow pages\nRationales: Steps 1 - 3: Read the question and the context. The question asks about the location of a business restaurant, and, since it is business-related, it can only be in the business sector.\nStep 4 (Option A): No need for a business restaurant in the hotel because people can eat wherever they reside, regardless of whether it's a hotel, a home, or a hostel.\nStep 5(Option B): To be found on the mall would probably be to have a shopfront for selling food. Again, people can eat food wherever they reside.\nStep 6(Option C): No need for a restaurant on the mall because, like the hotel, the mall does not have a residency of its own.\nStep 7(Option D): The only choice where a business restaurant does not require a residential environment is a place in the business sector, e.g the hotel or mall, but given the other options there are only businesses located in the business sector, so this is more likely a place where the restaurant is located.\nStep 8(Option E): The business sector does not typically have a telephone directory, unlike the other options.\nAnswer: (Closest) Choice C:Business sector\n\n### Input:\"Weather at 10am may be forecast by...\" Choices:  A:\"the barometer\"  B:\"navy\"  C:\"meterologist\"  D:\"the meteor\"\n\n### Response:\"The meterologist\n\n### Explaination:\n\nInstruction:Answer the following fill in the blank question.<br>\n\nDemonstration:\nStep 1: Read the question and context.

{"text": "### Demystification:\nIf a person contracts a disease typically, what does the person become? A. Hospital. B. Head. C. Sick person D. Elderly person E. Doctors office.\nIf a head is typically a hospital, does the sick person typically have a hospital in their head? Maybe if they are the person who contracted the disease. A person could be anything, and the question seems more applicable to that fact, that someone may be sick, contract a disease, become head and the doctor's office and all that is needed would be a cure. If you are a person, you should only choose the questionable person and sick.\n\n### Validation:\nA: Hospital, B: Head, C: Sick person, Doctors office.\nA: Hospital, maybe head and person, but the sick person will not have it in their head nor contract the illness in an office.\nB: Head- hospital, office. It will need hospital care and medical attention and it will likely go to an office to be diagnosed.\nC: Sick person- hospital, office. The sick person could make a doctor's office, and it could need hospital if it is a severe disease.\n\n### Additional thoughts:\nThis is interesting. I think the question is being tricked, it is not saying what the person is, but instead saying what the person has, what the illness or disease is. Therefore, the hospital is illness itself, not the person. People could be sick, and head and person, and need a cure for the disease. The doctor's office does not require a sick person, but a sick person could contract disease and need office care, which is a different thing. This may also be how the question was answered for option B or E.\n\nIt is correct that a person could be sick if they need medical attention and a cure, and a head might be hospital, but it is also a hospital, if it is ill. It is also possible that a person who contracts an illness does not need to become sick person, but just needs care and attention. The sick person could be treated in hospital, and could be a head, and could get treatment, but it would not need to become the other parts of the question.\n\nIt can be confusing as head is illness to a degree, but it can also be a person", "answer": "D: elderly person"}

The meaning of the sentence would be \"place it over the toilet.\"\n2. Choice B: \"the table\" - incorrect answer. While using the word \"the\" before an object is required in some cases, there is specific context required. In this sentence, \"the table\" clearly does not include the toilet in the context, so the correct answer would not be \"the table.\"\n3. Choice C: \"below the table\" - incorrect answer, because the sentence suggests the item should be placed in the bedroom and not in another room.\n4. Choice D: \"under the table\" - incorrect because \"under\" would place the item \"beneath\" the table - the toilet does not fit below the table in this context.\n5. Choice E: \"beside the table\" - incorrect, because choosing \"under the table\" and \"beside the table\", while similar in structure, are both used to represent being below and beside something. \"Beside\" would suggest it should be on the opposite side of the table but \"under\" would suggest \"below\" the table. The sentence does not convey those meanings.\n\nStep 3: Choice D: \"the table\" is the only answer that is grammatically correct.

Consider choice A: Laparotomy. Laparotomy refers to an incision made through the skin of the abdomen so as to allow physicians to view the abdominal organs. Hence, laparotomy is not a procedure involving a single surgical removal of a stomach part. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n2. Consider choice B: Endoscopy. Endoscopy involves the insertion of a flexible tube with a bright light in order to view and sample areas where abdominal organs are located. In this case, endoscopy involves visualization and not removal of organs. Therefore, while endoscopy is often used as a surgical tool or an aid in various abdominal procedures, it is not a direct procedure of removal, so it is incorrect.\n3. Consider choice C: Ileostomy. Ileostomy is a procedure in which an artificial opening is created in the abdomen so that waste material may leave the body.

However, the cello is used in orchestras and other wind and string groups, as well as string quartets. It is therefore also not a non-contextual answer. \nStep 5: Continuing on the cello, consider choice C: Band. Bands are typically defined as a small musical group consisting of wind or percussion instruments. However, the cellos used as percussion and the typical group dynamic does not necessitate the cello's inclusion. Therefore, it is also not the correct answer. \nRationales\n\nStep 5: It makes sense that someone playing the cello will include someone. The term cello is the Italian word for \"bass viol\". A \"cellist\" is one who plays the cello, which is in this case a type of musical instrument or musical performer. Therefore, the correct choice is \"band\" which includes a cellist. The other choices are infeasible.\n\nAnswer: D: music band", "answer": "B: symphony"}

It will not be able to fit in the sleeve of a wrench and thus cannot be removed using wrenches. Pliers (Choice A) also do not work for this purpose as crankpins cannot be pulled out of their holes with pliers. Using a wrench to loosen a crankpin will damage its bearings.

{"text": "(Option C) What Sam prefers is (solitude).\n### Explanation: Sam's kicking John out was done because he did not want him to come. He is not in his solitude, but his own company or solitude. The choices are:\na. The verb *came* that indicates past action is followed by \"to *see* *Sam*\", which is the first name of the subject, \"John\". By following the subject immediately, and in the past, \"Sam\" is then the direct object of the verb *kicked*, in the past tense in this sentence.\nb. Then, since the phrase \"Sam kicked him out\" is an action that refers to an event, and the main clause is, (Sam didn't like company, he preferred solitude.). Therefore, the sentence, \"John came to see Sam, and Sam kicked him..\" follows the meaning of preference, like a preference towards solitude to see his friend. It can't be loneliness, because it is not a preference, and it is not the action of him kicking, even though he has kicked.\nThis is why the answer will not be loneliness \"A\", since this means being alone, even though the sentence says his preference, not the action, is for solitude. It can't even be \"B\", since the choices for \"C\" and \"D\" are what he prefers, not a preference itself. The subject is not \"alone\", so therefore it can't be choice choice \"E\".", "answer": "C: solitude"}

The first reason listed is that there is a limit on the amount of interest the borrower may be willing to pay. \n2. It is unlikely that the interest rate is the thing that the lender cares about; after all, banks may impose certain rate maxima (cap). \n3. This reason is not appropriate, since the interest is usually paid regardless of how much or how little the borrower owns. \n4. While the rate of decrease could be a useful benchmark, it is not really appropriate here since this question asks about limits per se, not about rates decreasing over time.\n5.

This makes it easy prey for lions to kill and eat; thus, the answer is likely to be D: hyena. Another possibility is B: zebra since the giraffe, in turn, might eat a zebra that it kills, and a baby elephant probably would not be able to reach or eat a giraffe.\n### Rational 2:  A crocodile, though perhaps a formidable predator, would have a hard time eating the baby elephant even if able to reach the infant pachyderm.

Drive Train (vehicle, see below).\nStep 3: Reject the answers that don't fit on a case-by-case basis.\nStep 4:: Considering the context, an adult man in a formal setting (for example, in a traditional  company)  will not be getting ready for work by dressing himself or by drinking beer, since both of the actions mentioned in the answer options could offend his/her colleagues.\nStep 5:: In the scenario the man will not be dressing himself (option A), nor will he be drinking beer (option B). Further, while he may choose to do some exercise prior to going to work or prepare his tools to work better (which includes dressing in order to function properly), doing so cannot be considered getting ready for work, as a man is simply getting dressed. \nStep 6:: In the scenario the adult male is either driving a truck of train to go to work or sitting in an airplane in the morning (e.g., on a domestic or international flight). In the first setting (driving a truck), he may choose to get ready at home by showering, dressing himself and dressing his or her truck (all 4 options), yet option E (drive train) is the most common. Moreover, an adult male who commutes via train would use the option E to get ready for work. \nStep 7: An adult male who drives himself will most often drink coffee or water  (to avoid getting tired or sleepy) prior to starting his work for the next day.

{"text": "Simon might take the cow someplace it could produce milk in order to sell the milk (D: dairy farm).\n\n### Relevance of \"He didn't want any meats for it.\"\n\nSimon didn't want any of the cow for itself, likely including the meat. He instead wanted to put the cow to work, which was likely the same work as the work a cow would have in producing milk. Therefore, the cow was likely purchased with the intention to sell the milk, which would be made into milk products such as butter, yogurt, and cheese; the cow would likely produce these types of products at a dairy farm. Since Simon already had a food source, such as butcher's shop (E), he would likely not purchase the cow for the meat it would produce.\n\n### How would you have found the answer if you were not aware of the context/clue \"He didn't...\"?\n\nThe first thing to notice is whether Simon is buying the cow for the meat (like a butcher or grocery) or for the milk (like dairy farm). Once that distinction is made, the most likely choice is where in order to sell the cow's milk.\n\n### Consider two wrong choices:  A: countrzidue B: City\n\nI have not been able to find a specific example of this, but presumably this would be incorrect because Simon would not want the meat for himself, so he wouldn't take the meat to a meat source such as a butcher or grocer unless he was giving the meat away or selling it to another source (like an employee or customer that did not eat meat) which is not mentioned. In addition, since Simon wanted to put the cow \"to work\", he would likely want to put the cow to his intended purpose for obtaining the cow, and therefore it makes more sense to believe the cow would be going to a dairy farm, which is what Simon might buy the cow to be, than being \"out\" at places it could provide no work such as the city.", "answer": "C: dairy farm"}

So option B: Cut Overhead is a good answer.\n\nResponse 2:\nWhile the other options are also possible answers that a business person might say, option B: Cut overheard is an option a lot of business people in the know (i.e. someones who talk about this topic) would choose. \nThis is important because the question asked how one can help a business grow, and therefore the answer given must be a good answer in the eyes of business people who would give such an answer. \n\n### Justify:\nThis is a sentence with an apposition.

The word \u201cfiddling\u201d is one adjective from a verb. We don\u2019t say \u201cfiddling should be play.\u201d So the proper grammatical structure is \u201cfiddling *can\u2019t* be play.\u201d\nSo, none of the options start with \u201chave\u201d, which is inaccurate for grammatical or contextual reasons.\n\nStep 3- The word \u201cbook\u201d can apply to any collection of written work. We would not expect the conductor of an orchestra to fumble through the parts. Therefore, Option A: practice book is incorrect.\n\nStep 4- No one can or would be expected to play with idle time. In order to play a piece, one needs to know the notes of the piece and be able to deftly execute the notes quickly or slowly to suit the moment. Hence, option B: dexterity is incorrect.\n\nSimilarly, option C: idle time, is incorrect.\n\nOption D: knowledge of music is a possibility, but would not be described with fiddling. One may \u201cfumble through\u201d a piece when they do not have full knowledge of the work, but fiddling is not the manner in which a person would expect someone to play. So fiddling *can* indicate knowledge of the music; but it would be unlikely.\n\nHence, option D: knowledge of music sounds the most likely.\n\nAnswer: D: knowledge of music\n\n### Input Questions:\n\nWhat kind of person would you say to make their own?\n\nStep 1: Analyze the question to see the logical flow.

These choices are too similar to be useful. \nAnother option might be to ask whether there is any other way to \"make a jigsaw puzzl out of a jigsac puzzel.\"\n\nConsider the remaining options which are A: jigsaw or jigsaw puzzel, B: chess game, C: puzzle box, D: jigsaw or puzzle or puzzle puzzel, and E: puxxel.\n\n### Eliminate the unspecific terms.\nOption A: jigsaw, jigsaw puzzel. Since choices A: jigsaw and B: chess game are unspecific terms, \nOption B: chess game is better because it is specific and relevant to the context. \nSo, eliminate all the other options, leaving options B and E.\n\n### Evaluate the potential logical choice and its validity.\nOption E: puxxle. There's a chance that \"puzxle\" could be a type of word that is specific to jigsaw, but that is only a guess at best and is speculative. \nMoreover, considering the specific options like E: puxxle and A: jigsaw would probably give a better response. \nHaving the option E: puxxle doesn't eliminate \"puzzle box\" because it could mean \"puxxle to make a puzzle\" in the context of a jigsaw.\nEven though \"puxxle\" is a valid term in its own right, in this context, \"puzxle is the correct answer.", "answer": "C: puzzle box"}

{"text": "Put it on a shelf\n\n## Feedback\nIt is a suggestion, the response: Put it in a shelf.\n\n### Feedback Rationale:We evaluate our responses to make sure that they are logical, complete, and grammatically correct. Using the feedback, we can determine the logical response. In this case, the feedback should be \"the answer is shelf\". To ensure that our responses are logical, we assess the situation and consider the types of responses that follow the logical path. From there, our logical response can be the one that best fits that logical response.\n\n### Input, Assessment, and Logical Response\nFor the feedback, we evaluated the logical response based on the question. The question asks the reader where would you put the dictionary, and there are various places such as shelf, library, study area, table, and classroom, so it is natural for the reader to think about putting a dictionary in these different places.\n\nThe response feedback can indicate two important things in the evaluation process: 1. It is incomplete, such that it must provide a full response to the question (the answer is shelf), and 2. there is a grammatical error (the answer is shelve).\n\nTo begin the logical path, we first evaluate the question to see if the feedback is a logical match. The question asks, \"Where would you put a Dictionary while you're using on\" (emphasis on the on). From this, we can conclude that the question is asking the reader to explain where the dictionary is on their desk while they are using the dictionary. It is unlikely that they would place the dictionary on the table as they are not reading it on the table. It would be more likely that they would place the book down, such as on the floor, the couch, or the shelf.\n\nNext, we use the logical response - the response with the most logical match - and determine the correct and incorrect options. We eliminate the wrong answer based on our previous observations and the logical response to the question. In this example, the logical response is place it on a shelf. We cannot place the dictionary anywhere except one of the options - the choices on the response card are classroom, library, study area table, and shelf. All other places are incorrect, and only one of the choices is correct. If we evaluate the logical response and the feedback option, it is clear that", "answer": "C: table"}

For the first choice, A: arrogate, this choice has a definition: to act in an offensively arrogant manner, which cannot be used to describe Bill since he did not act arrogantly to the enemy.\n\nStep 3: Look at the remaining options, which are B: retain (keep), C: embrace (accept), D: engage (start a fight), E: smile.\nStep 4 - Evaluate the remaining options individually. Retain (keep) cannot be used to describe this scenario since Bill did not \"keep\" the enemy.\n\nEither engage or embrace can't be used as there was no \"fight\" that occurred.\n\nStep 5: As far as the remaining option, smile, is concerned \u2013 since smiling is not really \"doing\" anything, but only conveying an action, it fits the description.

{"text": "Answer: A: geography\n\n### Answer Explanation: Geographers study the Earth, including where things are and how features change through time. Geographers may specialize in topics like population, natural resources, and landscapes. Some geographers study a specific region, such as North America or Europe, while others focus on the Earth as a whole. Historians study the past by examining sources like books and documents, listening to people\u2019s stories, and analyzing artifacts. They can learn a lot about how a group or a culture once lived by studying what they left behind. History is all about how we got to be the way we are now. Math is a group of rules and formulas that help explain and predict what happens in the world around us. They show us how to solve problems like \"If I took a dollar and added 10c to it, how much would I have?\" or \"If the temperature changes from 15C to 25C, what will happen in a particular place?\" Math may seem easy to learn, but it takes a lot of practice and skill to become good at it.  In many cases, learning it helps you with other things like problem solving and working with numbers. Some of us believe in a god, but even if we do, we're still people, and we're all different. A dancer might be good at dancing, but that doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re good at it in all fields. \n\n### Other Input\n\n* Dear,\n  * How do you feel?\n  * I am confused I think, I'd rather eat something than just sit through this.\n  * Oh, okay.

It appears that the policemen are at a scene of an accident and that they have the task of clearing the scene.\nStep 2. Since there are a lot of choices. We need to know what the options are and which direction we should move. Eliminate the impossible ones.\nHurry along: The policeman have nothing to do with the speed of the traffic. They can't control the speed of the traffic as they have no authority over the traffic control themselves. They can only direct the traffic. So hurrying along is out of the question.\nTraffic: As I have explained in \"Step 1\", traffic refers to moving vehicles or objects. Therefore, this option cannot be right.\nTraffic and direct traffic: direct traffic is different from \"traffic direction\" because the policemen don't control the \"traffic flow\"; they just direct the vehicles/objects coming by. So we can eliminate it.\nTo clear up traffic is not in any sense what we are looking for because \"Clear Up traffic\". The policemen are not trying to clear anything, their goal is to clear the traffic congestion by directing the traffic.\n\nStep 3: At this point we look at the remaining three choices.

{"text": "Step 1: The circus monkey waved a white surrender flag. \nStep 2: Choice A: French Government \u2013 As this is a circus monkey, this choice does not make sense as it does not relate to a circus monkey at all.\nStep 3. Choice B: Friend's house - Perhaps the circus monkey was leaving or visiting a friend's house and is waving the white surrender flag as a sign of goodbye? However, this choice does not sufficiently match up with the context since no one refers to the circus monkey as their friend.\nStep 4. Choice C: Zoo - The zoo could be an appropriate answer, but some additional context is required on the type of animal that the circus monkey is or else any of the answers might be correct by proxy.\nStep 5. Choice D: South Africa - Perhaps an African circus monkey is visiting a zoo in South Africa? Is holding a white surrender flag as he enters the zoo? The conductor might have been joking to suggest that it was some sort of surrender, but the choice of South Africa is odd for a circus monkey in an American train, and the conductor never references South Africa or says the monkey is there - it is simply an inference that the conductor makes.\nStep 6. Choice E: Madagascar - Similar to South Africa, perhaps the circus monkey has come from Madagascar to join the circus and is holding a white surrender flag on arrival? This is less plausible than the preceding answer, but some additional facts might suggest it is one of the answers.\nStep 7. Choice F: The correct answer is an amalgamation of the previous answers, as the conductor (Step 4) indicates that he was joking (Step 5), and that the monkey is waving a white flag (Step 2), leaving the circus (Step 6), and in the process of coming to South Africa from Madagascar.\nIf the conductor said nothing about joking or the white flag, answer choice F cannot be answered correctly, and hence a true or false might be more appropriate.\n\n#### Correct\nStep 1: A white surrender flag - Yes\nStep 2: A friend's house - No.\nStep 3 To a zoo - Yes for holding a white flag,", "answer": "A: french government"}

{"text": "A: pleasant thoughts\n### Rationale: Steps 1-3: As the question asks about things you love, and wants us to know your thoughts, A: Pleasant thoughts fit here. Steps 4-6: We can eliminate moving (choice D), as once you\u2019re back on vacation, you can\u2019t move in. Staying there also means you can\u2019t move from there. We can also eliminate overspending as spending more doesn\u2019t mean you love somewhere (for instance, some people overspend and still hate a place). We can\u2019t move to the place we love, nor do we need to (D: Staying there). We don\u2019t have to or need to move (D: moving there).

Choices: 1: Inventors 2: Politicians 3: Revolutionaries 4: Workers 5: Leaders\nRationales: Steps 1 and 2: Look at each choice in turn and eliminate the unsuitable and unnecessary choices. Inventors (Choice 1) create something new. While revolutionaries (Choice 3) also change the world, they do so through political action, and are themselves part of the status quo - they are changing the status quo to make changes, hence not an appropriate choice. Workers (Choice 4) often change the status quo by creating something, but this change is only local or short-term. Leaders (Choice 5) change the world through action or leadership which can include creating the status quo.\nStep 3-5: Now consider the choices remaining - they are Politicians (Choice 2) and Revolutionaries (Choice 3). While politicians can be revolutionaries, it's not necessary for a politician to be a revolutionary, nor is a politician itself a significant cause of revolution. This leads you to the correct answer - revolutionaries, as these are the individuals who can directly change the status quo. Hence, answer C: revolutionaries is the correct answer choice.\n\n### Input\nWhich type of material can the", "answer": "D: staying there"}
{"text": "The most appropriate choice is C, which states: Clothing Stores. The reason that other responses are incorrect is because they do not address the question in a reasonable way and make no mention of what type of places would be able to sell socks and jeans. A laundromat is not mentioned directly but is implied in the instruction. The reason there are no such implications is because a laundromat was not mentioned anywhere in the instruction. A washing machine could buy jeans or socks in bulk if that were the case but the sock and jean question makes clear that they are going to be able to purchase them individually. The closest implication that could be made to support choice B is that a closet could be a place where customers could buy socks and jean from. However the implication is not directly stated and not likely that anyone would make it without a closer glance at the question and that seems unreasonable as well. Shopping malls can of course sell socks and jean, but jean is specifically listed as being on sale in choice D. Additionally choice A, the washing machine, has nothing to do with the question and does not explain where the sock and jeans would come from. The choice of clothing stores is simple, they sell socks and can be purchased individually. Shopping malls is close but is not able to purchase items individually. A closet would not be able to get socks and jeans from a place such as a washing machine, laundromat, or shopping mall.

Choice A: garage B: carport C: shed D: driveway E: parking lot\nRationales 1. The question asked you where do you store your vehicle in case you can not go home anymore during a rainy day. There are four choices given, and they are A. Garage B. Parking Lot. C. Shed and D. Carport. 2. In case if we are a home owner and we have a garage with big area then we can store vehicles in our garage, if we do not have garage maybe we can rent from others and have a carport which is a kind of building with an attached roof for car, in case if we do not have big area we can store it in shed then the last alternative is carport which is also the last option to store your car in case we can not go home any more.\n\n### Response After you analyze the four choices it is quite obvious that none of them is suitable for storing your vehicle as you can not go home because of rainy day. Hence it must be carport or shed because it has the least area to be a home and can store your vehicle in. However Carport is the best choice for storing your vehicle because there a lot of car port in the market and it is less expensive and easy for installing and maintain. I think it will also save on time and energy to store your vehicle.", "answer": "A: airplane"}

Competition is about beating others and putting skills on display, so answer choice \"Skill\" does not match up with the question being asked here.\n\n2. A: EDGE: An edge is a physical advantage that allows you to compete more effectively than your opponent \u2013 you may have an edge over your opponent height differences or maybe you\u2019re quicker than them.

In either case, competing does not make you better, it makes you more competitive. It is not what people seek when competing.\n\n5. D: Friendship: This is not a suitable choice because a friendship is about the quality of emotions; love friendship, friendship, respect, etc. None of these emotions are related to a form of competition, which requires a certain amount of intensity, focus and competitiveness.  Competing is about having an interest in doing something that is more than just a friendly act of competition. Hence, this choice can be eliminated from the answer.\n\n6.

Choices: \nA: 3/4 of cup  B: 4/10 cup  C: neither\n\nRationales: Consider and eliminate unrelated scenarios: a half cup of brown sugar is not equivalent to an eighth cup of brown sugar and a cup of flour is not equivalent to a tenth of a cup of brown, nor are these values within the constraints of the question.\nStep 2, determine which choice is the better option: 3/4 cup of flour is the equivalent of 10 ounces. 4/10, then, is equivalent to 2.5 ounces, a smaller value. Hence, in terms of equal weight, 4/10 is smaller than 3/4, and is therefore inferior.\nStep 2(a): Weighing this choice against the other option, neither of these is an ideal choice. If someone chose 3/4 of one and 4/10 another, they may not have enough to fully make their recipe. If 3/4 of 4/10 were used, they would not need as much of the next ingredient and the meal would not be fully balanced.

This is common sense.\n\n#### Reason 2:\n\nA) Wiping off the floor would not solve the problem of there being a wet floor; in order to wipe off wetness, one could use a wet towel. Therefore, this answer is not logically the correct one.\n\n#### Reasons 3:\n\nC) Hand sanitizer and E) removing the spilled liquids do not do anything to the floor, and the floor itself isn't being promoted in the question.

{"text": "Both A and E are correct.\n\n### Rationales:Step 1: Consider each option one by one by first eliminating the unrelated options A, B, and C. As isopropyl alcohol is typically sold in pharmacy and grocery stores, it isn't available at typical restaurants and parks. As safety glasses are worn in safety-related work situations, they aren't typical attire at restaurants and pubs nor for people leisurely having lunch or drinks in parks.\nStep 2. Now, consider each remaining possibility further. The choice D: Supermarket is a viable answer if you are looking to buy products that contain isopropyl alcoohol, though you probably want it in concentrated form (since supermarkets don't stock pure alcohol). Therefore, choice C: In a park can be eliminated. The choice E: Chemistry lab is the appropriate response because it is a place where one can get and use safety glasses to maintain eye safety while handling lab chemicals.\nStep 3. Even though we have found two answers, let's consider each in greater detail. The choice A: Pub is not a place to find isopropyl alcoholm, so this can be eliminated. Furthermore, one would not wear gloves or safety glasses at a place like a pub - it's a place people go to drink alcoholic beverages, so it's not an appropriate location to wear gloves or safety gear.\nStep 4. Let's examine the final choice - E: Chemistry lab. Would you wear gloves or have eye protection in a chemistry lab? Of course, they could be useful tools when handling harmful chemicals in a lab. One needs eye protection while working under lab conditions due to fumes and substances used in the lab. Also, it would be wise to wear gloves to protect skin that could otherwise be negatively affected by the type of lab substances handled.\nWe see that the final choice is both A: Pub and E: Chemistry lab, which are viable and valid answers to the question.\nAnswer: Both A: Pub and E are correct", "answer": "E: chemistry lab"}

Choices: 1. A: in the jungle 2. B: in a bamboo groove 3. C: in the Australian Outback 4. D: in China 5. E: in a child's book\nRationales: - Step 1: Read the question to understand what is being asked. Identify that the question asks where you would find a panda, given that the museum placed a stuffed koala rather than a panda. Note that the given information about the koala being stuffed makes it unlikely that it was placed in an actual outback location.\n- Step 2: Think about what it means \"to place the stuffed creature in the area where you'd find a panda.\" This indicates that the display is meant to look like something it's not, an actual panda. Thus, the koala cannot possibly be placed in the outback (the actual habitat for koalas).\n- Step 3: Evaluate each answer choice individually. Choice (A) is eliminated as you can find a koala in the jungle, so this choice cannot be the correct one.\n- Choice (B) is also eliminated because you cannot find a bamboo forest in Australia.\n- Choice E is also eliminated because while children's books can contain animals, you cannot generally find stuffed koalas in children's books.\n- Choices (D) is also removed because China doesn't have any koala habitats.\n- Choice C is the correct response because the Australian outback is the correct placement for a koala, not a panda.\nAnswer: Answer: C: australian out back\n\n## Instructions:Answer \n\n## Instrucation:The museum made an strange choice for the koala disguies what's the odd in the choices, there's the koala's home is in where?

If Billy were to leave his stuffed animal over at the toy store, then that's where the mother would yell at Billy. In reality, this choice is not relevant.\n- Choice B: the hall - Not much of a possibility with the wording, \"toy store\" (the specifics of it might include the bathroom, such as a nursing space, but the wording was inaccurate)\n- Choice C: the bathroom - No, Billy's stuffed animal would not be in the bathroom. \n- Choice D: the amusement park - While an amusement park was not specified, it is unlikely that amusement parks have their stuffed animals inside the toilet. Thus, this choice is not applicable.\n- Choice E: the fairgrounds - Not sure why this has anything to do with stuffed animals, let alone where Billy might want to leave them.\n- Choice D was the most applicable, so it would be the correct answer choice.\n###Input: What will you make from a large group of people if you give them a list of tasks that needs done?

Consider the choices. \nStep 3: Assess the context; determine what kind of work each choice represents. \nStep 5: Apply that information to the situation. When you put away silverware, you might not need to wash it, as it's dried. But it would look odd and uncared-for on a table.

Consider A: special because while being special can certainly make someone feel appreciated and worthy, it is not specific to when someone receives something rare.  Consider B: personal as being likely in this scenario. \n\nGiven the choice A, \"special\" can mean different things to different people, and thus the person would likely feel unpredictable emotions of appreciation, shock, anger, etc. as the giver intended to make the receiver appreciate or honor the sender in one or more ways.\nChoice B, \"personal\" is a good choice as it fits multiple emotions that someone can feel: appreciation, acceptance, offense, gratitude, and more. Consider, as an example, a relative that takes the time to find out specifics on your family or personal hobbies and creates a gift that is unique to your tastes and interests.  In this scenario, receiving such an item would be a rare moment and the resulting emotions would be positive \u2013 you would feel appreciated and special. \n\n**Note:** All the response variables are mandatory fields or there will be some errors that will not let the user to go through to the next level.\n\n**Note: Choice D:** is incorrect because it implies that someone would feel offended and as a result, feel negatively towards the gift.\n\n**Note that Answer E:** can also be correct because the gift may not be common but being presented on purpose.", "answer": "A: special"}

{"text": "What the school had made to [what] change?\n\n### Rationales:\nFirst, the author has made a grammatical mistake by reversing the sentence. The correct sentence would be \"They seemed to what effort the school had made to what change\". This mistake can be easily noticed since \"the school had made effort\" is not grammatically correct. Moreover, the subject should be \"They\", not \"school\".\n\nThe author has used \"effort\" and \"change\" in the wrong context according to the options provided. Schools make an effort to change but not change in [the sense] of \"effort\". Schools usually change the ways of teaching and educating their students by introducing new learning methods instead of taking efforts to change in [the sense of] \"take efforts\".\n\nThe author is also using the word 'authoritarian' in an inappropriate manner. Authoritarian does not refer to [someone] or [something] who \"authorizes\" or \"enforces\" something. Rather, it refers to a government/management system that holds absolute power over the people, and usually enforces a certain ideology. Therefore, choice C: authoritarian is the correct answer, choice D: yell at cannot possibly be the correct answer since it violates the rules of the English language. Choice E: avoid is also incorrect since it is not the usage of the word \"avoid\" as per the context of the question.\n\nAnswer: D: yell at\n\n### Input\n\nWhat has to be taken to the zoo?

The correct word would be \"carry\" or in a rare circumstance, \"transport\". The question does not refer to the act of carrying/transporting the things. On the contrary, it refers to the things that have to be carried/transported to the zoo. So only options B and D are", "answer": "A: ignore"}

While getting divorced may affect certain types of sisters, it is not an activity you would do with your sister. The rationale behind this is that sisters have similar relationships, meaning one may be used to represent the majority.\n\nStep 3. While husband-and-wife couples are related by marriage, husbands and lawyers cannot engage in one type of marriage. Consequently, a wife (a.k.a. a married woman), a husband (a.k. a married man), and a marriage (a.k. another type of marriage) are in relevant relationships to each other, while husband and a wife are not. \n\nStep 4. While husbands and sisters can be associated, such an association is not relevant to this answer.

If it were \"who can be applied with a caring heart\" (i.e., general applicability), \"all mammals\" could be the response. \"Species\" is a logical choice because it is in general applicable. A \"caring heart\" is not necessarily associated with one species over another, whereas it is logical to presume that \"caring hearts\" differ in species.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n> The best answer for A is \"E\" (all mammals).

{"text": "C: pencil  case\n\n### Rationales:\nStep 1: Consider each of the choices one by one. \nStep 2: Choice A: Desk Drawer \u2013 A desk drawer is located in the office, not the pencil case! Hence, this choice is not a possible answer. \nStep 3: Choice B: Cup \u2013 Pencils do not fit in cups and, instead, they are stored in a pencil case or a desk drawer. Therefore, this choice cannot be a possible answer.  Note that a cup and pencils are not stored in the same location.\nStep 4 Consider Choice C: Pencil Case \u2013 While some people might use a pencil case for pencil storage, pencils can also be stored in desk drawers and cupboards. However, a pencil case is the most logical choice to hold pencils rather than some other objects, like pens or paperclips, for example. Since the question asks where John went to get more pencils, it's obvious that the pencil case is where he went. \nStep 5 Consider Choice D: Shelf \u2013 Pencils are not stored on shelves or even on shelf-like things. Hence, this choice cannot be the correct answer. \nStep Step 6 Consider Choice E: Office Depot - While one could argue that this would be a way to get more penciles, Office Depot could be a place to get more pencil-like items, like writing utensils. However, the question does not ask for place to get more writing utensils or office supply. Hence, this choice does not fit the question properly.\nAnswer: Choice C: PENCIL CASE\n\n## Assessment\n\nUse the guidelines in [Guidelines about assessment](https://www.duyskindes.com/static-instructions-instructions.html#Guidelines-about-assessment).\n\nFor the first instruction, make sure the question is in the proper format.\n\nFor the second instruction, make sure the response is in the proper format, i.e. using a format that matches the template.\n\nFor the third instruction, make sure that the proper rationales are provided for the correct response.", "answer": "E: office depot"}

Choices:  A. pit bull B. dachshund C. chihuahua D. miniature pinscher E. golden doodle\nRationales:Step 1: Assessment of the question\nFirst, we'll need to determine the context: is this a question about specific breeds or about dog breeds in general? \nSecond, we need to determine our understanding of \"popular\". \nIf it is the former, choose the breed which fits this criterion.\nIf the latter, then choose the breed which is the most commonly owned in the US (https://www.thespruce.com/popular-dog-breeds-in-america-4786459).\nStep 2: Assessment of all choices to determine possible answers\nThe question does not limit the variety of breeds to consider. Given this consideration, first we will determine what criteria the dog must fit so that it is \"popular\" (i.e., most commonly owned). We need the breed to be in the list. The other choices are either not popular or not well known nationally (in the eyes of the asker). (Note: other than the answer, other options can be eliminated if they would be unreasonable choices for the context. For example, the pit bull is not really a popular dog because of dog fighting and the association of this breed with violence).\nStep 3: Assessment of remaining choices\nWe need to determine which dog is most commonly owned in the United States. Here, we go back to the link for most popular breeds in the US and then eliminate choices which are not on that list. (Note: sometimes there is more than one answer, this is okay because we are looking for a breed of dog in general which matches the criteria).\nFinal answer: \"popular\" is synonymous", "answer": "E: mississippi"}

Look at each choice in turn.\n2. The best interpretation of the question is that the man wanted to take a public bus, but none of the busses were accepting passengers.\n3.

{"text": "### Demostration:\nFirst consider the context of the question. The context of the question is the \"passing sentence\" of the judge that condemned the man. This suggests that the man is already convicted of some crime and he is only about to find out what his sentence will be. Given this, the correct answer is D: **death**.\n\nNow for a detailed explanation. The question clearly asks \"What condemned the man to death?\" The word condemned refers to something which is a death sentence. The options \"guilty\", \"passing sentence\", and \"jail\" are not death sentences and cannot be the correct answer. The question is referring to something within the judge's sentence, not outside of it. Therefore, option \"passing sentence\" can be eliminated. Next \"jail\" also does not refer to anything in the sentence that the judge is passing down, and furthermore it can be eliminated due to not being a death sentence and \"death\" is the correct answer. The next option is \"dead\". This can be eliminated due the fact that the man has already been convicted of a crime and therefore cannot be \"dead\" before the judge even passes his sentence. \n\n### Answer:\n### Answer Explanation:\nDeath sentence in the context of a criminal trial is defined as a verdict given by a judge sentencing the accused to execution. \nBecause of this, the only answers worth considering are \"death\" or \"dead\" which both suggest death, since they cannot exist as an outcome in a trial until one has been found guilty, meaning that their sentences have already been passed down, thereby making these sentences incongruous with the word \"sentence\". \n\n### Input:\"What do these 2 animals have in common?

Third sentence: A massage is often used to bring pleasure or relaxation.\n5. Fourth sentence: Since the last sentence reminds and relates to the last sentence, the correct answer will most likely have something to do with a vacation that brought pleasure or relaxation, specifically massage.\n6. The answer is choice E, nostalgia.\n\n### Input - Restaurant's bill of fare - It features many meats, which includes:\n1. A: pigs\n2. B: cows\n\n### Response - B\n\n### Rationale\n\n1. Bill of fare - what's served.\n2. The number of choices matches the number of answers: B.\n3. If both choices had more than one correct answer, they would have been listed first.\n4. Since the sentence states \"includes\", the right answer will be listed after what it includes.\n5. Since the right answer after \"includes\" is \"beef\", the only choice that has meats that include beef is \"B\" pigs and cows.\n6. Hence, the right answer is B, cows.\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis exercise requires two things: a sense of logic, and the ability to determine what a thing means.\n\n#### Step 1. First, examine the words.\n\nThe sentence itself indicates two choices, both of which begin with a capital letter, and both of which are common words: \u201cpigs\u201d and \u201ccows.\u201d\n\nThe sentences that follow the question wording also contain logical sequences and ideas that relate to the choices. For example, \u201cThe first choice [pigs], which is also listed last [is pork], indicates that the restaurant provides a lot of pork and pork products, including ham, bacon, spare ribs, chitterlings, and other \u2018swine\u2019 dishes.  If one of these items is listed as a lunch item on the day you make the visit, then your response would be [answer choice] B.\u201d\n\nYou'll notice how the answers to the exercises are given in the same order as they were introduced.

{"text": "B: piggybank\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice problem.\n\n### Rationale: Step 1: It is not possible to find the correct answer without knowing what a piggy bank is because of the words 'hard to get' which imply resistance through some means. This makes the option that involves resistance, namely the piggybank stand out as the correct answer. Step 2: The dollar is to be put in and a piggy bank can take money as opposed to giving out any. Since a dollar cannot come out of a piggy bank without the person breaking it, this answer is correct.\n\n**Answer: Piggy bank**\n\n### Input : What place do you start when you follow this road?\n\n### Input #1: The road goes north \n\n### Rational: Step 1: Involving a road that goes north is important as it is a major feature of the passage. \n\nStep 2: While the correct term isn't obvious given the instructions in the question. The road might be a two or three lane road, with a single lane going to the north and the other(s) to the south. This means that this road is always started at the North, and then other sections might be taken from here onwards.

Choices:  B: comb \nC: hat \nD: brush \nE: braids\nRationales:\nStep 1: Consider each answer type individually. \n\nStep 2: Comb: a comb is not typically used to hold hair. \n\nStep3: Hat: a hat is used to hold short hair. However, it must not be worn anywhere on a person's head, so it does not logically fit. Also, we can't be sure if the subject has short hair. \n\n4. Brush: a brush is used to groom, style, and control medium-length to long-length hair. However, we can't assume its length. \n\n5. Braids: braids are for longer hair, which this task is assuming subject has short hair, because the subject would not have short hair if braids were a plausible answer. \n\n6. Since brushing and braiding are not good answers, that leaves the best answer as the comb.\n\nAnswer:B: comb\n\n### Instructions:\n\nWrite a response that appropriately answers the question.\n\n\n### Input\n\nWhere is it appropriate for a person to be?\n\n### Rationales:\n\nStep 1: The first question is \"where is it appropriate for a _person_ to be?\" \u2013 we can guess the _subject_ is not a dog or pig. So the first step to narrow down the choices is to consider options where the subject is not a person, such as animals, to know that they don't fit the scenario. \n\nStep2: Consider choice A - this is a house that has multiple rooms, each room containing humans. However, choice A does not specify or explain the type of house the subject is in. If the house does not have multiple humans in it, or if the humans in those rooms are not the subject, choice A is not applicable. \n\nStep5: Going back to choice B, this contains the phrase \"housing for humans\", so it's important to understand what \"housing\" means in this instance. Humans are typically sheltered with a home, so \"housing\" is likely a metaphor for shelter, implying a place", "answer": "E: family room"}

He knows it will be a good job fit, that he has experience, but then says \u201cHe's worried.\u201d Therefore, he is afraid of the answer that he is given.\n\nStep 3: Choice A: accepting the job \u2013 Why would he \u201cworry\u201d about accepting the job? If he\u2019s accepted, then he is confident that he will get the job and does not have \u201cworry\u201d because of this fact.\n\nStep 4: Choice B: rejection \u2013 If he is rejected, then he does not necessarily have the job yet. If he is rejected then there is a chance that he could get the job, but he does \u201cworry\u201d because right now he doesn\u2019t know either way (which we will also consider in this step). The question mentions the possible outcomes of \u201caccepted\u201d and \u201crejected,\u201d which are the only choices the question is giving us. Therefore, we can eliminate choice B as insufficient and also eliminate choice C as irrelevant because \u201cworry\u201d is an internal state, not an action.\n\nStep 5: Choice D: less sleep \u2013 He mentions that he might have less sleep worrying about the job. However, we can eliminate this choice as irrelevant because we still don\u2019t know if he has been accepted or rejected.\n\nStep 6: Choice E: employment \u2013 Because the job is a good fit and the only thing left is to wait for the result, he doesn\u2019t have to worry about getting the job because he already knows that he will have it if he\u2019s accepted. For the same reason, this answer is also unnecessary and the correct one \u2013 he does not yet have employment, but he knows that if he\u2019s accepted he will have it since it will be a good, \u201cright\u201d for him, job.\n\nAnswer: E: employment", "answer": "B: rejection"}

To make one of these choices the correct choice, it must clearly relate to the answer on the question. \"To do what\" the answer refers to and can be considered as having two options. Condition means improving a body part, whereas expend means to make an effort to use a body part. Clearly, \"to condition a heart\" does not make sense, therefore, it must be a different choice.\n\n### Step 1: Consider the choices.\n\n### Answer:The choice that best fits in the context is \u201cC\u201d\n\n### Step2:Weigh, as an activity, does not involve the heart. Laughter is not a healthy way to weigh. Therefore, the heart is not being dealt with.\n\n###Step3:\nWhile stretching the body is often related to exercise, it does not specifically involve the heart. Exercise allows us to condition the heart healthily. According to Merriam-Webster, stretching is defined as \"to pull, stretch\".

While a sword collector might have a room or closet where they keep their sword collection, this could likely be called a sword room or a sword collection room.\n\nIt is more likely that if there were a sword in your house, it would be in a collection, not a \"sword closet\".\n\n**It is possible that a sword might be kept in a container called scabbard (Choice E).** However, it is more likely that the sword would be on display in such a container rather than hidden in it.\n\nSo, the correct answer is: C: collection\n\n### Response 2:\n**Sword closets or collections (Choice C).** This is the only reasonable answer that matches the context. \n\n### Instructions:What does a vehicle need to run? Choices: 1) A: spark 2) B: air 3) C: fuel 4) D: brake 5) E: oil\n\n### Response\nStep 1: The question asks which items or products a vehicle \"needs to run.\" The items that a vehicle needs for functioning and operation can be thought of in terms of four groups \u2013 spark, air, fuel, and oil - each related to a different area of the vehicle's components.\nStep 2a: Consider choice A: Spark \u2013 Spark is ignition, and although this type of electrical spark is related to vehicle's operation, a vehicle does not inherently need spark to run. Therefore, this choice can be eliminated. For clarity, spark is the electrical spark required to start and maintain the combustion reaction in car engines.\nStep 2b: Consider choice B: Air \u2013 Although air is a combustible, non-spark-type gas-fuel that is used in internal combustion engines, the air that a typical vehicle needs is the outside air that is pumped into the engine through the carburetor or fuel injection system. This is typically required to support the combustion reaction with fuel inside the engine. Thus, this choice needs to be eliminated.\nStep 2c: Consider choice C: F", "answer": "C: collection"}

We can conclude that the house in question is a garage-free residence: the'modern house' in the choices.\n \nStep 3: Here are the options provided: modern house, building, townhouse, and neighbor's house.\nStep 3 Eliminate options.\n\nStep 3.1: We already know that'modern house' will be the correct answer - but it should be kept in mind that some houses are built with garages; that's not the case presented in the question (garage is not a part of the house.) Hence, the other possible options can be eliminated.\n\nStep 4: Rationales: It has been confirmed that the garage had light sensores and an automatic door. However, the garage was not a house. Instead, it was part of the house - it is not a building and does not belong to a single individual. Therefore, it cannot be either a building or a townhouse.\n\nStep 5: Since'modern house' does not have garages (the garage is not part of the house) and it fits the context of the question in its other aspects of the garage and its function, it is correct.\n\nAnswer Choice: Modern house\n\n\n### Input : The pencils were sharpened and cut in half, what is it used for?

On a shelf with the doctor- while doctors do use medicine, they rarely would store it in a personal \"medicine cabinet\" of their own.\nStep 4. By the X-ray equipment - medicine is stored in medicine cabinets, not in rooms full of shelves or behind a doctor.\nStep 5. In the bathroom- if one were looking for medicine while in the bathroom, one wouldn't be looking for the \"medicine\", but rather for cold water or soap and other toiletries. This choice is the incorrect answer.\nStep 7.

{"text": "The response must be 99% accurate or higher, which means it should be a direct match or correct the most frequent, least common, or best error-correcting choice.\n### Rationales:For one possible answer, let's consider choice A: fire, which is the most likely since the smoke detectors went on. If there was a fire burning in John's home, it would be very difficult to both open his door as well as escape the fire. \nThis means that John would be stuck in his house as well as terrified about the fire. Therefore, the correct answer is choice A.\n\n### Input:\"It was almost an all night party,\" said Mary.  What was the party after it got stopped? Choices:  C: started before daytime B: continued after daytime,  not before A: happened at daytime E: lasted through the night\n\n### Response:\"It was a house party\" is the most likely answer. First, \"party\" is a specific term for a celebration, or a social get-together of friends or family.  If Mary did not mean this type of party, which makes up the majority of the answer choices, \"it was\u2026\" can't apply to the party.\n\n### Rational:Next, consider the other answer choices. \"Started before Day-Time\" cannot fit, as many people would say, \"it was a daytime start\" if that was what they meant.\n\n\"Continue[d] after Daytime, Not Before\" sounds like an odd phrasing as well, as Mary would usually mean, \"it continued not before daytime.\"\n\"Happened at Daytime\" is the least likely of choices because, unless the party didn\u2019t start until Daytime, Mary cannot just say that it happened, period, without specifying a time, such as the beginning, the middle and the end.\n\n\"Lasted through The Night\" sounds similar, and can be confused with, but this also doesn\u2019t mean that a party goes past dawn and doesn\u2019t include all night, which is the correct definition.\n\nAnswer:C: started before daytime", "answer": "C: winter storm"}
{"text": "The correct answer is C. \"Happen anytime\" is given as an explanation for why accidents do not always happen in the same area. D) \"happen anytime\"\n\n### Solution:\nGiven the context and the answer itself, we can eliminate choices B and D: Happen to people and happen often are unrelated to accidents, so they are eliminated. Happen anywhere explains that accidents can happen anywhere, rather than that they always happen in the same place; therefore, this choice has to be eliminated as well.\nNext, we evaluate each choice independently. A: \"Happen to people\" is not an explanation - it is an answer. B: \"Hurt people\" does not necessarily explain why there are more accidents in a specific area, so it is therefore eliminated. Therefore, the correct answer is C: \"happen anytime\".\n\n### Response1:\nThe correct answer choice is A. Step 1: Identify the correct part of speech between each set according by examining the verb endings and whether there is any syntactic difference between the two. \nStep 2: Examine the correct part of speech for each side in the set, and match it with the same type that fits with the answer. \nStep 3: Determine if the type is an appropriate part of speech or not. In the case of \"anywhere in the world,\" it is not a correct part of speech but \"in the middle of summer\" is correct and acceptable. \nStep 5: Apply the rule in Steps 4 and 5 until the answer is determined.

While it is possible for prostitutes to work in areas like New York City, they are not necessarily \"professional\"\nWhile choice B: whorehouse is not the correct answer for the same reason, choice C: street corner is the only choice that could be a location where prostitutes are likely to be found.

Being paid is a benefit and a good reason to be working with wood, regardless of how hard the work is, and regardless of who is taking home your payment. This is choice C: being paid. That is why woodworkers are paid, and that's a good way to avoid frustration of being paid.\n3. Being a woodworker is an inherent form of skill and talent, and it is a source of joy.

The remaining choices are therefore D: music studio or E: music store: the question didn't specifically mention other options that could be available, so they are plausible.

Telephone booths aren't particularly famous or common outside of the New England region of The United States. That being said, airports are not the right answer.\n\nB:Gotham City is a fictional place, thus is a bad answer.\n\nC:London is not a place where a telephone booth would be red. The name 'London' is an attestation for 'lond' or 'lon' which means 'city' in English, so it is not a place on Earth. Additionally, London is not the right answer.  \n\nD:City is the right answer, as 'City' usually indicates a large populated area which can mean anything from a location within the United Kingdom like London to a town in the United States or Canada.\n\nE:Gas Stations don't seem to be a place where telephone booths are red, let alone a place we can get a present on Christmas day.

So off to boarding school she went.  She made great friends there, and they became extremely close.  \n\n### Response\n\nWhich of the following would be an accurate description of Sally's parents?\n\nSelect all that apply. \n\n\n#### Choice A: They thought they were preparing her for the challenges she'd face later in life by sending her away to boarding school.\n#### Choice B: They realized that Sally was not an individual who would be able to handle a college education.\n#### Choice C: They believed that private school was more expensive than private boarding school.\n**Detailed Answer:** We know, from the information above, that Sally\u2019s parents did actually send her off to boarding school.  There is no evidence that her parents felt she couldn\u2019t handle a college education.  We know, because the parents sent her to boarding school, that they understood she could handle a college education. In Choice A, we know that the parents \u201cthought,\u201d (present tense) that this description would be the case.  We don\u2019t know if they actually believed it or not.  Choice B does not have enough information. It\u2019s possible, because they sent her to boarding schools, that they felt she could handle a college level education, but the parents were more concerned about the schooling environment.  Choice C refers to colleges being more expensive than private schools, and we can rule it out because the school that Sally wound up at was not a college.  So her parents were only concerned about cost or, alternatively, they wanted to avoid the expense of Sally attending college.  The correct choice is Choice B.  Sally's parents did not believe that she was not an individual who could handle an education in a typical college.  They sent her away for boarding school instead.\n\n#### Solution:", "answer": "D: republican party"}

This indicates that many people could be eating or consuming some kind of food. We are then asked about a \"popular food.\" This indicates that the food is something many people like. We know that there are many things that can be popular if they are widely liked, especially in the context of food. \nWe then see a list of different options to choose from. While it is not explicitly said that the food needs to be popular because many people like it, the question specifically asks about something \"popular,\" which implies that the number of people who like it is a reason it is \"popular.\"\nP", "answer": "C: brother's house"}

{"text": "The answer: \nC:  Library.\n\n### Rationales:\n### Step 1: Analyze the question and its context.  Consider the types of places where a desk may be occupied by a young person.  Identify what is being implied but not stated in the question - a desk normally occupied.  Also, consider the question in terms of the age range of the desk occupant.  \n### Step 2: Review the choices according to their relevance to the question.  Look for a choice that fits the context and is relevant to the question.  In this case, the context of the question implies a workplace, and a typical workplace desk would be found in an office building. Although a desk could also be found in other places, such as a schoolroom or a bedroom, the context of the scenario and the intended age range of the occupant are implied to be a school age to early working age, in which case a desk in those locations wouldn't necessarily be normally occupied.  This eliminates choice B: schoolroom and choice E: gymnasium.  Choice A: office building would also not be normally occupied - it would normally be used by the person, and that isn't being implied in the question.  Choice C: library also would not be normally occupied by the person, unless it was a desk with books available in which case the library would require a different set of choices to account for the age range of occupants.

Choices: A: after three years of practice B: if a child can play C: the person can play with ease D: if the person can read the score  E: when someone plays a song \n\n### Response :\n1. The task as stated is \"When would someone be very talented at playing [a musical instrument]?\"\n2. Choice E is not the correct answer as it does not answer the question. It only gives a way of playing a musical instrument.\n3. Choice D is not the correct answer because playing with ease is not the same as playing very talented. There are many people who are able to play the music well, but the music does not give them a lot of effort.\n4. Choice B is not the correct answer, because the child can play might also be a child who is talented at the music, but only the child can play the music.\n5. Choice A is not the correct answer either as after three years a person can be very talented, but the person also may be able to play.\n6.

For example, if the question asks \u201cwhat type of meat is used in a salad,\u201d you could provide the response \u201cA: meat. The correct answer is A: meat because although other types of food, such as fruit or fish can be included in a salad, the main ingredient is always meat. The correct answer to the question \"What is the oldest heat source of Earth?\" is \"C: sun. The question asks  \"Dan outfitted his home to run on heat from the only heat source, fire, sun or house...\" Fire and house are not a heat source. Only sun is a heat source. Therefore the correct answer is \"C: sun.\" The reason for that is fire isn't necessarily a heat source. A heat source is something that generates heat and the heat has to always be produced by the source. Fire isn't always a heat source. It can be burning wood and that makes it a heat source if the wood continues to burn and therefore produces heat. But if there is no wood, there is no fire and therefore no heat is generated.

{"text": "The correct answer is E: lend money, and the following is the reasoning. The sentence refers to a specific relationship between two people. The action specified - \"do something to hurt someone else\" - is in direct relation to this relationship. The sentence then asks, \"If a person does something...\" to this specified action, \"...they might do what\". In other words, it asks, \"What else might happen besides saying 'I'm sorry' or 'I trust God'?\" Looking at the choices, it states that the person might \"feel sorry\" or \"trust God\". These are both reasonable responses to hurt from another person. However, they are not the exclusive potentials. They might also make no response or use less formal words. Hence, the word \"might\" is key here - this might happen, but it might also mean anything else.\nThinking more broadly, it follows that the other action, apart from apologizing, trusting God, feeling sorry, and using formal language is lending money. This might also be something a person might do to someone they have hurt. Hence, this should be the correct answer. While the other options sound reasonable too, the sentence does not specify whether the other party has hurt this person. It then follows that this relationship is not the same as a parent-child relationship, friend relationship, etc. where an apology is more likely to sound natural.\n\nAnswer: E: lend money", "answer": "A: feel sorry"}

{"text": "D: \"Confessing to committing murder\" is the incorrect meaning of this question. It should be \"confess to a murder\", i.e. admit guilt in the court of law. Confessing to \"committing murder\" means to show guilt, which is only a small part of the process.\n\nA: The meaning of the question seems to be \"guilty conscience\". However, guilt and conscience are not interchangeable, and a guilty conscience alone would not make someone confess to commuting a murder (it's not even proof that someone had committed one). Furthermore, \"guilty conscience\" is just \"guilt\" with the adjective \"guilty\" in front of it - two such nouns together do not make proper sense, which makes this an incorrect choice.\n\nRationales: The choice is a bit tricky, but not quite as confusing as one might think. The question asks why someone would 'confess' to murder, with confess being the key word, so the choices are limited to things relating to the confession.\n\nFrom a literal perspective, it is possible to confess to a crime in order to obtain a reduced sentence, freeing oneself from guilt. However, confessing to a crime in order for one to 'find god' is absurd, so this option is clearly wrong. The other choices all make sense, albeit one more than the others.\n\nIt is sometimes possible to confess to the commission of a crime in order to avoid serving jail time (i.e be spared serving time, or be released from it) or due to a guilty conscience. However, this question is most likely asking about the need to confess in order for a person to absolve themselves of legal responsibility for committing the crime.\n\nBecause of this need, the logical option for a person to confess to the act of committing a crime would be in an organized ceremony which involves a witness from the community, the testimony of which would be provided to the court and, if the evidence is sufficient, a judge, as well as the testimony from any witnesses of the crime, in order to absolve some amount of legal culpability. The legal procedure to achieve this varies between different societal and cultural practices. However, it is not the confessor's confession to the court which is the focus of our question, and we", "answer": "A: guilty conscience"}

Step 3: To narrow down to the one true answer, evaluate and eliminate non-relevant and non-logical options. \n    * C: Accelerate \u2013 an accelerator is a device that controls acceleration, not a throttle, which is a device that controls fuel control rate. Therefore, this choice cannot be the correct answer.\n    * E: Airplane \u2013 While foot pedals do control the steering in an airplane, it's unlikely that pedals could be used to control an accelerator. Furthermore, as mentioned above, this is a fuel control throttle and not an accelerator.\n    * B: Fuel System \u2013 The foot pedals control the steering of a boat, just as pedals control the steer of an airplane. Hence, pedals control the steerer. Even though fuel control devices are operated by hand, fuel control can be made by foot as well. Therefore, this choice not only does not have the right control type but also does not have the right vehicle type.\n    * A: Car \u2013 Similarly, pedals do not control the car acceleration in a car.

Then, look at the following answers and determine which one is correct.\n\n3. Answer: Choice A; the country's currency is called the ____.\n\n### Rationales:\n\n#### First: Look at the instructions below. The question asks for something with the last name of rice.\n1. The first three letters of the word _rice_ don't suggest anything related to currencies. Thus, Option A is correct because it mentions _rice_ is related to a currency called _dollar_.\n\n#### Second: Look at the answers below. Choice A states that the country's currency's called the ____. The word _is called_ is the verb _is_ and it is used when you say that something 'IS' something else. So, it's accurate the term used in 'is called'.\n\n#### Third: Consider the word choice B: The country's currency is _called the rupee_. According to the information provided above, the name of the country should be capitalized. Thus, there is nothing related to the name of the country so it is the opposite of the correct answer.\n\n#### Fourth: Consider choice C: The country's currencies are _dollar_ and _yen_. The plurals of the answer are not used in the question, which is _is_ or _is called_. Also, _dollar_ and/or _yen_ don't represent the same as _rupee_.\n\n### English - Quiz 7\n\n### Rationale:\nStep 1: The question is asking to choose an answer by using information given in an image.\n\nStep 2: The information provided in the image does not allow for any option except Option A, which is a book written by one of the options present on the image.", "answer": "B: subdivision"}

However, only headache can be caused by sitting too close.\n\n### Input:\"How much alcohol should be mixed with orange juice?\".\n\n#### Response:\nThe appropriate response depends entirely on the context and the person making the statement.\nAs a general rule, orange juice should be diluted with alcohol according to the flavor desired. A more traditional ratio is 3:1 or 4:1, which is equivalent to 75ml and 60ml of orange juice mixed with 25ml and 15ml of alcohol, respectively. The amount of alcohol added should never exceed 50% if the goal is to serve a drink that is acceptable to consume. It is important to choose a high-flavored brand of orange juice and to include enough ice for the final product to appear clean. The dilution ratio may be even higher with low-alcohol juices.\n\n#### Input:\"The best way to avoid germs on a plane is to avoid what?\"\n\n-A. Drink water\n-B. Shaking hands\n-C. Travel alone/With children\n-D. Showering too often\n-E.

{"text": "Answer choices (c) synagogue (C) and (d) confession (D). In this choice there are two places that might be where \"religious people\" might be sitting in a chair listening to religious \"speech\".\n\n### Rationale:\n1. (a) auditorium (A) is the location that would have the most people seated in chairs, listening to a religious \"speech\". However, the \"speech\" being given would need to be religious for this choice (A) to be correct. Auditoriums are popular venues for many types of religious services including the services held in churches (E) and synagogues (C).\n2. (b) office (B) could have a few people sitting in chairs, waiting to be called in to talk to an authority figure. A place like this may have a religious leader meeting with one of their congregants, but since it is unlikely that all conversations at the office would be religious conversations, this choice (B) is not the correct answer because the speech is not expected to be religious. (This also applies to choices (e) and (f) where, although the choices could apply to a religious discussion, they are too narrowly scoped to indicate that the religious speech would be something other than the norm.)\n3. (c) synagogues (C) and (e) church (E) are both places where people might sit in a big room listening to a religious speech being given. However, synagogue (C), because it is a house of worship, is religious by definition. Therefore, (C) and (E) are the correct answers.\n4. (d) confession(D) does sound like it could have some religious connotation but, as can be inferred from the word \"confession\", the speech here is being directed to a single person, who may then have a religious discussion with the priest. However, this would not need to be a religious speech since the discussion might be in a non-religious direction. In other words, you might want to confess that you broke a window to the confessional priest, even if said window was broken because you had stepped on the cat that belonged to the neighbor that lived next door to you. Confession (D) can be an answer, but it's only relevant if the person who is listening has already admitted guilt towards some mis", "answer": "C: synagogue"}

Therefore, if travelling in the city, the choice D: Taking relaxation is more common, because it only requires moving in and moving out of a city. Therefore, it's the correct answer.\nC: Strolling around in the area - the same idea as A and B. There are many other things that we could be doing if we were strolling in the city.

The other options are all possible answers, but, unfortunately, there is no choice that is both required and has not been eliminated.\nStep 3, 4, 5: In order to find the right choice, we need to determine which choice does apply to both requirements.

However, that statement does not match the actual data. There is the possibility that getting paid can make people happy and other options can make people happy as well (like other kinds of money).

(3) Only two of the above choices fit the description.\n(4) Hardware and furniture stores typically require buyers to purchase large quantities of products at once while A pet store (Choice B) and a specialty store (Choice D) would typically offer smaller, more niche products.

{"text": "Step 1: Assess what you know, they were on their flight to paradise. This means they are flying to a warm location, that has pretty weather.\nStep 2. Eliminate the choices that are not suitable for the situation. For example, the choices 'be happy', 'change quickly', and'surprise us' are not helpful for the situation, and 'check the weather one more time' does not make much sense.\nStep 3. This leaves us with the choice 'look beautiful', but if paradise is warm enough, surely the weather will be hot and beautiful regardless, and thus 'look beautiful' doesn't really make sense with the scenario.\nStep 4. We now know what we know, and we know what we don't know. Therefore, we do not know what we are looking for in the scenario, other than it should be something that has something to do with weather as it relates to paradise.\nStep 5. This leaves us with 'occur here' as the choice. When the scenario says they are \"on their flight to paradise\" it means that there is some aspect of weather that is going to be occurring at paradise. In other words, you were on your way to paradise, which would not be the case if, upon arriving, the weather there was the opposite of hot and perfect.\n\nAnswer: A: Occur here\n\n### Instructions:\nWrite a response that appropriately answers the following question.\n\n## Instructions:\nWhat is the difference between the following set of statements, each having its own distinct meaning on the subject?

Choices:  Choice A B or C\nRationales: Consider how cakes change in their height as you bake them. \n\nThe height of a cake will always change as you bake it, and it will change in length or diameter. Since the question only asks about height, the most logical option is to reduce the height of the cake to match the correct choice. \n\nStep 1: Consider each of the choices one by one.\n\nStep 2: Choice A: cakes don\u2019t grow wider as you bake them, hence, this choice isn\u2019t the correct answer.\n\nStep 3: Choice B: Cakes may get taller and flatter at the same time, but in most cases, the cake becomes flatter. So this choice is incorrect.\n\nStep 4: Choice C: The height of cakes increases as the cake bakes.\nAnswer: Choice C\n\n## Instruction:\n\nInput: What's the most similar in color to yellow? Choices:  Yellow Yellow light orange Red violet blue green \nRationales\nStep 1: Choose one of the choices and find its name using a search engine.\nStep 2. If the search engine finds the color in the chosen choice then that choice will be eliminated. You can either look up the name of the color or just look up the color name in the image section.\nStep 3. You may choose to go to the next question if you feel like you already got the answer.\nStep 1: In this example, you find the name of the color blue.\n\nStep 1.1: Blue is not listed in the choices so this choice will be the answer.\n\nStep1:2: Choice Yellow \u2013 Yellow is a color that is used for painting or decoration.

It can not be found on the grass, where some animals live.\n\n### Lemons are found on land or in the water. They can not be found in heaven, which is up in the sky.\n\n### The answer to this question is the leopard. If you are trying to find a lemur, you need to go to a place where lemons are. A lemon is on a tree or on the ground. You could find it in a tree, a hole in the ground, or in some grass. You could also find it in a hole.\n\nThis is not an answer, therefore we are still looking for a better answer.\n\n### Rewriting rules:\n\n### If you were looking for a leopard (not the leopard), where would you find it?.\n- The response should say to find it in the tree or on the ground; in the grass or under the branches of the tree. So, I would rewrite this question as, where would you find the leopard?. But the leopard is not looking for the lemur. The leopard does not need the lemur. So you can only find a lemur in a hole.\n- If you were looking for the lemon (not the lemonade), where would you find him? I would say you would find him in heaven or in the ground under the tree.\n\n### Examples:\n\n### A lemon is on top of a tree or on the bottom. It can\u2019t be in the sky. So, it can be found in a tree, on the ground that has mushrooms in it, or in a hole in the ground.", "answer": "D: field"}

{"text": "### Step 1: Understand and summarize Question: How is someone who loves TV likely to feel about thier remote.\n### Step 2: Eliminate unsuitable choices\n1. An attached feeling means that the person feels a longtime bond and attachment, which is not typically how someone behaves towards a remote control.\n2. The nostalgic feeling is feeling fondly and happily about someone or something from the past. This is definitely not what a person is expected to feel about a remote that they are using right now. Nostalgia is about looking back, not thinking about the present.\n3. The companionable feeling is the term used for someone who is friendly and good company. This is not an expected feeling from someone towards their remote control which is just an everyday item of technology that they use on a daily basis.\n4. The feeling that is expected for someone is either the close feel or likely feel.  \n\n### Step #3: Assess possible responses to the question and choose the best\n1. 'Close' means 'in touch or having a special relationship or connection with someone' or perhaps even in physical closeness to someone or having a long history with that one person. (https://www.thesaurus.com/browse/close)\n2. 'Close' might also mean to be near in time or space. (https://www1.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/close)\n3. 'Close' is also similar to the word 'Intimate' which means 'to be familiar with and trusting in someone.' (https://www.merriam-Webster.com/thesuarus/intimate)\n4. Because of all of these meanings the word 'close' does not seem like the appropriate word to associate with a tv remote control.\n5. Because of this 'Likely' would be the best alternative choice\n\nAnswer: Likely as the person is likely to feel emotionally close with the tv remote because of it being a companionable tool that helps them in their daily routine.", "answer": "A: attached"}

{"text": "Answer: D: teachers\nRationales: Consider each choice one at a time.\nStep1: Option A: boredom. Boredom is not the same thing as patience and time. Boredom is a lack of interest where you do not care at all for what you are attending school for. Patience and time are required to attend school, but they are not the actual instructors that teach the children. Hence, this choice cannot be the correct answer choice.\nStep2: Option B: patience. Patience can be thought of as the ability to deal with a situation that frustrates you. This kind of patience would be important in a person being an effective instructor. Hence, this choice too might help children to learn something, but it is not the correct choice.\nStep3: Option C: time. Time is defined as a quantity of duration or duration measured, or how long something lasts. While time can be an important factor in a person being helpful, it is not the same thing; it won't tell the children what to do (e.g. learn a word from the text) and it won't do something while sitting right next to the child and assisting. Even if time was an instructor (which it isn't), its hours are not great amounts. Hence, this cannot be the correct choice.\n\nStep4: Option D: teachers. In the context of schools, teachers are the most important factor to determine whether children are being taught properly or not, and there are many aspects to being an instructor that must be demonstrated, such as having knowledge, being good at explaining things, caring about one's students and other traits. While teachers are needed in large quantities to instruct the students in a system, they, by many measures, are the most important factors within the definition of an instructed system. Hence, \"great\" means the right number of teachers in this context. Finally, with teachers being the most prominent, correct, choice, option E: inspiration wouldn't fit with it, because inspiration is not a proper instructor. Hence, it cannot be the correct answer.\n\nSummary: An instructor is, in most cases, the person that teaches the pupils or students something and is qualified to do so. Being an instructor and being an inspiration (option E) are not the same; having teachers (option D) is essential for an", "answer": "B: patience"}

{"text": "C: preschool\n\n### Instructions:\nWrite a response that appropriately supports the answer.\n\n### Rationales:\nStep 1: The question is about a child whose playroom was massive, presumably at a younger age, hence, as a rule, a child in a large living space is usually associated with a preschool, and even more specifically, with a nursery school or a preschool. There can be a larger building that has multiple nursery schools/preschools, with one being named as the child's playroom, but the entire building is not the \"spoiled child's playground\" (the correct answer). A building is not associated with playrooms any more than are houses or retirement homes. Houses do not have playrooms (unless you consider a basement as your child's playroom) and while retirement homes might be child-friendly places, their residents are typically elderly people, not small children.\nStep 2:- Only among the given choices in which the child's playground (that the question is about) is a room of nursery school/preschool - as a rule - it is a rule that young (e.g., smaller) children attend preschool in order to get an early education. This is where their playroom is. The question does not require the child to have gone to school yet. Hence, as a rule, the nursery school (where the child should attend school in the later years) is the correct choice - as a rule, that is, and not for the case specific to the child at hand.\nStep 3:- A: big house is not a possible answer - a child's playroom should be within a small space, not a large space.\nStep 4:- E: retirement home is not a possible answer because even if one were to be a retiree, it is unlikely to have a playroom in the home, not because one is a retiree but that homes are not commonly associated with playrooms. In conclusion, the correct answer is C: preschool.\nAnswer: C: preschools\n\n### Input:[100] What does the word \"pig\" not belong in this set of groups?

Also, the oven is a place where turkeys are cooked and it's more likely that the house would already have an oven. \nStep 7: Finally, the turkey is bought at a store, and thus you would need to buy a turkey in the store that you would then need to bring home to consume, but you would need an oven to cook the turkey in.

You know the number of letters in the second sentence, so you need to use any of the previous sentence to come up with the number.\n\n### Second Request:\nInput: How is the mail delivered to the town? Choices:\nA. In the late morning when the post office closes.\nB. When the mail carrier leaves on a trip.\nC. Monday through Saturday.\nD.

{"text": "Input: A: desire B:spending money C:money D: needs E:time Choices:  A choice is spending money  B choice is money  C choice is money  D choice is needs  E choice is time\nRationales: Consider choices A: spending money; B: money; C: money; and D: needs. These are related to spending in one way or another.\nConsider choice E: time. It's related to spending money, but doesn't explicitly depend on money to be able to spend; therefore, it is not a good choice.\n\nConsider choice A: desire. It's not about buying products, and it's more of a feeling rather than a need to spend money.\n\nConsider choices B, C, and D. This is the crucial step to answering the question where you can eliminate unnecessary choices (including the most obvious incorrect answers) which helps increase the odds of choosing the correct answer and saves precious time. For this particular question, however, it's not hard to eliminate unsuitable options since you'll easily be able to tell which of the choices are similar in some way.\n\nNow that the irrelevant and unsuitable options are eliminated, we must determine which of the remaining choices, if any, fits better than the rest. This is the part where you have to use your reasoning skills to pick out any differences between the options. One way to do this is to start reading the remaining options sequentially and take note of which of the options matches with each choice in some way. You may also want to write each remaining option and any differences you notice separately to help with determining your answer after evaluating the options and rereading them.\n\nWe start with option A: spending money. It's related only to B, C, and A itself, which is not a good answer. So that's out. Next is money: it's related only to money: option C which is not the correct answer either.\n\nNow for a crucial comparison: the need for money to be able to buy things is not important for determining whether your answer is correct, but how money is related to time is what ultimately determines if you're choosing the correct answer.\nConsider all of the options, and compare them.\nFirst, the only way to do something, in general, requires money.", "answer": "C: money"}

Hence, a factory, a supermarket, a garage, and a garden aren\u2019t the correct places.\nStep 2. Evaluate only the options that are related to the place where the container is common and large, one where hundreds of them exist in similar shape/size and for a similar purpose, that is, a warehouse: Option A, B, D and E are correct.\nStep 3. We can eliminate options D and E because a warehouse is a place where things are kept and they are not in particular rows; and option B is incorrect because a factory is not a place where large containers of products are kept.\nStep 4.

The word has been in use for as long as is as long as it has used. The meaning is that it exists as long as it has ever been in use, or has as long as it has, and as long as it has existed, it has been in use. Hence, the correct options are that option A is correct while option B is incorrect.\nStep 7-8. The word in use suggests for a particular purpose, such as a job, a role, a task etc. Hence, option C, which suggests it is used without for a particular purpose, is incorrect. Option D, which suggests it is for particular purpose in general, is incorrect. Option E, which suggests it is no longer in use, can\u2019t be correct because option F suggests has long, which implies it has existed for a long time.\nStep 9- 11.

{"text": "### Answer Choice:\n\n### Supporting information:\n\n### Rationale\n\nThe word _tiny_ is used because it conveys the idea of something very small. One of the ways to use the word _tiny_ is when you are trying to compare the size of two objects of same nature such that one of them is bigger and other is smaller. In such case we look for a word which conveys the idea the \u201cbigger is bigger\u201d (the word \u2018larger\u2019) and the \u201csmaller is smaller\u201d (the word \u2019smaller\u201d). There are some words that can be used to modify the scale at which two words differ and are called \u2018adjectival\u2019 or \u2018qualitative\u2019 words. The important words of this type that can be used to describe the relative scale of something are: _larger, smaller, bigger, stronger, weaker, deeper, deeper, darker, lighter_, _clearer. The words farmland, city, property or subdivisions can be described as larger than tiny but they all cannot be used interchangeably with the same adjective. Therefore, the correct answer is _larger or _bigger_.\n\n### Reference Links\n\n* https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/larger\n* https://www3.mhhe.com/sites/9780135093898/index.html\n* https://www1.vocabulary.com/word/larger\n* http://www.dictionary.com/browse/larger\n* www.lifespanlearning.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Adjektive-englisch-mit-Erkl\u00e4rung.pdf", "answer": "C: city"}

{"text": "A dancing party\n\n### Input and Answer:If they were celebrate the occasion, how could it be described?\n\n### Rationales: 1: Choices A: drinking, C: dancing, and D: happiness, are incorrect because these cannot describe the situation: an occasion which is not currently being marked is described as one which is currently being marked.\n\n\n2. Choice E: enjoyment, is incorrect because enjoyment can only describe a current situation, such as \"I am enjoying a sunny day\".\n\n\n3.

{"text": "#### The most appropriate answer is Answer choice D: *injuries*.\n\nWhile playing sports, both athletes and professionals are exposed to the possibility of injury.

The other two outcomes are more reasonable - if one falls from a mountain, he or she would be dead or possibly injured (depending on how tall the mountain is, the time the person fell, etc.). Hence, choice D is more appropriate than C, which seems out of place and would not be experienced by someone who falls from a mountain.\n**Step 5:** Choice E (die/explode) is also not the answer. The more likely outcome, when one falls from a mountain (or any cliff of a certain height), is death. The chances of exploding from this type of fall is not probable enough to choose it as an answer. Hence, the correct answer is C; when someone falls from a mountain he or she will die.\n\n### Choices:\n1. A: (too many), inappropriate, eliminated.\n2.

{"text": "A: unfeeling\n\n### Why:\nReason 1: We can eliminate 2 choices at the start of the task without reading the question. We know \"antipathy\" is not an acceptable term in this context. Now, to get \"indifferent\" from the remaining 4, let's read what it means in context: \n\nAn indifferent person is [not] concerned about you and will not help you if you are having problems or difficulties.\n\nWe can see that this is a feeling, a \"person\" is feeling indifferent, not the person you don't care about, who is \"having problems or difficulties\", being indifferent.\n\nWe can also eliminate \"negligence\" as it sounds a bit harsh. There isn't a reason to use it in this kind of situation.\n\nNow, we are left with two choices that seem relevant and appropriate, but, as an example, can we distinguish between these two choices?\n\n### Demand:\nThe task can be demanding if a candidate can:\n1. Eliminate 2 choices without reading the question\n2. Apply context to eliminate another choice in reasoning\n3. Reason and recognize the fact that indifference can be an emotional response and cannot be used appropriately by itself.\n4. Make distinction that one can feel a negative feeling towards another, but the other is not necessarily experiencing any negativity\n\n\n### Answer:\nWhen a person feels antipathy towards someone, they don't like that person. Antipathy can mean hate. \nThe person can still be indifferent to someone even though they hate them.\nTherefore, they can feel antipathy towards a person and simultaneously be indifferent to the same person.\n\n### But why not use rapport?\nRapport can mean that a relationship where there is good understanding and communication between two people. Therefore, it's unsuitable.\n\n### You can use the answer to practice.

{"text": "#### A) auditioning\n\nIf a person is auditioning someone else, it means that they are looking for someone to perform a piece of music on a guitar. In order to be an auditionee, the person must have some musical talent, even if it is somewhat limited. For example, a person who has recently purchased a new guitar might go into a local music shop and request to try it out. The shop attendant would then hand over the guitar, and the customer would try playing it, probably for no more than between five and ten minutes. If the customer wishes to use the guitar for more than 15 minutes, then they would likely need to pay for it.\n\n#### B) hear sounds\n\nIf a person hears sounds, it means that they heard something that had happened or was about to happen around them, but did not necessarily see anything. For example, suppose someone was walking down the street and got the feeling that they were being followed. They might look up and notice a figure walking very quickly some distance away from them. This figure seemed to be getting closer, but the person could not actually see it, so they heard its sounds as it moved closer towards them.\n\n#### C) listening to music\n\nIf a person listens to music, it means that they will hear sounds coming from an instrument that is making music. For example, suppose there was a concert held at a large stadium with thousands of people attending. At some point during the performance, a person might enter one of the many aisles where many of these concertgoers were seated or standing. During this time, they would hear many different kinds of music coming from nearby people's radios, CD players, mobile phones, portable speakers, etc. However, these devices were either turned off or being used in silent mode. Therefore, only the sounds made by the instruments in each of these players were heard.\n\n#### D) making music\n\nIf a piece of music is made, it means that it was recorded or otherwise created by a person who was not simply an audience member. An example would be a musician who plays guitar, drums, keyboard instrument, or another type of instrument that can make music. The musician then records the sounds created by this instrument onto something such as a recording device or into some type of format like MP3. Later, these sounds become available to be heard either in person or online for free.", "answer": "C: listening to music"}

In fact, the choice of place to connect is irrelevant, and all place names in the choices are irrelevant. This question is really not about place names at all. \n\nThe second undesirable expression is \u201cgo\u201d \u2013 go where?

To demonstrate this, try picturing all of this in your mind: a connection could be made from an electrical circuit to a wall. This makes sense and seems intuitive. The choice of place is irrelevant and there is no connection to another place. \n\nMoreover, when it comes from \u201cwires\u201d to \u201cwall\u201d to \u201ca place\u201d, it doesn\u2019t make quite as much sense because we\u2019re skipping a wall. It is, however, possible to connect from \u201cwiring\u201d to \u201ca wall\u201d, and this is a choice in the question. \n\nFurthermore, the expression \"go to\" was used in the question - a better expression is \"to connect to\". The expression \"go to\" implies movement - movement that may or may not actually happen. \n\nFor all of these reasons, the correct answer is \"connect from \u2018wire\u2019 to a \u2018wall\u2019 to \u2018a place\u2019.\" \n\n### Input :\n\nWhat are two ways food can be cut by a knife?

Additionally, a train station is the most likely place to be using a shopping bag if you're going to a location like an airport, since you would probably use the train to get there.\n\nAnswer: D: shopping mall", "answer": "D: shopping malls"}

{"text": "Ask the person \"what just happened\" or \"what time is it\".\n\n### Rationales:\nStep 1. Consider each choice one by step 1: Consider each option.\nStep 2. Consider choice A: drink tea. A person can drink tea for any number of reasons. If he or she wakes up, his or her usual morning routine may include drinking tea for the pleasure of drinking it, for the caffeine boost, or to warm up. This answer could be a reasonable response to the question in a broad sense, but it does not provide the requested details about what the person will do next.\nStep 3. Consider choice B: thank god. This is an acceptable option, as it is a perfectly relevant response, but it does not answer the question.\nStep 4. Consider Choice C: open eyes. If a person did previously wake up, this is likely a reasonable thing for them to do the next. However, if you wanted to make this person's answer even more specific and accurate, it would be better if he or she first thought about what happened next or what time that it was. Even though this seems logical, it would cause the person to say \"open eyes\" twice.\nStep 5. Consider choice D: feel angry. While it is understandable that a person could be angry upon waking up, it is not a response to the question that would be as specific and appropriate as the others.\nStep 6.

However, in step 2, it's important to eliminate any of those choices that are logically unable to do so. Since a cafe sells coffee and other beverages, a cafe cannot be a place to buy groceries.  Similarly, a hardware store sells tools and equipment, so it can't be a place where someone buys groceries.  Books can't be bought at a hardware store, so a bookstore cannot be a place one would buy groceries. A post office could theoretically sell groceries but rarely does. A restaurant has many uses other than grocery sale. This leaves us with a store as the only left choice, which is the correct choice.", "answer": "D: train station"}

It can \"bite\" you (choice C), or it can not bite at all (choice E); likewise, it could \"feel pain\" (choice E) or it could stay alive (choice D).\n\n### Step 1: Look at the different options, and eliminate the unnecessary and/or incorrect ones so as to narrow the list of options: \nStep 2:  In choice A: \"Lie down\", the wild animal is already lying down. Therefore, choice A is not relevant and can be eliminated.\nStep 3  : Choice B: \"Run away\"- this isn't really possible in the context of the question and therefore can be eliminated. There's really no point in touching wild animals from a \"safety\" or \"risk\" perspective, because they can already run away if they wanted to.\nStep 4 : Similarly, in choice C: \"Bite\", there is no point in touching the animal because if the animal didn\u2019t want to take any physical contact (as is the case for choice E), its response will have nothing to do with you touching the animal. \nStep 5 : In choice D: \"Keep alive\", the wild animal is only \"keeping alive\" from the moment it is touched. Keeping alive is actually an activity which could take place for some time (for example, if you keep a pet alive), so this choice is not true for the moment of this question. The wild animal can \u201ckeep alive\u201d (or not, given choice E) because you touch it, but the choice is not relevant for the current context.\nStep 6 : In choice E: \"Feel pain\", the only way for an animal to feel pain is to actually touch it, which is what the question is asking.

{"text": "A: garbage can\n\n### Explanations:\nStep 1: To know that this question is about what this woman is heading with her \"drawstring bag\" and that this bag was the only baggage she checked, one should read the entire question.\n\nStep 2: Going through the first and only choice - B: military - you may notice that the choice itself is talking about a military person and not a non-military person. Hence, this may not be the correct choice.\n\nStep 3: Likewise for the next two choices - C: jewelery store and D: safe - both of them refer to where people go to buy jewellery and secure valuables. The correct answer is not a jewellary store or a safe, but it might be the garbage can where she checked in her only checked baggage.\n\nStep 4: However, while the garbage can or its contents is not mentioned anywhere in the question or its choices, one could make an inference in favor of it:\nShe has nothing to hide, and that there would be no reason to use a military-oriented term and jewellery-related words. Hence, she doesn't seem to be either a person from the military or a person who buys/sells jewellery but a person carrying garbage to the garbage bin/can.\n\nStep 5: One may argue by providing a counter-example for each inference step (by pointing out places where garbage cans aren't found, for example): garbage cans might not be present where the question is asked, it might not be a military question or a jewellery-buying/selling question. These counter-examples can be considered, but one might argue that the context of the question suggests that this case is not the garbage can.\n\nStep 6: We can now eliminate C: jewellary store and D: safe as well as other possible choices. As she had checked in the only bag she had that's referred to in the question, and there's no mention of any further baggage, she didn't have a jewellery store-worthy amount of valuables or was using a jewellery bag, but was instead carrying garbage for the garbage can/bin.

In addition to the answer shown above, provide a brief justification for your answers in Part B. If your answer to a given question is not given above, choose 0 for your choice and write your explanation for that answer.\n\n### Part B:\n- In Part B, you must provide a rationale to support your choice. A rationale is an explanation that describes why your answer is correct. Your rationale must explain why your choice is the correct answer for a given question and why the other choices are incorrect. When you write your rationale, you must consider the context of the question, the choices provided, and the logical reason one answer is more correct than the others.\n- When you write a rationale, you must support your answer with reasoning. Therefore, you must use facts or reasoned analyses from what you have learned or experiences you have had that demonstrate, justify, or explain your choice. For example, if you choose one choice over the other because it is more appropriate, the rationale you provide to explain your choice should include a logical reason why it is more appropriate. For example, you might choose option C instead of option A because you recognize that they are not the same word (and therefore they have a different meaning), or you choose D instead of B because you believe that it correctly describes the task of the question. Avoid giving just the dictionary definition in your rationale. Your rationale should demonstrate that you have an understanding and apply correct reasoning in a logical, analytical argument.\n- Although you can use the dictionary to determine the correct definition of a word, it is not an appropriate resource when it comes to writing a justification. If you use a dictionary definition as support, your response will be considered inadequate.\n- Be sure to follow the instructions in Part B to develop the rationale.\n\n### Rationale Instructions:\n- In Part A, you provided a rationale.

A scar never fully heals.\n```\n\n3 Things that make a scar:\n* It started with a cut.\n* You can't heal it totally.\n* It has a visible mark.\n\nSo the correct answer is A, B, C, and E from the choices.\n\nBut why C? Because C is the only answer that doesn't mention healing. The others have to use a healing action.\n\nSince the question is asking about a figurative scars, it doesn't mean healing and it makes more sense to choose stitch.\n\nIf it were a literal literal scars. then the correct answer would be A, B, and D, since you could technically heal literal scars.\n\n### Input:\"Where would you use the word to go?

{"text": "Head of the Branch yelling at owner\n\n### Rationales: Consider each choice one at a time.\n\nStep 1: Consider choice A: Owner \u2013 The owner of any branch is typically the head of the branch.\nSince an owner is the founder and top level manager of a company, any order or request given to him/her by others in the company hierarchy would likely have come as \"yelling\". Hence, this choice is correct.\n\nStep 2: Eliminate unsuitable choices. Consider choice B: Foot.\nAs the \"branch\" referred to here is a part of a larger organization, the \"head\" could not be the bottom of the organization, like a foot. Choice B is, therefore, not a valid choice.\nStep 3A: Look closely for any patterns or logical contradictions in remaining choices.\n\nStep 3B: Consider choice C: Subordinate \u2013 From the description, it seems that the \"head\" is the owner of the branch, who yelled at a person below them in the organizational hierarchy, akin to a subordinate. Hence, this choice seems more plausible. Eliminate unsuited choices.\n\nStep3C: Consider choice D: Base \u2013 In the context of a branch of a company, the base of operation is the location of the organization of which the branch is a part, like the corporate headquarters. While there might be a location-head known as the \"branch\" of a branch office, which might be yelling at a subordinate, the branch itself, as the base, typically is not. Hence, this choice, too, cannot be correct.\n\nStep3D: Consider choice E: Point \u2013 The word \"point\" might refer to a specific department of the larger institution. But, as we have ruled out choice B, it cannot be the owner of the branch on which the owner yelled. Hence, it cannot be the correct answer.\n\nStep 4: Combine information from the previous steps.\nThe correct answer is Choice C: Subordinate.\n\nAn analysis of choice C further reveals that it is subordinate in the branch hierarchy. A \"head of the branch\" cannot be yelling directly at the owner of the branch. It has to be someone below the owner, which means the \"head\" we are looking for is the \"subordinate head\", or a subordinate who is responsible to someone", "answer": "C: subordinate"}

Therefore, it would be likely for the lizard to come surprisingly from the desert or dessert, rather than from the forest or grassland.\n* The description also mentions that when caught in a room with one's bare hands, many people experience the urge to run or hide in fear. This is understandable when encountering a 5 foot lizard with venomous fangs, which is common in the desert.\n* Consider choice D: Gardens \u2013 although a lizard might eat fruits or berries found in a garden, that wouldn't be the purpose for the lizard visiting the person in the first place.

A man looking good and being beautiful are not the same. A man who is beautiful, such as having a good hair or a good skin, will not necessarily be looking good as the good of his skin can easily cover blemish that the skin has.\n\u2022\tC: Tardiness : This is a choice which should not be considered as the word \"before\" in the question indicates a time before time which a job interview is to be conducted and a man being late for is a job interview is not the right context to consider.\n\u2022\tD: handsomeness : This is a choice being considered as a man who is handsome will be looking good.\n\u2022\tE: neatness : This is the choice which the answer is actually describing. We can infer that the man is portraying himself to be neat as that is what he is describing himself.\n\nAnswer: C: Looking Neat\n\n### Instnction:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Demonstration\nInput: What does a cowboy ride?

C: Center D: Midpoint E: Core\n\n### Demostration:\nConsider each choice one by one before jumping to conclusions. \nStep 1: Consider choice A: North Side \u2013 While a person can technically be transported from the North Side to downtown, it would require a long and very indirect or roundabout route because the South Side and Center are the best places to go downtown. Therefore, it is a less interesting choice and can be eliminated.\nStep 2. Consider choice B: South Side \u2013 While a person could potentially be transported directly from the South Side to downtown on foot, this is only a very narrow section that is not part of a typical route. Therefore, it is eliminated.\nStep3. Consider choice C: Center \u2013 Center is the correct answer; it's the very center of the city in a literal sense, and it's also where most people go for downtown.\nStep 4. Consider choice D: Midpoint \u2013 While the Center is a place, it is a different type of place than Midpoint. So, since this choice is not the name of a place or object, it can be eliminated. Since Midpoint is not an option, Center is the correct one.\nSince we have identified the best spot and best choice, we can eliminate the incorrect choices, leaving only the Center as the best choice.\n\nInput: What does a person do?

Eliminate unrelevant information and the answer that may not work within the context of the question. We are looking for a verb that describes what someone might do, not the emotion they are experiencing. \"Glee\" (Choice C) isn't a verb, thus it's not a correct answer. In comparison, \"Have fun\" (Choice F) is a correct answer that would be an alternative choice to all other correct answers, if they had been provided as choices. Hence, \"Have fun\" is a reasonable answer even if none of the other answers are explicitly stated as wrong.\nStep 5. All other answers involve a specific action. This is different from \"having fun\" which is an abstract noun.\nStep 6. The remaining choice (Choice B) is the correct answer because it is a verb that describes what a person may do and, as such, fits the context of the question best.\n\nAnswer: B: laugh\n\n### Input\n\n- What might someone do during a carnival?\n\nInput Choices: (1) A. Sing (2) B. Dance (3) C. Wear costumes (4) D. Walk\n\n- What are the things available during a carnival night?\n\nInput: Choices: (5) A. Food (6) B. Games (7) C. Rides\n\nInput Choices:(8) A.

Choices: 1. A: made 2. B: raised 3. C: enticed 4. D: built 5. E: fix\".\nStep 2: The question asks \"what had to be done\". Step 3: Two of the choices are incorrect. B: raised and D: build makes no sense. Step 4: C: enticed, D: build and E: fix are all gramatically correct. Step 5: C: enticed does not make sense as an action. So C: entice, E: fix and B: raised remain. Step 6: Considering that \"build\" is a part of \"C: build\" and \"C: entice\" is also part of \"to build\", then E: fix is the best choice.\nAnswer: E: fix\n\nInput: In what place would you like to be if you\u2019re thinking of a bookstore to shop for any novels? Choices: \nA:  cafeteria B: school C: library D: hospital E: house\n\nRationales:In this question, since you\u2019re thinking about buying a book, you\u2019d want to go somewhere where you can browse through a lot of options. Therefore, this is a common way in looking for a bookstore, hence you would say \u201cI want to be in a bookstore\u201c. Therein I say, there are 5 choices in the question, each of them has been paired to a place. Therefore, my question would be, where am I if I\u2019m thinking or looking for a bookstore?\n\nStep 1: Consider each option one by one.\n\nStep 2: El", "answer": "B: raise"}
{"text": "E: \"get food\"\n\n### Rationale:Step 1: To answer this question, we will need to figure out which of the choices has an incorrect preposition. To determine this, we must first read over each of the answer options and consider any grammatical differences between them.\nStep 2a: We know that the choices are in the following forms \u2013 cook dinner (A), eat (B), go back to work (C), make food (D), get food (E).\nStep 2b: At this point, we know that the correct answer will not include make food (D) or go back to work (B) as these are not verbs in the past form. This leaves us with cook dinner (A), get food (E), and eat (B).\nStep 3a: We will begin by breaking down which answer options don't make grammatical sense.\nStep 3b: First, let's determine that cook dinner (A) doesn\u2019t make grammatical. This is a phrasal verb that means to prepare dinner and doesn\u2019t use get food.\nStep 3c: Next, let's determine get food (E). This option starts by using get and can only be used with the indefinite pronoun it.\nStep 3d: Finally, let's determine eat (B) doesn't make grammatically sense either. This option uses a conjugated verb and cannot use get.\nStep 4a: When comparing get food (E) with eat (B), we can deduce that the only choice that makes grammatical sense the past participle - get food.\nStep4b: Therefore, get food is the correct answer because only the choice with a proper past participle makes grammatical sense. Get food is also a verb phrase and describes what the subject did \u2013 \"they\" get food meaning they went food shopping and returned with food to eat.\n\n```\nInput: Where can the staircase be found?

Choice A: Drop out of school is the most suitable choice. \n\n### Instructions:\n\n### Input : Describe the characteristics of a car engine.\n\n### Examine:\n\n#### Choice A: 4-cycle, internal combustion\n\nThis choice is the correct answer because internal combustion is a four-cycle operation, and this matches the description given by the scenario: \"the four-stroke combustion cycle\". Internal combustion engines have one fuel injection and one exhaust valve per cylinder, and a piston that moves up and down inside the cylinder. The four cycles of an internal combustion engine are as follows. \n* Intake, when fuel and air are taken in, compressing them and mixing them into a combustible mixture. \n* Compression, when the piston pushes the mixture down, making the air hot and pressurized. \n* Ignition, this stage involves spark plugs that cause the fuel to combust. \n* Power, or the combustion stage, when the fuel burns and pushes the burning cylinder down, causing it to move and generate motion. \n\n#### Choice B: Incomplete combustion\n\nIncomplete combustion is the burning of fuel without complete combustion, meaning that not all of the fuel is burned out. Incomplete combustion results in the production of harmful pollutants and greenhouse gasses. \n\n## See this question in the original article\n- [https://help247.io/blog/how-to-learn/cfa-level-1-level-2-or-level-3-which-level-should-i-take-if-i-just-got-my-master-", "answer": "D: wash dishes"}

Note that the question is asking for a negative -- the excluded option. All four answers (B, C, D and E) are \"yes\" options.\n\n### A: To show a Job \u2013 People can get a job without a driver's license; a driver's license is not necessary to show a job. Therefore, this answer is not the correct answer even if this is a common reason for getting a driver's license on its own, and the other options are not necessary to be excluded for this reason.\n\n### B: Insurance \u2013 An insurace company might require a driver license to give to the policy holder, which then the policy holder would then use to get their insurance, but the driver license itself does not serve as insurance. Therefore, it is possible for a person to have insurance without a driver license.

{"text": "### Demostration:\nAnswer: C: understanding\n\n### Difference of Correct Answer:\n\n### Instructor Remarks:\nExplanation about the correct answer may be as follows:\n\nIn general, society refers to a particular group of people having common culture, interests, and traditions. The term is usually applied to countries, regions, or broad geographic locations.\nSocieties can be subdivided into many other social groups, such as gender, age, ethnicity, class, religion, sexual orientation, language, appearance, and disability. They are also affected by, and can define, an individual's social category or identity.\n\nSocieties are characterized by patterns of relationships between people, including both positive and negative ones. These patterns are influenced by individual needs and the distribution of power and resources within a given society.\n\nIn political science, there are two main perspectives on how societies and the individuals within them interact with each other. Political realism sees humans as inherently selfish and egotistical, while social contract theory believes people want to feel like they're part of a larger group.\nSocial contract theory is a political philosophy and theory of sociology originating in 17th-century Europe, though it became particularly associated with the work of Thomas Hobbes during the Enlightenment. The social contract is a hypothetical agreement in which individuals surrender some of their freedoms and submit to the authority of the state in exchange for protection of their remaining rights. For Hobbes, the protection of property and personal security are the only legitimate functions of government, and all other activities (including education, infrastructure, law-determining, etc.) are \"addition and refinement\" of this basic function.\n\nSociety is fundamentally about groups. Therefore, it's a given that conflict is an unavoidable component of their dynamic nature. This can take form in a multitude of ways as a conflict often has an inherent emotional component. \nThe two most popular approaches in dealing with conflicts that concern society are the avoidance and management approaches. Both approaches are essentially aiming to reduce or minimise the negative impact of a conflict on the social fabric/identity  and society as a whole.\nAnother approach, the cooperative approach to resolution, is where the problem is viewed in such a", "answer": "E: revolution"}

The man in a box must be on the jury because of the context of the question, which states that there is an old person on the old man in the jummy box. \n\tD. A man sitting in the jury box. The context of the problem is that there is an older man on the jury box so there is no way this man is not on the jury.\n\tE. A man who is sitting in the jury. This is not correct because by context there is already an older person in the jury box, so this person was sitting there prior to the question.\n\tStep 2: Decide which of the remaining two options (A or B) is the more logical answer. \n\tYou then compare the remaining two answers because of an ambiguity in what the terms \"a man\" and \"a man in the box,\" and the word \"older\" in the original question. \n\tThe man sitting in the jumiry box is \"newer\" than the original question.  Then it's logical for an ambiguous answer the man who was sitting there. \n\tSince there is an older person in the box, this means that this person is an older person on the jury. That's why an old man is seated when the question is asked, so the answer is D. \n\tStep 3: If the remaining two option", "answer": "A: wear shoes"}

If she has to prepare every last bite that she serves, she is most likely in a very small apartment, most likely a studio.  The apartment's location, while not given, can still be inferred by the given answers.  The most likely place to live near her deli, and that can serve her needs as much as possible, would be a town.  Towns are made up of many smaller, self contained, districts, where each has its own shops, and is a short walk away from each other.  The area for the deli itself, then, would be its own district, so she would be a short walk away from the deli, and probably nearby other shops for her other needs.  She would have access to things such as markets and public transportation as well, which would make up for the absence of a food court, jewish community, or even new york city.  The town is an attractive place to live in, because it has an area that is small enough for her to have a good amount of privacy for her, but is small enough to not be overwhelmed by the hustle and bustle and congestion of larger, more populated, areas.  An added bonus of a town over a larger place like new york city would be that there would be less people in general, which would make it easier to find the foods that she would be most likely to keep and use up, and to find places to order things like meat, which would be a key ingredient in a good large amount of dishes that she would likely have available for purchase in her deli.\n\n### Input:(1)  A woman is walking to the store.

{"text": "The instruction says what place that you can learn about operations with numbers.\n\n### Choices:A: math book B: Phonebook C: statistic. D: music school E. Office\n\n### Rationales:Eliminating unrelated choices:\n\nLet's start by getting rid of options that do not have anything to do with operations with numbers. We will not use the phone book to learn about operations with numbers and we won't be learning through the statistics. We also don't use an office, a music school or a math book to learn operations with numbers. Therefore, the choice we should pick is option B\n\nNow, let's look at options B-F, starting with the most unlikely one.\n\nWe can't learn about any kind of operations on the internet, unless we decide to put it into Google and actually look up some information, and that is not something you need to do if you want to get rid of this task. We use math, in most cases, you don't need a book to learn about operations.\nThis way, we are left with the choice between C and D.\n\nNext, the book we use for learning can be considered a hardcopy math book if we look at it from now with that in mind. The reason why we don't use a hardcopy of a book is because you cannot learn this kind of operations with a hardcopy since this is something that you need to do in your head, so, we eliminate that option.\n\nLet's move on to the next choices, we have a statistic, a place where we might learn some operations. A statistical book can tell us about operations though, but we have been previously informed that it would be hard.\n\nIn the end, we come to the same conclusion, the correct choice is A.\n\n### Option A: Mathematical Books and Online", "answer": "A: math book"}
{"text": "### Rationales:\n> Step 1: Consider all choices for an explanation.  \n> Step 2: The question asks if stars lit up something in the wilderness. \n> Step 3: Consider choice A: outer space.  While this could have happened in outer space, the question simply mentioned a wilderness, which implies an earthly location. \n> Hence, it is not the answer to the given question.\n\nStep 4: Turn to the others for an explanation. \n\nStep 5: Choice C: the universe is another option. However, the question refers to stars lit up something, not earth, so the universe is not correct.\n\nStep 6: Choice D: orbit is also another option. In fact, the planet orbits the sun. However, this doesn't seem relevant to the original question of the stars lighting up something in the wittlesness. Moreover, orbit is a term related to space and astronomy, and not necessarily to earth.  Hence, it is not correct.\nStep 7: The final choice is choice E: the ground. The word \"lit\" is a verb, which means to light or brighten, and therefore \"the ground\" would not have \"lit up something\" in a wilderness. The correct answer is choice E: the Ground.\nAnswer: E: the Ground\n\n### Input:\"Roses are nice\" is an idiom.  What is another idiom? Choices: A. Love is the air. B.

Each option has been deemed logically possible and applicable to the given question. However, each one also requires special consideration while determining an answer. \nStep 2: Choice A: Love is the air.  Love is the air is an unrelated choice, because it does not mention roses and does not address the same concept we are asking about, which is \"roses being nice\".\nStep 3: Choice B: A rose by any othername would smell as sweet is another choice that is unrelated, because it does not address the same thing we are asking about and does not have the same", "answer": "B: night sky"}

{"text": "The computer in the cubicle serves all purposes A, B, C, D, and E.\n\n### Input\n\nWhy is the door in the house for an attic that could serve as a bedroom in some cultures used more widely in others? Choices: \nA: Used to hold in heating B: Used for storage of items with a wide variety of purposes C: Used as a guest room D: Used to hold children \nE: Not used at all\n\n### Response\n\nIn traditional Western houses, each family member has a separate place to sleep. Thus, a bedroom is not needed by everyone of the family. People then just decide in which rooms they want to have their belongings, and store those belongings, as rooms, as storage rooms, or something. Meanwhile, a lot of families with many children tend to add a large room to use this as their bedroom. This room is normally in the attic, and so people often do not care about putting a door in this room. However, people with small families prefer to have separate bedrooms, thus, there is usually a door in rooms (as bedrooms) here.\n\n### Response for each choice\n\n### Input Answer:\nA: Attics and bedrooms are used for storage, so attics are sometimes used for sleeping. \n\n### Response (why it's wrong):\nThis is not what the question asks. The question asks about why attics are used as a bedroom \"in some cultures\". That means in some cultures, the question asks, they are \"in use as a bedroom\". It does not ask \"Why are they used as a bedroom\".\n\n### Input Rationale:\nThe first part of the question asks \"Why is the door in many houses needed\" which means in Western, door, in fact, are needed to prevent people from out of the rooms (such as living rooms, kitchens, bedrooms...). Moreover, many houses don't have attic (hence no door). They also don't put children in attics, instead, they use separate rooms. Thus, the door to the room is also needed.\n\n### Answering\nIn other cultures, a lot of people do not install doors for the bedrooms and this causes families to put their children in the rooms and not on beds.", "answer": "C: do work"}

{"text": "Input: His day at the office was neating an end, he went through the start menu on his. To do what? Choices A: run programs B C: control model D E: power down.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. Step 1: Evaluate the question: A man starts up his computer at work. Given that his day is at work, he would not be playing games or running programs for leisure. As for the controls of model, he would not be controlling that if his day is at work - he's probably only adjusting and operating the computers working environment. 2. Step 2: Look at each choice. Choice A: Run Programs \u2013 While there are cases where people run programs on their computers and phones for entertainment, this choice is unrelated to the question. Therefore, it can be eliminated.\n\nChoice B: Play Games \u2013 Likewise, while this choice could refer to the use of video games played on computers, it is again, unrelated to the question, and can be also eliminated. \n\nChoice C: Controlling Model \u2013 While it is possible to control a model with a computer, he would not have reason to do so unless he is working on a project involving computer-controlled technology like robots. \n\n\nChoice D: Power Down \u2013 While it is possible (and, at times, necessary) to power their computers down at the end of the day at work, the question's context and syntax reveals that he has already done so and is, thus, looking, instead, through the Start Menu. \n\nChoice E: Reason Exists \u2013 While this question contains the words \u201creason exists\u201d in its context, it is unclear whether the question is asking what the reason is. Either way, the choice could still refer to the question, or to something else related to people who use a computer, which may have absolutely nothing to do with the question. As such, it is also unnecessary to the question and can be eliminated as an option. \n\nChoice D is the correct answer, for it is the most obvious. Given the context, he is likely looking through the start menu at the close of his day after he has already decided to shut down his computer. His work day is done, and he can leave in the evening. He wouldn't be looking through programs or model controls or the start menu if he wasn", "answer": "D: power down"}

There are certain places where such an excavation is considered undesirable, such as where there are dead people.

The city and a building are places where excavations are desirable. It is inaccsessible to excavate buried things in a city, therefore, the answer is D: City.\n\nStep 5: As a further measure of confirmation, the second choice, \"cemetary\" should be eliminated.\n\nStep 6: In a cemetery, there is an ongoing cemetary which includes deceased people. Therefore, a cemetary may not be an appropriate place to excavate. By extension, if cemeteries are \"undesirable\" areas for excavation, the same reasoning applies to all graves on earth.\n\nStep 7: By extension, other human-made constructs may be suitable for excavation. Thus \"building\" is also a suitable choice, but this choice has already been selected as \"desirable\".\n\nStep 8: \"Archeological site\" is desirable for excavation whereas \"city\" is not.\n\n### Confirmation:\n\nAnswer: B: cemetary\n\n### Response, demystification, and confirmation:", "answer": "B: cemetary"}

In this case, the choices are in the context:\n\nA: War - war is a conflict between two or more opposing groups - airplanes are not a conflict but a tool, so they are not under war.\nB: Aircraft Carrier - an aircraft carrier is not where there are not any aircraft that is not in use; it is the other way around. Aircraft carriers are where a large amount of planes are located.\nC: Graveyard - a graveyard is a place where bodies are buried; an airplane is not a body. Therefore, a graveyard is not where you would find airplanes that are being used.\nC: Sky - The sky is not a place you find airplane graveyards, and the term aircraft carrier could refer to a place where planes take off, are maintained or are stored while they are not in use, so a place where there is not any airplane that is used could be an aircraft carrier - therefore this is the right answer.\n\nAnswer: C: aircraft carrier\n\n### Input :Where does a slap box sit?

{"text": "B \n\n###### Rationales\n\n* Step 1: Look at each of the choices.\n* Step 2: Eliminate options that are not related to the main idea of understanding somebody else. For example, in the context of understanding each other, people would not be changing their bodies.\n* Step 3: Eliminates options that do not fit with the main idea that people understand each other. For example, one should not say they believe in God for understanding each other, because \"If people listen, they cannot do what they believe in God.\"\n* Step 4: Eliminate what the options cannot be understood to do. Some options are too broad, in that, saying \"believe in god\" could mean anything about listening. For example, one is not paid for listening.\n* Step 5: Look at the options that are left and select the one that makes the most sense. There are not many options left, only four.\n* Step 6: Consider each choice and understand how it would apply to people who are listening better.\n* Step 7: The option that makes the most sense is choice B because \"Swap bodies\" is the only option that directly relates to what people would ultimately accomplish if they understand each other better.\n* Step C: Learn from each other does partially relate, however it may not make as much sense to swap bodies. One may learn how to play the piano from someone else, but they do not have to play a different piano.\n* Step D: If people listen, understand each other, and believe in God all those people will talk to each other, but they are not doing anything specific with any others (unless of course they have a conversation).\n* Step E: Pay bills is a completely unrelated and confusing option.

The question is not asking for that. \nStep 2: B: crowd is misleading, as it indicates large numbers of participants. If this event was hosted at a night club/bar, then a crowd could be possible, but a party as a social event might have a few dozen attendees, not hundreds or thousands.

{"text": "### Answer:\n\n### Rationales:\n1. Step 1: Whenever you can, it might be wise to break the question down into smaller pieces. Doing so can make finding a solution easier, while also minimizing the difficulty of reading long instructions. For example, for the question, \u201cWhere on campus is the library?\u201d, we can ask, \u201cHow many campuses have a library?\u201d (Answer: there is only one.) Similarly, for the question, \"What is the difference between a group of rabbits and a group of wolves?\u201d, one can try to first ask, \"What is a \u2018group\u2019? Is it the same definition as \u2018harem\u2019? What is a \u2018wolf?\u2019 Do they look like a hare?\u201d And so on. Doing so helps ensure that you understand that the question is asking for the similarities between group of rabbits and group of wolves - not the differences.\n\nStep 2: Read thoroughly over the question to get a sense of what the question is about. Don\u2019t simply guess at the meaning of a word \u2013 instead, look for hints in the sentences that follow it. While this question about \u201cthe difference\u201d between different groups of animals looks like it's about differences between groups of animals, it is not. If this question asked about differences between groups of students, animals, people, etc., the answer would be different.\n\nStep 3: If the meaning of a word is unclear, it is good to cross reference it by looking at definitions for the same or similar words \u2013 and even when you think you know the meaning of a word, it is good to use this process. We\u2019ll return to this cross reference process in later steps.\n\nStep 4: When reading the question, try to find a list of related options. The more options there are for the question, the more similarities there will be.\n\nStep 5: Cross reference words like \u201calienation\u201d or \u201cdiffering\u201d with other words you know are related to \u201cDifference\u201d. Look at the answer options for which words you think should be used. (In doing so, note that although alienation is not in the answer options in this test question, we do not rule out its use as it was not the question in this test question.) \n\nStep 6: When the options are: A: sum, B: likeness,", "answer": "A: sum"}

After eliminating the inappropriate choices, the remaining choices are bedroom and fabric store. The bedroom is not the ideal place to dry wet clothing because doing so would likely invite the risk of mildew or mold developing on those items. Placing them in a fabric store would likely result in the customer buying new clothing instead of returning those items to the dry cleaners. Placing them in the linen closet or on the space heater may cause the clothing to overheat, making them unwearable.

While this is merely one example of how people can enjoy themselves together, I believe it is appropriate given the prompt that people can enjoy themselves together if they want to share their ideas, interests, or beliefs. \n```\n\n### Demand Response\n\nInput: In how many types can a man play golf?

Choice D: a practice of photography and videography undertaken by underwater landing UAVs is only a part of taking photos and filming underwater, and not the entire practice.

{"text": "Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n### Demonstraion:\nInput: Where should you leave a piece of bread if your doing work on it? Choices: \n\tA: oven B: garbage C: microwave D: table E: fridge\nRationales: This is the logical reasoning process which is applied for this response.\nStep 1: Decide from which option the other choices are to be eliminated after that choose the correct option. \nStep 2: Option D: microwave does not apply, since a piece of bread usually doesn\u2019t require heating. (Note that an option can be eliminated for many reasons - it could just \u201cnot work\u201d with what\u2019s being asked; it could conflict with the answer\u2019s purpose/intent; or other valid reasons). In this case, the answer\u2019s purpose is for food and the microwave is a counter for other foods which is why it\u2019s been eliminated in the first place. \nStep 3: Option E: fridge, although could be a likely answer, does not apply to the question - the question asks specifically for \"work\" on a piece of bread.\nStep 4.: Choice A: oven does not apply \u2013 a piece of bread is not suitable for baking and cooking over an open flame since it is highly combustible. Furthermore, most ovens don\u2019t include an area designated for bread, although some might be made to specifically cook bread.\nStep 5.: Choice B: garbage does not apply \u2013 a pieced of bread is not typically thrown in the garbage (as food, at least) and it can cause a fire when thrown in an oven or left on or near an open flame and so would be more likely to be put in a toasting pan to make toast instead. (Note that while you are eliminating options, you do not necessarily need to list out every reason and explanation that supports this process. You could summarize and list one or two reasons if that's easier.) \nStep 6: Choice C: table does not apply because a bread can not be left on a table as a general rule; they often become stale quicker than other foods like fruits. \nStep 7: Choice E: table also does not apply because it doesn't make the bread.

Choices: 1: The hands stay still 2: The watch stops working forever 3: The hands sweep back and forth 4: The hands will keep moving clockwise 5: The hands move clockward backward\nRationales:\n1. The time passes and the hands stay still - There is no movement when time passes so the hands don't move. A watch with a movement is something that ticks forward as the seconds and minutes pass by. There are devices that keep track of the time without using a movement, which are called clocks.\n2. The watch stops working forever - The watch will be fixed with the correct parts so it can continue to work or it will stop working forever.\n3. The hands will sweep back and forth - If the hands are stationary they are sweeping or stationary, there is no other possibility.\n4. The time passes (time goes forward) and the hands will move clockwise - The hands move clockwise, not clockward backward, with time moves on or forward.\n5.

Option B: This is incorrect because musical stores sell instruments, not instruments themselves. Option C: This is incorrect as a specific type of band, the jug band, is known for playing the banjo as its primary instrument.

Choices:   A: curtains<n>B: tailor shop<n>C: clothing store<n>D: sewing room<n>E: hardware store<n><n>---<n>#### Output: B tailor shop<n><n>---<n>Fabric is typically cut to order at a tailor shop. The material is first selected and ordered. Then, it is cut to the customer's specifications. The tailor shop also does alterations on already purchased clothing. A sewing room might be able to make custom clothing, but it would not likely have the ability to do alterations. A sewing machine might be used to cut the fabric from a large piece into smaller sections. The size and shape of the piece would need to be measured at the tailor shop.<n><n>---<n>#### Outcome:B<n>

I'm not an engineer, I don't have a degree to prove it but I'll tell you about something I recently did with one. A few years ago my daughter was in first grade and we moved to a new neighborhood. She was anxious and we decided she should walk to school with a buddy from the previous class. We took her and made sure she knew the girl's name and where to catch her every morning. A few months later after school started she said there was another girl named Kira in the class that wanted her to walk with her to school. So from then on there were two. When school came around to Halloween that meant two costumes. \nThe next year was different -- there was a classmate, another girl, who was in a wheelchair. She was a bit older than my daughter. Now there were three. Halloween costumes became three each and that's when we decided she would need a new backpack. We were at the grocery store with my brother, an engineer who I knew had helped put together a backpack or three and asked him about his opinion. He suggested we get a backpack with wide straps and he said that he knew of another engineer who had built a rig that could be attached to the backpack straps so it would be easier to pick up a big one. I did it my way and it turned out not bad at all, but at least two other people said that was clever.\nOne thing that I thought was really clever was the strap. In a classroom with fifty or so kids, this backpack has a strap in it I have never seen before. One strap goes across the shoulders and through a small triangle-", "answer": "B: filing cabinet"}

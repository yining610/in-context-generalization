An image of a far object is focused by what is known as an objective lens on a mirror that is in front of the viewer, the rays of which focus on an image of the object seen through a large eyepiece to produce the visible images.<n><n>2-The magnification is determined by the ratios of focal lengths of the objective lens and the eyepiece lens - the ratio is the magnification. The magnification of a telescope is usually given as the ratio of its focal length, measured in feet, so for example a telescope of 900 millimeter focal length would have a magnification of three times.<n><n>### The teacher's solution<n><n>Telescope | Objective Lens | Focal Length | Eyepiece | Magnification<n>---|

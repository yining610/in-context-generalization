The magnification of a telescope is usually given as the ratio of its focal length, measured in feet, so for example a telescope of 900 millimeter focal length would have a magnification of three times.\n\n### The teacher's solution\n\nTelescope | Objective Lens | Focal Length | Eyepiece | Magnification\n---|", "answer": "A: sights"}

We're guessing that you're missing it because all your solutions so far have been correct but lack the additional text.\n\nAnswer: 1. The teacher didn't want the students to prepare dinner. But the teacher wants her students to prepare dinner, to prove their point. - False\n\n2. If I have to keep track with how much oxygen (at school) there is, where am- I? - In space.\n\n3. The class should have studied all of the igneus formations, but they have not got to all of them. - Right\n\nAnswer: For question 1. In the question, \"The teacher didn't just WANT....\", the word \"teacher\" is written in upper case, which is inconsistent with your capitalisation scheme, where all English words are written in upper case, except the first word in sentences, and names of people and places.\n\nI think your test is flawed for a variety of reasons, such as the way you have written \"shouldn't\", \"if\", as well as the way in which you wrote \"and\", \"all\", \"the\", \"of\", \"they\", \"them\", etc.\n\nI think you have written, in an unintentional attempt to make the questions more challenging, the wrong words for the questions. It is certainly an interesting question, but perhaps you should change the words in the questions.\n\nI am not quite sure of how to write the right answers to the questions, but please read this if you think the \"instruction\" is wrong.\n\nComment: The way you've said it, the answer shouldn't be \"A\", it should be \"B\".\n\nComment: Can you expand on what you mean by how the questions are flawed?

The purpose of this course it to introduce young women to the fun and exciting field of computer science.\n\n### Why Python?\n- Python is an exciting and easy-to-use programming language.\n\n### What is programming?\n- Before we started programming, let us explain the basics. Programming is all about giving instructions in a language that computers understand. Let us explain the instructions further below.\n\n### 02 Basic Instructions - the loop\n- The loop is the very basic programming concept.\n\n### More on Loops\n- You have probably heard of the term repeat or loops in many other contexts. However, we mean it differently here.\n\n## 03 Conditional Statements\n- Conditional statements allow you to execute one instruction when one or more conditions is true.\n- You may have used if statements in your daily life often without noticing that this is the very basis for conditional statements.\n- How many times a day do you check weather and turn on the AC or heater if the temperature is different than what you want? Or do you check the time only if you are late for something scheduled? These are examples of if statements.\n\n### How many statements?\n- To understand conditional statements, we need to look at statement blocks.\n\n### The basic syntax\n- let's look at the most basic example before we go through the more advanced topics.\n\n### Exercise: Show me\n- Try to build a program following the exercise given below.\n\n## 4 If Else statement", "answer": "D: knowledge of music"}

{"text": "What would it take to change the default? In a word, nothing. If you want to remove the user's ability to change the default in one of these fields, you must use a Custom Validation expression to prevent changing the setting.\n\nTo accomplish this, first click the ellipsis (\u2026) beside the property to be overridden and click Add Custom. A dialog box with the Property Name field filled in appears. In this case, the Property Name box should be set to TextBox.TextMode property. After doing this, click on Add Expression and you will then have a New\u2026 button to the lower right of the dialog box. In the resulting dialog box, type the following into the textbox:\n\n\\### A Custom Validation expression to block any attempt to change the default setting in the\nTextBox.TextMode.\n\n##### In the above expression, the \"equals\" sign (equal to sign) means that the two values are always identical and the third (false) means that the value returned to the expression should be returned whether the expression result is True or False. If there is no \"equals\" sign, just enter True as the condition and then the false. The expression for setting the TextBox.TextMode will be entered when the User has pressed Enter inside one of the TextBoxes.\n\n### To summarize\nIn our attempt to prevent the user from altering the default value of the TextBox.TextModes property, we used the TextBox.Text property along with the TextBox.TextChanging event handler and a few other related properties. Using these properties was the simplest yet most effective method to achieve our desired result, and in the unlikely event that the user is determined to go through with the action of altering their TextBox.TextMode, the system will catch it through the User Validation events.", "answer": "E: hands"}

And the teacher said \"their effort\", not mine. I hope that the student understands that.\n\n### What are the challenges faced when automating this task?\nThere are multiple challenges faced when automation this task, for example the teacher might say \"There is a mistake in your answer.\", and it is hard to determine when they say it just for example purposes or when it is a real mistake. This kind of thing is hard to make an AI system to differentiate.\nIn addition, it is hard for AI to understand when and what teacher want them to say in some conversation.\nThere were also some cases of the student miscalculated a number and just corrected and continued the task without the teacher saying anything. It is not easy to distinguish between the teacher actually asking a math-related question or not and the students were just explaining a wrong-answered problem to which they think will make the teacher happier.\n\n### How is this task being done by humans now?\n\nCurrently the teacher uses his knowledge of students and teachers to differentiate who is just having a conversation and who has a math problem.\nIn addition, the student who gets any question or a miscalculation will correct the problem and ask the teacher if the calculation is correct or not, to which the teachers will reply \"That's okay.\" Therefore the system can not just understand what the teacher says but it also needs the information of student's questions.", "answer": "A: ignore"}

In her introduction, she said that it would have been the best-selling self-help book ever if it hadn\u2019t been for the recession, which had temporarily slowed sales. Of course, she had no way of knowing whether or not her book would have been the best seller whether or not the recession intervened. There is no hard evidence about whether or not her book had the potential to move more units than any other self-help book. Her argument is that, had the recession not hit at the exact moment that her book was released, it would have outsold all the competition. But this is a poor argument because there is a possibility that the book would not have sold more than any other. There are a lot of other factors that could\u2019ve prevented the book from selling, which we know nothing about.\n\n\n### Questions:\n1: Does the author use the evidence given in support of his argument?

{"text": "While the cat is certainly living a long life, the cat is certainly not talking as much as what a dog would. However, the cat does manage to say some other things that make the cat seem more intelligent than what it actually is. While the cat does occasionally show signs of being intelligent, as some may say the cat \"meows\" the cat is actually meowing for a very specific reason. The cat has been known to meow for different reasons. For example, in some cases a cat will \"meow\" when it is in need of petting, or even when it wants to eat. When it wants food, the cat will \"meow in a specific way. The way in which it will meow will be completely in sync with what the owner of the cat wants or needs. One common form of meowing comes from the cat wanting food. A cat will often meow in a more drawn out way when it is meowing in attempts to call for food. There are a few different types of meowing when the cat wants food. The cat will do something called \"vocalizing.\" The cat will use what is called a muted meow. Finally the cat will meow when it comes to a specific kind of food. When the cat is requesting something certain, such as a treat or food that is a specific size, the cat will go through a few distinct meowing patterns. As a result of the cat wanting specific food or wanting specific types of food, it can be assumed that the cat is at least using its meowing as an acceptable form of communication. One thing that needs to be noted is that the cat is actually intelligent. The cat will be able to remember things such as who it wants to feed it, when it should be fed, and even that the cat is not afraid of loud noises. The cat is not fearful but merely reacting as such to loud noises. The noise of certain people may help drown out all of the noises the cat has experienced. The cat may also do something called \"play possum.\" This is what happens when the cat fakes death. The cat typically does this if it is afraid of something or if it is feeling attacked when it is sleeping. There are a few other reasons why the cat does this. It may also do this out of confusion. Some other times that the cat is more likely to do this would be if the cat is in a place it", "answer": "C: meow"}

{"text": "**Choice:**D\n\nThe teacher was a really great guy. He was really nice to me when a lot of the teachers wouldn't even talk to me. But he was the only one who took the trouble to teach me how to read. He took the trouble to look through the books I had in the library and found me a book that was just perfect for me. Then he made me read a book about four pages a day. Then he made me write one half page each day in my copybook, and I did it everyday except on Saturdays, Sundays and sometimes Christmas. One day he called me up to the blackboard in front of the whole class and said, \"Johnny, I want you to read this page.\" It was one about robots. I stood in front of the whole school and read it like I hadn't never read before, and then he told me I could go to my seat. That's the best part of what he said. Because I knew that if I could do that in front of the whole schools, it meant that, by and by, I'd learn to read anywhere. I'd be able to read books at school, in church, on the street, anywhere. Now I sit in class and I can read everything the teachers writes on the blackboard. I didn't learn anything from him but how to read. But he gave me that and I can make a living.\n\nThe teacher didn't just give me a book and say \"Read it.\" He showed me how to read.\n\nI suppose I'm as surprised as anyone to be in a normal school right now.

{"text": "I can see that the people who did so much damage were very likely to be arrested. I think that if one were to be arrested by police officials, they should try to act calmly and behave respectfully in order to make sure that they do not get arrested. What do you think happens when a person gets in trouble with their parents? Do they usually want to be involved with it at all?\n\n### Input 2:\nAnswer:\nBecause I do not have the right to use that area in my possession, I realize that the police will be very helpful and will prevent people from using it. If someone would do something wrong, they will be prosecuted as well. This is something that most people will be interested in, and the police will be very useful in keeping order in our city and keeping our town safe by not allowing people to harm the building or other property in certain cities. It's easy to make bad choices and to make the wrong decision that many have when a person decides to do something wrong. This is something that many people will try to avoid as much as possible. I think that sometimes people will hurt your feelings because of a little mistake or a small decision that was wrong. It is easy to have a mistake, but it is not too easy to let mistakes go and prevent people from doing these things. A person who was trying to be safe and made a mistake should be careful of what they say and do, and they should be careful not to get arrested and prosecuted for something that wasn't their fault, or it may not have had anything to do with them.\n\n### Input3:\nBecause I was not at school, I had to follow the rules that were set aside by the people who were in my classes. They were supposed to be on time and follow the rules for being in the building at the correct time for class. This made it difficult for us to meet to discuss something we did not like. If we had to do this again, what would you suggest when we went back to the classroom?\n\n### Response3:\n\n\nIt is important for you to remember that when you go back to school after school break that most of your friends are not going to be there. This is because most of your friends and classmates are gone. This means that unless you want to be in the wrong place and you do not want to be put out, it is important for you to stay away", "answer": "B: going to jail"}

For example, I believe a person can say \"What is a person\" to a human, which would result in a person giving a definition of \"person\" and the definition given by another person would most likely be one that includes the word \"human\".", "answer": "B: stand upright"}

{"text": "The stress response is a method of coping that is commonly known as the fight-or-flight response. It is a series of physiological reactions that occur in the body when in response to a stressful or dangerous situation. It is the result of our body\u2019s alarm system which is comprised of the hypothalamus which is a part of the brain, and the pituitary gland. As stressful and dangerous situations arise in our daily lives, this alarm system is triggered and we feel a rush of stress hormones and chemicals to help you react to the stress and the danger. \n\n### Demostration:\nThe fight-or-flig response begins in our brain, when stressful or dangerous situations that arise in our daily lives trigger our alarm system. As stressful and dangeros situations arise in our life, the alarm system is triggered and you feel a rush of chemicals, neurotransmitters and hormones to help you react to strd. The alarm system triggers a response from the hypothalamus, which produces a hormone called adrenaline. The aldrenaline circulates into the bloodstream where it is sent with other hormones, most commonly cortisol, to the major organs. Our organs will then begin to work to prepare us to react to a danger. \n\nThe stress response can cause death if not treated properly because our aldrenaline, cortisol and various hormones, make you ready for action or reaction. This may include things such as the heart working to pump more blood and the brain functioning differently. The more these hormones are in our system, the more likely we will have a stress response (fight, or flight) in certain situations and our bodies may not be able to get all them back to the normal rate and rhythm. This can lead to serious health conditions or chronic stress.", "answer": "B: heart attacks"}

{"text": "The sporting goods store.\n\n### Solution:\n* The user input is\n\n```\nThe teacher didn't just [want, you, to, work, prepare, dinner]\n```\n\nwhich is the sentence that the instructor wants completed.\n\nWe don't need the verb in the sentences because we know them by the verb tense or subject\n\nWe first need to match the user input to the instructions in the `for` control statement.\nSince in this example the sentence contains the word `work` there is a need for us to determine which of the words within the `for` instruction are related to work. To do this, first determine if the words in the instruction match the words in the user input:\n\n```\nfor [work, you, to, in, store, just, prepare, did, sports, dicks, sports,]\n```\n\nWhen words match it is known as a subset to the user in the example and the instruction, which in this case, is the user input. In this example the word `work` is part of both the user output and the for input which is a subset of the user input to the instruction and instruction of the for control statement.\n\nIn programming, we have this idea of a logical AND and OR that represents the user input to the action of the response.\n\n### Explanation\n\nSo now that we know, both the user output and user input are subsets of the for statement, is there any possibility of a subset OR of either the user output or the user input statement?\nCan be possible that the user input and the for statement are unrelated based on what we know or can all the words within the user input be related to the for statement?\nAll the words can be related to the for statements based on the logical AND that occurs. We are left with just `prepare` `dinner` `dick` `sporting` `sport` and `store` as possible choices based on the user input and our logical AND. After choosing and removing any words that can't be part of the user choice to the `for` instruction, the sentence will read like `prepare dinner in the sporting goods store`. In order to do this the user input must have the `all` keyword in the user choice.\n\n\n# # # # #\n\n## The instructor has provided the instructions in the following multiple choice question", "answer": "B: sporting event"}

{"text": "The male body produces more testosterone in response to sexually stimulating activities such as competing with another male, and this increase in testosterone helps induce an increase in sexual attraction.\n\n### Input\nWhat do men do to attract attention, but in a negative way? Choices: 1: Bold and charismatic 2. Physically appealing 3: Easy on the eyes 4: Physically violent 5: Agreeable and humble 6: Strong and masculine 7: Physically handsome 8: Smart and educated 9: Fancy and flossy\n\n### Response\nWomen tend to evaluate men more favorably when male attractiveness is associated with a low degree of testosterone. Men might use testosterone through behavioral or physical means to attract women. This is because men view women who prefer men higher in testosterone to be more physically attractive, and these high testosterone-preferring women are more likely to initiate romantic interest in the male and more likely to have a desire for multiple sexual partners[24]. These behaviors all involve displaying physical prowess or using physically aggressive means of attracting females, including competitive behaviors, sexual advances, and direct verbal threats. These behaviors demonstrate that men seek to attract females by displaying a lot of testosterone.\n\n### 7 questions\n\n### Question:A team of 160 people were participating in aerobic exercise at high intensity. The group was subdivided into two smaller groups. The first group received a testosterone boost and the second group did not. Which group performed the best?\n\n### Answer:Group that received testosterone boost. \n### Group exercise increased oxygen uptake and heart rate.\n### Blood was drawn and researchers gave the testosterone gel topical 160mg/s to the boost group.\n### Study conclusion was that this type of exercise increased testosterone levels.\n### Exercise results have direct positive benefits on testosterone levels by improving physical energy and strength.

{"text": "### Instructions: Write a letter to your friend, who has decided to learn English on her own.\nEncouragement Letter to a friend:\n\nDear Emily,\nIt has been great hearing from you in the email and I really appreciate your interest in learning on your own. I can understand why you would want to learn on your own especially with English. Your level seems to be basic or beginning where you are currently at, and you can't get too deep into vocabulary for that level. I believe in a way that's kind of the idea behind your interest in learning on her own.\n\nWith that being said I believe there are a couple of resources that could help you on your way to learning on your own. If you google resources about learning English, you should find a huge list. From there you want to go on to decide which you think is the most useful and find resources to get books or videos to help you. You also want to make sure you find resources that are easy to understand. This means that you do not plan on reading a textbook and then jumping to the answers immediately. I recommend starting off with something easier than a textbook. A simple website or app or something that has a lot of explanations before you give practice would probably help you the most in my opinion.\n\nHope that encourages you Emily and I hope to see you back at school soon.\nRegards,\nYour Friend,\nAlice\n\n### Instructiion: Answer the following multiple choice question for your friend, who is going to learn English on her/his own.\n\n### Options:\nChoice: A:  The text is written for a reader who speaks some English, can read and write simple sentences at a basic level and is eager to learn vocabulary and phrases.

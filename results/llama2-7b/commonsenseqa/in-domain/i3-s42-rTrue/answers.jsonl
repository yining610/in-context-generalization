{"text": "A\n### Rationales:1. The statement asks what people use to absorb excess ink from a founctain pen.\n2. The options include A. shirt pocket, B. calligrapher' inkwell, C. desk drawer, D. blotter, E. pen holder\n3. The first few phrases given by the question indicate that the extra ink is not coming from a fountian pen but from a letter or any other document being written that has excess ink.\n4. The options imply that these pieces of material could be used to wipe away excess ink on a letter or a document.\n5. As such, the options also imply that the person who may write these letters/documents may need to wipe away the excess ink.\n6. Calligrapher is someone who makes letters or words on a page. Calligraphic hand indicates the hand of the person writing. So, calligrapher' hand is ruled out.\n7. Shirt pocket, desk drawer, and blotter can be considered.\n8. Shirt pocket implies the person wearing a shirt, as in writing down a shirt size. This rule out.\n9. A desk drawer indicates that the ink needs to be wiped away only from desk paper or other document. So, the desk drawer is ruled out.\n10. A blotter implies an item used to wipe away ink for drafting purposes. However, the person doesn't need a blotter to collect excess ink, unless he is writing on draft papers. So blotter is ruled out too.\n11. The last option that is left for the correct answer is the pen holder. Because the extra ink is collected on the paper and not flowing from the pen, this means that the person does not need to keep changing pens to keep the extra ink from coming from the pen. In the process, he/she may be wiping away the excess ink on the paper which needs a pen holder.\n12. Therefore, the answer for the question is option A: PEN HOLDER.\nAnswer:A\n\n### Input:\"You may be interested in this news.\" What news might the statement be talking about?

Meat is a living being in the world of animals. A living being has blood. A living being can be cut, but a non-living object like cutting board cannot be cut.

{"text": "The answer is B: office\n\nInput: A big city needs to find a way to reduce the number of cars during rush hour each morning. Choices:  A and B B: the mayor can ask the police and school bus drivers to stop picking students up from the bus stop,  and make bus stops 1-2 miles farther apart. C: the mayor can ask people with disabled parking permits to switch to other modes of transportation, such as a subway. \nD: the mayor can ask workers to stay late two days per week or telecommute one day per week. E: the mayor can encourage citizens to sell their cars and move closer to downtown.\nRationales: Firstly, we can eliminate the option A, asking the mayor to stop picking students at bus stops. This idea is flawed as not everyone has buses that pick them up from the bus stop. Furthermore, this could confuse and irritate parents, so it wouldn't be good for the mayor to do it.\n\nOption B, asking the school bus drivers to pick up students farther out. Although this would save time in picking up students, this would not solve the problem of reducing the number of cars at rush hour. We can exclude option C also. Asking people with handicap permits to not use their permits, would save money as people would not pay as much for their parking permits, but this idea would cause a huge loss in money. \n\nThat would be the idea of option D, encouraging workers to stay late two times per week or telecommuting, so people can't travel to the office and they would stay home. With that being said, we can eliminate option D. The reason being is because this would cause workers to lose money because they would be spending more time at home and not at the office, which means they wouldn't make as much. \nOption E would be the most effective as it would encourage citizens to sell and get rid of their cars, which would make them use public transportation. By getting rid of cars, this would also reduce the pollution that is occurring in different parts of the city and the emission of fumes as well. \nTherefore, the answer is E: encouraging citizens to sell their cars.\nAnswer: E: encouraging citizens\n\n### Input 2:  What part of the human", "answer": "C: synagogue"}

{"text": "The statement talks about an apple tree with 10 apples which have a total number of 13. The sentence then mentions a set of mathematical operations involving the number 13, which is divided by 3, resulting in the value of 4. The statement says that the value of 4 is now counted as the number of apples on the tree and not three apples.\n\nConsidering these statements, the answer could be B, because the question asks 'there are x apples'. The value of X is actually 13, which the question subtracts 3 from. Subtracting 3 from the number 13 equates to 4. The value of X is now given as 13 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 4.\n\nThus, option B is the answer. \n\nAnswer: B: Garden center\n\n### Input: \nThere are three houses in a row.

{"text": "The answer is [choices: D: fairgrounds](https://www.answers.com/english/fairground).\n\n### Rationales:\n1. A doesn't really connect to a ticket booth. A train station is a large stop that trains typically arrive at, which is probably not where you would go to get a ticket. At a ticket booth, they typically sell tickets for a venue or ride. However, in a metro, they sell tickets for transportation. Also, a cathedral is not typically associated with a ticket booth, but it is associated with a ticket boothing service like church.\n2. The train station, though a station, is not necessarily a fairground.\n3. B does not really connect to a ticket-like booth. The metro does not sell tickets; it offers transportation or, in some cases, accommodations to travelers. A cathedral could be used to sell something, but it probably isn't associated with the term ticket booth.\n4. The options D and E are the only options that actually point to a ticket booth, which is where those places would sell tickets to fair grounds. E is not really associated with a ticket boorthough.\n\n### Answer:", "answer": "D: fairgrounds"}
{"text": "The question states that he began losing consciousness. All of the other answers do not make sense. The plane is going down faster than normal. \"Death\" and \"injury\" are also not acceptable answers since they have the same meaning. \"Coma\" as well is not a plausible answer since \"coma\" is \"a state of profound unconsciousness, loss of ability to feel pain and respond to external stimuli\" (Webster, 2010, p. 98). \"Falling down\" is not likely since he is falling with his whole body. He is not losing consciousness since he is losing some function and will probably die if the plane continues to plummet.\n\n### Explanation:\nBoth choices are not valid, since one answer must be a verb and the other a noun in past tense.\n\n### Response - No: Answer the following multiple choice question.(No clue)\n\n### Demistar:\nThe answer is A: A and B\n\n### What is the question trying to ask?\n\n### Demostar:\nThe question is asking the following: In which case would Cats and Dogs be classified as different animals? A and B, only if one of them has characteristics present in both cat and dog. If not, they are two different animals.\n\n### Who is the protagonist in the question?\n\nIn question Cats and Dogs, Cats and Dogs are given as an example to show what it takes for two animals to be considered the same or different animals. The question mentions that cats and dogs are two different animals, and this is because both of them are different. The question is asking what characteristics of Cats and Dogs will make them be considered the same animal.\n\n### Why does the answer have to be a specific value?\n\nIn this question, there are two possible choices - C and D, which means that there are two statements given for us to compare against each other. These two choices will take different values, then we would take the sum of these two choices to obtain the result. For example, if we have 1 and 2, then our sum becomes 1 + 2 = 3. Thus, if someone answers A and B, then they would be wrong because their answer cannot be 1.\n\n### What does A and B", "answer": "E: falling down"}

B: Making tea: When asking which boys are being rude to what girls, making tea is the girl's responsibility. At such a young age girls were expected to take care of the tea for their elders, therefore girls could not be girls.\n3. C: Minding others: This is another answer that cannot be the correct answer because taking care of their elders was a responsibility of the girls, hence, \"girls could not be girls\" and boys could not be boys.\n4.

We know that bob has hurt feet from running barefoot on hot pavement so we can't assume he's running on a hard surface.\n\n2. The sentence \"his feet hurt from running bare foot on the hot pavement\" tells us that the ground beneath him can't be hot. It could be cold or dry but not hot. Therefore the ground beneath him is not hot pavement.\n\n3. When we look at the choices we see that the other surfaces all have something wrong with them. \"A\" could be a bed of nails but it doesn't mean anywhere. \"B\" is a town meaning this could have to do with a town square running through town and getting lost. \"C\" is a flat surface that is attractive, consistent look but this doesn't mean it's flat and has an \"attractive consistent look\".  \"D\" says he has to run from corner store and this could mean he's lost his shoes in a corner store and now has to run to his house without his shoes but doesn't help us pinpoint the type of ground he's running on. \"E\" could mean running on a hard surface but we know that he has hurt feet so we wouldn't assume a hard surface.", "answer": "D: city block"}

Bob thought that they were worthless, but these cards were indeed rare and not common. \n\nAnswer: D: rare\n\n\n### Input:\"Everyone thought Amy was too short for cheerleading, but she wasn't. She excelled in what she did?\" Choices:  A. dance B. track C. gymnastics D. volleyball E. hockey\nRationales:\n\nAfter looking at the options, we quickly eliminate options E and D. Both answers describe sports that are considered high risk by definition. That leaves us with B, C, and A. Now, these options are a bit more difficult to eliminate due to our initial misconception that Amy was too short for basketball in general. \n\nTherefore, we must analyze the statement more closely and deduce the true meanings behind it. \"Amy excelled in what she does.\" This statement can be interpreted in two ways, 1) the sport she played 2) the specific cheerleaders moves and activities that she specialized in. \n\nIf the former was the correct interpretation, then the answer would be something like track or volleyball. This is because these sports were more likely to require a minimum height or weight requirement for participation. By analyzing the second interpretation, it becomes a bit more clear that this would be an inaccurate statement. This would be a very specific act referring to her specific movements and activities that most individuals simply wouldn't use. This makes the answer much clearer as well. \n\nAfter much deliberation, we can conclude that the right answer is C: gymnastics. Because we previously identified that cheerleading is the sport, the only remaining option is gymnastics, which fits in line with this interpretation of the question and of the statement. As she was short, perhaps she was unable to jump high enough or", "answer": "D: rare"}

However, produce refers to any kind of vegetable or fruit, not just those that are fresh. Moreover, the question does not refer to a credit option specifically for produce.

But when he saw a boy with the same bike, he became upset and decided to stop the robber from taking his bike. But the boy he had been chasing was the same boy he had met at the gas station! \n\nAnswer: The man gave her a ride to the police station so she could report the theft of her bike. When she woke up in the police station, she was scared and wanted to leave. She didn't want to spend the night in the police cell all alone, without having anyone knowing what she did wrong.

Choices:  A warm-blooded B: thirsty C: sweaty D: tired\nRationales: Rest, tissues, gargling, and breathing are all steps to aid in eliminating a cold, unless something is preventing them from being effective. All of the answers indicate something that is preventing them from performing their functions. \n\nA: warm-blooded animals (including humans) have a normal body temperature of about 98 degrees Fahrenheit. That would seem to contradict the fact that, in order to get rid of a common cold, you would want to rest.\nB: An individual would have to really be in need of water to be unable to take in any amount of water, regardless as to the temperature.\n\nC: Sweating is not a problem that would stop the elimination of a cold since sweating is a natural body process, typically used to release excess heat.\n\nD: Being 'tired' is a vague and subjective term. It should be defined beforehand, as it can mean different things to different individuals. Additionally, there are instances where someone can be tired but not be prevented from their desired actions (in the case of a cold, resting).\n\nE: Drinking water can aid in the prevention and elimination of a cold, which indicates that being unable to drink water would result in a cold getting worse. \n\nOf all the options listed, the only one that applies to each of the things described in the sentence is A; 'if you are a warm-blooded animal, you won't be able to take in enough water to prevent your cold from getting worse'. This suggests that a warm-blooded individual, such as a human, would not drink enough water to prevent this result. \n\nThe only other option remaining is option E, which suggests that someone would have to not be able to drink enough water for their cold to get a chance to improve. \n\nOf the answers given, the option E is the only one that doesn't cause any problems. \n\nThis concludes", "answer": "A: slender"}

After understanding the sentence which provides information regarding the barn the other answer options become clear.\nOption A: make is the correct answer here. \n\n- 'Making' something is the same as 'constructing' something or 'building' something.

The question simply asks what she was looking for. That gives us a clear starting point.\n2. Option A, 'her purse,' is not a good option. If she was looking for her purse, she would have already gotten it and she would not have spent an hour looking for it in the kitchen.\n\n3. Option B: 'her keys,' again, is not an option because she might have had her keys on her at the time she spent an hour searching for the phone, or if she really lost them it wouldn't take an hour to look for the phone and not find the keys.\n\n4. Option C: 'her keys and her phone,' is not right since the phone took an hour to find and the keys wouldn't take that long.\n\n5. Option D: 'her purse and phone,' is also not correct; \n\nshe would have gotten her purse by then so it would not take an hour to find her purse and phone, and the keys and phone take less time to find than an hour.\n\n6.

{"text": "Input:\nIn order to survive in any environment, fleas have evolved many amazing methods of locomotion. They are the smallest known animal group with an adaptation of jumping. Fleas are able to jump over a distance of up to twenty-five times their body length.\n\nThe word \"locomote\" means \"to move from one place to another\". There are several ways that a flea may choose to locomote. If a flea wanted to locomote in a way that would allow it to move between places where it could find a blood meal then it would probably try to \"stay in place\" or \"lie down\", in this way it would be able to locate a warm place and \"jump\" to it when appropriate. The jumping motion described here may be called, \"hoping\", \"bounding\u201d, \u201cleaping\u201d, etc.\n\nIf a flea wanted to leave somewhere fast then it might \"run\", \"roll\", or \"stagger\" from the area. A \"staggering\" flea might have fallen because it was hit by a cat's paw or knocked down by a bird's wing. A flea that was trying to move from one position to another in such a way that it was likely to find a suitable environment or a suitable location would most often travel \"sidling\u201d, \u201cstumbling\u201d, or \u201cdragging\u201c; these are all methods that move it sideways.\n\nThe following statements describe the ways in which fleas locomote:\n\u2022 They locomote by jumping across a number of body lengths.\n\u2022 They locomoted by laying very fine eggs.\n\u2022 They loom from one end to the other in a jumping motion.\n\u2022 They leap forward by traveling horizontally along the ground.\n\u2022 They move sideways rather than forwards.\n\n### Comments\n\n**Exclamation Mark**: This means we are not sure whether the answers are all wrong or all right, we choose to leave them as comments.\n\nIn the task, A: jump is wrong, but the other answers are right.\n\n**Correction**: This is to correct the task that contains incorrect answers.\n\nIn task, the answer is **C**.\n\n## Conclusion\nIn this solution, there are two tasks that have the same question but different answers.\n\n1", "answer": "E: jump"}

Choices: A: having appointements; B: being late; C: have time to  think; D: time consuming; E: impatience.\n3. Rationales: The statement says that it is difficult to do work when a patient waits for the doctor. This indicates that waiting for the doctor is likely to cause  something to not happen. For example, a patient may be unable to work because he/she is waiting for the doctor. If the patient has an essential job, he/she may not be able to perform his/her duties properly. In order to do work, a patient must be healthy. For the patient to be healthy, he/she needs to be cured of their illness and, in order to cure the patient\u2019s illness, they require a doctor.\n4.

Science would be a fitting addition to campus, especially for a billionaire who donated a large sum of money to the campus.

The other options are not as appropriate, such as \u2018fraternity house\u2019 and \u2018big city\u2019. 1. The question only mentions a \u201clarge\u201d donation to his former college, not any other college buildings 2.

{"text": "1. The problem talks about doing favors for everyone but not getting anything in return, which frustrates the individual. Typically, this is an indication of the person having a poor sense of gratitude. A person who feels obligated to provide favors without rewards is not displaying a sense of thankfulness. \n\n2. Options A, 'let down' and B, 'gratitude' are out of the list of choices since both refer back to 'it.' This implies that they are both referring to the same individual. \n\n3. Option C is 'illness' which is likely not the answer to the problem. Although some people have illnesses, it is unlikely that many of these people would feel obligated to do favors. Others may feel obligated to do more favors in order to compensate for their illness, but they would most likely not be looking for rewards, they may just be happy to get the favor done. \n\n4. Option D is 'gratitude,\" which is both vague and specific. The response should be specific since the question asks for the reason someone would feel let down. \n\n5. The only remaining option is option 'E: gratitude.' \n\n6. The answer is C: illness and D: gratitude.\n\n### Inputs: You should give him a gift,  for he has spent money  on you to get you, what?

The key is to interpret what the question implies, not what appears straightforward.\n\nThe way to read between the lines is to look for key phrases and words that give the essence of the problem. Some of these words and phrases include \"promote\" (give someone a promotion), \"hire\" (give someone an employment), \"invite\" (invite someone to a private event), \"choose\" (give someone the privilege of choosing you), and \"fire\" (dismiss from one's position).  \n\nHere, these words are included in the problem to create a scenario where the individual in question helped another and wants something in return.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B, \"Give him a job\". The question suggests that the individual helped the", "answer": "E: gratitude"}

{"text": "B. A plane\n\n### Explanation:\nThe choice options mentioned are the following:\n\nA.Carnival\nB.Plane\nC.Concert\nD.Turned at night\nE.A penguin's tummy\n\nFrom the options given, the carnival lights blink throughout the day and the penguin's behind is visible in the daytime, indicating that the lights seen in the air at night must refer to aircrafts. It's impossible for a penguin' tasking part of its body to cause light flashes at night due to it being an animal. \n\nConcerts don't usually go on at night, and the option D, \"turned at night\" means it's referring to the lights we always see in the air at night. \n\nHence, we can conclude that the answer is B: plane. \n\n### Input 1: When is the best time to get to New York?  Choices:  A late October Tuesday afternoon B: a warm summer morning C: a quiet weekend D: a Wednesday during the day E: January of a particular year\n\n### Response 1: \n\nB. Warm summer morning\n\n### Response Explanation:\n\nLet's analyse each of these options based on the following criteria:\n\nA. Late October Tuesday afternoon\n\nThis option makes the most sense, as it is usually the time when the most number of tourists fly to New York. During this period, the weather is also comfortable, making it perfect for tourists to visit.\n\nB. A Quiet Weekend\n\nA quiet weekend would describe a place like New York during a weekend. Due to New York, being one of the busiest cities on the planet, it would make sense to choose this option when looking to avoid crowds.\n\nC. A Wednesday during the Day\n\nThis option sounds like a very rare occurrence, which is why it is usually referred to as the best time to get a ticket. \n\nD. January of a particular Year\n\nThis is another unlikely scenario, as the weather is usually very cold during these months.\n\nE. \n\nThis last option isn't even an option, as the date it refers to is not a good time to visit New", "answer": "B: plane"}
{"text": "D: repair shop\n\n### Rationales: 1.) The question mentions \"the basement\" which suggests that the person can go down the stairs to get to the the repair shop. The hardware store is much too distant for such a distance to be covered and the garage is only accessible by car where the basement is only accessible by foot.\n\n2.) Additionally, it states that the person has to \"walk down the staircase\" which again suggest the location to be either the basement or the repair shop. Furthermore the the library would be too far away to walk to. Moreover, given the fact that the question does not provide any information about whether we are inside or outside the house, the repair shop seems to be the more logical choice.\n3.) Therefore, the answer is the Repair Shop\n\n### Input:\"Whenever I feel lonely, I go for a walk.\" I often walk to a park. Why do you think they don't walk there very often?

The weather doesn't often get too bad, but some people might enjoy walking in the rain too\n\n2. Whenever it rains, it isn't very likely they'll go there.\n\n3. They'll likely go to the restaurant more often than they'll go to the park.\n\n4. They don't go very often because the restaurant is nearby.\n\n5. They probably don't go very much because it is crowded.", "answer": "B: basement"}

Choices: \nA: No B: 45 degrees C: 46 degrees D: 81 degrees E: 80 degrees \n\nRationales: Choices:  A. \"No\" - No, because if I told her but didn't explain why I didn't think this is good for her, I'll sound harsh, which may drive her further from me. If I don't sound like I really care then it's less likely to be a good influence on her and more likely that she'll go do the action.  Instead, I need to be sure what I say is heard.\nB. 45 degrees - This sounds a little more positive than \"no,\" because it acknowledges that I think she's having a good thought, even if I don't understand why or think it's a good action.  The phrase \"that it's a good idea\" could lead the reader to believe that I agree  with her, but I'm only saying that I agree this \"idea\" is a good idea, not necessarily the action. This is also a little more positive than saying \"No,\" and  shows that I agree that her idea is a good idea, even if I don\u2019t agree she should do this action.\nC. 45 degrees. This answer was the same as B. It's a great way to be positive towards the person who you're upset about, but still can be honest and clear about your response.\nD. 81 degrees. This answer can be a bit harsh for someone you have a conflict with. There is nothing wrong with someone seeing that they're wrong, but still making sure that they know that they are seen for the parts of them that are doing something good. The question says \"if you don't, \"so no matter what, you want to be certain you tell them your opinion. It shows that you care, but you care for their entire self.\nE. 80 degrees. This answer sounds a bit harsher than \"No\" or \"45 degrees\" and says that you don't", "answer": "E: heat up"}

It's unlikely they will be offered in areas such as a beach or a park, with no shops to do your shopping. \n\n1. According to Option A or B, amusement parks or urban areas involve a fair amount of walking, which may include carrying bags. Hence, the bags are likely to be in a receptacle.\n2. Airports offer shopping options before you land your flight, but bags are not typically carried on your person throughout the entire airport. \n3. Shopping malls don't offer bags because customers are expected to bring their bags with them to buy things and use a bin when they finish shopping.\n4. Trains don't have shopping sections like other modes of transportation, so bags are less likely to be needed.\n5.

Choices: 1. A: octopus 2. B: whales 3. C: seals 4. D: jellyfish E: crocodiles F: dolphins \n\n### Response : As per the question, octopus is also known as the \"camel of the ocean\". This implies that octopus has exceptional traits and physical features, such as camels, that enables it to adapt to adverse conditions in the ocean. Similarly, it can walk across the sandy bottoms and swim through the water's surface through its many tentacles. Moreover, it can carry 50% of its weight when compared to its body, which is equivalent to a camel carrying 35% of its total body weight.\n\n### Detailed Input: A: octopus B: whales C: seals D: jellyfish\nE: crocodiles F, dolphins\n\n### Response Detailed:Octopus is an unusual creature that possesses several similarities to camel. One example is its ability to travel on land as effectively as it does in the sea. The animal is able to move forward while balancing 50 percent of its weight. This would cause humans to fall down if they tried it because they only would be capable of keeping up to 35% of their weight on their feet.\n\n### The response also mentioned that octopus can walk across sandy bottoms just like a camel would.

{"text": "I think the answer is B, upper hand.  \n\n### Rationales:\n1. The question gives the context for the competition. Competition in sports or the business world often gives an advantage to one competitor over another. \n2. The statement about having a 'higher position' is not necessarily accurate as it can imply being able to see what's in front of one, which is not necessarily beneficial in some competitions.\n3. The phrase 'the upper hand' is specifically used when one has an advantage over another competitor. For example, if one student is better at math than the other, this gives the first student an 'upper hand.' \n4. So, based on our reasoning, option B, 'the upper hand' makes sense as the answer. \n\n5.

Choices: A: what you wear B: keeping a clean table C: washing your hands D: sitting E: saying grace\n\n### Response : B : Keeping a clean table\n\n### Rationales : 1. Keeping a clean table and washing your hands both involve removing waste or preparations from a table before eating. This allows the table to be used over and over again. \n2. Keeping a clean means that food and dishes are off the table and other people can use it later. This doesn't apply to what you wear and keeping clean isn't about making yourself clean, but about making the table clean. \n3. Saying grace before eating does not necessarily involve making yourself clean, so it doesn't apply. \n4. Sitting is not usually a requirement to eat food.\n5. Eating does not necessitate sitting down, so that option is not relevant. \n\nThis leaves us with two options: keeping a clean table and wash your hands.\n\nWhile the statement \"keeping a clean table\" doesn't necessarily tell you to clean a dirty table, that's exactly what people do at mealtimes. As such, the word \"clean\" in the statement refers to tidying.\n\nThe statement \"washing your hands\" refers to cleaning the hands and doesn't refer to a specific purpose or situation.", "answer": "C: marriage"}

{"text": "### Explanation:\n\nYou have to be more specific and write the instruction below in a more specific format.\nWrite a response that appropriately explains the given instruction.\n\t\n### Input:How does a car get around a corner safely?\n\n### Demostration: The question talks about car. The car is moving. Moving is in the future.\nMovement means change in place. Hence, when a car moves, its change in place will be different/opposite to its previous change in place.\nIf the road goes from left to right, then the car must move to the left. If the road goes from right to left, the car must move to right. Hence a car's way and corner are both the same and the car's way is equal to the road.\n\nA corner is defined as a path where car takes one full circle to complete it. Here, a car does not turn 90o. It always turns 18o. Hence, a car can always take one full circle at once to turn and then continue moving.\n\nHence, the answer will be,\nA: A car gets around a corner safely by following a direct single path and turning a full/complete circle at once.\n\n\n### Input; You should always obey the law.  What does this mean?

The law is also used in the same sentence so You are the subject.\nHence the subject is being asked to behave according to the law. It also says to obey the law and says what does it indicate.\nLaw = Behave according to the rule\n\nThus, the answer option is (A) and the following are the steps.\nLaw = behavior.\nBehavior means the action of doing something.\nHence, law represents action.\nAction means to do something.\nHence a law is something to do.\n\nThus, you have to do as law says.\n\nhence behavior =do\n\n### Input:- An elephant's trunk is a powerful snorkel.What does snorkel mean Choices:  A", "answer": "D: pass sentence"}

{"text": "While all the terms provided in the options given do not necessarily have the same meaning as invitro, they do share some connection with it, as discussed below:\n1. The statement uses the term `invitro` to refer to reproductive treatment methods. The term `invitro ` generally refers to the process of fertilization wherein the egg and sperm are combined outside the body, in a laboratory, under sterile conditions.\n2. The use of invitro is typically associated with the following scenarios:\nInability of fertilization: Reasons could be due to infertility, lack of regular periods, early menopause, and genetic factors as well.\nDifficulty to conceive: Reasons could be because of lifestyle factors like an irregular diet, too much alcohol, no/low sex, drug use, and more. Or a recent disease or surgery or the use of certain medications could alter the reproductive system, hence causing difficulty to conceive.\nReproductive disorders: This includes disorders like PCOS, endometriosis, uterine tumors, or tubal obstructions, where hormonal imbalance could interrupt the reproductive cycle.\n\nBased on the given options, `overpopulation` and `larger family` are scenarios where in vivo methods are used. This means the child is conceived and born within the body of the mother. Therefore, these options cannot be the correct answer to `What would cause someone to prefer _invitro_ for reproducing?\n\nNext, we examine, `problems`. The use of invitros could take away the problems faced in reproduction, hence, this could be an answer.\n\nLastly, `baby`, while not a reproductive term, is commonly used to refer to someone under 12 months of age. Hence, the `baby` could refer to someone who is born through an invitro method, which means, this could be an option as well.\n\nWith this information, it is evident that the only option that matches the term of invitro is `problems`.\n\nThe answer is D: problems/offspring.\n\n### Input:(2) A: is a good way to remember his shopping list.

{"text": "E: television\n\n## Instructions:\n### Answer the following questions about vocabulary.\n\n\n### Demographic Information:\n1. Gender: Female  2. Age:30  3. Education level: university\n\n### D. What do I think about the term \"a few\"?  \nAnswer:\n'a few' means 'not many,' or 'a small number.' One use for it is when using it to describe a quantity as a whole; for example, 'a few dollars,' or 'a few books.' Another possible use for it could be when one is mentioning the fewest items that fit a specific category; as in, 'this is a few of my favorite books.'    \nFurthermore, the term 'a few' is not typically used when mentioning a single quantity, as we may use a count word with 'a few,' like I mentioned above; so in cases where one uses just an individual item (or quantity) of the mentioned category, the term 'a little' might better suit the context.\n\n### What do I think about your definition of \"an enormous\" and \"a huge number\"?  \nAnswer: \nWhen using a superlative, we are comparing at least two entities. However, \"enormous\" and \"huge\" can be used on their own without saying what we are comparing it to. In this case, we see that the author is comparing at least two numbers, possibly in different categories, or the same category with a lot of variation between the numbers. I think this explains why the author can use \"enormous\" compared to a \"huge number.\" They are not using adjectives (enormous, huge, small) to compare specific numbers, so the superlative is not needed.   \nAnother time we could use the term \"an enormous, huge number\" is in the case where we are describing the absolute biggest (or the second biggest, etc.), as in the example of comparing 20 to 30 (if 30 is \"absolutely\" the bigger number...then \"very big\" isn't enough).\n\n### What adjective do you think might be used with each of these nouns:\n### 1. a pair of _______ socks  2. a group of _______ birds  3. a lottery that", "answer": "B: opera"}

Choices: A: how she would fail the exam B: what time she had to be at the testing center C:what she had achieved in the course D: that she would fail the exam E: what she had studied during the semester\n\nInput: The word \"should\" indicates that Jan was obligated to study as much as she had planned, but didn't study as effectively as she could. \n\nThe word \"should\" in the context of something that someone must do or that is expected of an individual, makes studying seem like it's a requirement rather than optional or a choice. \n\nIn the example, \"she told some people she would fail the exam,\" the word \"fail\" indicates that Jan had studied a substantial amount yet didn't study as well as she could have. This is evident through the phrase \"she should have studied more.\" The \"should\" indicates that she was supposed to have studied more and the word \"more\" indicates how much study she should have done by studying more. \n\nTherefore, the best response to this question is C: what she had achieved in the class.  In this case, if Jan had a low grade, and it is a result of her low study level, and she expected to have a good grade, she may have made that choice in order to increase her chances of having a good grade. \n\nAs a result, she would have", "answer": "D: egg carton"}

{"text": "The question asks about a person's life in relation to forgiveness. This could mean that for us to have forgiveness in our own life, we first have to forgive someone else. This would likely activate a 'good feeling', or in other words, niceness towards them.\n\nWe can eliminate option 'C' as forgiving someone in a relationship won't automatically cause new freedom. New freedom will come after an action, like leaving the relationship or taking responsibility for oneself and one's actions.\n\nForgiving someone likely also does not create new independence from a person since that would not be a good result of forgiving.\n\nWe can also eliminate 'E' as being good or a healthy heart doesn't guarantee respect. This would be more of a character trait, as if one could see respect from others as a result of forgiveness.\n\nSo, we can say that B is the answer. We do feel good feelings toward people whom we forgive. This would cause us to have nicer feelings, which could lead to more positive actions or more respect.\nAnswer: B and C: 'good feelings' and 'Good karma' respectively.\n\n### Inputs:Maria used the money to buy a house.

{"text": "Option B: Jocks\n\n### Rationale:\n 1. The first thing that jumps out is the use of 'you might head to a locker room'. I know from experience that gymnasium/gyms/fitness centers aren't typically found in locker rooms. Locker rooms are more likely to be found in schools or sports facilities such as a stadium. \n\n2. Also, when the word 'locker room' is mentioned, it usually refers to a place for athletes to change clothes and store their equipment, rather than a place for exercise or workouts.\n\n3. Since gymnasiums and the like aren't typically associated with locker rooms, we can therefore cross these two options off.\n\n4. Now that we've gotten rid of A: gym/ gymnasium/ fitness centre and E: gymnasium, we only have three options, B: jocks, D: stadium, and E: gym. \n\n5. Here, the word 'jocks' refers to athletes with a large following who are typically associated with sports or physical activities. The phrase 'jocks will drink' implies that athletes will go to the drinking place. However, nowhere in the passage states that we are talking specifically about athletes and their drinking. Hence, the answer must exclude 'jocks'. \n\n6. D: stadium is a facility that is typically used for the purposes of athletics and sports. However, as we already saw, the passages only mentions a small aspect of our options. This means that the answer choice must exclude this option also. \n\n7.

It does not directly answer the question, which asks where the people are, instead it simply mentions the place they go.\n\nOption B, the desert, is also incorrect for a few reasons:\n\n1. Sammy wants to go where the people are; this suggests populated areas, not the desert.\n2. The desert typically has few people; therefore, it wouldn't be where he would go.\n3. The answer doesn't directly address the question and only explains that the desert doesn't typically have people.\n\nOption C, Sammy's apartment, is likely inaccurate for several reasons:\n\n1) The question doesn't mention anything about Sammy's apertment or where it is located. \n\n2) Sammy wants to go to a place where there are people around. Sammy's apeartment likely wouldn't be somewhere that people are.\n\n3) Sammy's apt. should be specified with his address (ie: Main Street, Apartment #23). In that case his apt. should either be the population center or an area near it.\n\nThis leaves us with either Option D or E being probable possibilities. Option D is more likely; \n\n1) since the question involves the location of a population center; this could refer to a city or town.\n2) in which case, apartment would be an inaccurate answer.\n3) The only option left is then option E which refers to a roadblock. \n\nSo the answer for this is option E: Roadblock.\n\nAnswer: E: roadblock \n\n### Input:\"Give a good job and it won't be forgotten,\"  what does this mean about this person's memory?

{"text": "Committing perjury is lying under oath. Perjury is a crime where an individual falsely tells the court a statement that is in conflict with the truth knowing that it is not true. Perjury is considered a serious crime and it is considered a serious wrongdoing in law and religion. It is considered more serious than lying in general. When a person tells a lie it creates tension in the court and it creates mistrust towards that person especially if that person is a law enforcer or person who tells lies often or commits frauds. According to the context, \"commits the perjury to a police officer\" that suggests that the question is about a lawyer or a judge. When the perjury is committed to a police officer, the person who commits the perjury is facing the possibility of a criminal record so the answer should be E: tension. Tension meaning the person who committed the perjury has to face the consequences and can end up in jail.\n\n### Input; What is the difference between a prosecutor and a defense attorney?

If the person is charged for a crime prosecutor has a right to pursue the prosecution against the suspect. \n \n \n 2.

Solitude could be described as a condition of a specific individual that causes them to become isolated completely. Abbreviation is the name given to a shortened form of a word, while you is the name for a single person's specific gender.\n\n### In this question we can see how the statement 'Sam didn't like company' is given to us as the statement we have to use for the answer. Hence, we can eliminate 'company' as it may be the situation where the word'solitude' can be used. 'company' can be described as a group of people together, hence we can eliminate 'company'.\n\n'loneliness' can be understood as being alone, hence it is the most applicable in this case. Solitude can be understood to be a situation where someone is alone. Hence, we can exclude the answer option'solitude'.\n\n\n### Instructions: Answer the question\n\n### Input :  How did Sam feel?\n\n### Demostration : \nHe felt good and happy since he got to see his best friend.

{"text": "Music is a form of study which does not require any instrument. One would learn to play an uptight piano in a music room, a music store, or a music classroom.\n\n### Rationales: \n\nThe question states that someone would learn to play an `uptight piano.`\n`Uptight` is a misspelled form of `upright`. An `upright piano` is a grand piano with vertical body. Hence, it can be said with certainty that the piano played cannot be a grand piano which is horizontal in structure.\nTherefore, we only need to find the right spelling of the term, `upright piano.` \nBased on the above knowledge we eliminate options D and E as they are incorrect with respect to the correct spelling of the term. \nOption C has only one word out of place. Option B has two words in place. Based on the number of words and words in place, option A can be eliminated. We are thus left with option B.\n\n### Answer:\nD: Music Instrument Class.\n\n#### Explanation:\nThe question states that D: Music Class would be the correct answer.\nInstead of eliminating the wrong answers, we need to ensure the answer is included among the choices. \n\nOption B: Music Store can be further broken down into:\n\nMusic\nStore\n\nIn this, the word `store` is wrong. \n\nHence, we can conclude that the correct answer is: D: Music Instrument Class Room.\n\n### Input - Why did she buy a cake? Is there anything else she can buy without milk?\nInput B: Yes, butter is a common product which can be purchased in a grocery shop.\nRationales:\n1. The question states that `she' bought a cake. Hence, we can reasonably assume that she has already bought a cake.\n2. The question asks that she did not require any `milk.` While the question does not explicitly ask what the reason for her going grocery shopping is, it's reasonable to assume that she went grocery shopping for other items rather than milk when she didn't require any milk.\n3.

The question used the key-term \"master bedroom\" which means both the house and room need to be big enough to accommodate a master bedroom.\n2. It also used the key-term: \"city\" which implies that they are moving to a less urban place and need more space to live.  \n3.

{"text": "Scientific study requires one to look at information and draw conclusions from it objectively to come up with scientifically valid information. \nHowever, many times, information that people receive may influence their views on something \n\nFurthermore, a change in view can even occur if one is not well educated or knowledgeable on something. For example, a man who does not like chocolate gets married to a woman who he loves dearly. She has a chocolate sweet tooth and can not live without chocolate.

If it is early in the morning, many hours of the day are already completed. \nThe reason why the author mentions that it's a fresh air is because it is cool with a very low humidity but this kind of weather generally happens around dawn. At night time, the wind is usually slow and the temperature tends to be higher than at dawn, as that day's heat accumulated during the day time. This can be also explained with the thermodynamics' first law of thermodynamics; The law of conservation of energy, which tells us that energy can not be created or destroyed. But, energy can be transferred, changed into other forms, and/or move in different direction. This can also be applied to heat energy as we can not created or destroyed heat energy, but we can transfer, convert and/or move heat energy around. \n\nTherefore, a combination of both time periods; i.e., immediately", "answer": "E: see things differently"}

By not studying in a way that enables him to learn, understand, and internalize information, he was not doing anything to actually allow him to achieve a perfect grade. Thus in order to achieve a perfect grade, he should have spent some time socializing and engaging with other classmates so that overall he is a better student.\n\n### Other Instructions:\n\nInput: The man knew all the laws and wasn't sure what he should be doing in order to not get a ticket, what was best for him to do? Choices:  Obeying all traffic laws correctly A: breaking laws B: learning to break laws C: not driving D: speeding E: getting a ticket\nRationales:\n1. We can begin by eliminating the options that do not pertain to learning. These are A, B, C, and D.\n2. This leaves us with E, \"getting a ticket.\" Since the man knows the traffic laws and doesn't know what to do to avoid a ticket, the best option is E, getting a ticket.\n\n#### Instructions\nAnswer with what option is provided after the problem statement and rationales.

Chocies:  A: Automobile accidents B: getting tired C: eye strain  D: car crash E: backache\n### Response: C: Eye straine\n\n### Rationale: \n 1. The question indicates that there are pain involved in driving. It seems clear that the pain would be related to the driving itself versus other health problems like getting a backache. \n\n2. The options mentioned eye strain and backache, so the answer must not include either of these. \n\n3. The options mentioned getting tired and car crashes, but both of these options include backaches, so we could not decide which of them could not come after driving a car if backache is involved. \n\n4. We can eliminate getting tired from the options because 'getting tired' and 'getting a backache' are mutually exclusive. \n\n5. So, the one answer which matches the question and does not include backaches is 'eye strain'\n\n### Input :- What would an automobile accident result in?

This was supported by the passage which said that the poor man only had to eat the dinner one time to throw up. This indicates that he already had some health problem.

In particular, the Sahara Desert, is one of the hottest deserts in the world because of its lack of precipitation. \n\n### B: The North Pole - The North Pole is known to have a permanent snowfall. In fact, the North Polar circle only experiences temperatures above -18\u00b0C during the summer months. This means that any temperature above -18\u00b0c would be considered 'temperate' which is how we define the term'snowfall'. \n\n### C: The roof - A roof is typically covered in snow and is located at a higher altitude compared to the ground. This means snowfall is more likely to occur. \n\n## C: Canada - Canada is located in the Northern Hemisphere which means that much of Canada experiences winter. \n\n## E: The surface of Earth- The surface of the Earth can be covered with snow.

Explain your answers thoroughly.\n\n### What happens to the conscience of a person who has been caught commtitting a murder depends entirely on what type of action they took to hide their tracks and whether the authorities found their tracks easily. \n\nIn the worst case scenario for the criminal, he or she would go to prison for a long time, if not the rest of his or her life. Most prisons do not house murderers. They have other criminals who have also been convicted of other types of crimes. In these prisons, inmates may be housed in cells or given more spacious quarters. However, they still live under strict control and regulations that they violate at their own risk. In the best case scenario, the criminal pays fines and is released after serving only a minimal amount of time or not being incarcerated at all. Either way, there is little to no chance that the criminal will be able to live in their everyday life without facing significant consequences. \n\nIt does not matter if the criminal goes to prison if he or she is caught and their reputation or social standing is also tarnished due to bad press reports, public humiliation of any sort, family estrangement, and other life disruptions. Whether the criminal pays a heavy price in fines or is actually sent to prison, they will always have to live with the knowledge that they did something terrible if they are caught. Additionally, knowing for certain that they are a criminal will change their perspectives and way of life forever.\n\nThe person is almost certain to live with the fear of getting caught with such a notorious criminal past for the rest of his or life.

{"text": "In all likelihood it is an 'anthology'. An anthology comes from the Greek 'anthos' meaning 'flower'.\n\n### Rationale\n\nFrom the context of the question, the question suggests that'show on television about the ranger loved flowers', so the next day we got to watch the same character and storyline with a gardener and that gardener also loves flowers. So a show about a ranger would have flowers as a central theme, so its pretty much certain to be an anthology rather than a 'countryside' show or any of the other options.\n\n### Input\n\nWhile driving to work the driver found out that his car's fuel gauge was completely empty.  What was it that he found out? Choices:  a) a new job b) the time c) a promotion d) a dead battery e) the fact that he needed to fill up his car\n\n### Answer:\n\nIt is b, the driver found out that he had a new job. Why do we say so? The last paragraph read: When he first started driving, he felt so happy. He fantasized while driving to work about his new place. He thought about what he was going to wear that day. He thought about new projects he was going to take on. He also thought about getting a new car!\n\nThe first sentence read: He did a good thing this morning. He got to work early. He saw the alarm clock and felt excited. When he first started driving to this job, it made his day so happy.\n\nReading the above, the text mentions:\n\nNew job - He's excited\n\nLikely to take on new projects - He's excited to find what he will do next to improve the company\n\nNew car - He feels like getting one\n\nWith these clues, it would seem that the second paragraph of the text mentions that the man, got a promotion or a new job.", "answer": "B: anthology"}

Choices: K1: he had K2: his\nRationales: We know that he was \"poor.\" This means that he is in a situation of having limited to no money, so by default he has \"few dollars\".\n\nThis means that we can eliminate A1, B2, C2, D1, D2. We want a word that can only be filled in by \"he\" since \"his\" cannot follow \"he\" because \"his\" is the possessor/subject of \"money\" and has to go to \"him\"; furthermore, we want a word that has to do with himself, not his external things.\n\nSince the sentence talks about \"his poverty\", we want a word associated with \"he\", not \"who\" or the like, which eliminates G1, I1, F1, K1.\n\nWe are left with two options: A2 and B1 but A2 makes more sense because being poor doesn't necessarily mean that he has no money.

It is treated through various processes to make sure it is potable (suitable for drinking), which is the \"water supply.\" Water purity refers to how clean or safe the water is. Water bills indicate how much water you used and are a bill for the supply of water. Water heaters are the most common and efficient way in homes to have hot water in your faucets and showers.

This also shows that there is no seal within the Antarctic.  \n\nThe second to last option, \"penguin\" is also incorrect. This is because the Antarctic has a wide range to many penguin species. This animal is also capable of adapting to many environments. Penguins are more likely to be on the Antarctic side rather than away from there.  \n\nThe polar bears are a land mammal, and is not likely to be found on the Antarctic.

This indicates a'menu', 'lunch counter', 'buffet', etc. However, there's no mention of these, but rather, the'red bridge' being the reference location. This could mean that the red bridge is the one underneath the restaurant, indicating that it could be either on or across the river so red bridge in this context could mean a ferry bridge as well as any other bridge that appears in red.\n\nNow, the next thing to be understood is the restaurant serves'red fruit' to which options B and H could be possible. Red might suggest that the fruits serve are strawberry red or blood orange fruits. \n\nOption A does not make sense as it doesn't fit the context; we do not live in a san fransico refrigerator however refrigerators do have fruit.\n\nThe last is option C, which indicates that a refrigerator is across the road which is unrelated to the question however as we stated before, we do not live in san francisco, rather, the possibility of an orange or red colored refrigerator could be plausible if it was located on the bridge. So we can eliminate this option.\n\nThis leaves us with options B and H for consideration. \n\nHowever, option H doesn't make sense because while the red bridge might serve red fruit, the bridge is not the place to eat. Therefore, the red bridge is there simply to take the fruits to their location of consumption. Therefore option B is the correct answer and the red bridge is a marketplace.\n\nAnswer: B: a san Francisco Marketplace\n\n### Input and question: Which is more funny, a breeze or a butt or a shovel?

Choices: A: mt washington B: the green mountains C: a forest D: the countryside E: the city \n\nResponse 2:\nGo to a forest.\n\nRationale 2: Most forests will not play music while you are hiking.

Tommy's mom was angry.   What did Tommy, do after dinner? Chocies:  I: get up out of bed II: go outside III: play outside IV: stay in his bedroom V: go down to the dining room\n\n###Response:\n\n###Rationales:\n\n1. Tommy's mom made him go to his bedroom to stay until dinner. This means that Tommy has to stay in his bedroom for the rest of the day. So, he can't stay in his room or get up out of his bed.\n2.

In this case, age 15 means that Darion has to start learning how to drive. \n2. He is 15 years, old, which is the same age as his parents. \n3. He is also not 14 years old. \n4. They are in the same family, so, he wants to get a drivers license like his parents did.\n5.

It doesn\u2019t have enough employees\nRationales:1. The question specifies that it is the company that the speaker doesn\u2019t like, thus it does not include any mention of its size. 2. Although the question specifies that it doesn\u2019t matter how large the company is, the answer could apply to any aspect about the company that the speaker dislikes, including its policy regarding employee treatment, whether it pays well, or the number of employees it has.\n\n3.  The question specifies that the speaker feels that the company is too big. In other words, they feel that it is too large in volume. Thus, it must be one of the other answers. 4.

Incomplete statements are those statements that are too vague or lack important bits of information, and can leave readers with unintended meanings. Below is a list of all the answer choices. These answer choices are all statements that could be performed by people.\n\n### Answer: In the given statement, an application does not name the applicant, the job applicant, or the referee. Thus, it is not clear who 'confirms' the reference unless it is made clear that the referee performs the action. Therefore, the answer choice E: refuse should not be an option for the answer to this problem.\n\n### Correct answer: C\n\n### Input - The problem statements here is only half a sentence. Hence it contains a lot of gaps and ambiguity. For eg - Who is the job applicant? Who is the referee? What did the reference say?\n\n### Response - The job applicant does not have any responsibilities. This is what the given problem states. However, what if the referee provided false information or the reference provided different information? What if the referee provided misleading information? Or, what if the referees didn't respond?\n\nThe job applicant has the right to know who the referee is so that he can prepare for the interview and question the referee.\n\n### Solution- As there is a lot of ambiguity in this problem we can't draw any conclusion based on the limited information that we have.\n\n### Correction - The application needs to confirm who the referee is. If the reference is a person who is not reachable or not cooperating, then he needs an email, address, phone number, or office address so that he can try to contact the referee.\n### Rationale - There is limited information to confirm the referees.", "answer": "C: deny"}

If we look at each choice, we can eliminate answers at a time, based on the given text.\n\nWe can begin with answer choices A: Acrylic painting and E: watercolor painting, which are forms of painting. We then eliminate C: pencil drawing, since pencil drawing is not a painting. Therefore, we are forced to make a decision between A or E, which refers to types of paint. These are not likely choices given the problem.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B, Charcoal is used In the artist paintings.\nAnswer: B : charcoal\n\n### Input : How do the clouds look around the storm front?

{"text": "The area 'likely' to contain a large village is the 'rural area.' A village by definition is a settlement with less than 1,500 people, villages often form into larger settlements which people refer to as towns or cities. Large towns and cities will rarely have a village; they already have a greater population than a village can accommodate so they continue to grow; however, a village will rarely turn into a large town or city when it has no space to grow or accommodate its growing population. \n\nThus, the answer must be rural area. The next choice which must be eliminated is 'C' Suburbs, a suburb is a residential area located at the periphery of an urban center; therefore it is an area inside of or bordering on a large town or city.

He provides a vivid description of how different cultures view the significance of marriage. In some places in the world, marriage is considered a significant cultural experience that is seen as something more than a romantic union; other places consider this way of thinking to be nonsense. In his opinion, people in the latter group are the ones who are actually more committed to marriage as they have the opportunity to think twice about what it actually means: a life-long commitment to unconditional care and love of their partner and children. This also helps them realize the importance of honesty, as they have no choice but to be honest because being dishonest leads to divorce. According to the author, this idea is very appealing to most people and is the reason why they get married. As they don't even want to think about becoming divorced and having to deal with the repercussions, most people go through the marriage process because they do not have the option to do otherwise and because it is what their peers have been doing for years.\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2015/apr/11/society-pressures-trap-married-life-love](https://www.the-guardian.com/shortcuts/shortcuts-15.1485469458.pdf), April 30 2020\n\n### Demostration:\nA, Love.

The phrase \"trying their hardest\" indicates that the stores are trying really hard to try and convince the women to buy as much as products.\n\nAs a result, the stores are trying to lure the women into thinking that if women buy more products, they would be able to get more money. \n\nWe can eliminate C: Go shopping because it doesn't say that they will actually get money after purchasing the items. It also doesn't say that the stores will be trying to convince the women that if they buy more products, then they would be able to go shopping.\n\nWe also eliminate E: Save money because it says that since the stores trick women into buying products, then the women would not lose money. This implies that they would actually gain money. Also, the phrase \"more money\" in the middle of the question provides more information about the context of how the stores are trying to convince the females. The phrase \"more money\" doesn't say that saving money is the point of the stores tricking women in purchasing the products, but rather to tell the women to buy more products to get more money. Consequently, the women would not be saving money from this question.\n\nWe also exclude B: Pay money because it says that women need to pay money for things they purchase, but it doesn't give any information regarding how much money they are actually getting from buying more products or whether or not the stores are trying to keep the women from paying too much or getting cheated out of their money.\n\nThe correct answer is A: Get money because the question says that the sales make it seem that if the women buy more products, then the women will get money.\n\nAnswer: A: Get money\n\n### Instructions:\n\nInput: What will you say to her?.

{"text": "The only answer that makes sense is \"B: gulf of mecca\".\nA: This is not an option, because fresh water sharks never migrate between continents, they stay in fresh water.\n\nB: Finding a shark anywhere is uncommon, even if they found a shark in the Gulf of Mexico, it would not have been migrating between Continents. The Gulf of Mexico touches North America and South America, this would make it difficult if not impossible to migrate from one continent to another.\n\nC: This option seems impossible because the wording of question and answer is asking the biologist found a shark in what area, not the area it was in at the time. \"Migrating between continents\" infers that the shark was in a different area at one time, than another time.\n\nD: In this case this is a correct answer. Biologist found the shark in a television program (documentary possibly). This is true and makes sense.\n\nE: This is correct. Even though this might seem illogical to many, the shark was migrating and traveling over the coral reefs to reach another location.\n\nSummary of response: I think that it would be interesting to see how sharks change and the evolution they experience in order to survive. They change over millions of years, but they don't change that much in a single lifespan. Therefore, when a shark starts to change, it is going through a lot of difficulty and stress.\n\n### Input; Answer:What is a good way to get over an embarrassing phone call? Choices A: Have lunch with a friend. B: Avoid answering the phone. C: Make an emergency call. D: Try telling it to an adult.

A better course of action would be to avoid answering the phone so that one can get used to the situation. One can always make an emergency call if one feels distressed.

So, he joined the theater group. We can make some simple changes in his life by making some lifestyle changes. He wants to have something in his life besides the football team which means outside and non football related. He didn't change something in the football team rather he moved to the theater group.

It can be used as a noun or an adjective. It could also be used as an adverb. For example: it's a very heavy book. Here the context means it has a great deal of weight. The second example is: I bought a light coat to be able to wear it all summer. However, a heavy coat would be too warm and uncomfortable all summer long. The meaning in this case is that the coat has more weight than a light coat.\n\nMore and Less have different gramatical structures \"More money is spent on education than on health care.\" \"You will need to put more effort into solving this difficult problem.\" \"The new baby requires less diapers than you think.\" \"The weather will be less windy tomorrow.\"\n\nIf you can't say more or less in a sentence, think about which word would be correct. Using a grammar and spelling checker, they could see if the word has been used correctly. (It shows \"more\" and \"less\" are always interchangeable) If you say \"put down the less money\" or \"You will have to put down more effort,\" it is not correct.\n\nChoices:  Choices  A: more  B; less  C: less, D: more E: little\n\nThe correct answer is E: Little", "answer": "C: freezer"}

However, we already learned in the last question that 'human body' would not be an appropriate response since it would not be the best choice for places where disease could spread. This leaves us with 'rug' and 'hospital'. \n\nConsidering 'rug' is not a location where people are frequently exposed, but rather a fabric/surface it makes no sense to use in the options.

{"text": "Answer the question given in the problem.\nRationales:\n1. From the question, we can clearly determine that our goal is to do something. This'something' is not stated directly in the question, but can be understood based on the surrounding information. It's important to note that this something is clearly not killing or terrible or whatever else the student writes because these are not appropriate for the given context.\n2. The given sentences contain key terms and phrases that help us identify the correct answer. For example, the sentence 'You primary method is combat' could be interpreted as our method to reach our goal.\n3. The phrase 'combat' itself relates to the concepts of war and conflict, so this suggests that our goal may involve war or conflict.\n4. Additionally, \"your goal is to do what?\" suggests that our goal must involve a \"to do\" action.\n5. From this information, we can easily eliminate A-C because they do not involve any form of 'to do' action.\n6. Option D seems a little bit out of scope because the question said 'to do' and that does not require any degree of killing to be done.\n7. Therefore, we can select option E, as our final answer.\nAnswer: E: fight\n\n### Input 1:In war, a soldier's primary method is to fight.\n\n### Response 1:Answer the problem given in the question.\n\n## Rationales for Solution 1:\n1. The given information states that a solider's primary method is fighting. It also states that your goal is to do something using the primary method of fight. Therefore, it's fair to assume that you should fight your way to reaching your goal.\n2. The phrase 'to fight' itself can imply a literal form of fighting that is typically what we think of when we think of wars or conflicts.\n3. Furthermore, the sentence 'in war, your primary method...' shows that war is the primary context of the problem which suggests that we should expect a conflict resolution type of solution for the question.\n4. The last sentence 'but your goal is to do' shows that there is more to the problem than just fighting, suggesting that we shouldn't just assume that we can fight our way through the war to reach our goal. Instead, we must find a more creative strategy to reach our goal. \n5.", "answer": "A: conquer opponent"}

Choices: 1) wash car, 2) change oil, 3) clean it, 4) vacuum it, 5) clean the windows\nRationales:\n1) Wash car: While washing your car can help to remove some of the dirt, grime, pollen, and dust buildup that accumulates over time, this cannot be considered a preventative measure against rusting car. If rust formed on your car, you would not be saving your car from being damaged by washing it; you would actually likely be ruining it.\n2) Change oil: Changing the oil regularly will help prolong the life of a car as the oil needs to be changed after a certain amount of miles have been run on the car or a certain amount of time has passed. This can be used as a preventative measure towards potentially having to repair a damaged engine as the oil will be changing more frequently due to the shorter distance the water can travel in the oil. This is because water and oil are two liquids, unlike oil and metal, which can mix, creating something known as sludge. Sludge is a black substance that will eventually damage the engine of a vehicle. Since the water in the oil can only travel so far, the oil will eventually reach the \"dirt level,\" or the point where there isn't enough space left for the water to travel into. When that happens, the oil will break up and cannot lubricate the engine as well anymore. This results in the oil being more susceptible to sludge which then leads to engine damage which costs a lot of money to repair.\n3) Clean it: While cleaning your car is good for keeping it looking nice, it cannot be considered a preventive measure to avoid corrosion. In addition, cleaning dust and dirt from the outside of your car is not going to do much for the inside of the car, where corrosion often", "answer": "B: frustration"}

However, the text makes it clear that he was expressing dissatisfaction about bringing what he needed. \n\n1. The options presented all involve food or drink. The speaker did not need food or drink since he had brought it himself, not the other way around.\n2.

{"text": "C\n\n### Rationale:\n1. The word choice here is a little tricky, as \"procreation\" could refer to many things, including making babies, continuing a family tree, and the like. However, the statement specifies procreation, and \"having a party\" doesn't have anything to do with procreation.\n2. \"Hear the crowd go mad\" is redundant. One hears a crowd anytime they are present, and \"mad\" doesn't have any relation to procreation. \n3. \"Create success\" has something to do with procreating and could refer to becoming successful while making babies, but this doesn't necessarily mean the person procreating is successful. \n4. \"Reproduce\" is a synonym for \"procreate\", but it doesn't apply to every procreative act. There are so many ways to procreate, and \"Reproduce\" doesn't say anything about whether a person's attempts at procreation were successful.\n5. This leaves us with \"procreate\" and \"have a party\".\n6. The sentence clearly indicates that procreation succeeds in \"hearing the crowd go mad\". We can then conclude that partying and loud music have to do with procreational success.\n7.

We know that stories can be found in books and the forest has tons of books which are usually used to read stories.\n4.

Option 2 can be eliminated because there is no need for a ball when you have a wand.<br/>\n3.

Choices: 1 A: He watches so many action-movie prequels. B: He has an Xbox. C: He has too many text messages. D: He has too many Twitter followers. E: He has a Facebook page.\nRationales: A lot of people use Facebook, Twitter, Xbox's etc. Therefore it isn't a distraction. \n\nThe sentence suggests that he has a hard time focusing on his studies so it must be something that distracts him constantly. The question specifically asks for something that distracts and not necessarily what distracts him so therefore it must be something that is outside of his control.\n\nSince he can't control the number of twitter followers or Facebook users the only valid answer is \"He has too many text messages\"\n\nAnother possible answer is he listens to too much rock music but the question asks for what distracts him hence the number of rock songs shouldn't distract him it should be a constant so therefore he must be getting 1000s of text messages.\n\nThe rest of the answers don't fit either. A: He watches too many action movies and B: He has an xbox these should be distractions too but the question specifically asks which distracts him so A and B answers are invalid.

{"text": "Sean was lying about being a body in the morgue, but he was very afraid. He constantly worried about being found out. That makes the answer D: problems.\n\n### Answer: D: problems\n\n### Instructions:\n* He told us the difference between the subject and object of a sentence.\n* He told us how to improve his writing skills.\n\n### What might you be able to help him with? Write a response that appropriatley completes the request. \n\nInput : We can improve his writing skills by how,? Choices: 1. teaching him parts of speech 2. correcting punctuation 3. explaining sentence structure 4. explaining the difference between the subject  and the object in a sentence.\nOutput: We can improve his writing skill by explaining the difference between subject and the object in the sentence.\nExplaining the difference between subject and object in the sentence will help him learn how to make a well written sentence properly. It is because that it has a role of making a sentence properly.\nExplaining or making a difference in between a subject and object in the paragraphs or sentences will make the object or the subject sentence better by identifying the correct grammatical terms or by using appropriate words and verbs.\nExplaining differences in the between a subject or object will help him to understand it better and correct the sentence and understand how to write the right object and the subject better and make the sentence better by knowing the difference. \n\nAnswer:\n\n1. In a sentence, the subject of the sentence is the person or thing that is doing something. The object is the person or thing being acted upon. For example, in the sentence, \u201cThe cat sat on the mat,\u201d \u201cthe cat sat\u201d is the subject, and \u201cthe mat\u201d is the object. \n2. To identify a subject, ask who or what is doing something. To identify an object, ask what or whom something is being done to. \n3. The difference between a subject and an object: Objects receive the action, while the subjects do the action.\n4. For example; \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d is the subject and \u201cyou\u201d is the object. \u201cYou are the subject\u201d and \u201cthe birthday cake is the object\u201d.\n\n### Answer", "answer": "C: being found out"}

The phrase, \"made sure to clean the dust\", and \"dust on his television\" are key phrases given in the question. Therefore cleaning the dust must be done on the \"TV\"\n3. Looking at each of the options (A, B, C and D), we can eliminate (TV) because there is no mention of TV in any of the options and the options already mention all parts of home other than TV.\n4. Since TV is not mentioned we cannot eliminate Corner, so we make it our guess.\n5. All of the other options (attic, corner, they can't clean) are unnecessary because we know we need to clean the dust of a TV.\n\n6. Hence, the Answer is C: corner\n\n---\n\n### Instructon and Demonstrations \n\n### Input1: On the list there were over 20 what? Choices: shoes A: socks B: hats C: shades D: glasses E: clothes\n\n### Demstration1: The question asks us to select option among the given options. 1. The phrases \"over 20\" and \"socks\" are key clues that are provided in the question. This indicates that the number of items to select will be more than 20. 2. Out of the options available (shoes, hats, shades, glasses, clothes), the answer could be either 'clothes' or'socks'. 3. The question asks us to pick from the list rather than making out own options. Hence we select clothes.\n\n### Input2: He looked at them for quite some time before making a selection of which one he what?

{"text": "Sitting too close to the TV may cause strain, blurry vision, and/or headaches.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The word 'pain' means more than just a headache, and 'pain of any kind' is being asked about.\n2. Cases of headaches are common among adults who sit in front of the TV for long hours.\n3. Adults who watch too much television are often overweight. Therefore, sitting to close is likely to cause headache.\n4. The last option mentioned is laughter. It's unlikely that laughing while watching the TV would cause back problems or injury, since they would only be caused by prolonged hours of sitting.\n5. Based on the above, Option D i,e, headache, is the likely correct answer here.\nAnswer: D) Headache\n\nInput: The word was not heard.

Choices: A: They tapped their left ear B: They touched their left ear C: They touched their right ear D: They tapped their right ear E: They touched their left leg\n\n### Rationale:\nThe word was not heard. When people couldn\u2019t here they taped their left ear, and If left it would go away, means that if they tapped their ear it would go away.\n\n### If someone couldn\u2019t hear, they would either tap or  touch their left ear, which would go away after they finished touching it. The choices represent this.\n\n### This is what the riddle says:\n\nSo, option A, 'Tap'. The answer would go on to be: 'and if left it would go awat.'\n\n### The next statement says:\n\n### This makes the choice B.\n### Therefore 'Tap' and 'touch' are eliminated.\n\n### The last question says If they couldn\u2019t hear they would either tap or touch their left ear, the left ear is tapped.\n### And this means that the correct answer is B: they touched their left ear.\n### The question ends with 'they touched their left leg', which is incorrect.\n### Answer: B) they touched their left ear", "answer": "D: headache"}

What will he do at work? Choices: A: study B: work C: manage D: make money E: get a loan\n\n### Rationales: 1) The question only lists positive traits. The only negative trait from the options is E, which is 'get a loan' and is too specific. This makes it more likely that the negative word from A-D is true, which is 'work' as 'work' is not specified in their positive traits and the sentence implies that the person already knows this will happen.\n2) 'Getting a loan' does not seem likely if you are good at math, as it would require an understanding of the financial system that would only be necessary if you were pursuing a higher role in a bank or investment firm. It is also not necessary only one of'study' or'make money' is good at math, so it does not make sense to eliminate options B and D. It's likely that you would study math in some capacity, then use your knowledge of math to make money in math based careers.\n3) 'Work' is likely in 'business/advertising,' where you would most likely need a degree to get the job. \n  4) It's unlikely to be in 'finance', as this is typically a higher role and 'work' would not be necessary here.\n5) It's unlikely in 'engineering', as 'work' is needed.\n6) It's unlikely for 'IT & Computer' where 'work' is needed and the degree is necessary.\n\nAnswer: B: Work", "answer": "B: late for work"}

This answer is found through elimination, since there are four letters.\n5.

The options (A, B, D) are all things that sick people do, and B states to vomit, another sign of feeling sick.\n2. We can eliminate the options (A, C, E).\n3. If you begin to feel sick, your first reaction would be to call an ambulance. Keeping that in mind, it would be unlikely you'd feel sick enough to have to stop the car to vomit. You'd probably pull over to the side of the road to vomit, which is the same action as in options B and C.\n4. Therefore option B would be the only real option.\n5.

{"text": "C: building\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The question asks where people are likely to find food. A likely place to find food is in a grocery store. There are restaurants that people do not frequent to obtain their food.\n\n2. While opera may be a venue that food is made available within, the primary reason you go to the opera is not to consume food. The same is true for art galleries, churches, symphony halls, community centers, etc.\n\n3. In buildings, there may be a restaurant or cafeteria that is frequented by its employees to obtain their lunch during the workday. There may be a dining area, coffee shop or pantry in which employees may enjoy a snack or have a small meal. Food that is prepared in a household could contain additional ingredients to enhance a meal, but that doesn't mean that the food originated in a building. Food that is obtained in a building is likely because most commercial areas have food services on their premises.\n\n4.  A: opera -- while it is a building, the reason food is available is because it is meant to be a place of entertainment. Food can be bought and eaten at an opera or theater.\n\n5. B: supermarket -- supermarkets sell food but that is not the primary reason people go to the supermarket. Food is bought at supermarkets, but they are not frequented to obtain food. Supermarkets sell non-food items, as well, and that could be a reason to go to the store.\n\n6. D: conference -- conferences are places that people go to learn new things, discuss matters, and network. While food is often necessary to sustain life, food served at a conference is not likely to be consumed at a dinner party.\n\n7. E: apartment -- an apartment is a domicile. Food is likely to be obtained by going to the local grocery store.\n\n### Answer:\n\n### C: building\n\n## The task below describes multiple choices and directs that a particular choice is requested. Write a response indicating that the selection is the correct choice.\n\n### Task:\nInput: The three young adults on the trip shared a suite with a living ______ at the host college campus.

{"text": "C\n\n### Explanation:The key here is to understand the wording of the problem.  The question does not say a field containing a building, but rather \"contained\".\n\nA:  playground -- this does not have to do with the size or boundary of the field, so it is a wrong answer. \n\nB:  mexico -- this is not even in or around a building, so it is not what is looking for here.\n\nC:  town -- this is not what is looking or at least it not necessarily the correct location. \n\nD:  world cup -- again, while that is associated with a building, it does not necessarily have to be.\n\n### Input\nThe problem tells us that \"You can't do one after another without interruption.\" What does the writer mean by 'interruption?' A: Break B: Stop C: Break is a right answer C: There is no answer, interruption is not mentioned in a question.\n\n## Explanation\nBreak, stop, and break are right answers and an interruption is mention inside the question.\n\n## Other\n\n### Input\"You have to take a break every hour.\"  _______ breaks are generally advised.\" Choices: A: 5 B: 10 C: 7 D: 2 E: 3\n\n### Answer \"C\"\n\n### Input When she was a girl, Mary preferred to play sports than to do homework.

{"text": "Answer:\n\nE: spending money\nBecause getting paid causes the desire to spend money\n### Rationale:\n1. The question is looking for the answer that includes a verb.\n2. The given choices include sorrow, happiness, frustration, and paying bills.\n3. Of these, only paying bills includes a verb. Therefore, it is the correct alternative.\n\n\n### Instructions\n\nGiven a short description of an event or activity, choose the correct answer that correctly completes the description. The events are presented in a series and the correct answer follows each.\n\n### Example:An elephant and its rider were _____________________ in the swamp when they spotted a snake in the brush.\n\n### Answer:A: stuck\n\n\n### Example #2:The zookeeper was _____________________ of the animals during their feeding time. \nAn answer that could complete the sentence is:C: responsible for\n\n### Rationale\n\n1. The word \"of\" as used in the paragraph can indicate possession. Thus, an answer that could fill this space, therefore completing the sentence, would be the noun of the subject. In this case the animals, as they are responsible to the zookeeper.\n2. Answers that fit this pattern are \"for\" and \"of\" as seen in the previous example. So, the correct answer choice is C: responsible for.\n3. Answer B: taking care of is incorrect. An item can't be in charge of another item, especially when the other item is inanimate.\n4. Answer D: taking care of suggests it is taking care of them, which doesn't make sense since they're animals, not people.\n5. Answer E: guarding is wrong since the sentence does not present the need for protection.\n\n\n## Questions\n- 84159948870122\n- 84231365566295\n- 84536241252426\n- 84654240070693\n- 84765816063885\n- 85120370467890\n-", "answer": "C: happiness"}

'Buy' means Sarah is a buyer who is deciding on what to buy.\nThere are a lot of 'piece of furnitures' in houses, such as front of the door, bed etc. But the text said that Sarah 'was looking for a table'. Tables are furnitures as well and the context states that Sarah is looking for a table.

B)  He can't kick C) He can't swim the breaststroke. D) He can't make a left turn. E) He can't move his arms fast enough\nReason: Swimming is divided into 4 styles. The left turn is just one of the them, however, Tony has no problem making a left turn which means Tony can perform his style well. The 'breath' also means that he can take air, which means Tony can move his arms and legs. We're able to remove these two options from our choices.\n\n### Response & Answer:\nTherefore, the answer would be C) Tony can't swim breaststroke\n\n### Demolition:\nThis question asked \"is the answer \"C\" or \"E\". \"C\" stands for \"Tony can't swim Breaststroke.\" \"E\" stands for \"Toni can't move his arm fast enough.\" Then, \"C\" is the answer. \n\n### Instructions:\nThe following question is based on the passage you have just heard.

And also we can see that the option B is written in exactly the same way as missing socks. It becomes distinct by itself and can be eliminated.\n3. Hence the only option which can be matched is option A i.e to buy matching socks\n4. We can also see that both the questions have been posed, which asks about the possible solution to a problem and for the first part.\n5. Since the second question has already provided its option which leaves us with only two options to match and hence option A to buy matching socks will be correct\n6.

{"text": "C: die\n\nRationales:\n\nKick the bucket means to die. It seems more appropriate that the word dying would be used here as it's more of a synonym. If someone is mortal or has mortality they may die. That doesn't necessarily mean they are lacking immortality. \n\nIt is true that the word can die can also imply mortality but since some people are lacking immortallity and can die, it's not the correct response. \n\nDead means dead. It seems more appropriate to use this than the other words because dead people die but if someone is lacking immortality but isn't dead that means they may die. They haven't died so it wouldn't be accurate to choose dead in this case. \n\nMortal is almost completely synonymous with death, except that it is to be used with animate beings. In this case, we know that the given answer is to be used in the context of immortality and not death so therefore a mortal being would be an animate being. \n\nThis is a different meaning of mortal from that usually encountered in the English language. In this instance, mortal refers to being an entity of this earth.\n\nDying is used here to describe someone who is lacking immortalllity rather than dying. Dying in this case would imply that the person is dead. Dying also does not imply lack of immortality in itself. \n\nHence, the correct answer is C: die.\n\n**Rights are granted under CC-BY license.  \nOriginal content by [Takshaka (Taxidou)](https://github.com/takshakaaa)**\n\n### Input :\nSeveral students are waiting for a party bus to take them to the park.\nAs the bus starts to roll, they see a long queue of cars in front of them lined up at a gas station, and as the bus is trying to make its way past the cars, the car at the very end moves to a spot on the side of the road and parks.\nAnother car quickly comes up and takes that spot on the side of road, and so on and so forth.

{"text": "A.\nRationales: As the question states, the husband's wife asks him to stop being married to him and instead, let her marry her former lover. This implies that the husband feels strongly about this relationship and his wife feels just the same, which means the husband, in turn, is likely to feel emotions such as happiness or pleasure. \n\nThe phrase \"even with friends\" suggests that the husband is trying to avoid any negative emotions such as being sad or lonely since he realizes that this decision could have a huge impact on his life. \n\nTherefore, it's unlikely that the husband would feel unhappy with his wife or any other friends, as the question implies. \n\nAs such, the most likely emotions this husband could be feeling are either happiness or pleasure.", "answer": "D: grief"}

He knows this job will be a good fit for him, but he doesn' see all the qualifications they're asking for. \n\n2. The options given are A: acceptance, B: rejection, C: hope, D: less sleep, and E: employment. \n\n3. Hope can mean the act of wishing for something to happen, or the feeling of wanting something to happen. It can also mean anticipation. However, it does not mean getting the opportunity to get the desired job. \n\n4. Less sleep could mean that they're not getting a good night's sleep, but even if they did, it wouldn't affect their acceptance or rejection for the job. If you accept or reject, sleep is irrelevant. \n\n5. Accept means to allow somebody (or something) to do something while reject means to refuse to accept somebody (or something). Therefore, the choice C: Accept is not even applicable in this situation. \n\n6. The answer that fits here is A: Acceptance. \n\n### Rationales:\n1. He knows the job will be a good for him but he don't have all its qualifications. \n2. He doesn't want the job to be rejected but he would prefer the job be accepted than sleep deprived. \n3. If the job was acceptable, they could sleep well.

This means they probably don't like the intermediary third party and they want full control of hiring people on their own. \n\nTherefore, choice C: Accept is clearly not an answer to meet his need or want. \n\nOption A: Acceptance means to let somebody do something.

This leaves us with three choices that are potentially positive or neutral; A, C, and E.\n\nThe question states that the people are being purposeful. Choice A states that they are being \"deceptive\", which clearly does not align with purposefulness. \n\nThis leaves us with choice B and choice D. While both options include words indicating a lack of intelligence, \"stupid\" and \"silly\" are not inherently negative, unlike \"deceptive\" and \"deceitful\". \n\nThe key clues regarding \"agressive\" are that it refers to an individual being active with other individuals. Agressiveness does not necessarily have to be negative or harmful. \n\nThe statement \"People are purposeful in their harm of others\" does not limit the harm to be negative. If people were to intentionally harm another person it could be to protect themselves, which would not be negative in nature.\n\nFurthermore, even if intentional harm were to be negative, we still can't say cruelty equated with being harmful since there are plenty of other forms of harm that aren't necessarily cruel.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer to the problem would be choice C, \"Benevolent\"\n![](../../.vuepress/public/assets/images/multiple-choice-1.png){:.alignright}\n\nAnswer: C: benevolent\n\n## 1.3 - Multi-sentence Question\n\n### Instructions:A man in a 1970s-era black suit and tie is at a bookstore browsing the titles.

We know that a common saying is, \"go forth\", therefore, the answer cannot be A and B as we know that the true common saying is not the same as the false saying given in the question. \n\nThis leaves us with two possibilities; either C or D.

There are four different subject(s) to choose from: English, History, Mathematical studies, or Science (of any kind). Choices:  A : English B C D E F G H: History Math Science\nRationales: First, we can eliminate all of the single choices apart from Science: G, H. \n\nWhy? Because it is most likely the student does not have to take all their electives in each subject that they can take AP courses in. So the student can only pick one, of course they are not taking all the science courses, they are taking a science course, because that is what the student is doing now or they would not be in the situation of being able to do AP courses. \n\nTo eliminate D: History means that this is not an AP course and would therefore probably have no more content than what you learned in high school, and the same goes for any other subjects. So this is probably also not something that a student would take AP courses in at that level. If you ask where the AP courses are in the subject, then again, English, History, Mathematics, and Science seem most likely to fit here. Science (of any kind) is a possible choice. \n\nEnglish, History, and Mathematical studies sound the most likely for an advanced course, and AP courses generally don't count for English because a student would have taken college English or AP English. That is the most likely subject for AP courses in English. If we know that the subject is probably English, Science seems the most likely. Mathematical studies means that the student could take Math or maybe even Physics (in fact, it is likely this one would get in Physics as well", "answer": "D: compete with each other"}

{"text": "The shed is a structure that is built to cover objects, such as tools or lawnmowers and provides storage. We must think about its function and location for what kind of shed it should take place in the yard.\n### Rationales:  To keep things is a phrase that refers to storage. \"In\" indicates that it is inside the house, and \"next to the house\" means that the shed should be next to the house. The \"yard\" in this question is used to describe where the shed should be located in the yard of the house, indicating that it should be placed outside the house. However, the \"backyard\" in this question refers to outside the house. \"Back\" in this question refers metaphorically to the side of the house where no one goes or where people tend to hide things. This information supports the idea that the shed should be placed in the backyard. The \"farm yard\" indicates it could be on a ranch. However, the \"ranch\" in this question is a type of plantation, so this rule does not apply.\n### Therefore, the best answer to this question should be \"B: keeping things in\" because it fits the most of the choices.

To reach the destination means that a ship could go to where it desired to reach. And if a ship can't reach its desired place, it can't go and then be stuck in the mud and washed by a storm.\n\n### Rationale: The options are: `A (was pushed up onto the shore)- could no longer travel` means the ship can't travel further after being pushed onto the shore. This is impossible because a ship can still travel even when it's floating in the water or on land, so an option that says the ship can't no longer travel can't give the answer.\n\n### Option C (became stuck in the mud), implies that the ship", "answer": "C: backyard"}

They went to a school and asked each student which ear they used to listen to music. Then, they took thousands of scans of different students' brains to identify if there were any patterns.   There was no pattern to the students who had been listening to music with their right ear, but there was a pattern to the students who listened to music with their left ear. These people were more likely to have schizophrenia.    We know that the brains of these people with schizoprenia looked different that the brains of normal people. And we know they used their left ear for listening to music. We can reasonably draw the conclusion that 1. There probably is no schizophrenia in people who listen to music with their right ears, and 2. This indicates that people who listen to music on their left ear have a higher propensity of having schizophrenia and 3. Schizophrenia does not develop in people who listen to both ears equally.

{"text": "> The answer is B. Tiredness.\n\nThe question said \"one might instigate civil action.\" The word \"might\" is used, which indicates a possible choice. This could be followed up with another choice that would not be possible. \n\nTherefore, the option that must not be possible is ___.\nAnother way to determine that Option A -  \"complications\" is incorrect is that the wording of the sentence implies that more than one feeling is a possibility. \n\nThere can be a variety of feelings that lead someone to start a civil action. This doesn't necessarily imply that complications might propel someone to instituting civil activity, but it does indicate that multiple other feelings could as well. So, the answer choice ___ cannot be A: complications. \n\nThe only other choice that fits the criteria is \"tiredness.\" The word \"action\" in the sentence refers to the action of starting a civil lawsuit. This implies the concept of \"starting,\" which refers to initial decisions and actions. \n\nTiredness is related to actions that require energy and effort. This indicates that a person isn't feeling energetic or motivated enough to take action in instituting civil action. \n\nSo, the answer is B. Tirelessness.\n\n### Input:\"What has the most importance in this chapter?\" Choices:  A -  The protagonist's brother is 5 years old B -  Mrs. Jones is 66 years old C -  The sister's house is 1 hour away\n\n### Rationales:\n> The correct answer is \"A\".\n\n1: \"What has the most importance?\": The question seeks a specific answer, so there can be only one choice.\n\n2: From the options, we know that \"The protagonist's brother\" refers to Jack, and \"his brother is 5 years older\" means Jack is 5 years old.\nSo, the answer choice that contains Jack is C.\n\n> \"The protagonist is what age, and what is the purpose for  being in the story?\" Choices: A -  The protagonists age is 80 B - The protagonist's age is 60 C -  The protagonist is 20 D -  The protagonist was the first to die in the accident E -", "answer": "C: anger"}

In school, one typically receives assignments in the form of tasks or documents printed out and given to students. \n\nOne possible place to locate such documents is in a binder.

{"text": "B: air \n\n### Justification : \nThe first clue given in the problem is the following: \"she'd sooner...\". This implies that this woman is in some way avoiding something she does not like and would rather do something else instead. She would prefer doing something else rather than having to deal with that thing she doesn't like.\n \n\n**The second clue is the phrase \"the smell of...\", which references the woman's dislike for a strong odor. This phrase suggests that whatever this woman is avoiding probably has an unpleasant odor.\n\n**Lastly, this information is supported by the fact that this sentence mentions that this woman dislikes the smell of the thing she'd rather do. In other words, the phrase \"the smells of\" is a clue to the solution because the author is informing us of the woman's disliked the smell of the things she'd rather do to avoid those things.**\n\nRationales: Perfumes are typically applied by the people wearing it to counter the smell of a body odor. They are not typically used to counter the scent of a foul smell. This therefore rules out option A: perfume, B: air, and E: puddles. \n\nFountains release water, which may not be preferred to avoid the smell of something foul. This rules out option C: fountain.\n\nThis leaves us with only option D: air.\n\nIf the smell of an odor is an unwelcome and unpleasant surprise, then it must be the smell of something that is being avoided. To avoid that smell, one usually has to do something else different. When this woman was asked what she'd rather do, she replied that she'd rather avoid the smell of that thing entirely by'spraying herself with water'.\n\nAccordingly, we know that this woman is referring to the smell of air, making the answer A: air. \n\n\n#### Answer: A: air", "answer": "A: perfume"}

This statement does not mention that he could speak well, it simply means that his vocabulary was of a large size.\n\nIn addition, the statement says that he spoke with confidence and didn\u2019t use his large vocablary, implying that his best skill is in his speech abilities.\n\nThere are no other options in the statement that relate to the question that suggest that he is good at a different skill than he can speak.

If it is gold bullion, then A: jewelers is clearly an incorrect option. Bullion refers to gold in its raw form and is often used for trading and hedging purposes, not jewelry making. Therefore, we can eliminate A.\n\nSecond, let us analyze C: Fort Knox gold. It is possible that the gold could have fallen from a treasure chest or similar but has been melted down and made into bullion. Therefore, option E: treasure chests could also be ruled out.\n\nThird, Fort Knox is a U.S. Army post in Kentucky but not a typical location for a jewelry store. Therefore, we can exclude option D.\n\nBy elimination, we can focus on Fort Knox and gold bullion. If Fort Knox is where the gold reserve is held, then the answer could be D if gold is being kept there as jewelry. However, there is reason to believe this is not the case as we do not know the specific quantity, form factor, or value of the gold.

We can see that *playing marbles * is the only one that could be fun. \n9. So we eliminate *need for rest* from the options.\n10.

A: wires is incorrect because we're not concerned with the wires themselves, rather we're looking for the connection between them.\n3. B: electrical circuit is incorrect because an electrical circuit is simply a collection of electrical conductors as in wires and switches and batteries. It does not include the connection itself.\n4. C: computer network is incorrect because a network may consist of wires, but in this case, the wires are not the crucial factor for answering this question. \n5. D: wall is incorrect because although there may be wall outlets within a wall, the information that we need is not where the wires are located, but rather the location of the connection between wires.\n6.

I disagree with the answer D: hurt feelings because, hurt feelings is already an emotional state and having civil action only means that the concerned group will now be able to take legal action to fight their fight.

Option E: hurting feelings is not an output result of civil action; it is rather the intended intention of the civil action group to begin with. The group only resorts to a legal manner of resolving the problem when other methods have been unsuccessful.\n3. Option A: bad feelings is also a negative emotional state of being which already pre-exists in the group and so this will only reinforce the previous negative outlook of the group.\n4. Option B: confusion. This is something that would have occurred to some members of the group; the civil action group would be taken by surprise and this would have caused confusion because the group will have to understand the way of the legal procedure of civil action.\n5.

This is why you cannot call something 'true' unless you have all the facts to prove your claim. This means that you should not consider something true only if your opinion says so. Instead, only after you have considered all sides and proved your claim, should you call something 'true'. \n\n2. The correct answer is option 2: TRUE.\n\n3.

Although \"classroom \" is used frequently in the sentence, it is not a probable answer due to its vague and vagrant meaning \" classroom \" might relate to \" college \" and may also mean the classroom located in the university. \" library \" and \"university\" both have the exact opposite meaning.\nThe other choices that are implied are \"university \" and \" college \", however they are not correct.\nThe correct answer is \"library \". \"classroom \" and \"university \" both have the exact opposite meanings and their meanings cannot be used in the sentence as both their meanings are not the same as the meaning of \"university \". \n\n### Input : James can do what at the age of 70?

James must climb mountains to be able to do something when he was 70.\n### Explation\nThe question was \" James can do what at 70\", this implies that James will be 70 then he can climb mountains. The choices are implied are \"rube a motorcycle\" and \"climb mountains\". \"Run a marathon\" can be easily rejected being out of the context and also  there is no mention of competing with anyone.\n\"Win a gold medal\" may seem to be the right answer but it is not so for the reason that climbing a mountain is no longer a feat by the time James is 70 and also there is no mention of him participating in any kind of competition.\n\"Travel to an Island\" is something that can be done by people of different ages so it has to be rejected.\n\"Climb", "answer": "E: library"}

Choices:  B: lost it or C: sold it D: bought it F: found it  Rationales: 1.'The artist's money' are the funds that the artist (who is the answer to the question) was originally meant to receive.\n2. The manager is making an effort to get a cut of the artist's money by attempting to get a bigger percentage or a larger amount than what he was originally supposed to receive.\n3.

The artist's manager did not 'find', 'lost', or 'bought' his money. This is because money could only be found, lost, or bought if it were originally possessed. The manager's action here was to try and take a larger portion of the artist' money.\n5. He was attempting this by pretending to be the artist and convincing him that he, the manager, was actually the artist and that he should then receive a larger portion of the funds than the artist. \n6.

{"text": "B is the library because you work in the library\n### Rationales:\nThe question begins by stating the individual desired to have a side chair in an office setting. The individual probably didn't want to have it put there for personal use because he would be the only employee working at that desk, which implies the side chair would be for visitors to come sit in while he worked. This would indicate the side chair would likely be set in the library since it would be the closest and most convenient place for visitors to congregate while at work.\n\n\n### Input:\"I wanted something small\", \"I was able to get a cheap one.\" \"I liked it\", and  \"It didn't go well\".

Choices: \n\nA: its small size\n\nB: the price\n\nC: it\n\nD: the design\n\nE: it worked out well.\n\n### Rational:\nThe question begins with the statement, \"I wanted something small\". This suggests the reason the individual purchased a small item was because he was looking for a product that met that specification. Since the individual was looking for something small, the key clues are the word \"small\" and \"small item\".\n\nWe can then look at the options. A, \"its small size\", implies the individual liked his small item because of its small size. B, \"the price,\" does not make sense here because the individual didn't like the price of his small item. The individual simply liked the small nature of his item. E, \"it worked out well.\" While technically correct, it makes no logical sense to be the answer since the individual stated he didn't like the small size (e.g., \"I liked it\"), therefore, the answer has to be either the first or the second option.\n\nSince the first answer (A) makes sense and the second answer (B) has not been selected, then that means the answer (A) is \"its small size.\"\n### Input: I am looking for a good place where I can sit peacefully and enjoy the view while eating lunch from home.

{"text": "The plastic things are kept away from children\n### Rationale: The statement is talking about children having a lot of plastic, and they might end up in trash. This would be something that is done in a children's home. The children here are in their own homes, therefore, they could not have plastic things in a cupboard because they are not in their own home. If they are in their own home, they could have the plastic things in a cabinet. Therefore, the correct answer is 'A' because it shows that these things are in the home and not the cupboard. In terms of what the thing is, it states that it is 'A person with children might'. Therefore, we can assume it would be a cabinet that should be owned by the family.\n### Input:The room on a ship where people sleep and take off their clothes is what? Choices: A: bedroom B: cabin C: corridor D: dormitory E: suite\nRationales: First off, the passage states that people sleep and take off clothes, hence the room is where people sleep and take their clothes off. The room is on a ship. We know there is a kitchen on the ship by the fact that it was mentioned earlier on in the passage. This means that there is a bathroom on the ship. A bathroom is used to take off clothes, shower, and wash oneself, hence it is a washing room. Hence, the answer to the question is C: Cabin.\nAnswer: C: Cabin\n\n### Input\"He looked over his friends and found which was missing?\" Choices: A: one B: two C: three D: four E: five\n### Rationales: The sentences from the first paragraph imply that he is asking for help in the class.

The sentence from the second paragraph which is 'He looked over his friends, found nobody, and then asked me to step into the class'. The sentence implies the missing friends. In this case, the answer is C: three, as he is missing three of his friends.\n### Input:\"What makes a rainbow?

{"text": "B: pond \n\n### Instructions: Answer the following short answer questions.\n\n### Question: Why is the term \"high stakes\" used for important and often expensive tests?\n\n### Demostration: The term high stakes is used to reflect the need for someone to attain a high grade or ranking. It is also used to emphasize a result that is expected to have a huge impact, or is heavily weighted, so that even a small variance between a high-grade or a low-grade is critical. \n\nThe term is frequently used in reference to school, college, or work related assessments, however it could also be used in a variety of other scenarios\n\nAnswer: The term \"high-stakes\" is used for \"important and often expensive tests\" because the individual that is taking the test wants to do a good job, therefore they put a lot of stress and pressure on themselves, which could result in poor academic performance and inability to pass the test. A bad grade or failure on the test would lead to unfavorable consequences, including the loss of scholarships, jobs, and other opportunities. The loss of scholarships, can result in paying the full retail cost of tuition or not being able to go to college at all. Losing a job would lead to the individual having to find another job, which is usually very unenjoyable. Another consequence would be social embarrassment, if the individual failed the test. This means they would have to explain to their family why they are unable to get the job, attend college, or continue to receive the scholarships. \n\nThus, even a bad grade on the test (the \"high-stakes\") has major impacts on the future and quality of life of the individual.\n\n### Input:\"There was the possibility of rain for the game.

As the question makes no mention of the type of water, \n\n### we can assume that the question is asking us to determine where humans would sit over any type of water. \n\nIn the question, the phrase 'extended periods' suggests that this would be an answer involving someone sitting for a very long time. The options involving any sort of sitting does not provide many other words within the answer to describe an extended period of time. \nAs bathrooms are a place where people typically sit, or where others would sit for extended periods of time (to use the bathroom), we can deduce that the correct answer should be B: Bathroom.", "answer": "A: bathroom"}

E: They\u2019ll be loyal to him forever.\nRationales: We can eliminate 'B.

It was at what time of the day? Choices:  a: breakfast  b: lunch c: dinner d: noon e: midnight\n\n\n### Deductions:\n1. The phrase'more than enough' implies that there were more leftover things than needed to be served or served correctly. 2. The phrase'many people' can only be a characteristic of one specific time of day (mealtimes). 3. The only correct answer choice is breakfast(b). This is because'many people' cannot be a characteristic during lunch or dinner since the restaurant can only serve a certain amount that the kitchen can produce, so many people would not appear. Also, the phrase'more than enough food' can only be used in describing a mealtime breakfast, since during other mealtimes at this restaurant (lunch or dinner) many people may still gather and wait to be served. The phrase'many' people in this case is only describing the mealtime breakfast. Hence, we can conclude that'many people' in this case refers to'meals', and since there are many meals throughout the day, most likely breakfast. 4.

This is because the phrase \"the best restaurant in town\" can only be used to compare restaurants in the town, not across the world. Also, referring to the restaurant as 'the best restaurant' is irrelevant. If the restaurant is good, it is good, and referring to it as 'the best restaurant in town' is pointless.\nThe phrase, \"A local restaurant\" also could be referring to the restaurant across from the library, since it refers to a restaurant in town.

Choices: \n\n\\- A: playing football made him better at lacrosse\n\\- B: playing lacrosse made him better at football\n\\- C: Both playing football and lacrosse made him be better at both sports\n\\- D: Neither playing football nor lacrosse made him have a skill that made him better at both sports\n\n### Rationale 1:\n\nLet us begin by determining how many of the conditions (i.e. how many skills each sport gives) exist between the sports. We see that football does not directly give a skill to lacrosse nor vice versa. So it looks like a condition (i.e. a skill gained from playing football directly made him better at lacroesse) doesn't exist by itself. However, there is a condition exists in the form of \"both playing football and lacroses will make you better at both sports\". By understanding this, we can rule out the possibility that playing football made him better with lacrosse. That leaves us with the options A, B, C.\n\n### Rational 2:\n\nTo determine if any of these two options A, B exist, let\u2019s see if we can create an argument in their favor. The possible arguments would be:\n- Playing football MADE him better at lacrosis (A)\n- Playing lacrosis MADE him better at football (B)\n- Both playing football and lacrois MADE him better on both sports (C)\n\nAs mentioned in the last part 01, B (playing lacrosis made him better at football) is ruled out from the two options A, B, because it doesn't work in the context.

Choices C: cabinet and D: television.\n### Rationale:\n1. What home entertainment device with 12 cables is a cabinet? This is the first and simplest question after home entertainment.\n2. It does not. There is no cabinet that has 12 cords.\n3. Certain components of a home entertainment system typically require cables, such as televisions, receivers, and speakers.\n4.

Choices: \n1) A: work experience 2) B: more patience 3) C: higher level of success 4) D: less experience 5) E: less responsibilities\n\nRationales\n1. Work experience is the experience of doing a particular job.\n2. Work experience is the type of experience that is used to gauge performance in a work environment.\n\n3. Higher level of success is better for a job as it means the individual has had greater past success in their chosen profession.\n\n4. Less experience means less training in a profession or job, implying an inability to perform at the same level as someone with more experience.\n      \n5. Less responsibilities would likely result in a less hectic schedule, which may be preferable for some individuals. However, this does not necessarily translate to being \u201cbetter\u201d in terms of work performance or output quality since it is not an actual job-related competency.\n\n6. Work experience would allow for better performance in a job because it gives one more information about what can be done in their professional capacity.\n      \n7.

In 2011, the number jumped to 42.98 million (which is about15%). In 2012, the number rose to 46.8 (which is about 9% of the population).

Or a name of a part of the bird? \n\n2) Bald Eagles are a national symbol, so it seems unlikely that the question would ask where they are \"safe\". \n\n3) The word \"eagle\" doesn't have a plural form in the statement.

{"text": "What might a kid does with his friend before going playing\nRationales:\n1. The question is asking what the kid might do with his friend before they go to play.\n2. Looking at the options provided, we can eliminate laugh, sit, and entertained, because the phrasing doesn't make sense. These are activities that a person might do with the friend once they reach their destination to play. \n\n3.  Math, meet, and being with friends are all plausible possibilities, but they don't directly relate to going to play. Being with friends is not necessarily about going to play either, it has to do with having friends.\n4. This leaves us with the final option, which is D: play.\nAnswer: D, play.\n\n### Input : The children play with what? Choices: A: ball B: a new ball C: tennis D: football E: a new football\n\n### Response : The children play with.... Choices: A: a ball B: a new bal C: tennis D: a new ball E: a new footballE:  a new football\n\nRationales: Option D, 'New Ball' cannot be the correct answer because the question is asking the children to play with something, it does not end with a new thing.\nOption A, 'A New Ball' is incorrect because the question specifically mentions that the word new cannot be used.\nOption C, 'a new ball' is incorrect because the word 'new' is mentioned in the question but what is new is not the 'ball' but the 'ball' itself. So either the word 'ball' is also new or it is not. If the ball is new, it means another ball is older than it and thus it becomes unsuitable for playing.\nOption D, 'a Football' is also incorrect because the text does not mention anything about a Football. As a Football is an object to play soccer, only the choices that involve soccer to be played is acceptable.\nThus, the correct answer has to be B, 'a tennis'.\n\nAnswer: B, a tennis.\n\n### Question A is: Which of the following statements can be inferred from a sentence?

{"text": "### Explanation:\n\nIn order to be nailed, wood is typically shaped. That is, a hard surface is formed by scraping away the wood by hand or with a machined tool.\n\nPlacing nails in wood generally isn\u2019t considered carving, since carving is more complicated than simply hammering in several nails. It would also be inaccurate to describe drilling lots of holes with nails as carving wood. Carving typically involves shaping hard materials by hand, not just putting objects into materials.\n\nPolishing wood is a completely different process. Polishing means smoothing down the surface of wood via friction using tools such as sandpaper and polishing stones.

{"text": "D.\n\n### RATIONALES\n1. \"hospitals\" are places where people go if they need care, which would likely come with some medical procedures which can start a fire. Thus, a hospitals would likely be more likely to have fire extinguishsers than other places since the patients are not as likely to start fires themselves. \n\n2. \"garages\" are places where people keep their cars or tools. Since there are lots of things that can start a fire, a garage would probably have lots of fire extinguisher, but it's not necessary for every home. Hence, the word \"likely\" is important here.\n\n3. \"Doll houses\" are not likely to have fire exquishers since they are small doll houses. \n\n4. \"boats\" could be a place where a fire would start, but it is not likely that one would start such a fire. Hence it is not likely to have lot of fire exquishers.\n\nHence \"D. Houses\" is the best answer. For a better understanding, let us consider the \"If.. Then\" statement. \n\n1. If there is something very precious, Then there would be a very high probability that the person would keep the object in a safe place. \nSo, If a doll house is very precious to the owner, there would be a high probability that \nthe owner would keep the object safe. But since \"Dollhouse\" is nowhere mentioned in the passage, we cannot directly say that it is a likely place.\n\n2. If a person keeps the thing safe for long time with other possessions, Then there would be an implicit probability of its preciousness. \nIt is said that \"There are lots of fire exting\u00faishers in a doll house\". \nIt is not directly said that the doll house is very precautious, so we cannot say that there is a lot of fire exq\u00fcishers in the doll house itself but it is said that \"in a doll house\".  In other words, there will be fire exquishers in a place where a doll house is placed. This implies that \"In a house, there are likely to be a lot of fire exquishing devices\" but it is not explicitly stated, hence \"It is likely that 'fire exquishers' are in a", "answer": "B: hospital"}

It gets worse as you get closer to a city.\nThe term'michigan' and'map' were clearly not written by a native English speaker\n\n### Output: An expressway suffers from traffic getting worse the closer you get into any city.\n\n### Input and Output:In a car, there are two what, an engine and a transmission? Choices: . A: wheels B: tires C: axels D: seats E: gears\nRationales:In the question, an engine is said to \"help the car reach its goal.\" Whenever an engine helps reach a goal, it is helping the car function and thus also helps the car move. We can thus assume that engines and cars move in tandem.\n\nThe question then says that the \"transmission helps the car when moving forward\". Since the engine also moves in tandem with the car, it therefore follows that the transmission would also move in tandem with the engine and in a way opposite to the engine. A car is thus moving forward when the engines are moving backward.\n\nIf we look at the other choice options, we can eliminate each one as none of them could fulfill the description given in the question. This leaves us with the correct answer of E: gears.\n\nThe transmission functions as a gearbox system that changes the transmission's speed ratio as the car moves forward. When the transmission is in high gear, the gearbox turns less and thus moves slower but farther than if it were in a lower gear. \n\nWhen an engine is moving backward, the car will move the opposite direction as the engine.

{"text": "C: attempt suicide\n\n### Rationale:\n1. The question asked a question in which the person saying bye to another is leaving because of an argument.\n2. The arguments could be either because an individual is transferring another or because the individual is moving houses.\n3. So the choices might relate to either one of the two.\n4. It is known, as said in (2) that both A & B are related to an individual who has left their job or organization as a result of an argument. \n5. Therefore, the answers of 'insulting them' and 'thank god' might not be relevant to the context of 'How might a person address a person who is leaving?'.\n6.

The given options do not directly correlate. The response that is expected here is C: attempt suicide.\n9.

{"text": "The best answer is'sneezing'\n### Rationales:\n#### 1. We can cross out the other options. Sneezing is an action not a state of being.\n\n#### 2.  Looking at the remaining options, it would have been logical for the statement to be 'fatigue, not feeling satisfied' because if the boy failed his report then he would have been upset. Thus the statement would have been accurate by saying that he would have been feeling unsatisfied, which has been asked in option E. \n\n#### 3. Also, option D, 'getting good grades' would have also been an appropriate option. Thus, it is an incorrect statement.\n\n### Option A:\n#### 1.'Sometimes you have to fight city hall' means do something even though you won't be successful, so the most appropriate answer is sneezing, which is the only action mentioned.\n\n### Rationale 1: The correct response is sneezing because the statement refers to a specific action.\n\n### Response 2: If the child in the question was sneezing while working, the result would be that he would not see his report card in time to prevent the mother from seeing it,  but \"city hall\" refers to the authorities or administration of a specific place, in this case the area where the boy was doing chores. \n\n### Rational 2:\nA city hall is an administrative building where a local government office is housed. If a problem were being solved, it would be within the authority of that specific government office rather than a general authority such as the city or government in general. Therefore, the sneezing would not prevent the mother from seeing the report card, because the sneezing did not occur within the authority of the city hall.\n\n### Final Rationale: \nThe most relevant answer is Sneezing because that is the only action mentionned in the problem.\n\n### Answer: B:city hall\n\n### RATIONALES:\nCITY HALL MEANS the building at the seat of a city's administration.\n\nThis answer is correct because it talks about the city hall in the state rather than city hall in the town.\n\n### Question:He thought of everything he lost, how did he feel?\n\n##", "answer": "E: getting good grades"}

Dogs whine in their manner of speaking, whereas humans scream. Dogs howl and coo, whereas humans moan. Dogs don't use words, while humans do. When attempting to quiet your dog, don't be scared to take harsher actions first. Yelling or using a shock collar may be more effective if your dog has a habit of barking at everything, particularly if they are a young dog.

{"text": "A: coal or wood - Coal and wood are often used as fuel for combustion or the burning and release of heat as a source of energy. Burning coal or wood releases heat energy. When we burn a piece of wood, carbon atoms combine with oxygen in the air to form carbon dioxide gas. As a result, the wood releases energy (enthalpy) in the form of heat. Burning wood or coal is a common example of exothermic combustion that produces heat energy.\nA: lava - Lava is a molten solid that typically flows towards the surface of a planet (such as the Earth) or a satellite (such as the Moon). It is produced on the surface of large celestial bodies like stars and large planets via volcanic processes such as vulcanism. Almost all large globular bodies and terrestrial planets have a period of volcanic activity in their past called their youthful stages. Such a period is called planetary differentiation. The surface of these planets become hot enough to melt the mantle material and outwardly force it up to the surface causing lava/magma to be expelled onto the surface of the planet resulting in volcanoes and magma eruptions.\nB: fire - Fire is known to produce heat to warm or warm things. It is a chemical reaction between oxygen and a fuel such as wood, leaves or coal, or any other combustible substances and produces light and heat in the form of energy. Oxygen interacts with elements and reacts with elements to produce different substances, and the products of these reactions are referred to as ash. \nC: wood - Wood is a type of bio-mass or solid-fuel that comes in many shapes and sizes depending upon the species of tree the wood originates from. Solid wood, like the trunks of trees may be used as fuel or timber. Wood is a porous renewable material that is relatively easy to work into various forms.\nD: solar energy - Solar energy is power that comes from the sun. The sunlight contains a range of visible light, ultraviolet light and heat. The sun is about nine and a half million miles away from the earth and rotates around the sun. When solar energy is transferred to the earth, it takes about eight minutes to arrive. Solar energy is usually captured through photovoltaic solar", "answer": "B: fire"}

Alcoholism is a disease, making alcoholics not fully responsible for their actions. It would be unfair to punish someone for something that they cannot control.\n\n### Explanation:\nWhen someone is on probation, it means that this person has legal issues and cannot be in trouble with the law. This implies that they will have to face the consequences of their action if they violate it or break the law. The consequence can be a fine or jail time.\n\nThe statement mentions the wife's probation. This means that she is being punished due to her alcoholism.\n\nDue to both alcoholism and probation, the alcoholic husband cannot rely on his wife as a source of help. The answer should satisfy him.

Since they have a different college, it means college was long ago. There is a possibility that Jake is a different person.\n\nThe statement goes on to say that Jake was having trouble getting with his roommates. We can infer from the context that Jake was living with his roommates in the same college. If Jake was not having a problem with his roommates, he would not seek help outside of the college.

{"text": "A: exhilarated\n### Demo:  \n\nAnalyze the choices:\n1. The key words we should consider are \"cliff\" and \"for a cartoon character.\" The latter probably implies that the cliff-diving is something they've done as characters in a cartoon. This seems to refer to something that happened while performing as a comedic character, like a stand-up comic or an actor in a play.\n2. Therefore, the choices are D: Getting wet, A: Exhilarated, B: Dismemberment, C: Spinal Injuries, and E : Splats. Given that it's the result of something that happens while performing, it's unlikely that it's getting wet. Also, in the context of comedians performing, it probably is not spinal injuries. That leaves us with A: Exhilaration and B: Dismembered. The key words here are \"cliff diving\" and \"performance,\", the only choice out of the remaining three that involves something performed is dismemberment. Hence the answer is option B: dismembered.\n### Demo: \n3. However, cliff diving usually means falling off a cliff without protective equipment or anything else. Usually, there is no one to catch him at the end of the cliff dive either. This probably shouldn't be considered dismemberment or injury. Even though the comedian \"dives\" off a cliff for his performance, he won't be hurt/mutilated/dismembered physically because of it. Injuries occur more likely if one falls off the cliff in real-life, however.\n4. Even though there are probably some comedic injuries while diving off a cliff, \"spinal injury\" isn't one of the popular options or likely options based on our analysis.\n5. The only choices we're left with is \"Exhilarated\" and \"Splats.\" Again, the key words are \"cliff dived\" and \"performance.\" One could assume that Exhilaration means the performer felt excitement or joy while diving off the cliff. This could either be while diving or while looking at and appreciating the natural setting or the beauty of something.\n6. Splats would probably be used if the performer", "answer": "E: splats"}

Now from the statement, we can infer a few things, firstly, that the article was about the uptick in the number of accidents.\n\n### Rationales:  Secondly, the husband was dismissing the article, indicating that he may not be believing in the article altogether. He is dismissing that there could be an increase in the number of accides, which seems highly unlikely but we can't be too conclusive because the statement doesn't say so.\n\n### The only choice that is mentioned in the article is D: Happen often.

Choosing to become depressed would not help that person find new things in life and would only make it harder for him or her to do so.\n\nOption B: Welcome Change: This is a very vague and general choice. Just being willing to change won't help a person find new things in his or her life. A person may welcome change, but that does not necessarily translate to him or her automatically finding new things in life.\n\nOption C: Thank God: There are lots of people who find new things in their life, and most people are thankful, regardless of whether they're finding new things or not. Saying \"thank god\" wouldn't really help a person find new experiences.\n\nOption D: Experience New Things: This choice sounds like the correct answer and would be the best response. This implies that someone is looking for new experiences, specifically.\n\nOption E: Pay Bills: This choice doesn't make much sense. It sounds like an answer that was chosen simply because it made people think of someone who was looking for new things in their life. Paying bills is not what someone is looking for when they're trying to find new things in their lives.\n\n### Solution:\n\nA is not correct. The first sentence of the problem says \u201ca person looking for new things\u201d. This hints us that the choice would be the thing that the person is looking for and there is nothing that the person is looking to avoid.\n\nB is incorrect. \u201cWelcome change\u201d doesn\u2019t make much sense within the context of the problem.

These \"large containers\" are likely referring to storage units within the supermarket, such as bins filled with food items. The options provided are not accurate descriptions of what is in a supermarket, other than the one answer choice that matches the scenario. \n\nOption A - A \"dime a dozen\" refers to nothing else than money. The scenario states that large containers are of great quantity and in every supermarket they have food. The price of one of these large containers is a dime and it is not sold at one dime in every place, so there is no way in which this statement could be true. \n\nOption B - Factory is a place where things are produced. In the question, the supermarket is stated to be a place with hundreds of large containers which could mean that these are the products. There is no evidence to point that in the answer given.\n\nOption C - A garage is a place where people store old things that they do not use anymore and when they need them they need to carry them to the house. In the question, we are talking about a place where food is prepared and it is necessary to have large containers to carry food to the supermarket.\n\nOption D - A warehouse is a place for the storage of different kind of goods and food, though not always, in the question we are talking about hundred of large containers in a place which is different from a warehouse, this makes this option very improbable.\n\nOption E - A \"dime\" is a name of money. If it was a dime, it could only be a kind of \"ten cents\", in the question, it is stated that it was a \"dime a dozen\".

The microwave option is more convenient with less food prep than the stove option--both in terms of effort for the user as well as in terms of effort involved in preparing'microwave-friendly' food. \n\nRationale :  the best answer should be B: effort. The only answer choices containing the word 'effort' are \"time\" and \"food\". Hence, choose the correct answer.\n\n### Inputs : What did the two brothers do in school?

Choices:  A. pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis B. monocyclohexane C. polyethylene D. abalone E. silicone\nRationales: Option B,'monocyclohexane,' is the answer.  \n\n1. The sentence talks about a dictionary, indicating the problem is related to words or their definitions.\n2. The statement says \"John took a look through the Dictionary,\" which suggests he's looking for information contained within it.\n3. The question describes a 'what' (word), which only applies to the vocabulary provided in the beginning of the sentence after the 'dictionary.' Since we now know that he is indeed looking for a word (defined in the dictionary), we can eliminate options that are non-words.\n4. The sentence also states that John thought the word he found had the most letters, indicating that he must have looked for a word that can fit the description or have a lot of letters.\n5. This leaves us with the other options: Monocyclohexane, polyethylene, abalone, and silicone.\n\nOption A is ruled out as it includes 35 letters - 20 letters more than a standard word.\n\nOption C is ruled out because it has less letters than the longest word in the dictionary (Pyrostigmine, 17 letters).\n\nOption D is ruled out because Abalone, a shellfish, is not a word.\n\nOption E is ruled out because Silicone is not a standard English word.\n\nThis leaves us with Monocyclohexance.\n\nReasons for choosing answer b: 1.

A cargo ship transports cargo and it is a receptacle of sorts. \n\n3.

Vertebrates have backbones, so we can eliminate A. From here, we look at the verbs. Birds fly, making B. out of the question. So what about chirping? Not all birds chirp. The same goes for laying eggs. All birds are not flightless, yet not all birds are capable of laying eggs. So the answer is C. \n\nOutput: All birds lay eggs.

We should also note that this is a problem since it's been mentioned by a speaker, which suggests that there's no problem with vegetables in terms of taste or cooking. Hence, we can eliminate options 2 and 3.\n\nWe can also eliminate option 4 since people don't eat what they don't know or don't like.\n\nThis leaves us with options 1 and 5. \n\nAs option 1 deals with not liking the taste of vegetables, it's an incorrect answer.\n\nWe can therefore conclude that the answer which deals with a lack of nutritious foods is option 5.\n\nThe correct answer would be 5: there aren\u2019t enough nutritious vegetables for people to eat.\n\n###", "answer": "C: clerk"}

{"text": "Answer letter \"a\" and explain it in your own words.\n\n### Rationale\n#### Option 1 - Watching tv because there's nothing else to do\n\nThe expression \"when there's no other option\" typically means that something is not desired and is chosen out of necessity or obligation rather than happiness or enjoyment. In this case, the person is watching tv because they have \"nothing else to do\" which indicates that they do not wish to watch tv but they feel obligated to because they have no other option. This indicates that they must be dealing with feelings of boredom or disinterest related to their choice to watch tv which are emotions that typically do not result in pleasurable or fulfilling outcomes.\n\n## Option 2 \u2013 Entertainment\nThe statement that \"I'm watching tv\" clearly indicates that the primary motivation for watching tv is \"entertainment.\" This means that the sole reason why the person is watching tv is for pleasure or enjoyment, which suggests that they do not experience feelings of stress or obligation when deciding to watch tv. Hence, option B in choice of answer is correct.\n\n## Option\n\nOption 3 \u2013 Boredom\n\nThe statement that \"there's nothing else to get bored\" indicates that the person has little options available to them. With regards to the options given, this can only be interpreted as the individual being bored by what options are available to them, i.e., the options available to them do not interest the person and result in them feeling bored.\n\nAdditionally, the statement \"i'm watching tv\" is an indicator that the person is choosing to spend their time engaged with tv instead of doing something they enjoy or consider more fulfilling, as a result, the person is likely to experience feelings of boredom and/or dissatisfaction with what they are watching.\n\nFor these reasons, option C in choice of answer is applicable.\n\n## Option D Get fat\n\nOption D \u2013 Get fat\n\nThe statement that the person is watching tv \"because there is nothing to do\" indicates that they are disinterested or bored and therefore not actively engaging in activities that are more productive or enjoyable. Since tv involves sitting down and actively engaging in a series of images and sounds it is likely for the person to consume larger quantities of food which is a potential result of being in", "answer": "B: entertainment"}

I could say that moving the cars involves driving them, as one person drives the cars but then that is only part of it. I could continue to say that more than one person also is required, and you would have to be very organized to make sure you had the right one on the right place but, you would need to have other drivers that do not know where they are headed and you could say you are moving from one place to another and still not give a complete answer and you are right because the question is too long to be giving this much of an explanation because the answer should be simple and you would only say or tell what the answer is not what the question should be saying.\n\nThe other answers are wrong because you can't tick a person and say I am accusing you, I think it would be something like a ticket or it's all a tick and tic and a tac and tab and so on, and what I am saying is that the statement says cars are given to you but you have to move them or you will stop, and what does it mean?  I could say that moving a car entails driving it and you could do this, you could also say that you stop the cars and they stop but you can't tick someone and say you are not moving forward and this is why, the question says entails moving, which means you are changing your car from one type to another. \n\nAnswer: A: driving\n\n### Input\n\n### Answer\n\n### Rationale\n\nAnswer: B: Road\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Demo\nInput: What did he do in the bathroom?

{"text": "I'm not exactly sure how you determined your answer but it should be C: serious. Shane acted ridiculous and this turned a lot of people off from the funeral. Additionally, when the funeral was taking place nobody knew Shane would be doing a comedy routine.\n\n### Rationales: \nIf your answer includes any word that isn't what the question asks, or the answer doesn't make sense, then it's probably wrong.\n\nIn the question, serious is defined as \"dignified, formal, or worthy of serious attention\" and ridiculous is defined as \u201camusingly or extremely silly, stupid, or absurd\u201d (Merriam-Webster). \n\nHence, we can eliminate  \"solemn\" and \"somber\u201d from the possible answers because neither of these meanings fit with the definitions given.\n\nBecause Shane's joke-filled speech turned off a lot of people, it probably wasn't \"solemn\" or \"somber\" and that also eliminates \"compete\" from the answer options. \"Solemn\" means being without noise and \"somber\" means serious, sad, and gloomy.\u201d\n\nThis leaves us with serious and \"straightforward\" as the only two possible answers. \"Serious\" means \"having meaning or importance.\" This can also entail being solemn and/or somber, as the context of a funeral would cause a certain degree of somber-ness.\n\nThe original question asked for an answer where the expected response was a funeral with somber, serious, and/or solemn behavior. While a person could speak something with humor, that act might not fit the expectations at a funeral.\n\nThe definition given for \"straightforward\" is \"free from subterfuge, evasion, or equivocation.\" It is unlikely that Shane's comedic speech was \"straightforward.\"\n\nWith this, the answer should be C: serious or solemn. The phrase \u201cacted very ridiculous\" as it is in the statement doesn't make a lot of sense. It is a little hard to understand what the author was trying to say, which is why it would make sense to omit that and move on to the second part of the sentence \u201cwhich turned off people who expected...\u201d.\n\nHence, answer should be \"", "answer": "D: somber"}

To clarify, a police officer cannot:\n\n1. Provide protection by securing law, order, & the prevention of crime, as this does not directly involve protecting people.\n2. Arm themselves as this only increases the strength of an already powerful entity, to a point where it can be detrimental.\n3. Direct traffic, as this entails helping vehicles safely move and does not involve preserving lawfulness or maintaining internal security.\n4.

This statement is true since there has been great movies and popularity in them. There is no specific movie that was popular. Therefore, each of the given options is a reason for this. However, people loved sequels refers to the number of sequels that were loved by people and not the number of great movies that people loved. As the statement doesn't say that people loved sequels, it can be excluded from the options.\n\nSo, the only remaining option that is not a reason for the great year for movie is Quality acting.

A building - We can also rule out this answer choice because buildings do not cast shadows. They are built from materials that absorb light rather than reflect it.  C. A bridge - The answer choice 'bridge' is true since a bridge does reflect light and cast shadows on the ground around it. However, in some examples, the shadow of the bridge looks as if it had stepped onto the other side of the bridge or the other side of the road. The bridge and light from the sun, or sometimes a building, form the object appearing to step over the ground.  D. Ground - The answer choice \"the ground\" is also true. All objects with a surface that reflects light, like the ground or pavement, casts a shadow. E. Bright light - In contrast, the answer choice \"bright light\" is false.

This can be interpreted as either \"Protect the child and ensure the child is safe\" and/or \"Protect the innocence of a child\".\n4. Duty of care comes under care for the child.\n5.

B: Opera \u2013 A theatrical performance characterized by singing and dancing. C: Party \u2013 A social gathering marked by joyful celebration. D: Stage \u2013 A raised, open-air platform from which performances are presented. E: Dance \u2013 An artistic display of rhythmic movements of the body to music. \n\nThe choice in question must be a setting or environment where one would often see performers perform.\n\nChoices A, B, D, E, and C are all incorrect.

This is because there is no mention of thoughtful being described in a negative way, meaning if the answer is one of these, it cannot be described positively.\n\nOption B, \"human\", while could be positive and could have an interpretation of compassionate and being thoughtful, is used as a pejorative term. This is because it is a shortened form of \"human being,\" which is considered polite but non-personal.\n\nOption A, \"devious\", is similar to option B, with it's negative use of the word being. This also causes the same issue that option B faces.\n\nOption C, \"strange,\" shares an issue where it can be both positive and negative, but the context used does not have a positive meaning. Therefore, it cannot be chosen as an answer. \n\nSo this leaves us with option A: disingenuous which means 'lacking in honesty' or 'feigning good intentions in order to gain an advantage'\n\nSince the description of \"compassionate and thoughtfull\" is being compared to disingenuous, it would logically be a negative connotation.\n\nTherefore, The answer is D: disingenuous. \n\nAnswer: D: disingenuous\n\n### Input:(Sue) had a lot of stuff for her room.She also had lots of stuff for her closet, and even more stuff for her drawers.She has so much stuff!She couldn\u2019t find anything!

{"text": "The word 'accident' tells us that what she consumed was unintentionally. It suggests that she either didn't know what it was, or didn't think it was poison. Looking at the options given, we can rule out junk food, for obvious reasons.\n\nLooking at the remaining options, we find that 'drinkable' doesn't quite fit. The word 'drinkable' should also imply that it has some benefit to the consumer, like it gives them nutrition or taste. Poison doesn't give you any benefit. It's bad for you, so it wouldn't be a good fit here.\n\nThat leaves us choosing between A:'Antidote' and C:'Antidote' As the statement mentions finding poison in the cabinet and 'thought that it was...', the poison would have been something intended for use in the home, or food that's not usually considered poisonous (i.e., spice). \n\nBoth antidotes and health foods are commonly found in the kitchen. \n\nSince 'antidote' also implies that it's a medicine, it answers the question.

{"text": "If you hit someone with your car, that person could die if the accident is severe. The accident could also result in the person getting injured or hurt. \n\nAside from the consequences associated with the victim, you might also face legal ramifications of a driving offense, such as getting arrested. However, a mild traffic violation might result in only a fine without arrest. (2) In an extreme case, you could also be charged with second degree murder if the accident resulted in someone\u2019s death. \n\nAnswers: There are many answers to this question depending on the circumstances. If the situation involved a serious accident and death, the answer is \u201cdeaths\u201d. \nAnother option could be arrested. If the person hit with your car was a minor, it could result in charges of negligence of a minor. For instance, if the case involved a drunk driver, the driver may be arrested and sentenced to prison.\nThe victim\u2019s death could result in charges of second-degree murder or negligent homicide. For example, a man charged with negligent homicides was sentenced to 7 to 14 years in state prison. \n\nAnother option is that a minor might be arrested. If the case involved a drunker driver or a reckless driver, sentencing may range from a 1 to 5-year minimum prison sentence. \n\nAn alternative answer is that you need to use a lot of gas for the person to get killed. For instance, you might have to drive more than 200 miles on a tank of gas. The amount of gas you use is another factor that can affect the amount paid on a traffic offense. For instance, if you use 30 liters of fuel, you face a fine of between $1,500 and $2,500.

That is why I chose that this statement is true since I know that there is broken glass inside the car. If it was only broken from the outside, there wouldn't be any broken glass inside the car so answer A and D would not be correct.

Although this choice mentions hung clothes, the rest of the options use the phrase'sniff/get/go/have a smell.' Option B,'sniff.' would imply that the clothes could get sniffed because of their smell.

The question is not explicitly specified but we may take that into consideration while constructing our answer.\n### Example: It is not stated explicitly but we could assume that necklace needs to be located on the female or male neck.

{"text": "```\nIf You aren't glad, Unhappy or Gloomy...then what might you have? The options are depressed, downcast, angry, unhappy, and sorrowful.\n```\n\n### What did you find?\n```\nYou will notice that downcast, unhappy and sorrowful words have the term \"un\" which mean not. They essentially mean the opposite so if the question is:\n\nAre you glad, Unhappy, sorrowful or downcast?\nThen the answer will most likely be: Yes\n\nThis means that the answer is A Depressed\n```\n\n#### Hint on the next task\n\n```\nThis is similar to a \"Which among....?\" question. If you can determine the negative of a \"Which among...,?\" and get the positive on the opposite it gives you the answer.\n```\n\nRationales:\n1. The options in the question list include being gladd, unhappy, gloomy, and unglad. Since the options are \"not\" the answer choice must include the term \"glad\" in the correct form. This leaves us with Option A: Depressed.\n2. Looking at the options closely, We can determine that an adjective should fill in the blank.\n3. We can determine this by looking at the example provided in the question:\n\nDepressed: sad \nAngry: upset\nSorrowful: upset\n\n4. If the question listed any type of Adjective and asked, \"If you aren't angry, then what might you be?\" the choices would all be similar as they should include the term \"anger\" in the correct form and include the word \"not\" in it.\n5. \"Glad\" is an adjective, which means our answer would be an adjective as well so the most likely answer is Option A: Depressed", "answer": "A: depressed"}

{"text": "I'll go to the pub.  Have a good vacation.\n\n### Explanation:Choice B: plane is incorrect. The question asks for alcohol and french foods. Plane is not alcohol. It's also not frog food. \n\nChoice C: beer is incorrect. The question is asking for alcohol, not beer\n\nChoice D: store is incorrect too.  It specifically asks for alcohol and  french food. Store is not alcohol nor french foods.\n\nChoice E: Fraternity house is incorrect too. We can eliminate because it's neither alcohol or fried food\n\nThat leaves us the only choice option which is A pub.  The last sentence suggests that you're on a vacation and we can't find any alcohol in a fraternity.  The last choice that you suggested is \"have a good vacation\" which means the alcohol is not available in the fraternity and that is what you're complaining about in the first place. \n\nHence we should answer the question B: pub. There is no alcohol there but it's the closest thing we can get to get alcohol. \n\nAnswer: B: pub", "answer": "A: pub"}

E: Repaired it.\n\n### Response\n\nRenewed the loan will be the option as the other options are incorrect to the given scenario.\n\n### Explanation\n\nSally asked for more time which doesn't really fit the given scenario as we don't know the exact amount of time she asked for. \n\nSelling the car to someone else might be an option, but we don't know how much the car is worth, or if Sally can find a customer to buy it.\n\nSally giving the car back to the loan company is not a viable option because Sally wants to keep the car as evidenced by her asking for more time to pay off the loan.\n\nRepairing the car may not be possible because we don't know if enough time is available for Sally to get the car in good enough condition to even qualify for a new loan.\n\nSally renewing the loan is the best option as it resolves the loan issue completely.\nAnswer: B\n\n### Examples\n\nQuestion 725, \"How do you feel about the new dress code for women in Pakistan?\" \n\nResponse: I am excited about it.

{"text": "> There are many factors that determine whether or not a building is \"insubstantial\" or \"substantial.\" How tall it is, how it is built, what kind of material it's made out of, etc. But we can eliminate choice A and D because they are simply too extreme. A building could obviously be much taller than 1 meter, and much shorter than 1 millimeter. \n\nThus, the only choices left are B, C, and E.\n\n> Because a massive building could be massive regardless of its construction, we can eliminate choice C. \n\n> The statement said that the building has to be \"massive\" (adj.) if it is not constructed (V) well, meaning that the building must be massive before it is not constructed well. And that is pretty straight-forward: if you construct a building that is not massive, you will likely not have a problem in that regard.\n\nWe can therefore rule out choice B, and so the only choice left is E.\n\n> The statement then says \"if it is not constructed well.\" We can therefore eliminate choice E because it has no negative connotation but only speaks of a positive construction. \n\nThose last two observations leave us with B and D. Now let's look at the last two in more depth to see if they make sense\u2026 \n\n> Choice D \u2013 \"inconsequential\" \u2013 makes perfect sense. We can easily see that if a massive building is not constructed well, it can be inconsequential.\n\nChoice B \u2013 \"massless\" \u2013 is a word that we do not normally see and is also rather complex. This makes it less likely that we should choose it. However, this one was tricky because it appears that the word \"mass\" refers to actual mass and not to how much space something takes up in space, such as when we talk about \"mass\" in the context of gravity. \n\nAfter thinking about this and giving it a second look, we can eliminate this choice and we'll end up with the right one.\n\nThe answer is choice D: Inconsequential. \n\nAnswer: D: Inconsequencial\n\n### Input : The most famous bridge-builder of the 20th century.

Since we can't add graphs to play, we can eliminate option E. Similarly, we can eliminate option C because when we play, we don't talk about graph.\n\nThat leaves us three options. From those 3 options we can eliminate option A because when we are at a bus stop we do not talk about graphs.\nThose that are left with us are option B, C and D. We can eliminate option D because grass is not the type of thing that can have a graph.\nWe are left with the choice between options B and C i.e. between Bus Stop and Post Office.

We have to find which of these additions is the most appropriate.\n\nThe options that are given are B, C.\nWe can eliminate \"B\" because, when we can add something to something, the thing to which we can add something is the most likely thing that is most appropriate. \nConsequently", "answer": "B: graph"}

We know that \"since they had a fight\" refers to when they had the fight it was not as recent as what she is implying it to be as there are chances that she does not call him to resolve the fight but to say that she is sorry for what happened and hopes for another chance. We also do not have any direct information that she called him the next day as none is provided.

Choices: \n\n### A: bite B C: lie down D: need to eat.\n\n### D: sleep E: go.\n\nThe question asks what an animal is likely to do if it's tired. We can infer that tiredness is related to lethargy or sleepiness. \n\nOption A, 'bite,' does not imply tiredness or the need to rest.\n\nOption B, 'lie down,' suggests that resting or sleeping may be the best option for an animal. As the answer implies that an animal is likely to wake up after a short rest, option B or C would make sense as possible answers. \n\nOption D, 'need to eat,' is related to hunger, not to tiredness. Hunger typically relates to food that is already eaten and the need to obtain more food to satisfy the body. \n\nOption E,'sleep,' indicates that tiredness is related in some way to sleep. Therefore, we can infer that sleep is an option that would help tiredness.\n\nThe animal is tired.  What animal could do this?

Choices: \n\nF: laugh C: stab A: groan D: point B: threaten C: laugh\n\n### Rationales:\n-  The scenario presented above involved Brian, whose routine involved a joke about a character in their office.  The humor of his joke, it seems, lies in the character's incompetence. \n\n-  The audience was entertained by the narrative he gave and by his joking about the character's stupidity, as described above.\n\n-  This scenario is a humorous rendition of the following case.  A couple lost their $500 wallet. After searching for it for three days, they found it in their mailbox.  To no surprise, the wallet was damaged, and they realized that there was a $20 bill missing.  However, one day, two weeks after finding it, the police found a $50 in- the mailbox and arrested the couple.  The police realized that the $20 was in their wallet but they insisted on arresting the couple for stealing a $50 when they lost their wallet by accident, the couple had to stay in prison for two weeks until they paid another $45 that was the cost for the stolen money.\n\nAnswer:\nRationales:\n- In this question, the scenario is about a $20 bill that was stolen or lost, and the suspect is the husband.\n\n\\- Therefore, the response must be: \"confiscated.\"\n- In this scenario, I would not call a confiscation a laugh, so B is incorrect.

But it can also be a storage space for items that need protection from the elements.\n3.\tThe passage mentioned that \"A home owned by a museum might be better prepared than most homes\", this means that owners tend to be more careful about what they put in their attic.\n4.\tFor this reason, a home or building that has artifacts in the attic would be more likely to have an attics filled with history.\n5.\tThe answer, then, is A: A home that is old.\n6.\tA home that is old means that it has more history.\n7.\tA home that has more history would be more likely to store history.\n8.\tHence, the answer is A, an old home.\n\n\n### Input:\"That's what I say,\" she replied, in a what.\" Choices:  A:\"sarcastic\" B:\"smart\" C:\"helpful\" D:\"cheerful\" E:\"polite\"\nRationales:\n1. A phrase or statement is a short section of text or speech. It is a part of another statement and has its own purpose, independent of the rest of the text. The first letter of a statement (sentence) is always a capital letter. For example, in the sentence \"The girl wrote a statement\", the word \"statement\" is a phrase.\n2. Adjectives of description are used to provide an immediate visual description of a person, object, or place. For example, \"He was an old man\" (adjective of description used to describe a person, i.e. the subject) is a phrase. However, adjectives of description do not always include a clear-cut subject and predicate. For example, \"a lovely old man\" (adjektive) does not have a clear subject, but is used to describe an object.\n3. This statement is about the writer of a letter and her reaction, and it describes what she thought of the letter that she wrote.

This phrase tells people that the Indian Ocean has to do with the Earth.\nThe second word, the Indian Ocean, tells people what oceans make up the location.\nThere is a diagram located to the right of the problem. The diagram lists all the oceans. It also points to the Indian Ocean, showing people where it is located on Earth.\n### Answer:\nThe Indian Ocean is found on Earth in the southern hemisphere.

The Earth.\nThe Indian Ocean is located in the Earth.\nThe Indian ocean is an ocean located in Asia.\nBased on what is learned above, what does a Martian need to know to learn where the Indian Ocean is? A Martian needs to know that the Indian Ocean is an ocean in Asia. Martians need to know that Earth is the planet where the Indian Ocean is.\n### Answer\nThe earth is located in the universe. The earth is a place where oceans are located. Therefore, the answer to what a Martian needs to know is Earth is the planet where oceans are. Oceans are located in Asia. Martians do not need to learn that the Indian Ocean is in Asia.\n### Reactions:\nWhy does a person need a Martian to know where the Indian Ocean is located?

{"text": "We are given with the passenger who is on the bus and the fact that the people on the bus are noisier than usual, which makes us think he is using his phone to block the noise. Then he turns on his headphones, which does mean he wants to relax. We can eliminate the other choices like go to bed, sleep, and stretch out. Hence the only choice that makes sense is \"listen to music.\"\n\n### Input I'd like to try a new restaurant tonight. Which of these would be your suggestion? Choices:  C: 5 star A: fine B: moderate D: small E: extravagant\n\n### Response\n\nWe start by answering the previous question. The other people on the bus are quite noisy, so the passenger wants to be loud. This means music won't do the trick. Hence, we can easily eliminate (A). 'Fine' means the food will be mediocre, and the question doesn't say that we have the kind of money that allows us to have mediocre food. Also, we can eliminate '5 star', because it would indicate that we have a lot of money. With that done, we also eliminate'moderate' because it simply means that the food will not be anything special, and again that goes against the question.\n\nWhat does 'extravagant' mean? It means it is a rich person's kind of restaurant, and we do not want that. So, this leaves us with only one option (E). \n\nIf we are looking for the best possible choice given the question, (E) would be a logical choice.\n\nAnswer: E: extravagance.\n\n### Input The other passengers on the bus weren't very quiet, so they listened to some music on their portable MP3 players and what?

The question asks \"what\" would happen when someone is playing too **aggressively**\n2. \"Too aggressively\" can be defined as exerting an undue or excessive amount of force or intensity on one's opponent or target in any kind of game or activity.\n3. We can think of several game examples:\n  - A golfer overexerting themselves on a golf ball\n  - A tennis player overexerting themselves when hitting the ball\n  - A boxer overexerting themselves in the boxing ring\n\nIf the player is exerting too much force when playing, the player will probably tire much faster and eventually get hungry.\n\n### Input :Which of the following words does not have the word \"doggo\" in it?

{"text": "A: necklace\n\n### Rationale 1: I think answer C is wrong because we can clearly see from the context that the chain ring is being used to fix something. If I am correct then that means that it doesn't have to be directly related to the question.\n\n##Rationale 2:The sentence tells us that if we screw a chain ring on to something, what we are fixing. This is the kind of question that we all can solve in our sleep and if we do any good, we've already known the answer way before we've even gotten here. It's something that happens every day in the most natural way and to put it in technical terminology wouldn't change much of the answer. \n\n##Rationale3:The sentence continues to tell us that if I screw a chain on to something, what I'm fixing. This means nothing else except that we should give the answer closest to the meaning of the sentence and since we've narrowed it down to being an object that is being fixed in the sentence, we shouldn't think of the answer too broadly but should try to think of objects that are often screwed on to.  \n\n##Rationale4:Necklaces can be screwed on. If we consider all the objects that are commonly screwed on, the answer seems like a logical answer.\n##\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n### Demonstaration:\nInput: What time is it in London?

It does not ask about the time in any other city so the only thing to consider is time in London.\n2. 'A: 3 A. M.' is correct because London has no 3 A.M but it can have 3 A.M for example like 3 : 00 A.M or 3 :30 A.M.\n3.

{"text": "D Smile.\nInput: What do you think the dog wanted? Choices: A; To be petted. B: To be left alone. C; To be in the shower too. D; To be left alone while petting. E; To not eat.\n\n### Response A petting. This question describes a situation involving a dog. It asks what the dog wanted. So, it's important to consider the traits of the dog to determine the choices he may have made.\n\nSince the scenario involves food, a dog is likely to want food instead of not eating.\n\nDogs love to be petted too so it's an unlikely response. This is shown from the textbook itself where it mentions that the dog \"leaned so close to the person he loved.\" Also, it's possible that the dog would respond to the text with an emphatic \"not me\" or a smile which doesn't fit the mood. \"Leave me alone\" seems like a better response though, but the dog's desire for food is still more apparent. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: to be petted.\n\n### Input : You may wonder what it is called, the answer is a what. Choices:  A; Reveal. B; Disguise. C; Disconnect. D; Scream. E; Cower\n\n### Response :  C disconnect, as the text clearly states that a man's fear of being exposed has to do with his connection with another person, who would be his fiancee in this case. This also directly reflects the other answers.\n\nWhat the question is asking is what it is called what? so to disconnect would be what? That's why the answer is c disconnect.\n\nNote: This answer will not be changed for 127 questions\n\n### Input ; A piglet named Wiggles was taken to a zoo, He did what to make sure he was not lost?

Answer: farm land (what you planted) Rationales:  1. The question specifies that the farmer \"chose plants he could use again the next year.\" This indicates that the plants are being grown specifically so that they can be used again in the future.\n2. The question also specifies that \"he only planted what.\" This indicates that the farmer only planted one thing--not multiple things, as some of the given answers suggest.\n3. Additionally, the phrase \"made bird feed\" implies that the plants that would be planted in the first place will be used for the purpose of providing food or nourishment for birds.\n4. With that in mind, we can eliminate all but the last answer option--farm land.\n5. This indicates that the answer is D: farm land since this is the only option that satisfies the above criteria.\nAnswer D: Farm land\n\nInput: The man had some money and a few choices, which one did he take?

Choices:  a: pink b: green c: red d: yellow e: blue\n\n\n### Demotrations:\nThe question itself doesn't provide any information about the person.  Since it's not stated whether the subject is male or female, we can't assume much regarding their general interests and preferences.  This being said, the question does hint towards their favorite color. Since it's stated as \"his favorite color,\" we can assume that the subject is male.  \nIf the question were \"her favorite color\", it would suggest the subject is female since \"his\" refers to a male individual.  Due to this, we can assume that the answer is \"his favorite color.\" It must refer to either \"blue\" or \"green\" since the choices provided all fall under the male gender's spectrum.  Finally, if the subject is female, it would be \"her favorite color\" since the word \"his\" must relate to a male. \n\nHence, we can presume that the answer is \"blue\" since it follows the context of the problem and the choices provided. It answers the most likely personality type of a male to match the given information provided in the problem.\nAnswer: b: blue\n\n### Input\nInput:  Which of the options can a student choose in which they want to enroll for college?

{"text": "The questions asks where people traditionally get information from about the world, which has been limited to books, books & meetings, television, meetings, and guides respectively.\n\nSince people do not get information about the world from the newspaper, the correct answer has to be B: books & meetings.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. Books and meetings were the only two things listed which people traditionally get information on the world from, this narrows down the choices.\n2. Books is the only thing that doesn't contain in itself a part of an English sentence, the meeting is an english word which can only be contained in a complete sentence like the others as well, thus making books the answer.\n### Input: You were reading an article about the history of books and learned that the first books came about when people began to transcribe what they read on paper, true or false?\n\n### Rationale:\nThis questions asks us to determine whether the article mentioned about books coming from when people began to transcribes things on paper.\n\nThe first sentence asks us to determine how the first books came about, implying that books did not come from when people began to write on paper. \n\nFurthermore, if the article said that books actually \"came from when people began to read from paper\" then it would contradict the very question it was trying to answer by saying that books did not come into being at the time people began to write on, but were directly caused by the time people began to transcribe.\n\nThis only confirms that if it says people began to transcribe on paper, then we know books didn't actually come about from that, but we know that it did not exist in the first place.\n\nTherefore, the answer is False.\n\n### Input:\"Everyone was on their phones staring at the screen.

{"text": "The opposite of  hosting a crowd is NOT paying debts, individual or single person\n\n### Explanation:\nThe question asks us to distinguish the opposite of hosting a lot of people.\n\nThere are multiple options for the opposite of hosting a large group. \n\nThe question only requires 1 option so all other options need to be eliminated.\n\nPaying debts:  paying debts and hosting a crowd might come as opposites for a specific reason. The opposite of paying debts is earning more money.\nIn general, people with large incomes often can pay their debts without affecting their quality of life. \n\nLarge hosting parties can also generate large amounts of debt in short periods of time. This might come as the opposite of paying debt.\n\nBut they are two different scenarios, and hosting a party and paying debt do not necessarily come as opposites when thinking about it in a broad context.  \n\nThe same case applies for the other two options, individual and single person respectively. \n\nThere are multiple people within a crowd. The inverse of a group of multiple people hosting a party is not an individual or single person.\n\nFurthermore, being an individual or a single person is not always related to hosting a party.\n\nIt is better to eliminate these two options.\n\nThe only one left is \"small group\" as a crowd can be considered to be a group.  \n\nSo answer is\n### Input:\nWhat is the opposite of pigeons? Choices:  a: flock b: swarm c: group d: crowd\n\nAnswer: a: flock\n### Explanatin:\nThe question asks to determine the opposite of pigeon. We can be certain that the given response doesn't provide us with what the opposite of pigeoning is. The options are a: flock, b: swarm, c: group, d: crowd. The opposite of a crowd won't be a swarm, a group or a flock.\nThe word 'flock' is synonymous with the word'swarm'. The opposite of'swarm' is 'not swarm', or 'not to swarm'. So, we can eliminate'swarm'.\n\nSimilarly, a group is made up of multiple things. So if the opposite of a group was a", "answer": "A: few people"}

Their parents told them to try to what after dinner? Choices:  a: to drink water A: to not laugh B: to be quiet C: to chew with their mouths closed D: to eat slowly E: to not burp\n\n### Response As people eat rice, they produce gas in their stomach that can lead to burping. Drinking water after a meal can help to reduce burping as it can help to move gas through the digestive system.\n\n### The last part: What were a good example of what she and her friends did to be polite?\nShe and her friends tried to be polite by listening to others, being considerate about their language, and keeping their voices down in public places. \n\n### The second part:What are people generally allowed to do in church?\nPeople are allowed to read their scripture and pray silently, but not to talk or sing out loud.\n\n### What was the main idea of the reading?\nThe main idea of the reading is to teach people to be polite and respectful in public places, church included.\n\n### How did the students demonstrate their understanding of good examples of being polite?\nThe students demonstrated their understanding of good examples by giving examples of being polite in public settings: listening to others speak, chewing with your mouth closed, and being quiet.\n\n### Were the students behaving appropriately in math class by answering their classmates questions?\nYes, the students were behaving appropriately in class by answering their classmate's questions on the board.\n\n### Who are the main characters in the passage?

{"text": "The statement indicates that when a person sees new things, they most often feel excitement. There are four emotions listed as possibilities: curiosity, excitement, boredom, and wonder. Curiosity suggests a desire to learn more, and wonder does as well. Excitement describes more of an emotional response to having new things happening to you. Boredom describes a lack of motivation when dealing with new things.\n\n### Explanation:The key here was that all of the emotions described something when dealing with seeing new things. This does not include something already seen, so curiosity does not apply. Wonder would be nice to have, but it doesn't necessarily have as much of an emotional impact. In a practical sense, excitement can best be applied to the given scenario. Therefore, the answer would be B: excitement.\n\n### Input. What are two things teachers do that students don\u2019t like? Choices: \nA: criticize B: encourage C: lecture D: punish E: scold\n\n### Your response:The provided statement can be applied to two things that teachers do: criticize and punish. While these can both be effective strategies, their use has its drawbacks.\n\n### Students don't like teachers who criticize them. By criticizing students for something they did or didn't do, teachers may alienate students by making them feel like they are not respected. Furthermore, it may cause some students to want to please the criticizer more, since it feels like they are doing what he/she wants them to do.\n\n### The same thing can be said for punishing students. This makes students feel as if they are being treated like criminals, and causes them to have a negative view of school.\n\n### There are ways to correct both of these, but students don't like them.\n\n### Answer:  B, D, and E are all correct, as they are all ways in which students don't like teachers.\n\n### However, students like when teachers encourage them to think of new ideas, which is something to do.", "answer": "A: curiosity"}

The question gives clues that you can buy socks or jeans with other words like 'clothing store,' 'was hing machine,' and'shopping mall.' These terms are not related to buying jeans or socks.\n\n5. The choice A is not related to buying socks because a 'washing machine' does not sell socks. The washing machine is used to wash clothes with jeans in it and is not used to sell socks.

'Clothing store' can be eliminated because it is a place where you go to buy clothes like jackets, shirts, pants, etc. Clothing stores do not sell socks or jeans or even close to it.\n\n7.

The options in the question tell us that each choice can be used to fight loneliness. \n  3. Option A,'meet people.' Loneliness can result from being isolated from others. Being isolated from other can lead to loneliness.  If someone were to'meet people', they would no longer be isolated from others and thus, this can potentially help to fight loneliness\n  4. Option B,'meet friend.' Loneliness can be reduced when one has a closer relationship with a friend.  If one needs a friend, becoming closer to the desired friend can help reduce loneliness.\n  5. Option C,'make people laugh.' Being lonely can result from social anxiety. Social anxiety can result in isolation. Social anxiety can be overcome by being able to elicit laughter from those one is with. By being able to eliciting laughter, one could no longer feel lonely as one can be with others and get the social satisfaction that comes with laughter.\n  6. Option D,'socialize'. One can reduce loneliness by being able to socialize with those one needs to connect with. \n  7. Option E, 'liquor.' The question asks for a social activity and liquor does not typically help with that. \n8.

{"text": "If a company would not have to report on certain things or pay fees to the public shareholders, it would not be going public. The company would be saving money so it must be going private.\n### Rationale: A) Revealing information: Being a public company means that the investors have access to the information. Reports and financials provide information on the company. Companies can choose to be closed that is a private company.\nB) Being ridiculed: Being a public company will result in the company being watched by the market and potential investors. Market will decide for itself whether the company is a good investment or not. This could possibly result in ridicule from the public, especially in case of failure.\nC) Problems: Be it employee frauds, financial irregularities or product recalls, public companies must disclose this information to public shareholders. Thus more problems could result in ridicule, negative publicity and could affect the stock price leading to problems.\nD) More Funding: Going public is a huge money drain. Cost of going public is estimated to be $2-3 million. As companies go public, they are subject to a series of disclosure requirements under the Securities Act as well as periodic reports under the Exchange Act. Thus companies going public are not looking for more funding but could be a sign of liquidity crisis.\nE) Telling All: If companies are not required to disclose any of their information or are private entities, it will make the companies more efficient in running their business. It will allow the decision makers in the company to keep the company performance confidential from investors.\nTherefore, the only option that doesn't make sense is E: telling all, which means that a company would be going public just to reveal information.

{"text": "A: Bathroom\n\n### Explanation:\n1. The first thing i would like to point towards is that answer options are the exact opposite on the question and task. Meaning it's a pretty easy task to make an incorrect answer choice. The question asks for where to check for the source of smell, and the answer options are asking for the source of the stale smell. So, option A is correct as the smell is originated from kitchen hence the smell will be from the bathroom.\n2. Next up is, to read the question carefully. \n\nAs i have already pointed out above the answer options and the question statement will be the exact opposite of each other.\n\nYou can also go with another approach here rather than a deductive one. This approach is known as a pattern-recognition approach by simply reading the question statement and the answer options, one can quickly find the correct answer.\n\nFor example\n\nIf there is a stance in the air coming from kitchen, then it will be sourced from -\n23/23 - The Source of Sour Smell is Bathroom.\n\nI would further add that if the answer options were different it would have been an easy task, however the options are the exact opposite in the question and the task and hence this task is pretty much difficult to complete.\n### Response: B: House\n\n### Explantion:\n1. The question has the exact opposite option than the question statement and hence an easy question to miss a answer as the options are the exact opposites.\n2. The answer options are The Source of Sour smell is Bathroom, The Source of Stale smell is Kitchen & The Source of Sour & Stale smell Kitchen.\n3. To find the source of stale smell, we need to check the question statement and the option given as answer. \n\nThe question statement says - 'if there is a stale stench in the air coming from kitchens then what should one check for source'.\n4. Hence the answer can be A: Kitchen.\n5. Though the answer for stale smell is the opposite i.e. option C: Cupboard \n6. But the question statement is talking about stale'smell', so this should be ignored.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. The answer does", "answer": "C: cupboard"}

Choices:  a: India  b: China  c: The United States  d: Brazil e: Afghanistan\n**Rationales:** For an analysis look at each option carefully. Option A: India has a land area of 3,286,759 sq km, which is less than the land area of China and the US. Also, India has the lowest forest area, so it is logical that India doesn't have much grasslands.  Option B: China has a land area of almost 2,509,694 sqm, which is still less than the US and Brazil, and its forest area is the largest among all, hence, it is unlikely there would be extensive grasslands.  Option C: The United States has the largest land area (9,833,600 sqkm) and its forest area is second largest. It can have some grasslands, but it's unlikely to be as extensive as in Brazil.  Option D: Brazil has the largest area (2,348,453 sqkm), almost three times the size of the US. Also, its land area is more dense than the area of US land area, thus it will have less grasslands than the United States. Therefore option B is the right choice.\nOption E: Afghanistan is the smallest country on the list, with a land area of 652,230 sqkm. If the grassland is dense, it might have more than another small country.\n\nAnswer: B: China has the greatest area of the grassland.\n\nInput: The most prominent mountain was how?

Therefore we can eliminate option 4. Option 1: The snowy is not the right answer. All mountains in this world have", "answer": "E: utility room"}
{"text": "Play piano. A student could be sitting in front of a piano if they are studying piano, or if they are studying engineering and need to play the piano to test their design.\n\n### Rationales:\nThe question asks about the black and white keys on a piano. Pianos are an instrument that are typically used to learn the principles of music and play songs.\n\nAnswer choice: D: study book - The piano is not studied in books. Also, it is not used to test the design of an object, it's used to play songs and learn about music.\n\nAnswer choice B: read book - A student could read a book about playing the piano and this choice is probably the only logical one. But, this is a task requiring inferential reasoning instead of literal reasoning. Reading a book is different from studying something by reading it, so while in theory this choice could work to help the student study piano, it makes more sense that reading a book about it would allow them to learn more about that instrument.\n\nAnswer choice E: study engineering. While the choice itself is logical, the only way a student could be studying piano and engineering at the same time is if they were doing something else such as playing a piano with the purpose of testing an engineering design, but this doesn't seem to fit the task parameters. While playing piano is often used to test music equipment and even engineering, it is generally considered to be something separate from both of these things when you are just studying piano.\n\nAnswer choice A: talk - Talking is a way to learn about something, but learning about the piano is unlikely with this method.\n\nAnswer choice C: play piano - The pianist, who is learning about and studying piano, would play it, not the piano itself. If the answer choice was Play piano, it would have been A.\n\nAnswer choice D: study engineering. - The student is studying engineering, but that is not the same as studying piano.

Choice A: \"beyond\" does not follow the previous answer since the distance can be farther away than a city block away. \n4. Choice B: does not follow because the answer was not \"around\". \n5. Choice C: contradicts the direction of the previous answer (toward the dog, not away from dog) and the question (toward the girl). \n6. Choice D: describes a place where the location of the dog is not known and \"on top\" describes an elevated/upper location or place. The girl did not know where her dog was but cannot be on top of it. \n7. Choice E: directly contradicts the \"lost\" context given to the question. \n8. This leaves us with Choice E: \"inside\" which describes a place where the dog is kept and where the girl wants to search for her dog.\nAnswer: E: Inside.\n\n### Input:\"Fiona couldn't believe ___ he thought she was a good student.\" Choices: A: who B: that C: what D: how E: which\n\n### Response:\"Fiona couldn'\n### Dem:\n### Dem:1.

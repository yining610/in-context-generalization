You will learn how to create a variable within the nested conditional to have more complex conditional statements. You will then learn how to use multiple conditions in a nested conditional statement.\n##### Multiple conditional statements\n\n##### Example 1\n\nThis problem is a little bit different from the others, so I will go through it, with examples first, and then code in the second part. You'll create a nested conditional and a variable (i) that contains an answer to the previous problem. The solution to this problem is not at the bottom, this one is up to you.\n\n### Code:\nCreate 3 variables (i, j, k) to hold each answer to the last 2 problems:\nk = 9\ni = j = k = nil\n### The conditional\nCreate a new condition with the conditional statements. First create and assign a new variable called \"y\". You'll be making nested conditional statements so let's go down the rabbit hole and start a new level.\ny = i == true #", "answer": "B: bamboo grove"}

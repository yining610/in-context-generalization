The key is to make a variable, "period", to hold the first period (ie, the year when it was recorded). If it's 1990. Then period is 1990, and if it's 1800, then period is 1800. <n>    - Go to [this](http://gdata.worldbank.org/g/wbgao/download/timeseries) website and browse to the Illinois. Then select the file called "Unemployment Rate, Annual". If it's 3.8%, then period is 1954, if it's 2.2%, it's 1792. You know what I mean. You then get a csv with five columns.<n>    - Get only the "Value" columns in each year. <n>    - Put the values into an array.<n>    - Now get all of the variables in the array that were values that were under 8%.<n>    - Print whether period is the first-mentioned element.<n>    - Change

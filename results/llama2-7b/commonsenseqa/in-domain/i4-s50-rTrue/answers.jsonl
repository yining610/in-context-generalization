This is a likely answer because it is where most gardening takes place, where many people plant flowers or vegetables that produce pleasant smells.\n3. Option A, yard. This is also a good answer choice. Often people are outside in their yard while gardening and it often produces the pleasant smells he seeks.\n4. Option B, basement.

We can't judge the efficiency of a car compared to a motorcycle, because: we don't know how many people can it carry or how long the trip will be.\nIII. We don't know if traffic is heavy or not.\nIV. We don't even know if the traffic lights are more or less frequent on one or another transport's journey.\nV. If one of them has to stop more often than the others during the journey, obviously the car would be less efficient.\nVI. If the car goes faster than the motorcycle, then the car can reach the point faster than the motorcycle (unless the motorcycle can do it too)\nVII. But if the motorcycle stops more often than the car, this might not be a problem for the car that doesn't have to stop as often as the motorcycle.\nIn short, this implies that:\nI.

Similarly, B: satisfaction is a feeling that can be associated with getting paid, but again not the process of actual payment.\n3. Option C: sorrow is not directly attributed to getting paid, as this feeling can apply to many types of situations independent of getting paid.\n4. D: ocean, is the right answer as it directly relates to a feeling of being paid. Getting paid may make you feel like you are sitting on a beach or oceanside, as you may have a job that allows you to enjoy the outdoors on your payday.\n5. Option E: bill collectors, is not directly tied to actually \"getting paid\", and can't be eliminated as answer.\n6.

One potential downside is that it can also elevate blood pressure temporarily.\n3) A: hot chocolates is not necessarily a blood vessel dilation because some are sweet whereas others use unsweetened chocolate. The caffeine does produce an alertness effect.\n4) B: hot water does not open up the blood vessels but is more of a comforting option to relax.\n5) The matchbox could be used to \"create\" non-invasive blood vessel dilation, but this is not a type of blood vessel dilation per se. \n6) D: yoga exercise is not specifically a blood vessel dilation method; it could increase the heart rate and therefore temporarily", "answer": "A: depressed"}

The question asks, \"Where would you find a Bee that is Gathering Pollen?\" Bees are insects that feed on flower nectars and pollen, a protein-based food, not fruits. 2) One of the options is B: Sky- bees typically fly below the level of the clouds and do not use the sky as a gathering place for pollen. 3) Next, consider D: Field, which refers to a place where bees would gather pollen, but not the court or the orchard- it is unclear what would be found within these spaces. 4) Option E: orchard, is not relevant as it is not a bee gathering place for pollination. 5) Finally, option A: United states refers to a geographical location, not a gathering place for bees. 6) Consequently, the final answer is C, a Court- a place where bee-pollinating flowers are grown \nSo the final answer  is C: court or orchard\n\nInput:What do you do to fix a wound? Choices: 1) A: stitch it with sewing thread 2) B: apply antibacterial ointment 3) C: leave it to nature to heal on its own 4) D: put pressure on it 5) E: keep it clean\nOutput: 1 and 2 are very clear incorrect options as applying thread to a wound, as well as using any form of antibacterial oils/creams, or chemicals to a wound is likely to inflame it and can cause infection. 3) The third option of leaving nature to heal can be misleading because it doesn't mean exactly the same as \"let it heal on its own.\" This can cause misunderstanding. For example, a person with a wound could still apply antibacterial products without harming nature but actually putting pressure on the wound to cause it to heal quicker. 4 and 5 seem to be more natural options to care for a wound but in order to determine which one is correct, more information would need to be researched to rule out the option of \"keep the wound clean\" which is not a simple", "answer": "D: field of flowers"}

Fists as tools are an unlikely response to holding tools and are more likely to be used for punching.\n7) Choice E: hands does make sense as a good fit for this question. John would not have used all of his hands for punching at the walls, so his uninjured palm does make sense as an appropriate response to a question such as \"what would he have trouble holding\" when punching at his wall.\n8) As this is the only realistic option among the answers, \"hands\" is the correct answer to this question.

Option C: Grocery Store: A grocery store is a place to buy food but does not always preserve food from spoiling. One would need to buy the items and then store them themselves.\n4. Option D: Pantry: Another option which involves storing food in a pantry, but the key in this is that it is one that is likely to \"SPOIL if left out\".

Option a: Six Threes can be ruled out as it is the sum of two numbers and it does not make sense to do the sum of two numbers when the question is asking for the sum of the number itself or the answer.\n3. Option b: Eight Fives is also not correct as it is a sum that cannot be answered in terms of two and three. \n4. Option c: Four Twos can also be ruled out as it does not involve two and three and cannot be solved accordingly.\n5. Option d: Two Ones is not correct, as it does not use two or three in the calculation of the sum and is also not divisible by each of them.\n6.

{"text": "1.\"A wife asks a husband\" does not necessarily mean the wife has asked her husband to stop being married. However, \"to stop being married\" could be a reference to the death of a spouse. In this scenario, feeling happy is not appropriate as the spouse is dead, not divorced.\n2. The rest of the question refers to life changes and situations in life, which could include feeling happy, happy, pleased or happy. This indicates that happiness is more likely to be the correct answer than any other option.\n3. Pleasure and happiness are similar but pleasure is specific to a particular experience, such as eating a particular food or riding a roller coaster. This is not the case here where happiness is a general emotion felt regardless of a specific experience.\n4.Pleasure applies to things, not feelings. So it cannot be the answer.\n5. Grief might arise when someone is in the process of ending a marriage and is moving on to another relationship, but even then, the correct answer would be 'happy'.\n6.

Option E, surface of earth, isn't really a place where a few people breathe air in recent times.\n5. All of the other choices do have the right idea, but they are actually locations which have lots of air breathed by many people in recent times, and not a few recent people. \n6.

Choices:  A. city B. landmark C. state capital D. town E. country\nOutput:  The input: On a map which dot is closest to a given location. \nAnswer: D - Towns. We can see from this graph that the smallest city is New York, then Houston, then Tokyo. After Tokyo there's a big range between Boston and Chicago, and then the last city in the data set is Shanghai, which is about twice the size of Los Angeles. Since this is not a multiple-choice question, which is really unreasonable to expect, any valid answer would be a town size greater than 765,000.\n\nInput: What can be used to turn on a light when it is off?

Option D: Fast food drive-thru would not make sense. It would imply that the people are lining up to place an order with a cashier at a drive-thru window.\n\n5. Option E: City would imply people lining up in the context of a city's local government or administrative workers.\n\n6. So it's left at option A: bus stop.

We can eliminate A: allergic because an allergy is an immune system response to a substance in the body, and the question is about whether an allergy could be present.

Option B: trash does not seem to be a logical choice either.  \n(a) They could be hidden anywhere they were found (so not necessarily just a single box), (b) It's unlikely that they would be stored in the trash rather than somewhere else.\n(a) Closet is likely to be located somewhere in the same room, in which the box with the clothing was previously stored. Therefore, it does not represent a good choice for a place of hiding. \nSo, it is important to consider that this person is looking for a place to hide holiday decor.\n4. Consider the remaining four options: (c)loft, (d)closet, (e)box.\n(a) Box is not the type of container that is typically used to store holiday decorations (as it is generally a smaller box that could not contain many pieces).  \n\nSimilarly, loft and closet, although both likely locations for storing clothing, are not likely to have similar objects (like holiday decorations) in general.

In option C, the surface of earth is an interesting choice because some people might choose to live there, however, most don't and there are other options they would live in that can better accommodate their needs, so option C: Surface of earth should be eliminated.\n\n5. Next, looking at options E, E houses, there could be a few people who live in a car-show.

Sarah discovered a second heart in her patient, so she wouldn't be able to confirm that he was a human since a human does not naturally have two hearts.\n2. Sarah would be making this discovery in a hospital with a surgical area where animals are often being kept. So, there is a good chance she would not label her patient as an animal, but as something more.\n3. A doctor does not necessarily think of patients as old things or antiques. It's more likely they would describe people as such a word as a \"patient\".\n4. An antique shop would not be where a patient normally would go if he opened his chest to find a second heart.\n5. Sarah found a second heart, but this alone wouldn't make it possible for her to confidently determine what it is.\n6. The last possibility would be \"human being\" and that is the right answer.\nSo the final question is : the question is asking about the patient as it would be unusual for Sarah to find their second heart (which they didn't have before) in their chest.

B: Lighter - This is used to light certain items on fire, and is not necessarily used to create a fire when it is not already ablaze.\n4. C. Matches - While matches can ignite a fire, there are situations in which they are not used to create a fire and are instead used to extinguish one, especially in situations like fire drills.\n5. D: Pencil - While this item can be used to score certain things and can have an eraser attached, it can't get the job done of creating a fire, either by itself or with anything else involved. \n6. E.

What differentiates the most famous bands, such as The Beatles or The Rolling Stones, is that they have achieved massive fame - they are cultural icons that people all over the world know and love.

{"text": "1.\"Small grapes\" can refer to grape seeds, or the actual grapes themselves which can have smaller seeds than other types\n2. The first question is asking for a specific use of the small grapes, not just any grapes in general, as they would be smaller grape seeds, and not a grape in the fruit form.\n3. \"A picnic basket\" fits well because both can hold food and people can eat the food outdoors, making picnic baskets a common carrying apparatus for food and wine, and an enjoyable space to celebrate when people enjoy the outdoors. It's easy to imagine small grapes, seeds and juice being packed into a picnic basket, especially as an appetizer.\n4. B\" wine press\" is not used for grapes at all.\n5. \"C juice\" is not a use for grapes at a picnic as this just denotes juice in general, not any specific type like grapes.\n6. D \"fruit cocktail\" can refer to a juice made from fruits but it is not a single specific type of fruit like grapes at a wine press.\n7. So the single remaining option is \"E kitchen\" as both small grapes, grapes and wine can fit both small and large kitchen spaces.\n8.

Eliminate (C) \n(D): person is likely in the countryside or on a farm. This eliminates choice (D): Countryside.

Eliminate choice (E)\n(F): The person is likely at a city park, or even in a city park. Eliminate choice (F) and we are left with two choices (E) - State Park, and (G) - City Park.

But as the question asks about the GOAL or the FINAL OBJECTIVE and not the METHOD, fight is not the answer.\n5) Join: as in join an army, this does not necessarily imply that the \"goal\" of doing so is to fight an opposing force. Rather it may be to enhance oneself by joining a unit that will train or improve one's own skills of battle - but this is not answering the QUESTION about the GOAL or FINAL OBJETCTIVE of War. Joining the army is not inherently part of the war goal.\n6) Kill: War ends at some point with the death of most soldiers on both sides.\n7) Terrible: this does not specifically speak to the goal of the army - that they intend to in fact kill. It's more of a \"why this is a bad thing\".\n8) So, the correct answer is to \"Fight with enemy\", as this best answers the QUESTION of the GOAL or FUNDAMENTAL INTENT of the army - and not the METAODOLS employed to do so.\nSo the final is A: fight with enemy\n\nInput: What goes well with grits, and also goes well with fish?

In this question, two o'clock and two days are not units.\n2) time is an element and a unit of time, while week is neither. Also, time is an element and not the name of a period of time.\n3) Tomorrow is not a period of time, but it is rather the next day, and 2 o'clock in the 24th hour of the day.\n4) Yesterday is a period of time as the question states, but not a proper unit of time.\n5) In this question, 30 o'clock is a time unit.\nSo there is no answer as the questions do not check.

That is not a type of juice found at a juice bar, so B does not work.\n4. C\"Square\" is a place on a graph or plot, often used to describe the degree to which the data changes, has nothing to do with getting in shape or drinking at a juice bar\n5. D \"Gym\" is a physical location where people usually go to get in shape, and drinking juices is not associated with gyms.\n6. E \"Refrigerator\" is a space where food is chilled.

The question is asking about how the government can or will help with schools.\n4. Option D, \"require to pay taxes\" is not a group of people, but a law stating that people must pay taxes. The taxes can then be used for government programs, including funding schools. So option D can be eliminated. This leaves us with three options.\n5. Option A: \"school children\" need a lot of help with schools. Governments provide funding in the form of subsidies, loans, and other assistance programs to support children, and they work with organizations such as charities to help students financially. This is what the question is really asking about.

The answer is option E: \"take money\". The government can be expected to take a lot of money to help with schools because the school is a vital pillar of both society and children's lives, often creating a cycle where parents pay for costs associated with school on their part because the government has already given them a helping hand for their children.

Options A and B are likely to be used in everyday contexts such as \"I'm feeling special/personal today\" and would not be relevant to a situation described by the question.\n4. Option D \"unique\" is too specific and there is the indication that common could mean common to receive a gift at all but unique within the context of a present for someone else.\n5. Option E \"rare\" is the correct answer because it describes something to be felt after receiving a gift that one might not normally receive which is consistent with the question.\nSo the final feeling is \"unique\" after receiving a new unusual gift.\n\nInput:What would you be likely to get when giving cute presents?

All of the given answers belong to the Latin plant family. There is no such thing as a \"yes-and-no\" answer, so D) No is not the right answer.\n3.

{"text": "1.\"a\" is the antecedent for \"what\" which is \"make\" so the answer would be \"feel safe\".\n\nOutput:2. It makes sense to say that \"A person who wants to\" do something, would also \"own\" something - namely, a(n) \"house\".\n\nOutput:3. \"A person who wants\" to do something would probably not get \"better\" in salary - that would only be the case if they had a(n) \"better\" job.\n\nOutput:4. Unless getting a(n) \"lottery\" is a way \"a\" person will get a better job, it is not the intended answer for this prompt.\n\nOutput:5. \"Feel\" would be in the correct place if it were describing how a person felt about their performance in a new role, but it is used to describe the state of being able to (financially) be comfortable, which is not the intended answer.\n\nOutput:6. \"Save\" is too general of an answer - it could apply to saving more, saving less or simply saving nothing at all. The intended answer is \"feeling\" safe, rather than safe.\n\nOutput:7. \"Own\" is the correct answer because the last phrase in the prompt is about feeling safer by having something in a person's (work) role.\n\nOutput:8. It makes sense to describe a \"job\" that is better as being one (e.g., a \"job\" that pays more). To do this in a phrase that includes both a \"better\" and a \"job\", one will require some form of \"being\" rather than \"getting\".\n\nOutput:9. If a person is going to have a \"lottery wins\", they won't then have \"a\" \"better\" job - so, this phrase does not make sense.\n\nOutput:10. The phrase, \"feeling\" safe is not a description of a job, but is rather a description of the result of having a job.\n\nOutput11. \"Feel safe\" is the correct answer for this prompt.

Eye contacts contain a lot of fluid (milk?), but aren't known for fungus growing on them. \n4. Showers use water, not milk, so they probably do not allow fungus growth like cheeses do.\n5. A biology lab (containing many liquids) would be a place to find fungus growing somewhere made from milk.\n6. Decaying matter (not necessarily milk), like compost or piles of rotten carcasses, may contain many types of molds and mildews. \n7. So, one answer is C: biology laboratories.\n8.

The term \"coffee drink\" would probably have been better here.\n3. \"Get drunk\" is not an option in this context. \n4. It can be decided that \"throw up\": as he is \"ordering\" something, it is almost a certainty that it will be eaten, not vomited.\n5. \"Eggs\": \"breakfast time\" does not rule out eggs here, but eggs are often eggs Benedict, which is usually served with ham, so this choice is also excluded.\n6. \"Toast\": \"toast\" can be eaten for breakfast, but as this is eggs and toast, it is possible that the eggs could come with something that Brad is not ordering. So it is an excluded choice.\n7. Since eggs, toast, coffee, and \"to get drunk\" have been eliminated, the only remaining choice is D: getting drunk.\n8. \"To drink wine\" could be included as an option. But it is not the only possible drink at breakfast.\n9. So the final answer is D, getting drunk. \n\nInput: What is the answer when the question is no longer being answered?

From this, we see that Choice (B) \"populated areas\" doesn't match the question.  We also see why (D) \"the desert\" doesn't match, because Sammy wanted to go to populated areas and the desert would not likely be one. From this, we can discern that (A) \"race track\" is unlikely as a place of people as well.\n\t2. So the answer has to be (C) \"apartment\" as it is the single populated environment from the choice given to us.\n\t3.

That is a clue to us that (B) is likely an incorrect answer.  It doesn't fit the prompt well. \n\t2: The action the correct answer should be is likely a way that the police would control the suspect, in this case the suspect was suspected of a crime.  Arrest and arrest and let and arrest are out because they don't reflect a controlling function.  \n\t3: So the answer \"Ask ______\", is the  correct answer.

This is not what the question is asking about. \n2.\"Business Restaurant\" is a phrase that describes what type of restaurant the business (company/restaurant) is. No where in the question is a place said to contain a \"business restaurant\" so eliminating this option. \n3. \"At Hotel\" indicates a location where the business has a hotel to serve customers but is still a place that is more likely to have a hotel than a restaurant. \n4. \"Mall\" is a shopping location, not a place one can go to eat, so this is also an incorrect answer.\n5. \"Yellow Pages\" is a source of information to find various types of companies, not a type of place where a business is likely to be located.\n6. So \"Business Sector\" is not right, neither are \"Mall\" or \"Yellow Pages\". That leaves us with D: Business Sector and B:town Business restaurant. \n7. Business Restaurants is indeed a type of restaurant, but it also is a phrase that describes \"where a business is located\", a \"Business Restaurant\", which the question is also asking for.\n8.

Choices:  A \"find out\" B \"win\" C \"understand\" D \"pass\" E \"be more\"\nOutput: \n1) \"I can miss the chance to pass...\" does not answer the question.\n\n2) \"I can miss a chance to win...\" is a synonym of \"I can miss a big chance to pass...\" so it is the same as B.

{"text": "1.\"What\", in this context, should be interpreted as \"personality trait\".\n2.\"She\" pronoun makes the answer singular.\n3.\"Products\" in the first list is a plural noun describing a singular noun.\nSo, the answer cannot be C: time or D: money.\n4. If \"time\" is ruled out, it can be assumed that \"practical needs\" cannot be time, because practical needs have to be something other than time.\n5. If \"money\" is ruled out, \"spending money\" is not the answer either, as the sentence mentions \"spending money\" as a feature of this person's \"what to shop more\", which would indicate this person's love of shopping is not motivated by spending money.\n6. This means that \"spending money\" could not have been the real answer to the question.\n7. So the only answer in the list that doesn't contradict this answer is E: credit, as it makes sense: since \"time\" and \"money\" are ruled out, the only way for the sentence to stand is to say she shops for practical needs that are motivated by credit. This leads to conclusion that E: credit is the answer to the question. So the final answer is E credit\n\n\nInput: Which word is missing?

{"text": "1.\"Ben\" could be a male or female, so we will use he as the pronoun for consistency.\n2. A: prison is where most inmates spend a majority of their time, meaning he may not have been there for a long time.\n3. B: bridge is where cars travel and are not commonly places to live. So this option can be eliminated. The same can also be said for C: locked up.\n4. Homeless shelter can be a choice if the length of time has not taken him far away from home.\n5. His neighbor's house seems unlikely as a long-term solution for housing, nor is it an option used for incarceration.\n6. This means the correct answer needs to be either \"A: prison\" or \"E: neighbor's house\".\n7. However, if \"8 years\" is being mentioned in this question, this rules out neighbor's house. A: prison holds inmates during their sentence, but they are released as soon as it's done, making it not a suitable place to \"spend\" 8 years.\n8. This leaves us with either incarcerated or homeless and the latter makes more sense as it can account for his staying in a shelter for \"8 years\".\n9. So the answer is B: prison.\nSo the final answers are A: Prison \nSo the final answer are A: prison\n\nInput:Why would someone put a pineapple on a pizza? Choices: 1: So that I can eat a Hawaiian slice 2: to make it more yolk-like 3: to add zest to it 4: to cover up its doughy taste 5: to make it look better\nOutput: 1: So I can eat a Hawaii slice is not a \"why\" but a reason, as in how one might enjoy eating pineapple pizza. The question is asking why someone would put pineapple on pizza.\n2: To make it more yolk like, makes no sense as pineapple has no correlation to yolks.\n3: To add zest to it makes no sense, as zest is spice, not fruit.\n4: to cover up doughy taste, does not make sense because doughy taste is not related to pineapple; pineapple is just", "answer": "A: prison"}

The statement, \"You have seen something through an optical optical telescope\", is nonsensical as there are no words of the same sequence.\n3. \"The\" is not used when referring to a person in the sentence, instead \"you\" refers to a person and is thus the second choice: A: sights B. \"The\" is used when referring to something inanimate. \n4. A: sight: a visual indication of the location of an event by observing some sort of object\n5. C: optical telescope: an optical telescope is a device used to view distant objects.

The first choice (A: Winners and Losers) may seem to align with John's personality but it isn't techncially dividing people but rather saying who wins or doesn't.

The second choice (B: Perform better) may seem to align but there isn't an act of categorizing or dividing people by this and it's not techncially what John would do. So it can be eliminated too.\n4. The third choice (C: Might Win) may seem to align because it sounds like he is dividing people into those that might win and those that won't win. So there may be some similarities in it to what he would categorize things.  But John is actually referring when he uses the word \"competitive\" because he likes to compete and not to simply MIGHT WIN. John is really talking about competing because it's a more general category of \"doing\". So it could be categorized into winning or losing.\n5. The fourth choice (D: Loses) is not categorizing people in any sense, just mentioning that he is competitive and likes to compete because he wants to win.\n6. The last answer (E: People who hate him) is not categorizing or dividing at all. It is saying something different than what John is talking about because it's not competing.\n7.

Options A: 'bite' and B: 'lie down' are likely to be things the animal would do after it has had enough activity, indicating it is tired. These can both be eliminated from consideration.\n3. Option C: 'keep alive' is about staying alive and not about an activity after becoming tired, so it can be excluded from consideration here.\n4.

Option B, \"shopping mall\" is a type of building that often houses many more stores than just one, and therefore, this option could possibly reduce its own customers.\n5. Option A, \"idaho\" is very far from a major city and will therefore have a limited customer base.\n6. Option C, \"in a big city\" is not as large as new york, so it has a smaller potential customer base limiting future numbers.\n7.

For example, if a restaurant does not sell milk and you order in a cafeteria-style restaurant, there may be milk on hand, but the waiter is not going to serve it to you in a glass.\n5. Home is a good choice. Home is the only choice among these options where the waiter could ask if they have some milk that they could put in a glass and drink with your meal.\n\n6.

It does not typically cause pain. \n6. Option D, getting tired, is a common occurrence while driving, but it is not always associated with pain.\n7. Option E, car crash, is a common occurrence when it comes to driving, but it also might cause pain like an accident.\n8.

Option A, automoblie accidents, is a possible event that could cause pain after driving a car that does not involve it.\n10. Since pain is not mentioned as being included or excluded for option B, it is reasonable to assume that backaches are not included or excluded. This leaves us with option B again.\n11.

Option C, table would be a relevant answer if it were the desk of a person writing a dictionary, but the question states \"put a dictionary * while* using it\" where \"using\" would not refer to a desk. Hence, table is not a relevant option.\n7. The location option that fits the question is C: desk - a desk is a relevant location where a person writing would put their dictionary.\n8. So the correct answer is C - writing a dictionary at a desk.\nSo the final choice would be C: desk\n\nInput: Which of the following pairs of words does not appear in this sentence? \"She was surprised I would say she was attractive.\" Choices:  A girl B: a girl C: girls D: girl E: women\nOutput: 1 option A: Girl has already been used in the sentence as an object of the past tense in the statement: \"I would say she was attracted\".

{"text": "1\"Fox hunting\" can be a type of outdoors activity.\n2.\"Great outdoors\" is a general term that can refer to any outdoor location. It does not provide specific information on a person's whereabouts within an outdoor location. Therefore, this option is insufficient for the question.\n3. \"Forest\" is a specific type of ecosystem, and being \"in\" it cannot imply where a person is located elsewhere. \"Beach\", \"Arctic Tundra\", and \"Open Meadow\" are specific environments that describe a person's location.\n4. \"England\" is an ambiguous term, as it may be referring to any location within England. It may also infer that the fox is hunting in England. However, \"England\" is not a common location where people encounter or are involved in the activity of fox hunting.\n5.

It may not be the individual's preferred choice for travel, but it can be interpreted as such. \"Sail\" is also a method of transportation that can use ocean currents to propel vessels, which would not require a human to physically be at the helm. This is consistent with this scenario.\n2. \"Taxi cab\" is a method of travel that requires an individual to be a human passenger in a form of transportation. It is not a human-powered mode of travel that would require a person to swim, cycle, or travel using another mode such as a horse.\n3. \"Ships\" refers to vessels sailing over oceans, with or without the use of sailors. It's not a mode of transportation that would require a person.\n4. \"Bike\" is a mode of transportation", "answer": "A: open meadow"}

Option A, \"vegetables\" is an item that is placed in a space, and would not typically be used as the subject in a sentence.\n4. Option B, \"market\" is a place to buy or sell things, and would not typically serve as the subject in a given sentence.\n5. Option E, \"book store\" is a selling point where books are typically bought or sold, and would not be used as a subject in a sentence. \n6. This leaves option D, \"train station\" as the correct answer, as this refers to a place where trains or train passengers are in a given location. So when in a train station, the question is asking about the reader's subjective location in regards to the train station, and the phrase \"while we're\" indicates that a reader would not typically associate oneself with the station, but rather that they are near and waiting for the train.\nSo the final awnser is D: train station.\n\nInput: Which is bigger, the universe or a blueberry?

{"text": "1: The question asks what moving cars entails, which can be interpreted in various possible ways depending on what context the answer is being given within.\n2: Option A: \u201cdriving\u201d is not the same as \u201cmoving cars,\u201d it just means operating a motor vehicle (car or other mode of transportation). This can be eliminated. Option B: \u201croad\u201d is one way to think about moving a car (by driving it on a road), but it can also refer to the landscape (the geography) a car is moving through. Although this is in keeping with the question as it was asked, it is not the best choice and can be eliminated. C: \u201cgetting tired\u201d is related to driving, but does not fully encompass the concept of \u201cmoving cars,\u201d and thus is not suitable. Option E: \u201cticket\u201d is not something associated with moving cars directly, and thus can be eliminated. The answer is thus either option C or E. D: \u201caccidents\u201d is not a direct result of moving cars, but something that can happen when cars move on a road. Additionally, \u201caccident\u201d is a vague term that can encompass many different types of occurrences which occur while cars are moving. It is thus also ineligible.\n\n3: This leaves us with either option C or E: \u201cgetting tired\u201d and \u201cticket\u201d can both apply to moving cars. However, \u201cticket\u201d would be a punishment received by a motorist for disobeying traffic laws - which do not relate directly to the physical motion of the car.

{"text": "1 What are you actually looking at? If you're seeing \"blinking lights in the air\", most likely it's the sky. Most common \"blinking lights at night\" are stars, planets, satellites, and fireworks. So none of the other options are very likely to be the answer, unless there are cars, planes, concerts, turned at night, or penguins flying around your home.\n2. If there are no other objects, then you're probably looking at stars and planets. If you are specifically looking for a planet, you don't have any stars to select. If you are specific, the only planet you can select is C: Plane.\n3. If you are asking about blinking lights in the night sky, you can't be looking for a live penguin. It's also unlikely that you would look at a penguin'sh bum in the nighttime sky.\n4. A penguin's backside in the air would be called \"an upturned penguin\" if you're viewing it from the ground.\n5. Penguins do not fly, so if you're seeing a penguin in the sky, it's also less likely that it's real. It's more likely that you would see UFOs or fireworks.\n6. In the original question, \"you're usually looking at it\" - so the answer likely isn't \"an object that's turning\".\n7. In conclusion, you may be looking at the night sky or a penguin'sb um.

Option C: Interjection is a part of speech expressing emotion and is not used to combine two words. So, it can be eliminated immediately.\n6. Option D: Conjunction refers to how two sentences or fragments are combined. So it can be eliminated since a sentence fragment is not a \"word\".\n7.

As options D (prague) & E (community) are both places where a school might not typically be located, they can be eliminated. This leaves us with answer options A, B, C, & D left.\n3. A: Residential neighborhood is not where one might find a school, as school is more of a public setting. This is further supported by the fact that \"residential neighborhood\" is not a commonly used phrase to describe where a school is located. It is also not the most likely of the options left, since a school is more likely to be found in an area where people typically hang out at certain times & places, such as B: a mosque or C: a city.\n4. B: Mosque is unlikely for a school to be located. First, it's not the most likely of answer options. This is further understood due to the fact that a mosque is a space mainly used to perform religious practices, not typical of a space used for school purposes. Additionally, schools are typically a neutral space where people of all religions can gather & learn, so locating one on a church isn't likely.\n5. C: Every City is the least likely option left. A city is a large area usually with many different neighbourhoods and there is not a standard place you can find a school located.\n6. The remaining option is D: A community where the school is typically found is located in a more public area that people can easily congregate and access.

We can factor out (a + b) to get (a + b)(x - y).  In this case x=3, y=5 and we have to factor out (a+b) = 8.  In other words, 8 * (a+b) - 8 * (a - b).  That reduces our sum of the squares further to (a+b)(x+y).\n\n\n1. 9 * (a+b)(3+5) = 625\n2. 2 * (a+b)\r\n3. a^2 + b ^2 = (a +b)( a -b)\r\n4. a^2 + 5^2 = ( 3+5)^2\r\n5. (9-8) - (9+8)\r\n6.

This indicates the sanctions should be reconsidered and maybe canceled.\n3) The word \"authoritative\" is a single letter and word off to the right of the sentence, which makes it hard to correct without moving the sentence too much.\n4) The word \"avoid\" is not only incorrect but is a verb that would logically follow from changing course (if necessary) but not from authoritative words and actions. It is also a single letter and word above the sentence to the right, which makes it hard and time consuming to rewrite the whole sentence.\nTherefore, the answer should be 'C' since 'ignoring' is not authoritative but is instead dismissive, or the equivalent of ignoring the efforts the school has made to change.\nSo the final and correct answer is C: ignore", "answer": "A: ignore"}

The answer to the question is 1, because a bear could possibly represent pain or fear, but those emotions are not what make anyone think of a bear, because only the image of a bear is associated with those emotions.\n\n3. The answer to the second question is 2, because joy does cause someone to think of a bear.\n4. This answer is not relevant to the question because joy and sadness are not what may be on someone's mind when they think of a bear. Thus, this is definitely the wrong answer!\n\n5. The answer to the last question is 5, which is also incorrect. This is because we have seen that joy causes someone to think of a happy image of a bear, rather than of pain.\n\nThe final answer is 1, because fear does make someone think of a bear.

Option -None- isn't really a choice in the question. If it was there, then the question would be whether a particular answer is located in the human body. That does not align with the nature of the question: the wording is \"where\", not \"whether\". So, option -None- is wrong.\n3. Option A: on the outside is not possible.\n4. Option B: inside points to the kidney or stomach possibly moving outward or downward to the body, but since the question is whether the organs in \"where\" instead of what state they're \"in\", it is wrong.\n5.

In order to answer the question, we must eliminate options that contain \"all\", for example, all choices except D will be considered here since D (all mammals) is too broad of an answer. 2. D: All mammals, is not correct as it cannot be said that all mammals have a caring heart. 3. A: Person, is incorrect in this example as it is not the specific type of person that the question asks about - the question clearly asks about a type of human, likely a gender/sex or otherwise specific person which includes males, females and whatever else may apply to the question. 4. B: Species, is not the correct answer as there is not enough information in the question to determine if there is a species of animal whose hearts are known to be more caring than other species. 5. C: Articohke, was not specified as being either male or female, so does not apply to the question.\n6. E: Live animal, is not the correct choice as there is not enough specifics in the question to determine which animals from this category contain caring hearts. 7. So, the caring heart type of person is determined to likely be a human from species B or species C, though more information is still needed to determine the human species and determine if they are male or female.\nSo the final choice is a tie between B and C, but we just need to choose one or the other.

There for there are only two options left, and both are still likely to be the right choice.\nA: Person, is incorrect as a person is defined above as only being one example. \n9. E: all mammals does not apply to the options since only humans are given as being specific people, and in the options there are only two choices that can be correct which can either be a male human known as a person, and/or a female human. 10.

Given that only B and E are backyards, the answer is obviously, \"B: Ocean\" \n2) This may seem like a straightforward answer- one simply finds fish in the ocean, but actually kids can find fish in their backyard if you consider what a \"backyard\" really means. If we consider backyards to mean any land that is relatively enclosed, then kids can find fish by going into any pond or lake in their backyard to find them, or by going to the nearest natural body of water that contains fish to find them. In this case, ponds and lakes are not necessary as you are in the backyard.\nSo the final Answer is B: Ocean\n\nInput: A man was at the supermarket buying flowers when someone asked him what part of \"love\" he was buying flowers for.

The question word'most' and the keywords 'watching movies' point to this.\n(2) Next, we consider all of the possible choices to ascertain which one fits the most with the key information and can replace the condition.\nTo find this, we consider two important factors:\n(1) What are the factors or conditions of the possible choices, that will determine whether one will replace the condition correctly?\n(2) What's the condition or keyword to be replaced? In our case, the keyword is 'watching movies'.\n\nIn this question, we can see the possible choices are as follows:\n\n```python\nchoice1 = (1)\nchoice2 = (2)\nchoice3 = (3)\nchoice4 = (4)\nchoice5 = (5)\n```\n\n(1) What's the word used to identify choice 'C' and 'D'? 'Eat'. This means we can replace 'C' and 'E' with the keyword 'Eat.'\n(2) Let's find out what the 'word' is for the condition 'watching movies.' It is 'watch.' We know that 'watch' is the 'word' to identify the condition we want to replace.\n\nNow we can remove the keyword 'watch", "answer": "E: eat corn"}

The small stone, 2. a tighter shoe, 3. a smaller stone, 4. a larger stone, 5. a tight shoe, 6. a more uncomfortable shoe, 7. a less uncomfortable shoo, 8. a big stone.\nOutput: 1 and 7: These answers are correct because we get the \"small stone\" and the stone is now smaller due to the action of having a stone inside the shoe.\n2, 4, 6: These answers cannot be correct, because they do not change the size of a stone by putting it inside the shoe. Answer choices 2 and 6 refer to shoes that have become more or less comfortable due to the action of putting stones inside the shoe, while answer choice 4 refers to a stone that becomes even bigger. This leaves us with answer choice 3 and 8.\n3: This is a smaller stone than the big stone, which contradicts our original question.\n8: We get the big stone due to the action of placing a stone inside the shooe, which contradicts our initial question that the stone gets smaller due to this action.\nSo the final correct answer is 1 and 7\n\nInput: What would you put on your hand before making a big move in ping pong?

{"text": "1.\"Where do most people keep\" in this question is asking where people typically or most likely store their magazines.\n2. \"Doctor\" is often associated with medicine and medical practitioners- but magazines are not related to healthcare and are used as a form of entertainment. So, doctor can be eliminated. So, A: bookstore, B: library, C: home and D: table can be considered.\n3. Bookstores are commonly used to display and buy books but are not typically used to store them and sell other items such as food and clothes, so bookstores can be eliminated. B: Library\n4. There are many types of libaries, from school, community to college libraries. Magazines are one type of material that you would find in a library, so the question of where people keep most of the magazines is a valid question for a library since they might typically store and have the most magazines of any typical place. Therefore, library can be eliminated. The remaining choice C: home. C: home\n5. There is a reasonable possibility that people may keep their favorite magazines at home, they can be eliminated, so C (home) has a strong chance of being correct.

A: hospital seems to be a very wrong answer for this. Some young children may be hospitalized but they are not usually at the child/toddler level that is being sought. So the answer is wrong.\n2. B: orphanage is not correct either because it is a place that houses foster children and can be a place to hold toys but it is typically not a place that people look for missing children. So, the answer of orphanage is not the right one.\n3 C", "answer": "E: table"}

{"text": "1) John is stuck in his house and can't get out the front door. \n2) There was a fire alarm going off, so the house may actually be on fire.\n3) John is afraid of being trapped inside when the smoke alarms sounded, so he may also be frightened about being stuck if the house burns down.\n4) It was a false alarm, so the house was probably not on fire.  However, during the false alarm, there may still be a real danger of a fire.  It happens that a lot of houses caught fire during a false alarm.  So it's possible John is also stuck because of a true real emergency situation in his house that went unnoticed.\n5) The house may be stuck in a snowstorm preventing John from getting his car out or the garage isn't big enough to park his car in there to leave his house.\n6) The house may be facing south and the smoke detector is on the south side of the house so it's more likely to sound than on the north side.  So he still feels stuck when the smoke detector goes off, even if it wasn't a true alarm situation.\n7) So, John may be stuck in multiple ways.  He could have a burned house, he could be dealing with a true emergency situation in his home that went unnoticed, he could be stuck in his house due to a snow storm, he could inadvertently put himself in a tight situation through false parking assumptions, and he may be over-sensitive to smoke alarms after a non-emergency false alarm situation.\n\nSo the final answer(a combination) is A: fire B: face south C: winter storm D belong to\n\nInput: What might a man use to trim his beard?

The options are: touchdown, fumble, out of bounds, foul and offensive penalty. If the referee didn't call on something it must mean it was not a penalty, foul, fumble or out of bounds, as those are calls made by the referee. This only leaves us with the options: touchdown or offensive penalty.\n3. Touchdown implies a score being made or a successful catch so it cannot be the case here as the question says he didnt call on the football game.\n4.

A whorehouse is a brothel- an establishment where prostitution of individuals is facilitated.\n4: However, option B might suggest a location that is hidden or concealed, so that this answer cannot be correct.\n5: The only place left to consider is option C: street corner.

{"text": "1: The question asks why one might not want to be working wood. \n2: Choice A: Blisters is not an explanation. A blister occurs as a result of working wood, and does not provide the reasoning for working wood in the first place. So, it can be eliminated as a possible culprit and does not warrant a selection as a choice.\n3: Choice B: Frustration does not match the question's logic and reasoning, it is an outcome of working wood and can be eliminated as well.\n4: Choice C: Money describes an overall benefit of working, and although not necessarily what one would expect from someone who does not want to be working, it can be removed as a possible culprit.\n5: Choice D: Make money does not describe someone who does not want, but rather someone who does want to make money, so it can be removed as well.\n\n6: Choice E: Money describes being paid and does not warrant removal, so it can be kept in consideration as the choice.\n7: So, the choice that is not what one might expect from someone who does want to work with wood is the choice of E: Money\nSo the final answer was E: money\n\nInput: What is worse to eat, pig or snail? Choices:  B: chicken C: horse D: rabbit E: steak F: cat\nOutput: 1.: The question asks what is worse to eat, and it does not indicate what specifically is worse to eat.\n2. Pig and chicken are both animals, but the question does not indicate whether the animal in question is a mammal or a bird. Snail is a mollusk, and a rabbit is an herbivorous mammal. So it is not immediately obvious if it is worse to eat rabbit or snail.\n3. Horse is an ungulate mammal, and cat is a carnivorous mammal, both are animals and are not both better or worse to eat.\n4. So the question is asking if eating a pig is worse than eating a snail, which would not be expected. This eliminates one answer which is  F: cat.\n5. The other choice which is  D: rabbit does not make sense, as if eating pig is worse than snail,", "answer": "A: blisters"}

Since we are dealing with a cottonmouth snake, it is important to consider the choice that may apply to this specific snake.\n2. \"georgia\" is not an american state, so this option can be eliminated. Also, georgia is not the native habitat of cottonmouth snakes, so this option does not fit the requirement.\n3. \"tree\" does not fit the requirement since cottonmouth snakes do not typically live in trees. So this option.\n4. \"nature\" may fit the requirement since cotonmout snakes come from a natural habitat, but this option can be eliminahed since it does not describe an specific American location.\n5. \"under the rocks\" refers to a type of behavior and can be eliminated as the question asks about location.\n6. \"france\" may be ruled out since cottonmouth snakers are not found in france and do not reflect the \"american\" requirement, so this option can also be eliminated.\n7.

Grocery shopping is often associated with meal planning and a day's worth of sustenance. So, the most likely time to shop would depend on the type of groceries being purchased.

Frozen foods, canned foods, and packaged goods can often be purchased and stored for longer periods of time. This would allow purchases to be made with more flexibility in terms of timing.\n3.

So, choose options that could be within or near the top of a tall building, and eliminate others that don't make sense with his location.\n2: James can see clouds when he looks out his window, which indicates he is in a fairly high location.  The location of a radio station is usually on the ground floor of an office building.\n3: The location of a city is not necessarily at the top of a high building.  So, this isn't a good match.\n4: James is living in a tower, which would be in a fairly high location, and he can see clouds when he goes out his window.  This also describes the top of a tall castle.\n5: A medieval castle has no windows or towers, so it can't be considered.\n6: James is still living in a tower, so this cannot be the answer.\n7: James is only seeing clouds from inside his tower when he looks out the window.  This means he is not on the ground floor, and a city or radio station would be lower in elevation than this.\n8: The clouds that James can see when he looks out his tower could be high in the sky when the view is unobstructed.  But if he was at a city he would only see lower in the sky.  James would have to be at the top of the tower to see the clouds that he described.\n9: James was living in or near a high building, like a tower, since he could see clouds.  But he wasn't looking out a window.  So it can't be the answer.\n10: James is only able to look out his window at clouds inside the tower where he lived.  If he was walking around a city, he wouldn't be able to see clouds from ground level.  So there is no way to see clouds as we do.  The only valid answer choice is B: radio station. The radio station is located on the top floor of a tall building, making it high enough to allow for clouds to be seen.\nSo the final output is B: radio station", "answer": "C: city"}

The clerk normally puts away the checks before they are handed to the person writing the checks. \n5. Choice C, the pay envelope was mentioned only because the clerk is not putting away the checks right away, and the paycheck is to be paid upon their return from work the next day, or the next week. \n6.

Since \"fighting\" means to try hard to do something, this does not apply to the situation. \n5. Choice E: \"produce\" can mean to make something, but in the original sentence it is describing the emotion/feeling that James had, not what he did, so this can be eliminated. The fact that James had this feeling does not imply that he made something as a result.\n6. Choice C can also be disregarded, because \"construct\" means to make (something or someone) become stronger, tighter, more powerful, or more useful, but this is not the meaning used in the context of the sentence.

Choices:  I: in the house II: in the sea III: under the ground IV: in their basement V: in a lamppost\nOutput: 1: There are many possibilities here for the answer. I. the lighthouse keeps the light in the house. \"In the house\" is very ambiguous. It might refer to the lighthouse or just the house of the keeper of the lighthouse.\n2: The second possibility is II: in the sea, the lighthouse must have its electric light underwater. This is what usually happens in most lighthouses.\n3: And the third possibility is IV: in their basements. This could be any kind of basements like one in a house or in an old tower.\n4: And the fourth choice is either the IV: in their basemens or the II: in the sea. Because all the light from the lighthouse is in the sea, it would be wrong if the lighthouse itself has \"light\" in the basement of the lights themselves.\n5: And the last answer is of course V: in a lampshade. This is a strange answer but since all choices are strange, an option has to be the last one anyway.\nSo the final possible answer that could fit the question is I: in the sea, II: In the sea, IV: in their baseme, or V: in the lamp.\nSo the final options selected are either I: in the sea or II: in the sea\n\nInput", "answer": "E: rain forest"}

Johnny and Bill don't want food, they want money specifically in this scenario so this wouldn't make sense.\n5) Option D: \"increase power\"? If Johnny wanted to increase his power over Bill, a better option would be to do something specific and relevant to the issue at hand - namely, resolving the money dispute between them.\n6) Option E: \"kill Bill\"? This is in fact exactly what Johnny would NOT choose to do. Killing Bill makes no sense in this scenario where they were fighting over money, not due to personal differences or rivalry.

Choice E: Calm: Calmness is related to certain types of music, such as relaxation music, but it is not specific to a lack of listening to music.\n8.

{"text": "1 The question asks for a divider that stores papers for work or for school, with a focus on the organization, rather than the physical structure or the medium.\n2. Binder is a physical container that may store papers for the purpose of organization, but it's not a divider per se, it's merely a tool used for managing the organization.\n3. Obesity similarly is not a type of divider, nor is it a mechanism for storing papers, or even a medium on which papers are stored. Therefore, we eliminated option C.\n4. Living room doesn't specifically store papers for either work or school; it could be for either one, or both, but it's still not what the question is asking for.\n5. Office suite is a specific organizational method, rather than a physical divider. So it cannot be correct.\n6. So this leaves us with A: street and E: office suite. Both of these could organize the stored papers for either work or for school.\n7. A: street is the wrong format to organize papers, as it lacks the organizational tools or dividers.\n8. So, we conclude that the answer must be E: office suite, as it is a proper place where papers are stored.\nSo the final and only answer is E: office suite\n\nInput: Your friends are watching the big game on TV.

Choices:  C: by looking at the number of times you've had to solve it. E: by writing it in different colors\nOutput: 1) The correct answer is C: By Looking at the number of times.\n2) Option A: \"By thinking of it for a long time\" is not a reliable or efficient solution to resolving an impossible equation - therefore it should not be the correct answer. \n3) Option B: \"By looking at the number\" is not a suitable answer because the question doesn't ask to look at the number of times _after_ solving the equation, but to solve it in the first place. \n4) Option D: \"By writing in different colors\" is not a solution to solving an impossible equation itself -- it is intended to help you remember which solutions you've tried. Even if it may help with the task of remembering previous attempts, it doesn't actually resolve the issue at hand. \n5) Choice E: \"By Writing in Different Colours\" is a good thing to do to make it easier to remember _which attempts you've made_, but this does not actually solve the equation itself.\n6) All other answers are irrelevant to the question.\n\nSo the final answer here is C:Looking at the number.\n\nInput:If I were a teacher of mine, I would say that you are lazy.

Choices: 1) ions and neutrons 2) electrons and protons 3) charges and valence 4) positive and negative charges 5) attractive and repelling 6) cations and anions\nOutput: The answer is A: electrons and protons. Ionic bonding occurs when metals lose electrons and nonmetals gain electrons to form ions, resulting in a combination of two or more different elements. Ionic bonding is characterized by the strong bond between cations and anions.\nHowever, the main components of ionic bonding are the electrons and protons of the atoms, rather than the elements themselves. This means that the ions and neutrons listed in 1) and 5) do not play a major role in the bonding process. The charges of ions are defined by their outer shell electrons and the number of electrons the ions gain or lose is equivalent to the number of electrons they remove from the metal, not their number of neutrons. The valences of ions 3) are equal to the number of their ions lost or gained and the positively charged and negatively charged listed in 6) refers to the ions, not the elements. The positive ions are formed when an atom gains electrons from the outer shell, while the negative ions are", "answer": "B: have fun"}

If you ranked these pool from shallowest to deepest, you would realize that the smallest pool, meaning the shallowest pool, is option A: Swimming Pool.\n4. Ponds and Lakes are larger water bodies, which implies that they contain more water than swimming pool, and this makes them deeper. Children\u2019s pool is also smaller that both ponds and lakes, but is deeper than both ponds and lake, because there are two layers of water in a swimming pool, and that means there is a depth change and the children\u2019s pool is deeper so it\u2019s smaller, therefore shallower.\n5. Then finally we see that while a lake is larger than a pond and contains more water, the depth in a lake is not higher than a pond or a children\u2019s pool, so the deepest pool is B: Pond.\n6.

{"text": "1) The question, though quite ambiguous in that it fails to clearly describe what is \"all around\" about the real estate agent who wins the trust of her buyer, is actually quite direct with regard to the answer it seeks.\n2) So our options must be those things that can be described as \"all around\", that is to say: charming, delightful, deceptive and all the rest needing to be eliminated.\n3) The first to be eliminated is \"manipulative\". A real estate agent being manipulative would be a deal-breaker and there is no way to sell a house to a stranger without them trusting you. Next to be eliminated is anything that causes them to doubt the agent. \"Exaggerate\" is this option because \"exaggerations\" can be the basis for mis-trust whereas, on the other hand: \"manipulative\", \"deceptive\", etc, are things that may cause one to doubt the agent.\n4) Last option to be eliminated is B: \"cunning\". Cunning is the ability to be crafty, cunning and smart; however, being cunning and untrustworthy at the same time is what one might expect from someone who is crafty or cunning or smart but not so from a real estate agent who is trying to be trustworthy.\n5) So, the answer is: D: delightful. Delightful is \"all around nice\", it is one of those things we naturally and unconsciously expect from people of a particular profession whom we need to trust the most and who we will interact with on a regular basis with (like a real estate agent and a house purchaser or renter).", "answer": "B: charming"}

C: Smiling is a natural expression that can be seen when meeting new people often but in the end it does not provide enough description to be able to determine whether someone is experiencing new people as their experience\n6. D: Being bored is when someone experiences their experience as being dull, tedious, or repetitive. However, for a person that is aloof and has self-importance, meeting new people wouldn't be considered boring. \n7. E: Making new friends is when someone experiences meeting new people as an opportunity to develop new relationships or connections with others. It is a highly positive experience and often leads to growth and satisfaction in life. \n8. This leaves us with answer B, anxiety. Anxiety is a type of emotion characterized by feelings of dread and elevated levels of stress. It is closely linked to the concept of nervousness and can be experienced when meeting new people. Therefore, this would be the correct answer.\nSo the final answers are B: anxiety\n\nInput: You hear it when you go to the dentist. What is it?

{"text": "1: The question asks about where a person might keep a book while it is being read. \n2: Reading is a solitary activity, which means that a person might usually keep a book on their desk (alone) while reading. \n3: Option B is the Library of Congress, and while a person may keep a book there while it's being stored, it's not a likely place to keep it while reading. Hence, we can eliminate B.\n4: Option C, the classroom is a place to keep a book when it's being read as well as other learning activities are undertaken in classrooms, but it's not the most common location in any given scenario.\n5: Option D, in bed is unlikely as it's an unsteady and impractical place to keep a book while it being read. Option D can be eliminated\n6: Option E has desk as a place to keep a read book, and it fits with the question because a desk is a typical location to keep a book while reading; option E can stay.\n7: So by crossing out all but the most appropriate locations, we are left with a book being kept on the desk while being read. \n8: Thus, the answer is E: desk. \nSo the final answer desk\n\nInput: What does the word \"vocabulary\" mean?

{"text": "1 The Fat Man is a reference to the famous \"Why does the chicken cross the road?\" joke that can be read like this:\n2. A: No go - The Fat Man refusing to accept what is possible is not a typical response to this popular joke, so this response doesn't align with the humor.\n3. B: Unlikely - This response is unlikely as the fat man is a common way to introduce humor or sarcasm, not necessarily a response to this specific joke.\n4. C Unable- This response could be appropriate as the Fat Man is often used as a way to make a joke about being unreasonable, but it doesn't explain the sarcasm of the joke.\n5. D: Cant do - This response could be relevant since the Fat Man has difficulty performing simple tasks, but it doesn'texplains the humor of the joke in this situation.\n6. E: Impossibility- This response is possible, since the Fat Man often makes impossible requests that are used for humor, but it doesn'texplain that this is in response to a simple activity.\n7. The correct answer is therefore, D: can't do. Fat Man compains that he \"can't\" do simple things, including crossing the road.\nSo the final ansuer is D: cant do", "answer": "D: cant do"}
{"text": "1) The question asks about what someone who gets angry after they get drunk is likely to participate in.\n2) As we read through all the options, A: violence cannot be the right answer as the clue \"after getting drunk\" indicates that violence may not happen. \n3) As we read through B: falling down, it is clear that this is not the correct answer because the word drunk indicates that a person may be disoriented and may not fall down.\n4) As for options C: vomiting and E: lower standards, we can eliminate both of these option because they are both activities associated with drunkenness and would not be engaged in by someone who gets angry after becoming drunk.\n5) Option D: Vomiting indicates that a person may become sick when they get drunk, but not vomit because the answer is specifically to participate in an activity.\n6) So the correct answer must be B: falling down. This answer is correct because a person might get angry upon becoming drunk and because the person is drunk, they might fall down.\nSo the final answers is B: falling down\n\nInput: What is red and white at Christmas? Choices: 1. A: Christmas tree 2. B. St. Nick 3. C: Candy cane 4. D: Rudolph 5. E: Santa Claus\nOutput: 1.) Answer 1 is false as a Christmas tree is neither red nor white at Christmas. The only colors of a Christmas tree are green and brown since these colors signify nature.  2.) Answer 2 is also false as St. Nick is not red nor white at Christmas and Christmas is not a red nor white holiday. \n3.) Answer 3 is true. A Candy Cane is red and white at the winter holiday of Christmas.   4.) Answer 4 is true. Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer is depicted as being red-nosed. 5.) Answer 5 is also true. Santa Claus is shown wearing  a Red suit at Christmas.   So the correct answers are A. Christmas tree, B. St. Nick, and C. Candy cane.\nSo the final Answers is A: Christmas tree, B.

{"text": "1.) In assessing each choice, A: dog's and E: nature are not accurate answers, since they are different objects and would therefore not conflict.\n2.) B: floor or E: nature would be a good starting answer since they are the same object. If we choose B: floor, C: garage would be ruled out because \"ripping apart\" is inconsistent with it. Likewise, if we choose E: nature, then D: trouble would be ruled out since \"ripping apart\" doesn't fit.\n(Same logic as before, just trying to eliminate unnecessary steps. If you aren't sure about the problem solving here, try to keep it simple first. You can eliminate choices that have no conflict with the other parts. It will likely take only 3-4 steps to get a good answer)\n3.) Choosing A: dog's is our first elimination because E: nature is not what is being tore and we are not sure what is being torn, so A: dog's gets eliminated.\n4.) Choosing E: nature still fits and makes sense, and D: trouble would not be as plausible, thus we have a possible answer\n(This last bit can be ignored if you feel it's unnecessary. I like to think of the problem in two steps, where the first step is to find the answer that fits the prompt, and the second step is to rule out other answers that don't fit to verify. So I thought of this to show as one step of solving the problem. It's up to you to decide whether to cut some of the extra text and steps or not)\n5.)

Choices:  a. He walked there. b. He rode the bus there. c. He got off the bus and walked there. d. He took the bus to his destination? e. He walked to the wrong bus stop and the bus took him there.\nOutput: 1) The man could have walked from point A to point b which he did, as he said he \"Walked off the bus and started walking at point b. However, in this case, the man walked, not traveled by bus.\n2) He could have taken the bus, but that was not the intent of the prompt as stated by himself, \"I got off the bus and started.

{"text": "1) You can hear testimony of people who have their lives changed by spirituality. The question asks for the action that is done by the people in their testimony.\n2) It does not say that the testimony has to be from a particular type of worship, so options A and B can be eliminated. So, the action is not going to church or testifying in court.\n3) Opinions on the effectiveness of soap operas varies widely, so people may have different opinions about what they do about their life. In that way, you can't really gauge the effectiveness of it. So it is not D: paying attention.\n4) You can't pay attention or testify to other. Paying attention is done by the person (singular) and by people (plural) and is a non-action.  So the last two options can be eliminated. Now all that is left to choose from are options C and E.\n5) Option C refers to watching, not going or paying attention. It seems unlikely that paying attention can be changed by watching something. Go to court and change, then the witness can testify of positive change.  So that leaves E: go into court.\n6) You can go into court to have your life changed, not a courtroom. The only one you go into is the building called the courtroom, in which you testify and the judge rules on your case.

{"text": "1) The question is asking for an indoor location where one can feel like one has all the space in the \"world\".

So these two options can also be eliminated.\n3) A \"basket\" also appears to be an incorrect option since it's a single small contained space, not even a large room of that shape.\n4) This leaves us with just two options: A \"Big house\" and a \"Small apartment\".\n5) However, in looking at these two, a small apartment seems to make more sense since it can be a physical contained space that offers the illusion of space due to the small square footage.\n6) So the \"final\" answer is a \"small apartment\".\nSo the final answer  is C: A small Apartment\n\n---", "answer": "E: big house"}

The options only ask about the type of surface that Bob crossed with.\n2 Option A: \"bed of nails\" is a type of surface, but it is not ground\n3 The question only asks \"where did he run?\", so option B \"town\" cannot be the answer.\n4 Option C: \"attractive consistent look\" does not refer to the place where Bob ran. So, this can be eliminated. Option D: \"city block\" could involve running, but that does not answer the question, because the options do not involve the kind of ground surface Bob ran on.\n5 Option E: \"ground\" is the perfect answer because Bob's feet hurt because of running on the warm surface.\nSo the final answe is E: ground\n\nInput:What is the difference between \"fat\" and \"obese?\" Choices:A: fat is to bmi as obese is to bmi B: fat is to bmr as obese is to smr C: fat is to smr as obese is  to obmr D: fat is to smo as t is to gmr E: fat is greater than obese is greater than gmr\nOutput:1 The question asks for a difference between two things, \"fat\" and\"obese\". \n2 Option A, \"fat is to bmi as\" cannot be the comparison; \"fat is to\" would be a subtraction (instead of comparison) so we must eliminate this choice.\n3 Option B, \"fat is greater than\" cannot be the comparison either since it would need an equals to instead of a lesser-than.\n4Option D, \"fat is less than\" is a good answer because both options need a lesser-than in order to be the comparison, and this contains a less than.\n\n5Option E, \"fat is equal to\" also cannot be the correct comparison because one option is not equal to the another. Since Option E does not contain a greater than or less than comparison, we can conclude that it is the correct comparison. Therefore, the difference between fat and obese is \"fat is greater then obese\".\nSo the final answeris B: fat is to be as obese is to s mr\n\nInput:  I took the highway from home to the city", "answer": "D: city block"}

This is false as the child will be responsible for whatever they do regardless, and is actually the parents stopping them in doing so\n4: Choice D: they may not make good choices. This choice is false since the children actually are allowed to make some choices on their own, just not major ones\n5: Choice C: the children aren't responsible. This is simply not the case and the choice is removed.\n6: Thus, the correct answer is choice B: they can be rude.

There is no way that a mother would take her children to a pharmacies where there are drugs being sold and prescriptions being written for people.\n5. The baseball stadium is not in the middle of the field, so it is not a football stadium.\n6. The baseball stadium also doesn't have a soccer field surrounding it, so it is not in a soccer stadium either.\n7. Therefor the answer is B: baseball stadium, not C: baseball stadium or D: pharmacy.\nSo the final answers are B: baseball stadium\n\nInput: Which of the following is made of silicon? Choices:  solar panel B: solar eclipse C: al gore D: aluminum E: solar oven\nOutput: \nWhen solar panels convert sunlight into usable energy through technologies such as photovoltaics, thermophotovoltaics and artificial photosynthesis, they need the photon absorbers that have to be made of materials such as silicon, gallium phosphide, gallium arsenide, cadmium telluride, helium iodide, copper-indium-gallium-selenide, or amorphous silicon.\n1. Since the choice is specifically labeled as \"solar panel\", it's obvious that panels that use different, non-silicon materials are not correct.\n2. Solar panels are made of silicon.\n3. Solar eclipses are not made out of silicon.\n4. Al Gore is a politician and is also not made out of silicone.\n5. Solar eclipsi are not made of aluminum- they are caused by the moon and sun.\n6. Solar ovens are made by heating the inside using sunlight.\nSo", "answer": "C: baseball stadium"}

{"text": "1: The question is asking for which means of transportation would be best suited for exploring space. \n2. One obvious choice is road block. This is the most likely answer, as it is common knowledge that space exploration is very difficult and that people are often in for a rough ride when they explore and live in space.\n3. However, road block does not actually exist.\n4. The next reasonable choice is transportation shuttle. Shuttles are regularly used as spacecraft and are commonly used by NASA and other space organizations for transportation purposes.\n5. Hoverboard is not a choice in the list and is not suitable for space travel. The movie \"Back to the Future\" shows it as a possible means of transportation in Earth, but not in space.\n6. The next choice to remove is supermarket. While it is commonly seen as a popular means of transportation for goods, it is certainly not suitable for space exploration.\n7.

The person may want to catch a cold or the sun and also do D: feel humiliation, but it is unlikely that these options are the desired outcome.\n3. Since option C, \"prepare to go\" could mean to \"prepare\" oneself for arrest, this can be eliminated. But option B, \"catch cold\" does not sound like the right answer, as that could mean this person wanted to catch a cold. \n4. A: 'feel humiliated' seems possible but not necessarily the expected outcome, given that the person knew the police were \"after him\".\n5. So it leaves us with E: 'hunt for food'. \n6.

The building is used to store books in a library. Thus, it must be a building made of buildings, in other words, a large building which is capable of containing rooms made of smaller buildings. Let's take each choice in turn for each of these sub-points, making use of the sub-points as a guide.\n2. Option I: public housing facilities is indeed an option since it refers to public buildings, but it does not refer to storage and thus is not used for storage, so cannot be a library building.\n3. Option II: private hospitaltherefore does not meet the minimum requirements for being a library building: it does not require public buildings, though it does refer to private buildings, which is correct enough.\n4. Option III: public schools, does indeed contain many private buildings. Though all public schools will contain some private buildings, public schools overall themselves do not fit the requirements for being a library storage building.\n5. Option IV: public colleges: again, the inclusion of private buildings does not make this suitable, but the main disqualifying factor is the omission of a requirement for being capable of storing books.\n6. Option VI: private museums: is not a storage building since it does not contain buildings", "answer": "B: think"}

Option A: Money is not a likely goal because it is a resource that may or may not be needed to achieve the stated goal, depending on the organization and/or the situation.\n5. Option B: notoriety is an emotion that is the likely result if one tells many people about an organization, not a goal itself.\n6. Option C: religion is like money and learning, it can either be a goal or a result, but it is not likely to be the goal.\n7. Option D: money is considered the likely outcome if one's goal is to tell many people about an organization.\n8.

If James was in an urban area and liked stars, he would be able to see them even if buildings were around.\n3. This means that the wilderness is somehow significant in terms of the viewpoint of stars without buildings or light around.  This is most true while in orbit, where there are no buildings to get in the way.\n4.

The question is asking for an action, but does not say whether or not the action could be for a happy or unhappy person. Thus it could be that the right answer is an option indicating a happy or cheerful action.\n2. Breaking this choice down, A: Board ship doesn't say whether or not a satisfied person would be happy- so eliminates that option. Since \"the satisfied person\" is presumed to be happy, we can assume that A: crossing street is a bad answer because crossing the street could be an unhappy action (or that it isn't a valid action to cross the street in the first place). B: grocery shopping is an action for a happy person, so it can be moved on to the next round, and C: feeling happy is an action that a happy person can do, so C: feeling happy can be moved to the next round.\n3. We are therefore down to two choices left- \"Shouting\" and \"happiness\" which represent happy (D) and unhappy (E) possible actions for a satisfied person.\n4.

We can therefore exclude choices D) and B).\n3) Choice E) is eternal rather than frequent, so we can eliminate it because it is a statement of the opposite of the right answer choice.\n4) Choice C) is unpredictable, but not necessarily infrequent or frequent. This answer choice could be true for a group observing every holy day every year - as we can see that the parties are infrequent, we can eliminate choice C).\n5) Thus, we are left with options A and E) - A) short term - meaning they only happen occasionally and not at all - or E) eternal, which means they happen infrequently, but more frequently than just infrequently.\n6) While both answer choices exclude the other answer choices, only choice E) actually includes the right answer, so answer E) is the right choice.\nSo the final choice is 1: \"E: eternal\", and there were five total choices, one was incorrect.", "answer": "D: frequent"}

The question also asks why she sings \"so much,\" which suggests that she regularly sings a lot and that her behavior might be viewed as odd to others.\n3. The question also suggests that she may be doing this to annoy others, as people who sing a lot tend to enjoy it and are unaware or unconvinced as to others' dislike for their singing. 4. The question asks why she sings so much, not why does she sing.\n5. The question asks why does she sing. This is a grammatically correct question. 6. So the question does not address the choice that she sings out of pleasure.\n7-8-9-10 1. Looking at the choices, option A, \"insane,\" is rejected because it doesn't directly address the question.\n2. Option B, \"annoy,\" does not address the level of singing that has been indicated by \"much.\"\n3. Option C, \"enjoy,\" is ruled out since the singer doesn't just enjoy singing, but sings a lot and in that way annoys others.\n4. Option D is to inhale, which indicates breathing in and holding the breath for a period of time, which is not singing or associated with singing.\n5. If Option E refers to having received a good voice from training or talent, the question can be read as \"why does she sing when she has been trained to have had a good voice?\", which doesn't fit the context of the question.\n6. And since there is no other option left, it must be that she has a good voice, so option E, 'had a good voice' is the correct answer to the question at hand\u2014\"Why does she sing so\u2026?\nSo the final answer to the question is E: had a good voice.\n\nInput: What has red and yellow stripes on a black background?

Option (B): \"Likeness\" suggests some form of comparison between the items, but also is not a function of adding or totaling items together. This would be incorrect.\n4. Option (C): \"Alike\" is too vague and could easily be interpreted as positive, but typically implies a sort of similarity or likeness. This would be incorrect in the context of this question.\n5. Option (D): \"Sameness\" is even less clear than \"alike\" and could be construed many ways, not in reference to something which a sum is typically done with. This would be incorrect\n6.

The question is asking us to place something (or things) in a certain location.\n3. Option A: linen closets are often used to store large, heavy blankets and sheets. This item in the question is thin and flat, so option A: linen closes is inappropriate.\n4. Option B, \"on the space heaver\", may seem viable at first but is an item for warmth, comfort, or heat, and is usually meant to go inside clothing rather than be a type of clothing you wear directly.\n5. Option C: kitchen is not suitable because what this question asks for a place for are \"cloths to be put away\". Some items found in or near the kitchen such as tea towels, napkins, dishrags and towels may be suitable to put in such a place, but clothing items are not.\n6. Option D: fabric store is used to sell clothing items, not store them.\n7.

C) \"Energetic\" is not a natural response that occurs immediately after exercise.  Instead it is a positive change that is felt gradually over time, perhaps days or weeks later, and is influenced by other factors besides exercise alone.\n4.

Choices:  a: stomach b: blood c: heart d: skull e: hooves f: eyes g: eyelashes h: snout\nOutput: 1: This answer is g: eyelid. Although a cow has an eyelid, it does not have any eyelashes. In fact, the lashes themselves are a part of the eye, not the lid. The question is asking what part of a cow\u2019s anatomy is related to the cow\u2019s brain, and therefore is asking for an organ that is related to the brain of the cow and it\u2019s location on the body.

In addition, the lens of the eye is directly related to the brain, as it controls and modulates the amount of light that reaches the retina, controlling depth perception and more. Also, the optic or ciliary nerves from the brain control both the motion and focus, as the lens must have the ability to flex rapidly to maintain focus with any change in distance or focus.\nThe cow does not have eyelashes, so answer choices a: stomach and c: heart can be eliminated.

Choices: a: the size of a sliver b: microscopic c: massive d: a superhero e: supernatural\nInput: A: the size of a ___\nRationales:\n1. The question asks about an organism being described as a phrase. This means it is not just a word, but a phrase, which typically includes a modifier, verb, and/or a noun.\n2. Among the choices, slap (choice B) is a noun, while slammy (choice C) is clearly a modifier because it can only modify another adjective; it cannot stand on its own as a noun for something.\n3. Therefore, we eliminate choice B: slappy (a noun) and Choice C: slammy (a modifier).\n4. In a recent scientific news story, the only phrase that is used to describe the organism is \"the size of a ___.\"\n5. As you can see, \"the size of a __\" is indeed a noun phrase.\n6.

Choices: \n### A: Its surface\n### B: A layer of gases\n### C: An object with different dimensions\n### D: No gases\n### E: Its color\n### Rationales:\n\n\nThe red color seen at sunset and sunset is a result of the scattering effect that occurs as the sun's light travels through the earth's atmosphere. \n\nThe sun's surface (option A) does not cause the red sunrise or sunset. \n\nA layer of gases (option B) can contribute to the red color of the sun at sunset. \nThe scattering effect occurs as the sun' s light passes through the earth's layer of gases, such as oxygen and nitrogen. These particles of gas can scatter the light in various directions, causing different colors to be seen at different angles. \n\nA cloud can cover the sun and create the red color of the sky (option E), but a cloud of dust or smoke will create a different red color. \nThe scatter of gases (option E) is the cause of the red color at sunrise and sunset. \nWhile clouds can also cause the coloration, their red coloration is due to the backlighting effect, in which the sun's light passes through the cloud and is scattered onto the ground. \n\nThe color of the sun (option E) is related to the scattering effect, but it is not the only factor. The scattering effect can also be influenced by other elements in the atmosphere, such as dust particles, smoke particulates, and pollutants. \n\nIt is possible to construct a small model of a sun (option A), but a sun is a large object made of different elements, and its red color does not necessarily depend on it being spherical. \nThe model would not necessarily reflect the same scattering effect as the real sun. \n\nIn addition, various objects (eg: the surface of the sun) have different physical dimensions (eg: spherical), but their color is determined by other properties. \n\nThe presence of gases", "answer": "C: music class"}

The choice, therefore, would be C, because it is the only choice in the set that involves chemistry.\nHaving stated that, the correct choice, B, does involve chemistry. The only place that would offer such a service is an actual darkroom. The darkroom is a special space where chemicals are used to remove imperfections from photographs by developing exposures.

Michigan has more than one highway. But it seems to be Michigan is just mentioned in the answer. But what does `expressway can suffer from traffic` mean? Does that mean that expressway can suffer from the traffic? Or does it mean that expressway suffer from traffic? If the first case, then it's not an expressway but `I-90`, a highway that goes between two cities in Michigan in the USA.

{"text": "The part of the job that the judge did not take lightly was punishing wrongdoers using a court sentence.\n\n### Justify the response:The instruction asks us to \"what\" the judge did not take \"lightly\". \"Lightly\" is referring to the judge's perspective of how serious the job was. By \"this part\" in the question, the author is referring to the judge and the task that he performed on an everyday basis: judging the guilty. Therefore, the sentence refers to the judge's perception of his role and how serious he took the job of punishing wrongdoers.\n\n### Reference to rationales:This choice was supported by the following references: In the given scenario, the judge did not take the man's punishment \"lightly\".  This can be inferred from the context of the scenario where the judge is trying to take the man's passing sentence to what?  This means that the question, \"why was the judge not taking the man's punishement lightly?\" can be answered with Choice D.\n\n\n\n### Rationale:A: An innocent person would not go to jail if they were found guilty.\nB: Incarceration means to imprison someone.\nC: Intercourse refers to sexual activity, not a punishment for wrongdoing.\nD: Death is a common punishment for wrongdoers, but not the only possible one.\nE: Judgement refers to the act of making a decision, not the sentence itself.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nWe had to answer many questions that asked us to justify our answers on why the answer is correct.", "answer": "D: death"}

The question asks about the most likely place someone would bring an attache case, a type of briefcase that is typically used for work purposes and typically has a handle.

Overhead compartments (choice A) on airplanes are commonly used for carrying luggage, including briefcases and other types of bags. 2. Chairs (choice B) are typically not meant to be used to carry or store briefcases or other belongings. 3. A hospital (choice C) typically does not have space or a purpose for someone to bring an attache case. 4.

Additionally, they're a staple food group in countries such as Mexico, Chile and Japan. These qualities and uses make baked potatoes a healthy food option to consume every day.   However, it's important to note that baking a potato can change its nutritional value, as cooking may help increase levels of Vitamin B6.

Choice A is immediately eliminated from consideration as it is not typically seen in bookstores unless they are also pet shops. Similarly, choice D is also eliminated as it is not a flower. Choice b is eliminated due to the nature of its being a purple flower. Choice E is eliminated as well, unless it is an anthology of plants, it would more likely refer to the color of a flower. Now, we are left with choices B, C, and E. From B and E, we know a planetarium is outside, would be indoors or outdoors, and would have shows or performances such as a concert, so we can eliminate both of them. In the option C, a bowling alley is a good indication that it is indeed a bookshop. Bowling alley can mean a venue located inside a bookshop where they can host activities such as reading clubs, games, or performances. \nC: a bowling alley.\n\n### Input : Choose a category\n### Response \nWe can eliminate the choices that are not categories, such as B, D, and E.

The blowfish doesn't live in the ocean, and no, it doesn't sell itself for a human to eat at a pet shop, nor does it live in a fairy-tale movie. If it did, the blowfish's name, \"blowfish\", would be an interesting choice to explain its existence in fairy-tale movies.\n4. A blowfish cannot live in a river.\n5. There are two options that describe beautiful places, i.e. \"great outdoors\" and \"river\", which are the best-fitting options.\n6.  The blowfish is \"free\", and therefore, it may be possible to place it in an open environment.\n7. \"Little mermaid\" cannot be a synonym of an environment, which doesn't fit with any of the other options. It doesn't even describe the blowfish, since it is \"he.\"\n8.  Finally, \"river\" refers to rivers, which can be home to fish that need to live in water. However, the blowfish does not need to live in the aquatic environment, and he is not even a fish.\n9. Therefore, the blowfish doesn't need to live in the Great Outdoors (i.e. \"free space\") nor does it mean living in the river. As a free animal and an individual, he can't fit in the pet shop, although it is true that a blowfish can be captured in a fish market in the pet shop. The word \"little\" might be added as an adjective to fit the size, however, it has nothing to do with the blowfish, and since it cannot apply to both males and females, it can't be applied to \"the blowfish\", which is a male.\n10.

I think I want the farmer who has the strong moral compass to produce in organic.\n- Since pears are my favorite fruits, if I have to eat pears, I would rather eat pears that were grown and produced in a healthy environment.\n- Since I also wish pears do not use so many pineapples, then I do not want to buy pears grown or produced in china.

The same is true for jazz (choice D), which is another type of music. Similarly, we can eliminate hip-hop (choice B) since this refers to a specific genre, not a performance venue.\n3.

A mother and her seven year old son are wearing matching pajamas, and a father and his six year old daughter are also wearing matching pajama. One of the mothers is holding a large lunch box when they are all in line for the Star Tours ride, and it is dripping rainbow colored water from the roof of the store. They all enter the attraction but the children are crying as they feel that their mother is ignoring them in order to take notes from people waiting in the line for their ride. The ride doesn\u2019t go in a straight line, and at one point the child realizes they have ended up in Paris France. The child is afraid, and her father realizes it. He asks his daughter if she would like to leave the ride, but she wants to stay and get off the ride at the first possible landmark. He understands, and asks the mother who is still taking notes to write a quick note saying that they will take her out of line if she wants. Her mother nods and replies, \u201cI already typed that. I just wanted to see if anyone else was thinking it\u201d, and takes out their phone and shows that it is full of notes on how other passengers feel about going on the ride. The father is proud of the mother and her note taking, but still slightly concerned that the children don\u2019t trust them as much as they used to.\n\n### Response (300 words, single-spacers)\n\nThe mother in the story is an example of a teacher who pays close attention to their students. There are two problems in the story. The first is that the mother could have been more clear with her daughter about when and how to leave the line or ride, and what to do if the ride does not go in a straight line. The second problem was that the father was also not paying as much attention to the children as the mother did.

It is a type of civil action that someone might take if they experienced a negative situation and wanted to seek resolution.\n\nOption C (anger) is a feeling that can also motivate someone to take action, but it's not necessarily related to taking a civil action as an option.

In sailboats, the helm can be described as the area where the steering mechanisms are found. This information is incorrect as the helm of a sailboat is on the stern of the sail. In motorboats and ships, the helm is found on the bow, but not in all boats. A tugboat and an inland barge are examples of boats that have their helms at the stern.

By interpreting the scenario in this way, it can be inferred that the car was stopped at a traffic light or was parked somewhere, or it was in the process of moving. \n4. Therefore, the driver of the car did not experience the impact of the window breaking, but the passenger or occupant did. \n5.  The beach (choice C) is the most likely destination of the small pieces of the broken glass, since this location is typically not associated with other significant sources of impact.\n6. The car was not driven to a bridge (choice B), in Spain (choice E), or the street (choice D).\n7.

Considering the given options, someone who needs to look pretty (B) has a style statement as their reason. \nThese statements do not address an issue with vision and would imply that the individual is choosing to wear them. \n\nA person who needs vision improvement (A) could be a good reason for needing glasses as well, as this is a medical issue that glasses help to address. \n\nA, E: These statements do not address an eye problem but would imply the person is choosing to wear the glasses. \n\nC: Someone who answers C is a strong candidate for having to wear glasses. \nBut, the individual is still able to drive with their glasses, which is not an option and would indicate that they do not need glasses.\n\nD: Although this statement might be an indicator of a need for a person to wear glasses, such as having eye allergies or dry eyes. \nThe question is asking why the person needs glasses, so having allergies does not directly answer that they wearing glasses, it would only state which allergy they have.\n\n\n## 2021-06-", "answer": "D: step forward"}

The question asks about the type of people someone in charge of a particular project will look for\n2. \"Looking for\" indicates that the kind of person the person in charge wants will have to be considered at some point\n3. Analyzing the given choices, we can eliminate choices A, B, and C, as these choices are either inappropriate or out of scope (A: greedy is not appropriate)\n4. The choice B: worried does not represent a quality the person in charge would look for either, as it is not necessarily the case that a person in charge of a project will be looking for someone worried.\n5. Analyzing choices D, which stands for \"Take charge\" can help the person in charge when looking for a person to work on a project.\n6. However, \"take charge\" is not an attribute the person in charge of a particular job will look for as some people can't be considered to be in charge.\n7. Therefore Choice E: bossy would be the most suitable choice as it can be assumed that the person in charge will look for someone who is bossy in order to be effective when managing the project.\n8. Reasoning: Choice D: take charge can help the person in the charge when looking for a project to work in, but it doesn't always mean that they will look this way when they are.\n9. Choice E: bussy could be the most appropriate choice as it can be expected that the person in charge of the project might look for bossy or bossy personality in order to effectively manage the project.\n10.

{"text": "In order to answer this question appropriately one must analyze each choice. Firstly choice \"A:\" appears suddenly is not an accurate choice since the word suddenly indicates something appears suddenly with out advance warning and choice \"A\" does not include a warning. Secondly, choice \"B: bottom out\" is also not correct since choice \"bottom out\" is referring to a tire having problems, not a person. Choice \"C: go downtown\" is inappropriate since choice \"go downtown\" refers to the word \"town\" and choice \"go downturn\" describes car crashes due to steep or hazardous roads. Finally, choice \"D: scream\" is inaccurate since the word \"scream\" does not describe a sudden event, instead in this scenario it refers to an event that happens over several minutes, not suddenly. The only choice that can be selected as the correct answer is \"E: roll over\" since \"roll over\" can be applied to something or someone and is a description of a sudden action.\n\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer: E\n\nInput: The last train to London is arriving in 09:39 hours.

The air that people breathe is generally recycled through ventilation systems and the shuttle would not typically be the place where people have recently shared air.\n\nA house (choice D) is an indoor place where people can share air. However, it doesn't indicate that the air has been breathed by \"many people recently.\" The answer would be different if the option said \"air that many people recently breathed in a house.\"\n\nA train station (choice E) is a place where people congregate to board trains and share air. However, the context of the station is implied, and the question only refers to air that has been breathe by many \"people.\" The option does not specify that the station is the place of sharing the air.\n\nThe surface of the Earth (choice E) is the most obvious place where people can breathe the same air as many others, the Earth has been used by many. However, this option doesn't specify \"recently,\" which would limit the number of people who share air from a large number of those who have lived on the Earth. Also, the air would likely have been recycled from the air around us by the natural forces of wind and other phenomena.\n\nBecause of these contexts and the specified conditions, the correct answer is B: the space shuttle.

{"text": "Input: What does a clock face look like? Choices: 1. clock face 2. 24-hr clock 3. digital clock  4. 12-hr clock\n\n### Rationale:\n1. The word \"face\" in the definition of a clock face refers to the layout of markings that indicate a time.\n2. 24hr clock: This clock uses the 24-hour system, which labels the hours by using digits (for instance, 2pm is written as 14:00, instead of 2pm).\n3. digital clock: This clock uses a digital display, such as a watch or a phone, which shows the time in numbers instead of analog markings.\n4. 12hr clock: This clock is most commonly used in the USA and refers to 12 o'clock being at the top of the clock.\n5. Thus, the correct choice out of the given selections is the 12hr clock.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The answer to the given question is A.\n2. The given definition of \"face\" refers to the front or outer part of a surface or thing, which indicates that a clock face is the layout of markings on a face of a clock.\n\n1. The choice C: clocks, although correct grammatically, is not the correct answer, as it does not refer to the markings on the face of a clock. Instead, clocks is more generally referring to the device that shows time.\n2. According to the given definition of clock face, A is the correct choice, as it refers to the specific markings on the face or surface of the clock, which is the outer clock face.\n\n1. Choice B: face refers to the front, or outer, part of a surface or object, as indicated in the dictionary.\n2. The word clock face, in regards to the time measurement device, refers to the layout of the markings on the front or surface of the clock.\n3. Therefore, the correct choice for the given question is A: clock face.\n\n### Input : Can you put your entire body into a hole? Choices: A. Yes B. No C.

While Chris is a person, it is not a tree.\nThe sequoia (choice D): the sequoia is not the largest tree in the world, despite the fact it is one of several contenders. The giant sequoia is a type of conifer found in California. The General Sherman Tree is one of the largest and oldest living things on earth, standing at roughly 85 feet or 26 meters in diameter and 275 feet or 84 meters in height.\nGeneral Sherman Tree (choice E): this is incorrect also.

Choice A mentions that one must have the right book to learn.  This does not imply efficiency as we can learn much faster and more effectively through other resources such as the internet, colleagues, or online courses.\n2. Choices B and C similarly imply that one needs to learn rather than work efficiently.\n3. Choices D and E imply that one has to be persistent. While this is true, it is a separate requirement; the question is asking about what must one have to work more efficiently.\n4. Hence, the only choice that does not imply improvement in work productivity is A: improve yourself, which suggests one has to improve themselves as an individual. This is a different concept and does not answer the question of how to be more efficient at work and thus, is not a correct response.\n5. As a result, based on the given choices, to learn must have the right tool, which is a key requirement for effective work.\nAnswer: The correct answer is Choice B: Have the tools!\n\n### Instructions: Answer the following multiple choice question\n\n### Input\n>How many animals live in India? Choices: \n>A: none B: millions C: thousands D: billions E: millions and billions\n\n### Response\nFirstly, it would be great to eliminate as many words in option A and option C that suggest a minimum amount of animals, as there are hundreds of millions of livestock animals in India; for example:\n\n- Option A uses the phrases \"none of the animals\" to suggest a zero amount, and similarly, option C uses the phrases \"thousands of animals\" to suggest a very low amount.\n- Option B uses the word \"millions,\" which is a very high number, to suggest a large amount.\n- Option D suggests an even higher number of \"billions\", which are even higher.\n- Option E also uses the word \"million,\" which is already a very high number; additionally, the use of the word \"and\" suggests the additional thousands of animals referred to in choice C, thus making an already high amount even higher.\n- Therefore, the", "answer": "C: have tools"}
{"text": "A: countryside.\n\n### RationaleA:  Countryside is the correct answer in an ordinary sense. \n1. \"Countryside\" is synonymous with \"field,\" which is why Choice B is incorrect. \n2. Similarly, \"B\" is incorrect because \"mountain countryside\" is an oxymoron. \n3. \"D\" suggests throwing the rock to the countryside of a mountain range, but this wording is confusing. \n4. \"C\" is incorrect because throwing a rock from a bridge would result in a splash in the river in the immediate vicinity of the bridge, which is not what you are trying to do. \n5. Similarly, \"E\" is incorrect because a surface isn't necessarily the countryside, and it doesn't tell us anything about where to throw a rock for a big splash in the river. \n6. \"A\" is the correct answer because it is the choice that contains the word \"countryside.\"\nAnswer: A: countryside\n\n### Test:\nThe answers for the practice questions are correct and the instructions for each question are valid. \n\n### Credentials:\nAuthor: [Evan Dong](https://github.com/eevandong/)", "answer": "C: bridge"}

{"text": "Electric fans are a common household appliance and are typically found around cooling systems in homes, such as air conditioners and swamp coolers, and in home offices. Cool temperatures are a common preference in indoor environments. Therefore, an electric fan could be placed in a home where its cool temperature is desired. A different set of temperatures may be desired in a hardware store, perhaps to help shoppers stay cool during warm weather. Electric heaters can be found in homes, hardware stores and offices. Temperatures are also likely to be cooler in an office than in a home or hardware store. Therefore, an electric heater could also be placed in an office where its warm temperature is desired. The most logical placement of an electric fan or electric heater is in a place where its temperature is desired. The term \"cool or cooling preferences\" is not used in the conversation. The words \"cool preferences\" in the given conversation are used in the context of preferences to cool down a person's body temperature. The other set of words, \"heater or warm preferences\" is also used in reference to preferences to cool down. Therefore, the given conversation is about electric fans and heaters which are used to cool down the person's body temperature by cooling the air they breathe in and making it feel more comfortable. \n\nInput:What can you use to dry hair or dishes?

An artist junkyard is not an entity that would need a balalaika, so A is out. Next, we can eliminate a music store as an improbable answer to the question because a music store might have a balalaika for sale, but not for use as a piece of musical equipment. It would therefore need to be played by an artist, and we'll move to the next option.\nSinging, in the context of the question, is not an entity that needs a balalaika. The question does not ask for which event singing would need a balalaica, or which piece of music singing makes use of a balalaika, or similar questions. We are simply asked what an entity would need the balalaika for, with possible answer options being: A. an event, B. the balalaika itself, C. singing, and so on.\nA symphony is not a possible answer to the question either because it does not have a balalaika. What needs the balalaika is not the entire symphony, but just a specific musical event, that is a concert or a show that uses the balalaika. Therefore, B. a concert and C. a show are good options.\nD. a symphony is out as an answer because it does not use the balalaika nor is it an event.\n\nLet's rule out a few events we have left: we know that an orchestra will not use a balalaika so Eliminate E. an orchestra too. The same is true for events with no orchestra (and thus no music or singing). These events we get rid of are: An artist junkyard, an event, an artist, and an artist's junkyard.

{"text": "The husband will feel pleasure. Explanation: Grief and isolation seem the least options with two choices left: D and E. D is unlikely as a feeling of grief isn\u2019t akin to being in some form of isolation.\n\nEven if the husband is being isolated because he is being grief-stricken, the concept of grief is more often related to a deep sense of helplessness, and a sense of hopelessness. The idea of isolation is not normally associated with the idea of \u2018grief\u2019 the way it is related to joy. It is more often a feeling of sorrow. This is why grief isn\u2019t the most probable choice.\n\nGrief is emotion and in the form of sadness and mourning the idea that you are separated from the person/object of grief. The feeling of mourning isn\u2019t usually felt by the person as an extension of the grief but rather as a feeling separate from the grief like in the case of death. Although grief and isolation are related, they are too different and are not akin to each other.\n\nThe other two alternatives are pretty clear and their relation to pleasure is also pretty clear. The other two choices seem much more suitable and even \u2018happiness\u2019, which is the most suitable alternative, is quite broad and vague. When asked to guess something, even if not a human emotion, the human imagination isn\u2019t sharp enough to guess a feeling quite clearly, however, being happy is one of those things that is easily visualized and understood by almost everyone.\n\nThe human mind, because of its sharpness at guessing human emotions and responses, could most easily answer this question with \u2018pleasure\u2019 as an option. Pleasure is happiness but more often than not, it is an emotion of joy. Pleasure is more distinct than happiness as it conveys more of an emotion of pleasure and not happiness. The other two alternatives are most definitely not akin to the concept of pleasure. The other two options may be closer to grief, as both have sadness attached to them but not related or associated with each other the way grief is.\n\nThe grief has an association with sorrow while isolation is not necessarily associated with any form of sorrow and grief. It would be akin to the feeling of \u2018decreased sociality\u2019 the way the alternative word is stated.", "answer": "D: grief"}

{"text": "The answer is Choice C: New York.\n\nGiven that the woman picked from an apple-tree and was surrounded by other trees that are not apples, we can reason that the apple tree must be present in an orchard.\n\nIn New York State, there are quite a few orchards that host apple trees. \n\nOne such location is The New York Apple Festival, which takes place in the village of Warwick [https://www.newyorkapplefestival.com/].\n\nSince it is mentioned that the woman was surrounded by other trees, orchards are appropriate choices for the question.\n\nInput: A music teacher is working at a school.

Choice E: The Music Conservatory, is incorrect because A: The Music Store, B: The Library and The Park can be found within school premises.\n\n2. Choice B: The Park is incorrect because The Music Conservatory is within the school premises.\n3. Choices A: The Music Store and C: The Library, both are within school premises.

When we think about what could be visible from a window from a place of work, we usually think buildings, so the answer is B): A city. 1) There are a lot of scientific fields that can be found within a city \u2013 medical research, technology, and pharmaceuticals, for example \u2013 so you could work in any city and still find yourself in a scientific field. 2) And if you work in a lab or research environment in a city, there are many things you could be doing: exploring new research methods, examining plants or animals, experimenting with a new medication or technology \u2013 all of which require a lot of paper", "answer": "B: woods"}
{"text": "This question requires us to analyze the choices provided and select the most logical option.\n\nThe term \"boring\" typically implies that a person or a group of people is experiencing a situation that is not exciting or interesting.\n\nFor children, being bored could potentially be due to a variety of reasons, such as lack of stimulation, lack of physical activity, or simply having nothing else to do.\n\nIn order to analyze the provided choices, it is important to consider the various activities that could be conducted by children as a response to boredom.\n\nIn the context of question, choice A, would specify \"walk\" that can be answered in a variety of ways, but does not provide enough information to answer the question thoroughly.\n\nChoice B, \"change shoes\" is unlikely to be the response to being bored. Additionally, it is a rather inane response to the question.\n\nChoice C \"play tag\" implies that the children are not necessarily bored, but are seeking out a form of physical activity. Thus, eliminating this choice.\n\nChoice D \"smell smoke\" is rather vague and is not a specific activity.\n\nChoice E \"reach over\" is also vague and is not a response to being bored, it could simply be a distraction to the question.\nHence, we can eliminate the remaining choices and conclude that the most logical and appropriate answer to the question is \"change shoes\" as an appropriate response to being bored for children.\n\n### Input(s): The pig's name is Wilbur, but he doesn't always use that. Why? Choices: 1. It is too long 2. Everyone calls him Wilbur 3. It's not his favorite name \n4. The names are too fancy (option 5)\nRationales: In the context of question, option 1 specifies that it is too long. However, the sentence \"Everyone calls him Wilbur\" is a clear indication that the name is not too long and is a common way to refer to him.\nMoreover, option 3 \"The names are too fancy\" does not refer to the name itself, but rather implies that the name is somewhat fancy.\nSince option 1 is false, we can eliminate it.\n\nOptions 2 and 4, however, are valid points of reference since they are both examples of people", "answer": "C: play tag"}
{"text": "Input:  What does the answer not require? Choices: A. a basketball B. a sports store C. a basketball hoop D. a basketball court E.a referee\n\nRationales:Reasoning: 1. If the answer does not require a basketball hoop, then basketball is not a sufficient condition for having the correct answer.\n2. The answer does not require a referee. A referee is in charge of monitoring the game and ruling on the fairness of plays, but does not make a difference in getting a ball.\n3. Having a basketball hoop is not necessarily a sufficient condition for obtaining a basketball, so A is not sufficient.\n4. Choices B, C, and D cannot be eliminated as other options by reasoning as above, so we move on to eliminating E.\n5. If one were to ask the question where can one find a ball, the option of a \"soccer game\" does not make sense, as one goes to a sports store to get a ball.\n6. Hence, the option \"soccer game\" can be eliminated as incorrect. \n7. We move on to eliminating A. By reasoning as above, we can conclude that having a basketball hoop is never a sufficient condition for obtain a basketball.\n8. Therefore, the correct answer here is D:a basketball court.\nA is in the choices because it's a sufficient condition for a ball.

{"text": "You could find air that has been recently breathed by only a small number of people in a house (choice B) or a cupboard (choice C).\n\n### Rationale:\nWe can immediately eliminate choice A: train station because we wouldn't be able to find air that wasn't recently breathed in by many people. Choice D: cricket stadum is also out because it's not likely to be a building where you would encounter air that hasn't been breathed by many people. Finally, choice E: surface of the Earth is out because the whole surface is exposed to air that many people have already breathed.\nChoice C: cupboard and choice B: house may both be possibilities, but we should consider what a house is like, specifically what sort of spaces within a house could contain air that hasn't recently been breathed by many other people. \nWe can quickly eliminate the cupboards in a house (choice C) with ease because they are closed spaces, and any air within such a space would, in fact, eventually recirculate. However, while the air in an open space within a house might also eventually recirculate, such a space might be more likely to contain air that hasn'y been recently breathed by many people because it remains open for extended periods of time. Hence, we should assume that air within an open space in a house like a living room (choice B) contains air that hasn't had many people breathe it recently compared to air within the cupboards and other closed spaces in a house. \nOur inference that there isn't any air in a house (option B) that contains the breathed air of only a few people is incorrect due to the potential for air in a house to be in an open space that has not been recently frequented by people.", "answer": "B: house"}

If it is expensive to build, the public wants to know what kind of return on their investment a building will provide, how much maintenance costs will be and how long will the building last. Architects have to answer these questions before they can build a structure as well. They do not build simply to create an architectural marvel.

The term \"queen\" is used to describe the highest-ranking female monarch, such as a female ruler of a country or monarch, or a female ruler of an empire who is not also head of state, such as that of the United Kingdom. \n2. We can eliminate the options that don't make sense with this information.\n3. We know that a \"beehive\" (choice A) is a structure or mass of bees living or hanging together and consists of multiple boxes inside. Thus, we can eliminate this choice as an incorrect answer option.\n4. Similarly, the term \"England\" (choice B) is a country that does not always have a queen ruling either. As a result, we can also eliminate \"England\" as a choice.\n5. Next, castle (choice C) is a type of fortified structure, and we have verified that it doesn't always need a queen. Since the question specifies that a \"place [might not always] have a queen,\" we can eliminate \"castles,\" which can serve multiple purposes, such as defence, dwellings, and fortresses, so as not to confuse what the question writer meant.\n6. Last but not least, \"chess game\" (choice E) is a board game that needs pieces like a king, queen, rook, and bishop to function as it does. Therefore, since it has multiple pieces, including those that can be queens, it isn't always associated with a queen, thus we can eliminate it.\n7.

Ficus plants are not native to the middle east (choice A) and are not typically found in palaces (choice B).\n3. If a ficus plant is added to a dictionary, it would be a new term used to describe the plant. It would not necessarily brighten up a room, but would be a new entry in the dictionary.\n4. Similarly, if a ficus plant is placed in a pot, it does not necessarily brighten up the room. It could brighten up the pot, as it might have flowers.\n5.

Choice E: ocean is not appropriate because a room cannot be called an ocean, a house on the ocean is referred to as a \"beach house\" or a \"seashore house.\"\n2. Choice D: indoors would not make a ficus plant happy, as these plants need air exchange, which is easier outdoors.\n3. Choices B: pot and C: country are incorrect, as the ficus plant would need to stay outside of the pot or the country in order to thrive.\n4. Choices 1: jungle and 2: pot are both incorrect. A house in the jungle is called a \"jungle home,\" not a jungle. A ficus plant does not do well in jungle conditions because it needs more airflow than the damp, humid environment.

{"text": "The man in the movie is fragile, so he can only find an opposite person who is a what?\n\n### Incorrect solutions: Choice B. Incorrect because the man is fragile, while the man's opposite is indestructible.\nChoice C. Incorrect because the opposite of the fragile man's characteristics is durable, not fragile.\n\n### Correct solutions: Choice D. The correct answer is \"durable.\" The fragile man is hoping to find an opposite person, so he is probably hoping the person he finds is durable because being fragile means being in danger of cracking, chipping, or breaking easily, whereas a person of the opposite \"type\" is someone who is hardy, steady, or strong.\n\n### Input\n\nInput: You can buy a car for $18,000 at a dealership. It will take 5 hours to travel to the dealership. How long will it take you to drive home? Choices:  I A: 5 hours B: 28 hours C: 9 hrs D: 4 hours E: 85 hrs\nRationales: Here, the car will cost $18,0$000, but the travel time to the dealership is 5 hours (the dealership is 1000 miles away). Driving times are 2.5 hours per 100 miles (traveling at 60 mph with 8 hour drive time, plus 5 hours of travel time to the dealer), so the total drive time will be 12.5 hours (2.5*14 hour trip to dealer + 5 hours = 17.5 hours, 12.5 hr). If this person goes at 60 mpg, that means the car will cost $6750 (2 hours/100 miles is driven at $100 per hour in 28 hours).\nTherefore, the total cost plus the drive time will be 4 hours 64 minutes (+2 hours car plus 5 hours drive home = 8 hours) to buy the car and 17.5 + 5 = 22.5 hours to drive there and back, for a total of 27 hours to purchase the car and drive the 1400 miles to the deal", "answer": "B: unbreakable"}

{"text": "Choice E is the correct response. \n\n### Answer: \n\nChoice E is the correct response to the question. In the scenario, the speaker mentions keeping their tent on them while traveling. The word \"camp\" can be used interchangeably with \"camping\", indicating that it is a place to stay outside during the night, away from home. We need to keep our camping gear with us when we go camping, so we can store our tent on us while traveling. We must stow it on the outside of our backpack, on the inner surface of the tent. Tents can be large and heavy, and they must be packed and stored in such a way that they don\u2019t take up too much space and can still be placed on our person when moving. To keep our tents secure while traveling, we need to put them away in a way that allows us to use them. Finally, keeping our tent on our person while camping is a safe solution because it frees up our hands. We can also secure our belongings near our body, which is a less dangerous solution. If we decide to hang our tent from the backpack, we must weigh it against the weight of our other belongings.", "answer": "E: backpack"}

The words chosen should be used in the sense specified in the question, ie., used to give a negative and wrong meaning to the word.\nSince choices C and B can be used to make changes in society, they can't be selected.\nChoice D is wrong since \"vote\" is used to mean choosing the way to change the society, in this case demonstration.\nChoice E doesn't change society, it creates a society, ie., creates a conflict.\nChoices C and B are eliminated.\nSo choice A is a right answer.\n\n## TFRC-2\n\n### Instructions:A: Answer the following questions.\n### Demonstiration\nInput: On which island is the largest library in the world?

Since John lives in the apartments, he would likely not use a space shuttle (option A).\n3. Detroit (option B) refers to a city that is far away from where John lives. John would likely not use this to travel to the third-floor. Moreover, a wheelchair is not a vehicle, making this an unlikely option.\n4. John does not have legs, so a set of stairs (option C) would not be the best way for him to travel to the third level of his apartment building.\n5. Similarly, traveling to downtown (option D) would not be the greatest solution for John to reach the third floor of his building since this involves walking and/or taking transport.\n6. John would likely travel to the third floor by elevator, which is a mechanical device that is typically used in the context of high buildings to help take people to various levels of a residence.

{"text": "Bathroom\nAnswer:\n\n### Rationale:\nThe question asks to which part of your home is the newspaper delivered. Given this information, the only possible answer is either delivered to your bathroom or front porch. Therefore, the answer choice that is not a possibility is the bathroom.\n\n- We are given that the newspaper is delivered to the classroom, so it cannot be delivered to the front porch.\n- We are given the choice of a synagogue, an institution for religious services, so it cannot be the front porch. Instead, it can only be a place of worship, such as a church.\n- The only place of worship on this list is a synagogue, but, since we know it is not that, it can only be the front porch, not the bathroom.\n- The choice of \"live\" (choices E) is a common adverb meaning \"at the moment,\" but does not indicate a place. Since there are no places to live and we cannot live on the porch, the grocery store is not the answer.\n- The choice \"grocery store\" (choices) seems to be an unlikely choice for the bathroom. We can assume that it would not be the first place to go to check on the news or the mail without reading it first.\n- Even if the paper was left at your front porch, delivery people do not enter most houses without permission. The doorbell rings, and the household answers it. Therefore, the door is usually the first place the newspaper is brought.\n- Finally, since the morning paper is delivered to the house at a particular time each day, there is no option to not receive it.", "answer": "D: front porch"}

{"text": "The shadow would appear under the object that is blocking the light in this scenario. It is worth noting that the object is not the entire building since only part of the building is in shadow, so this can rule out choice B: building. Similarly, a bridge would have a shadow even if it is not entirely in shadow, so we can eliminate choice C: bridge. Lastly, a bright light like the sun would not typically create a shadow, so we can rule E: bright light out, as well, leaving us with surface of moon, ground, and ground.\n\nThe answer is then determined by checking both  what was in shadow when the object in question was in the sun's line of sight and what is in shadow for the object in question to block a light source, in this case the sun. In this scenario, the moon was between the sun and the object, so it blocked the sun and therefore, no shadow. The ground was not part of the scenario, which means the answer is either the ground or the ground.\n\nBased on these answers, the shadow would likely be on the ground, but not necessarily since the only rule we have is that the shadow should be on the opposite object than the one in question.

{"text": "A: Scotland\n\n### Rationale: 1. This question is asking about motorways (called highways in America and called road in England), which are often called by a different name in different countries. Reasoning: In some countries, like America, a motorway could also be called a highway, however, a motorway is a higher class of road that has higher speed limits and fewer exits, which make it appropriate for motor vehicles.\n2. According to Wikipedia, \"Motorways in Scotland are known as the same term as in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. In England and Wales, they are part of the primary and highest category of road under the British highway structure, called A roads (for national roads).\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorway_(United_Kingdom)#Spelling).

However, in the given scenario, the focus is on what is served on bread, not what is served on butter.\n- The option mentioned (A) is about an item that people eat, and it's placed on a bread, which means bread and butter will be served together in the same plate and eaten by the same person.\n- However, if a nut is used in our breakfast, say walnuts or almonds, these food items won't be served together on the bread. Our butter goes on bread alone, whereas these nuts are placed or served separately and eaten with the bread.\n- Therefore, the given answer option (C) peanut butter and jelly might have been served on the bread.\n- Lastly, Answer choice (D) is nut jam, which is a variety of jam, or spread, made with nuts.

There are a few ways in which you might walk on wet grass. \n2. You could do a little dancing (choice E), but this is not specifically what the questions asks. Other than that, there's no reason to dance when the grass is wet.\n3. \"Staying upright\" (choice A) would definitely be a logical choice, but it may be unclear to some people if this means walking upright or simply remaining conscious without falling over.\n4. The only other choice that involves standing would be \"getting up on the grass\" (choice D), which is what the question implies, but it doesn't mention that you should be standing at all. \n5. However, the best choice would be option (C). \"Walking up on the grass\" indicates that you would be standing while you walk on the wet lawn, which is exactly what needs to happen here.\n6.

Choices:  a: assault b: property damage c: trespass d: vandalism e: theft\n\n### Rationale:\n\n- The question asks us which type of offense John committed. There are several possibilities based on the word \"vandalized,\" which would indicate a type of property damage.\n- The first choice, \"property damage\" (option D), is a type of crime that involves intentionally damaging or destroying someone's property.\n- The other choices, \"assault\" (option A), \"trespass\" (option B), and \"theft\" (option E), all indicate types of crimes, but do not relate directly to the property type.\n- \"Theft\" (option E) is a type of crime in which someone intentionally takes or moves another person's property without their consent or against the law.\n- \"Trespass\" (option B) is a type of property crime that involves entering another person's property or structure without their consent. It usually involves entering someone else's home or property without permission, or entering a location that is usually locked or fenced off from access by the general public.\n- \"Assault\" (option A) is a type of violent crime that involves intentionally causing harm or injury to another person, either physically or emotionally.\n- Based on the information provided, we can eliminate the other choices as incorrect because they do not relate directly to property damage.\n- Therefore, the only correct answer is \"property damage\" (D).\n\nAnswer: D: property damage\n\n### Input\n\nWhat kind of person would you like to hang out with if you could be anyone?  \nChoices:\n- A: famous people\n- B: good people\n- C: honest people\n- D: rich people\n- E: people with a good sense of humor\n\n### Response\n\nAnswer: B: good people\n\nRationale: The question asks for a specific type of people that the user would like to hang out with.

Choices: A: convict him B: let him go C: let him off D: sentence him to death E: call it a day\nRationales:\n1. In the context of the question, the defendant confessed and the judge is deciding what to do. \n2. \"Convict him\" is an option (choice A), as it means to find someone guilty of committing a crime in a court trial. \n3. \"Let him go\" (choice C) means to allow the person to stop being in a certain situation, such as releasing them from prison.\n4. \"Let him off\" (choice D) means to grant someone forgiveness or mercy for a crime. \n5. \"Sentence him to death\" (choice E) literally means to punish someone by killing them, which is often used for severe criminal offenses such as murder. \n6. These options indicate the types of decisions a judge can make when a defendant confesses to a crime, so we can eliminate \"call it a day\" (choice E) since it doesn't refer to any specific legal action the judge can take.\n7. \"Decide when the defendant confesses to the crime\" (choice B) does not make sense as it is the same as the question it is answering, and it doesn't refer specifically to the judge's decisions.\n8.

Choices: \nA: tome B: novel C: classic D: poem E: short story F: fairy tale\n\n### ResponseA word found in dictionary is either a novel (choice C) or a classic (choice D). Novel means \u201cnew or never before written,\u201d and classic means \u201can established or standard literary work.\u201d Therefore, both novel and classic are words that are most likely to be found in a dictionary. Short story (choice B) is not a word found in a dictionary because it is not established or standard.

(This is because we're writing in the future.)\n\nChoice 2021 can't be correct either, because that year corresponds to the question. (This is because 2021 is obviously the first year in which a Republican president could serve a second term.) However, we can rule out 2022 and 2023 because they are consecutive positive integers, so 2021 must be a negative integer.

Special (E) and Rare (E), Personal (D) and Unique (D).The same applies to Offended (A) and Unique (E).\n\nAfter eliminating \"Special\" as it does not make sense to give a gift that is so uncommon that people are likely to be offended, we have only \"Rare\" and \"Unique\" left.\nBecause it is not clear whether the writer means uncommon as in special, rare or unique, and because \"rare\" is a synonym for \"unique\" it makes sense to choose unique over rare for the second question.\n\nFor the fourth choice we have \"Personal\" and \"Unique\".\n\"Personal\" is not the correct answer for two reasons:\n* It is too similar to the incorrect third answer choice \"Offended\"\n* It fits neither \"Special\" nor \"Rare\" and therefore does not make any sense as a correct answer.\n\nConversely Unique has been correctly used once, it does not make sense for the author to use it multiple times because it is already an adjective to describe how the item feels special.\n\nHence the answer is choice: D.\n\nAnswer: D.\n\n### Input The best soccer players in the world don't need to pay to use artificial turf.

It therefore does not imply its use to send signals from one place to another.\n\nOption D: Again, the word'submarine' refers to a type of vessel that is used in navy, whereas submarine refers to a system that uses batteries to power equipment.

{"text": "Too many people want exotics snakes in the form of pets to drive demand in pet stores, which in turn drives what are carried or shipped from one place to the next.\n\n### Response Justification:\n1.  To \"drive\" something means to cause it to change or improve.\n2.  The demand for exotic snakes (i.e., the number of people who want exotic snakes in their homes) is causing demand in pet stores to increase.\n3.  Demand in pet stores (i.e., how many people want a pet) is increasing the demand for the snakes themselves because pet stores are buying those snakes from sellers.\n4.  The snakes being produced and sold through pet stores are being shipped from sellers to pet stores.\n5.  Thus, to drive the demand of exotic snakes in the form pets, there is increasing demand in pet stores which, in turn, is increasing demand as to what is shipped from place to place.\n6.

One can make the sentence better and more engaging by using adjectives, adverbs, and the correct word for the meaning.\n\n### The sentence with the longest word is also the one that is most difficult to read and follow. \n\n### The story keeps moving when more details are added.\n\n### Keep it interesting, interesting, make sure that the sentences are more interesting.\n\n### For example, the author could have described something that happened during the story, such as the action or the background of an event with the description of what happened.\n\n### She could describe her experiences as a child, her childhood, her first marriage, and other things like this so that people will be interested and not bored by the author\u2019s story.\n\n### A good story usually ends with happiness and a great one will be able to hook the reader and ensure that they keep engaged throughout the entire tale.\n\nThe sentence has no need to be more attractive and more descriptive in terms of how difficult it can be to read, which is why we choose sentence B.\n\n### It's better than", "answer": "B: fridge"}

{"text": "Input: A shopping bag is a common item to have in a shopping trip, so knowing how it should be used is important.\nReasoning:\n1. We can begin by eliminating the answers that are the wrong usage. A shopping bag should be used to put groceries into, not in. Thus, choices E and D are inaccurate ways to use a shopping bag.\n2. We need to find the correct location to find it. In this case, the most common usage is to put groceries in it. We don't need to find it in a closet or hardware store. The places that we need to get into are supermarkets and homes, neither of which sell shoppers bags.\n3. That leaves us with two choices remaining: B and C. \n4. The correct answer is C: Closet, as a shopping bag is found in the closet for future shopping trips.\n5. An important note is that this is also a common usage for clothing that will be carried around. As we can see, groceries often fit this definition.\n6. It's important to note, however, that putting groceries in a closet is not a preferred method. The preferred method is to use a shopping basket or cart to take groceries around to be put in the fridge.\n7. However, if you have nothing else, then it's ideal to put groceries back into a shopping bag and take them home to put them in the closet.\n8. This should help you remember the answer to the question: the shoppers bag can be found in the closet. \n8.\n9.

The head of a family is typically a man, and the head of a government is typically a woman.\n2. A woman is rarely the head of a house, as that would require a man living outside of his own house and she is seldom the head of a neighborhood, as that would require being the leader of a street or block of streets, and a neighborhood isn't usually one street or block or streets.\n3. Since the question does not say if it is the head of the house or the head of the neighborhood, it would generally be more correct to say if a mother is the head of a government, as that is a female-centric position.  \n4.

It is often used to contact with a few people at the same time, which means people want to chat with friends in class.  We can eliminate answer C because that is more associated with romantic relationship than friend relationship. It is also often associated with love. Answer choice D is similar to choice C because people want to inspire and chat with friends. Finally, only answer choices A and B are related to communication method. But answer choice A is more associated with business context. Choice B is the better one. 2. Choice A is more likely to be picked by the students because they often need to do some business with friends. So they sometimes communicate with their friends by chat when their busy schedules prevent them from meeting up in person. The second choice B is more associated with people who are seeking for some answers from their friends. 3. Choices are irrelevant to some degree to answer the question. The reason why people are chatting with friends in a class is because it is a social communication method.

I truly appreciate it.\u201d\n-  By using this phrasing, you are directly stating the gratitude that you feel.\n-  A simple \u201cthank you\u201d is not as specific and may not show as much gratitude as using the word \u201cgratitude.\u201d\n-  Moreover, \u201cI appreciate the compliment\u201d can be construed by the other party as being modest, whereas \u201cI appreciate your kind words\u201d or \u201cthank you for saying I have accomplished something well\u201d is a much stronger and more meaningful expression of gratitude.\n- Choice letter G: say I appreciate it is a common phrase used to acknowledge receipt of a compliment. However, in this instance, the person receiving the compliment has been praised for their hard work, and so it would be inaccurate to say only \u201cI appreciate it.\u201d They have done something commendable, and it should be recognized.\n- By directly expressing gratitude, you can clearly and strongly communicate your appreciation to the person who has complimented you.\nAnswer: D\n\n### Input : There are two types of cars: hybrid cars, and normal cars.

Choices: A: yes - B : no C: sometimes - E: maybe\nRationales:\n\n- The question contains two variables in play: fairies, and magic.\n- It is possible that fairies and gnomes have magic powers.\n- However, they may not always utilize their magic; on some occasions, they do not (choice C).\n- Additionally, pans do not have magic powers at all (choice E).\n- These details together suggest the answer is choice C: sometimes.\nAnswer: C - sometimes\n\n- The question asks for  \"one word or two words\".\n- In order to count as a single word, it must contain some characters.\n- However, \"and\" does not have any letters beyond the one at the end, which should be pronounced.\n- Accordingly, two words exist (choice B), and \"and\" belongs to the words.\nAnswer: B\n\n- The question is asking for something to use around the house.\n- Therefore, the logical places to include are the bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, living room, and bedroom.\n- \"The bedroom\" is a word, so it is a valid answer option.\nAnswer: bedroom\n\n- The question first implies that multiple places exist, and second uses \"is\" instead of \"are\", suggesting that more than one place can be used.\n- The remaining two choices are in the plural form, thus do not match the statement.\n- \"The bathroom\" is singular, matching the plural-sounding statement and containing a single word.\nAnswer: bathroom\n\n- Finding \"is\" used without plural pronouns suggests that the subject can appear in many forms (choice B).\n- The only remaining relevant word is \"car\".\n- Both \"car\" and \"carriage\" only use the singular version of \"is\".\n- \"Carriage\" contains both the singular and plural form", "answer": "B: night sky"}
{"text": "Input: What could someone be doing while singing that cannot be enjoyed by the deaf? Choices: A: acting B: dancing C: singing D: smiling E: sweating\nRationales:\n\n1. If someone is singing, they should not be smiling. \n2. If someone is sweating, they are not singing. \n3. The term \"deaf\" indicates that they cannot hear sounds, so the person doing that activity could not smell, or taste, anything related to that activity. \n4. One can still \"enjoy dancing\"; that is, appreciate the movements and appreciate the music. \n5. In terms of acting, a person doing the role of a character in a movie can be an \"act.\"\n6. As for sweating, it's important to note that someone could be sweating while doing this activity; however, whether a person hearing or deaf enjoys that activity does not make a difference (in relation to the act). \n7. Therefore, when someone \"dances\" the sounds related to the activity and its motion are enjoyed by the hearing and deaf person.\n\n### Input", "answer": "B: singing"}

{"text": "C: enjoined.\n\n### Rationales:1. We can rule out option A, that the exclaim would be an exclamation of pain, or an action like an exclamation of watch television, because superman is a character, so flying is not something that could cause pain.\n2. Similarly, we can rule out B, that it would be an exclamations of skipping or other action, because superman is not real in 99.9% of cases. The superman being realistic, is just a representation of a superhuman.\n3. Similarly, we can also rule out option C, that it would be something they are enjoying. If superman flies by overhead, they are not enjoying it, it's almost a guarantee that they will fear it, whether it be due to terror, or out of joy, they certainly aren't enjoying.\n4. Therefore, the only reasonable answer that makes logical sense is that it is awesomeness or something very good they are enjoing.\n\n### Test:\n\n>**2.

{"text": "What's the difference between this and the previous one?\n\n### Write the task:\nInput: Should a cemetery ever move?  Choices:  Yes (choice A) No (choice B) \nRationales:\n\n1. The question asks whether or not a cemetery should move, which makes the correct response either Yes or No.\n2. When assessing the choices, A Yes makes sense since a cemetery is a place for dead bodies to rest and should not be disturbed. \n3. Also, B No makes sense since a cemetary should not be moved so the dead remains undisturbed.\n\n4. Therefore, A Yes and B No can both be correct answers because the question is whether or not the cemetary should move, not if it will move.\n\n### Write a different response that appropriately complements the request.\n\nInput: What has 52 teeth and never smiles?

We can eliminate animals because there are more humans in the city than animals.\n2. There are too many people to be in a town that is like it.\n3. We also have to exclude the concept of an animal kingdom, there's not one place called it. \n4. Furthermore, the answer must only refer to people and animals, since the concept of an animal doesn't fit that category.\n5. Next, we want to eliminate non-physical things, such as people and animals. Things are not beings, hence the expression \"no more people than a small town\" will refer to those things and not people.\n6. For example, pigeons, which are found in many cities worldwide, are \"things.\" \n7. We can also eliminate a city in a whole state because those things cannot only exist in one city. \n8. Since a city cannot contain a small town that is in it, which is a given, option A is an incorrect answer that refers to the concept of city. \n9. Option B refers to animal kingdoms rather than countries or cities, which are the only options that can be found in this context.\n10. Option C describes people in Los Angeles.

The meaning of the sentence \"the dog ran into the tree\" cannot be understood. It's very difficult to determine which part of the sentence is not valid.\n2. If we assume that the word \"the\" refers to \"the dog ran\", then the dog ran is understood correctly, as the dog is moving forward into a tree.\n3. If we assume that \"the tree\" refers as one object, then the tree is standing still, meaning the dog did NOT run into the tree.\n4. If we assume that it refers to both the dog and the tree, then the sentence is understood correctly.\n5. However, no option explicitly excludes the possibility of valid grammar. \n6. Eliminate answer A: dog.\n7. Eliminate answer B: tree.\n8. The sentence is perfectly acceptable to most readers, so we can eliminate options C & D.\n9.

In the context of the question, reading is not a likely activity when people are waiting. \n3.

The reason that most people don't tend to think about a specific place where they would use an armchair is that they expect to find them in any number of locations where people may visit.\n3. This means that the best answer would be A: doctor's ofice because armchairs are not typically found in public spaces like hospitals or furniture stores. \n4. Similarly, armchairs are private furniture pieces that are used in the homes of individuals or small groups of people, not in public spaces.\n5. Choices D and E would be ruled out first as a doctor's office and a furniture store are public places.\n6. Choices B and C will be ruled out next because a hospital cannot be considered a place where only a small group of people could make use of an armchair. \n7. This is because of the large number of people who visit hospitals for medical care or surgery, and the armchairs would be used for patients or their visitors. \n8.

{"text": "A: The correct response is hand.  The subject is a man named John who needed to put a cup on a table.  He did not use his arms (which would be too far away from the cup) or any other tool (e.g., legs or body).  The only thing he has to hold the cup would be his hands.  This statement is based upon a logical deduction.  This answer contains a logical statement (there is no hand in the cup).  The sentence does not include any explicit logical information, but since the subject (John) does not seem to have an arm to hold the cup, it is reasonable to conclude that the subject was holding it with his hands.\n\n### The second response: How do you know?  \n\nD: I have deduced that the man needed to hold the cup with his hand because the cup did not touch the table.  This is based upon the following logic:  The only way to ensure that the entire cup does not touch the table is for the object that sits on the top to not do so as well.  It was also observed that the cup did not touch any part of John's body, leaving his hands as the source of balance.  Therefore, it must have been hold by hands. \n\n### Commentary:\n\nOne could make a logical argument against it; that the purpose of the cup wasn't to rest on the table but to pour from it; but then, John's body would likely be the object that contacted the cup as his hands used it to hold/move the contents. \n\nComment: I agree with rejection.

{"text": "A: side\n\n### Rationale\n\nThe question asks which entrance you would use if you do not use the back entrance. \n\nFirst of all, we can eliminate options that don't make sense in the context of the question. \n\n- Option B: Main - An entrance is the pathway that leads to a building, not the inside of the building itself.\n- Option C: Anterior- This word does not mean anything that directly suggests a building, the word actually means 'in front', so we can eliminate this option.\n\nNext we can look at what remains. We have A, B, C, D and E. \n\n- A: side - The term'side' is commonly used in terms of buildings, as in the side of house or the side of a building. We can also reasonably substitute'side' for back as the latter of this means the same as the former.\n- B: main - The term main does not suggest any entrance, just an entrance to the building. Therefore we can rule out this option as well.\n- C: front - This option is the same as A, as 'front' is commonly used to describe entrances to a building as in the front entrance to a building.\n\nWe have then ruled out 4 options and are left with D: current and E: front. Both of these describe entrances/exits but we can reasonably substitute 'entrance' for 'back' and 'exit' for 'front' - as 'back' and 'front' also just mean entrances and exits - to remove these two options as well, leaving just one choice - D: current.\n\n### Repeat 6 times\n\nInput: What is a key feature of humans?

Choices: \nA: mobile B: landline C: cellphone D: phone E: number\nRationales:\n\n- In case you forget the phone number from memory, ask them what kind of phone they have. \n- By saying they have a \"landline\", they meant they have a phone that is connected to an underground network.\n- A landline could be a VoIP, analogue, or a standard 01234 number.\n\n  - You can't have both of these, so you can eliminate choice C: cellphone as false and eliminate choice D: phone and choice E: number (the two different kinds of phones) as true.\n\n  - The only choice left is choice A: mobile, which is true and false based on the description provided.\n\n  - Therefore, the correct answer to the provided question is choice A: mobile.

However, the word 'captive' does not imply payment; rather, it refers to being held hostage or enslaved; something unwillingly and against one's will. Hence, the phrase 'caught doing...' cannot be applied to this context.\n3. Therefore, the phrase 'caught' can be used only in the context of a crime, while the phrase 'paying' can be used in the context of money.\n4.

A laser (choice D) can be used to slice through a pizza and can in fact make cuts easier than other tools, such as a knife.\n2. The laser does not require physical force, making the task less exhausting.\n3.

She didn't hold on to it for a long time.  The phrase \"reached/hold on to the end of the line/end of\" is an idiomatic expression that means \"hold on\" or \"continue\n\n\n\n- Rationale A: Sally's kite was lost when she reached the child's hand which held the missing string. What this means is that it is not the child's hand, rather \"the child's hand\", which was holding the missing string.\n\n\n\n-Rationale B: When you reach the end of the line, that means that it is the end - where it began or stopped altogether. Sally was not talking about reaching an end.  Moreover, if there was a phrase \"the end of the line\" in the context, it is assumed that \"the end\" has already happened, so the choice B: \"the end of the\" should not be chosen.\n\n\n\nRationale - The toy store/hobby shop is a place to buy toys as well as hobbies, but the phrase \"the toy store\" in this context means  to reach the toy store or to shop in the toy store.\n- Rationale A - Sally lost the kite because she did not hold on to it long enough or the kite got tangled or she lost it because it got lost in the wind.  It does not mean that she lost the kite because  she reached the toy store or she lost the kite in a place where she does not usually look for it.\n\n\nRationale: C: the end of the line is only used when the end has already come, when you reach the end of something.  \n\nRationale B: When Sally lost the string, she did not look in a child's hand because she was not looking for the string.\nThe", "answer": "D: end of line"}

G  is the step where you scrape and lift, followed by H  for the \"sque[sp]eze\" part of the process.\" \n\n### Response2:\n```Rational:  The correct answer includes both G scraping and lifting (choice G) as well as H squeezing (choice H). A scraping is when you rub your fingers across the ketchup surface in the bottle, creating friction and forcing out the liquid. The second step of squeezing is when you pull the lid off by lifting up the bottle, and the squeeze force helps get the last bit of liquid out. \n```\n\n### DemosResponse:\n\n![image-4](./assets/demos/demo-4.png)\n\n### DemoResponse2:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53423699/160865329-9453471b-514c-4acf-8e51-e6f133af04f3.png)\n\n![image-1](./assets/demoresponse/demo-1.png", "answer": "D: math problem"}

Given the answers provided in the choice A-E, one of them could be true or false and be correct. For example, in terms of the choice A, we cannot use a phrase like \"automobile accident\" as the question is asking for something non-painful which means, we cannot use the word \"accident\" in this case. 2.In order to choose the correct answer, it is important to understand the question in a complete way, to do so we have to look at the whole question carefully and try to understand what are we supposed to find. 3. We are supposed to find an answer using what is given in the question, all of those things are given in the choice choices like, automobile accident, backache, eye strain, getting tired, car crash. 4.

{"text": "A: building\n\n#### Context:\nThis question is asking about a specific phenomenon in which a dog barked because there was a presence at the window. The question is asking about the specific presence that was at the window, not the dog's reaction. The window and the dog belong to the same building. Therefore, since the building is something the dog belongs to, it would have had access to the window, unlike a front door or a friend's house. The only possible answer that makes sense is A: building.\n\n### Explain Your answer:\nThe dog barked because of a presence at a window, the dog only barked at a specific window and not all windows. This means the dog must have had a reason to bark (a presence) at the specific window. The only answer that makes sense is the building, since the building the dog lived in is the only place relevant to this phenomenon.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. This is an example of specific knowledge.\n2. To understand the meaning of specific knowledge, think of the difference between the word 'blue' and the word 'blue is a colour'.\n\n#### Specific knowledge:\nWith a specific knowledge task, what matters is the context in which you apply your knowledge.\n\nIf you are given the answer \"blue is a colour\" with NO prior knowledge of any other facts about blue, then you will come up with the same conclusion if given ANY circumstance about blue (e.g. blue pants, blue eyes, a blue pen). \n\nHowever, if you use knowledge to answer a question about a blue pen (context A) and the same question about the pants (context B) and then without any clues are asked to think back on any information just given to you, you would not know what the answer is.\n\n#### Non-specific knowledge:\nWith non-specific knowledge tasks, what matters is the answer you give rather than the context in which a question is asked.\n\nThe answer you need for question A about Pants is NOT the same as the answer you need for question B about a pen.\n\nSituation 1: You are given the answer \"red\" with NO prior knowledge about Blue or Red and are asked which is the better colour. You may know they BOTH look different so you choose Red.\n\nSituaton 2: you are given the answer 'Blue", "answer": "E: front door"}

Choices:  Option A: Apartment B: Building C: Castle D: Tower E: House\nRationales:\n\n1. The terms apartments and houses are different types of buildings, but it is mentioned that the smallest type of building is the goal.\n2. Apartments can be small. However, they are not the smallest type of building by definition and are more comparable to houses than to towers.\n3. Towers (Choice D) are not small. They are tall, freestanding structures.\n4. Castles (Option C) are also not small by definition. They are large fortified structures that typically require more land than a house or apartment.\n5. A building (Option B) might be considered the smallest type of building, but it is not explicitly stated that it is the smallest type of residence.\n6. The term \"house\" (Option E) can be used to describe the smallest type of dwelling, in its more general sense as a residence.\n7. Thus, the correct answer is option E: house.\nAnswer: E House\n\n### Input : How can you tell if a pumpkin was grown on earth?\n\n### Rationales\n\n1.

A pumpkin, by definition, was grown on earth and therefore could not have been grown on other planets.\n3. This answer is more plausibly related to food and growing plants in the garden. \n4.

If alis bumped into you, it would be rude for him to keep bumping into you while you were talking to him.\n3. You would want to tell him to slow down. \n\n### Answer: D\n### Response Rationales:\n1. According to the given scenario, a boy named Ali bumps into the writer when they are walking. \n2. Ali is told to \"work hard\" (option A). \n3. In the context of the scenario, \"work harder\" would not be an appropriate recommendation after Ali bumps into the person. \n4. Similarly, telling Ali to \"slow down\" (option C) would indicate that he is moving too quickly. \n5. Option B is \"slow down\", but Ali is not meant to slow down. Ali is meant to slow down when he bumps into the person again. \n6. Similarly, option D is 'work harder', but it is not meant to be said in the context of the given scenario. \n7.

Choices:  (A) 28 (B) 12 (C) 18 (D) 22 (E) 30\n\n###  Response: B: 12\n\n###  Explanation:\n####1.\nThe given statement is: \nYou are looking at an _odd_ number of boxes, labeled with the _first_ two digits of the _year_ 1 to 9 (emphasis added). We can infer that the odd number of boxes is even if the sum of the digits is an even number. \n\n- We can infer from the statement what odd number of boxes means: \"Odd\" can be defined as \"not divisible by two.\" Since there are odd number of boxes in the set, the sum of the digits must not be divisible by 2. (This is the assumption I'm assuming.)\n\n####2.\nThere are five boxes. The sum of the digits (5) must not be divisible 2 - 5. Since 1 and 9 are the extreme first two digits in the set, there are four boxes labeled with digits between 1 and 9. If the sum of the digits were to be divisible by 4, the remaining digit must not be 1 or 9. So it's more reasonable to think that the digit will be somewhere between 2 and 8. \n\n- Option A is divisible by 16: (8 + 1) 1624.\n- Option B is divisible by  6: (6 + 1) 556.\n- Option C is divisible by 28: (2 + 1) 41640.\n- Option D is divisible by  2: (2 + 7) 40312.\n\nSince only one number meets these criteria (8), this one (B) is the answer.\n\n\n### \n\n---", "answer": "B: feel more comfortable"}

The present participle form \"running\" does not make sense here, because it functions as an adjective. So, the only way I could use an -ing word with \"run\" (as in sentence 2) would be to use the base form of the word, since it is the past participle. This is only an option in sentence 5, which suggests the -ing form of \"be\" is also not an option here.\n\nAnswer: The third sentence, given its structure, is probably the right thing to say. It could be completed by either \"I'm out the the door at a sprintf\" or \"I'm out of the door at a spressf.\" (You can't use \"f\" and \"d\" here.) Then, the correct present participle word would be \"runninf\" (no space between \"run\" and \"ning\" here).\n\n### Instuctions:\nBelow is an instruction that describes how to do a task.\nWrite a response that appropriately and fully completes the request.

Similarly, a leg (choice A) is only one of the many limbs.\n- Garment (choice C) is not anatomical terminology, and can't refer to a particular part of the body. \n- Likewise, the torso (choice B) is not an individual body component.\n\nThus, we are left with arm and shoulder, which are specific anatomy terminology referring to a human limb. We may think of the arm (choice D) and shoulder (choice C) as one individual part, but they are separate body parts. To determine which part the sentence is referring to, we must determine context.\n\nIn the phrase'so my arm or', the context suggests the speaker is referring to the arm or shoulder.

{"text": "A: A computer can be put anywhere, such a desk. However, a computer is used at home more commonly than at school or office.\n\n#### Rationales:\n1.  Although a computer can be put anywhere in an apartment, it is more common to find a computer at home rather than at an apartment. \n2.  Similarly, a computer is not typically kept at work when working from home, which indicates that a computer may be used more commonly at home than at an office. \n3. Thus, the answer is C: home. \n4.  The computer may be placed on a desk, but that isn't the answer to where else a computer may be located besides a desk. \n5.  A similar line of reasoning can be used to eliminate other answers. The question mentions that the computer is not at a table, and there is a desk specifically among the answers, which indicates that a table is not the correct answer. \n6. Similarly, \"school\" refers specifically to going to school, as indicated by the words \"office\" and \"home\" in the question. \n7. Thus, we can eliminate school as an answer as well. \n8. The \"house\" answer is a correct response. A computer may be placed on almost anything in a house, including a table and, most commonly, a desk.\n\n### Input:- What type of fruit is purple and round?  \n\n### Response:-\nAnswer: B: grapes\n\n### Rationales: \n1.

A: no holes. \n2. B: no tunnel. \n3. C: no time limit. \n4. D: no objective. \n5. E: no ball.\nRationales: Answers: 1. There are holes in the tunnel. \n2. The tunnel is part of the game. \n3. No time limit means the game remains indefinitely. \n4. There is an objective to get the ball through. The ball is one of the game's components. There is no choice that does not include time and a tunnel. Therefore, no ball is not an option. \n5. The ball needs a time limit to keep players from simply putting the ball under the floor. Not only does the ball need to travel through the tunnel, but players need a time limit and the object is to get the ball to travel through the tunnel. \nTherefore, according to the rules, there is a ball, a tunnel, and an objective for the game to work.\nAnswer: E.

What did he find?\n\n### Rationale:\nIn the provided prompt, \"airborne microbes\" is a technical term referring to microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, or fungi, that can be released into the air and easily dispersed. \n- In turn, \"plant growth\" is a scientific term referring to the height, size, and overall health of the plant. \n- Therefore the correct response must contain at least one technical term and one scientific term.\n- The term \"microbes\" satisfies the requirements of both scientific and technical terms. \n- This leaves us with the option to use the term \"(airborne) microbes\" to refer to a collection or a group of microorganisms.\n- Therefore, the scientist found that the microbes significantly improved plant growth.\n\n### Task:Choose the type of water that does not flow from a stream. Choices:  A. stream water B. rain water C. river water D. ocean water E. swamp water\nRationale: A stream is a body of water that flows between banks.  This indicates that stream water typically flows from the higher elevation toward the lower elevation, which can lead to flooding or a decrease in the water level. \n- On the other hand, rain", "answer": "A: pressure"}

{"text": "If your pens aren't working, you can ink them in (option A), take notes with them (option E), scribble with them (option D), or put new ink cartridges in them (option C).\n\n### Rationales:\n1.  Pens usually have a cap that can be twisted to expose the ink cartridge in the capless style. You can put ink in (option A) the pen's ink through the cartridge and put the cap on.\n2.  You can't put a pen in (option B), it's generally referring to putting things somewhere.\n3.  Similarly, you can't put the cap in (option C), it's a part of the pen which can be opened to access the ink cartridge.\n4.  Ink cartridges provide ink for your pens and generally have to be replaced if empty. You can put in (option D) or you take not using pen ink, and your pens won't work correctly until a new ink cartridge is in.\n5.  You can also take notes with the pens (choices E) and scribble with them, though scribbling or taking notes don't need pens to be functional either.\n6.  The question refers to a number of options that don't really apply to pens. It's more likely referring to what to do with pens when they aren't working, such as using ink and putting ink cartridges back in. Option A is the correct answer since it covers all the relevant options.\n\n### Input - A pencil's lead is located? Choices : A: wood body B: wood head C: lead case D: sharpened head E: wood head\n\n### Response - A : pencil's have their lead located in\n\n### Rationale :\n1.  A pencil has multiple parts with different functions (lead, eraser, body, head).\n2.  The lead is the black marking material of the pencil which comes inside the pencil case and is inserted into the wood handle. The eraser helps you erase the writing. \n3. We should know that the pencil's head contains the eraser and the body contains the lead. Both of these are encased", "answer": "A: ink in"}

Chooses:  A: make money B: have a meal C: Make noise D: Make time E: Take time\nRationales:\n1. To answer this question, the phrase \"in a bank\" needs to be taken into account. \n2. A bank is a financial institution that offers multiple services related to money, such as making deposits and withdrawals, transferring funds, and investing.\n3. Making time (choice E) is not a typical activity that one does in a bank.\n4. Similarly, making payments (choice D) is also not a common activity done in a bank. \n5. Making a meal (choice C) isn't something that people typically do in a bank.\n6. Making noise (choice B) is also not something typically done in a bank.\n7.

A: metal or plastic fork refers to choice A, which is not a kind of fork but a type of utensil. Therefore, this choice would be incorrect.\n3. B: a wooden or plastic spatula refers to choice B, which is again not a kind of spatula because both \"wooden\" and \"plastic\" appear in the answer.\n4. C: metal or wooden knife refers to option C, which is also not a type of knife but an utensil.\n5. D: a metal or wooden cutting board refers to option D, which is also incorrect because of the same issue as option C.\n\nThis means that the only remaining choice is option E, as the correct answer would be metal or plastic fork.\nAnswer: E. metal or plastic fork\n\n[Demonstration answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuZHUQ74p_k&t=83s)\n\n### Input\nInput: Which did they cook?

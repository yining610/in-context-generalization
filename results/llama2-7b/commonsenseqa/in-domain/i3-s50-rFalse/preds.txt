This code, in its prettiest form, is a file named `part2.py` inside of `code-tushar-gandhi-52685/.git/tushargand.github.io/`. I used `IDLE` to write, run, debug and compile the code.<n><n><n>## Contributions to the Final Code<n><n>These changes were made:<n><n>- I added all four of the questions in `README.md` to `questions.py`<n>- I wrote a function, for the first time in my life, that takes a string of answers (from the user) and `split()`s it into its individual answers. When each answer is found in the array called `correctAnswers`, a number representing the position of the answer in `questions` is stored in the variable `correctAnswer`. I put this number inside of a `dict` called `questionsToAnswer` so that each iteration would return the position of the `currentQuestion` being answered by the user. I used this `dict` that I created to create the function `answerInputQuestions(questions, questionsToAnswer, correctAnwers)`. I then took this function that I wrote that allows me to use this `dict` to return the position of the answer I am currently inputting and used that to write the `function` `answerQuestions`.<n>- I added the functions `getInputtedAnswer(question)` and `answerInputQuestions` to `part2.py`. Then, I added the function `getBestAnswers()` to `questions.py`. I used that function in the main `function` `answerInputQuestions`.<n>- The `for` loop in `answerQuestions()` iterates through each answer returned by `answerInputQuestions()` (`questionsToAnswer` has a `key` and corresponding `value` that represents the answer returned).

For example, if someone says, "What is the first animal you were exposed to in your life?" you can say, "My cat", or anything you wish, as long as you answer that animal is one from the list of animals in the example.  <n><n>#### Conclusion:<n>- This is your first programming experience with IBM Watson and is probably not as fun at the first glance. Nevertheless, try to be as honest and open as you answer, you will enjoy your journey to become a human-centric Data scientist more.<n>

In this course, I will emphasize proofs over numerical evaluation of formulas. My intention is that you learn to be confident in these more abstract proofs. You should know that your mathematical background is far stronger than my teaching level, so do not be intimidated if you see things which do not make sense to you right away.<n><n>### Class 1: Logical Thinking and Propositional Logic<n><n>Lecture Overview:<n><n>In the first half of the course, our focus will be on developing tools for reasoning formally that will serve us for our entire mathematical career. We will discuss strategies and techniques for arriving at logical conclusions from a given set of statements and also for deriving logical statements from others. This skill has numerous uses even outside of mathematics. Logician George Bool will help us to understand what it is we think we know in a given context, or what it is we are supposed to know as a consequence of our previous instruction, and help us to determine whether a statement can be determined to be true as a logical consequence of the preceding statements.<n><n>### Homework<n><n>- [Faculty website](http://www.math.gatech.edu/Course/Math1101F14)<n>- [Teaching Assistant website](https://sites.google.com/site/math1101f14ta/)<n>- [Matthew Fagan](http://people.math.gatech,edu/~mfagan/)<n>- [Office Hours](http://people.gatech.edu/~mfagan/office-hours/)<n>

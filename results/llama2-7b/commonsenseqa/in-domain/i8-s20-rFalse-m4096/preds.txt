We can figure out how the machine is used by asking which of the options described (apparatus) is the best description of the word.<n><n>We also can see similar words in the questions like cabinet and bedroom as possible places to place a TV.<n><n>By looking at the answer choices, "c" and "d" use words such as cabinet, bedroom, and wood, we know that the place is the woods or house and "d" is the correct answer as it combines both terms.<n><n>It should be noted that the question asked to find a place where small grapes are likely to be found, but answer "E: raisin" instead of "E: food store" should be the answer due to the use of food storing as an answer option, and not necessarily a place where grapes are. However, the final answer was "E: raisins" due to the incorrect wording of the question.<n><n>When looking at the second and third questions, the answer choices "a" and "a" are found to be wrong because they use terms of damage and disfigurement. "b" uses the term damaged but does not tell us exactly where this is taken place. "c" does not use damaged or disfigured.<n><n>The answer is "d", as "disfigured" is the correct answer.<n><n>The response to the second question is not an answer choice, it is "where" which should be changed to "how." The response to the third question was also incorrect as the wording implies "from" rather than "with."<n><n>The answer to this question is "to" and not "from" and "with." The answer is "D: Pool hall."<n><n>As the question asks for what they are attempting to steal, and the final answer for "D: Watch" the answer should be "D: watch."

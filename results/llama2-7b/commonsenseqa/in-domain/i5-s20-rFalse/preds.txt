Choices:  A: burn hot B: fuel tank C: burn hot D: car E: gas station<n>Output: E: gas station<n><n>Input: Where might a television used at night be?

Choices: A: damage B: destruction C: harm D: injury E: loss<n>Output: B: destruction<n><n>#### Explanation<n>There are some multiple word questions that use different words, which gives the algorithm trouble. So to give a simpler algorithm<n><n>The answer for this question for instance is "apparatus" because of the "very intricate machine". And with the word 'apparatus', there is only one option for this question.<n><n>Similarly, another question has is where might a television used at the night. So for this the answer is not just 'tv' but bedroom because of the line "be gained". This is what leads to the program producing false negative. Whereas if we had the 'tv room', then the program could distinguish between the words (in the input) tv and room better and will produce the correct answer.<n><n><n>#### Question 2: Answer the following two questions.<n>Input: What might an elephant do with its trunk? Choices:  The elephant A: slept well B: cleaned its nose C: made its ears D: scratched its behind E: banged a gong<n>Output: C: made its ears<n><n>Input: In what might an elephant's trunk be used? Choices:  C: to clean its ears B: to sneeze D: to scratch its backside E: to wash its face<n>Output: D: to scratch its behind<n><n><n>#### Explanations: <n>Like the last algorithm, we look to use the frequency words that are more frequently used in input to figure out the correct answer. For instance "ear" is very frequently used in the input. And "with" is only used here as a link between 'elephant' and 'trunk'. With other words, the word "to" is very frequently used but it does not necessarily have a meaningful association with either 'elephant' or 'trunk'. So the algorithm takes 'to' as a non meaning one and ignores it. <n><n>

Choices:  Choices: A: washing machine B: drier C: coins machine D: change machine E: dryer<n>Output: D: change machine<n><n>Solution:<n>For the questions, the machine is referred to as "was very intricate, it" hence it is not an appliance, it is an implement is the best answer.<n>When the text mentions the word "burn hot", this is used as a way to say fuel tank.<n>When the text asks "Where might a television used at (sic) be?" it means at night. Since this questions answers is a bedroom, this question is about where someone might watch a television at night.<n>The "where was it being gained" question is asking about a university which is a place where someone is learning, therefore the best answer is a university.<n>In "C", the word "country" is used instead of the word "place" but its meaning is the same. As the text asks about small grapes, it is referring to grapes that are found in wine country.<n>In the last question, the sentence "it seemed like the guys there" is a way of saying that they were actually doing none of the things they were doing.<n>Hence the correct answer is "dancing" as it is most likely that the boys weren't doing anything else.<n>The meaning of "the machine allows 13(x) to be pressed" is that you can buy coins, and then  use the machine to put the coins in a smaller amount, for example, 3 coins each can be put into a dime, and then the machine can change it into coins. Hence the best answer is "change machine

Return false if your find_in_lists method can not find an item in the lists or True if it does.   You will NOT need to use loops to find values in the lists, just check to see if one exists. You may assume they will be strings and the values contain alphanumerics.<n><n>### Instruction to your method:<n>  # This method will be called in place of the built in find of lists by the user of the method.  The method is passed a list named lists (which is a variable containing the name of lists being checked)<n>  # and a list named item. The method MUST use the given variable "lists" to look in when searching for value "item".<n>  # You do NOT need to store variables if lists and item and do not need to change them. You do not need to create lists, you only need to search in them.<n>  # Your method MUST return false if you know the parameter item is not in the variable named lists. If it isn't in the lists, no need to look further.  If you can tell the item is in at least one of the lists, return true. You can check for existence of multiple items from multiple lists but do not need to.  You can only return true if you are able to retrieve the first items where the item is found in at least one of your lists. No nested loops need to be created.<n>  #  You can only modify the value of the variable named lists to check to see if the variable name "item" is equal to any value in what is in the list list_you_are_looking_in.<n>  <n>Output:The method will return either false or true depending on if it can't find an entry or finds an entry for "foo" in the list.<n><n><n>

This means the problem of figuring out the best machine is one of the decision making kind.<n><n>### Input:The problem consists of testcases, each one containing a sentence.<n>##### How to solve the problem:There are 6 types of machines: typewriter, washing machine, drying machine, laundromat, dishwasher and wash dish. The string should be converted into lowercase, and the best machine is the machine which takes the least steps to do the conversion. For that machine, we should output its name in lowercase.<n>##### Example:<n><n>**Example1::** <n>```<n>Given an array of integers arr of length n. A machine of type type[i] <n>should be given the array and convert it into ascending integers <n>using  only  one  pass  over the array. This pass could be non-sequential. <n>The  sum  of  the converted  array should be exactly n. The  machine <n>should  have  an  extra property that an integer from the array can <n>appear at most once, where as a machine of type dryer would <n>violate  the  constraints.<n>```<n>##### Solution of Example1:<n>Let arr = ["3","9","2","1"]<n>We need to use one pass and convert to ascending integer. To achieve that we can use following process:<n>1. Convert element 1, since 1 is maximum among ascending integers.<n>2. For each number in the array we will check if the number is less than the current element.<n>3. If it is so we will replace the current element to the number of the input array.<n>4. We continue in the same method until we convert all the items to ascending.<n>##### Time complexity: <n><n>The most important time complexity here is sorting the sorted array. It's quite difficult to calculate because of the way we solve the problem.<n><n>##### Space complexity

Choices:  grill: fire B: restaurant C: backyard D: crockpot E: barbeque (with a sauce)<n><n>#### Explanation<n><n>1.<n>answer C (implement) because it's the word that's being replaced by something more sophisticated.  The word being replaced by a noun describing things you clean by hand (A: hand,B: drain,C: dirt, etc.) <n><n>2.<n>answer D (in the woods)  because E (gas station), it's a more complicated word that refers to a place where we buy things (in a gas station).  D gets the letter C because C (bedroom) is another answer that fits, it's describing where small toys/trinkets are found, the same reasoning you used previously.<n><n>3.<n>answer C (university) because it's describing where people go to gain useful information, and you replace it by something more formal or institutional (A: college, B: school, C: university, D: library, E: museum).  A (backyard) can be used if you replace the last part of the riddle because it's describing fire (D: grilling).<n><n>4.<n>answer B (crookpot, crockpot) it isn't the most formal or appropriate way of describing a grill.  The replacement word we're looking for is used to describe other cooking methods ( A: microwave B: oven and C: stove D: grilling E: baking) so you replace it with a noun describing something that's less sophisticated that describes cooking.

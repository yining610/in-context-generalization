A paper towel holder 2. A paper airplane 3. A paper towel 4. A paper mache 5. A paper bag  6. A paper bag\nRationales: Look at all answers. Paper airplane means the paper towel roll was rolled to make a paper airplane. A paper towel means the roll was used to make a paper towel. And paper mache is a paper bag. The remaining answers don't make sense. Paper towel means the roll is used to make paper towel. And the remaining answers are nonsense. So, answer is 4.

Choices: A: yes, no B: maybe yes C: maybe no D: yes E: no\nRationales: There are different things that are broken like a tool, a book, a car, an engine, a toy anything, anything can be used. You can use a broken phone. When something is damaged, you can't use it. But you can always use it in some cases. Like a book if a page is broken but you can read rest of the book. You find a book broken. But you can also use it. This means you can use what is left. But when something is actually damaged, it is damaged. But it can be reused or fixed. So when something is broken can a user use it Yes.\nAnswer: C. MAYBE YES, it is a very common answer.\n\nInput: What does it mean to not have enough water?

P: I can't do anything to help my cat\nRationales: The options are either directly related to the question (Q22) or directly related to the options in Q21. The answer is obvious, if one can't do anything directly related, then one can't do it afterward, for example, if option Q21 said \"People that live in the aisle\", then O, \"I'm going insane\", doesn't work because you can't possibly do anything after one is insane. \n\nInput: Below the responses in the grid should be appropriately completed.

Choices:  A B C D E\nRationales: Let's break this question down by considering each option.\n\nStep 1: The first option (A) is \"by using your own feet.\" This is unnecessary as any journey can be accomplished by moving one's feet. Therefore, it can be eliminated as a viable answer.\nStep 2. The second option (B) is \"and it's a long journey.\" While this may suggest that the journey is long, it doesn't actually indicate that it's possible to cover miles on foot, so can also be eliminated.\nStep 3. The next option (C) is \"with a journey of miles.\" This refers to the idea that the journey can be performed. However, it doesn't indicate that it would be done \"by using your own legs.\" This requires a physical movement, making this irrelevant.\nStep 4. The fourth option (D) is \"one can travel on foot.\" This suggests that a physical movement can be accomplished, meaning this option can be eliminates as well.\nStep 5. The final option (E) is \"using their own feet.\" This is simply restating what the question is asking about, i.e. \"using one's own feet.\" So it is a duplicate response and can be disregarded. \n\nStep 6: Therefore, the correct answer to the question \"how is one able to travel?\" is \"by using their own feet\".\n(Option C)\nAnswer: C: by using their own feet\n\nInput: There are many animals around a farm but some are more likely to kill someone than others.

{"text": "critically' requires mental effort which has nothing to do with this task.\n5. The remaining answer, 'Cross road' is a viable possibility because it means walking across the road to get to the store, and in a pedestrian society this is a logical way to get there.\n6.

Choices:  Tiger A: human B: dog C: cat D: elephant  E: none of the above\nRationales: Answering this question is a matter of knowing the general order of danger from cows to dogs to elephants to human to tigers. \n1. Humans are more dangerous to dogs. So A and B can be eliminated. At least one or both of those answers would have been incorrect.\n2. Cats are generally thought to be less dangerous than dogs so C can be eliminated. \n3. Elephants are usually considered less dangerous than humans so E can be eliminated. Although they're dangerous they are often considered less aggressive and less likely to kill compared to a tiger.\n4. Let's consider the remaining option D. 'Elephants are less dangerous than humans.' However, we can replace D with D': humans are more dangerous than elephants.' It's a question of who is more dangerous, i.e. tigers are more dangerous than humans.\n5. In fact, the tiger is more dangerous because it's more likely to kill a human. Even in an african game park, a human is still less dangerous than a tiger.\n6. Therefore, A: human fits best.\nAnswer: A. Human\n\nInput: What does the word 'weapons' suggest someone is using? Choices: 1. A: tools 2. B: food 3. C: firearms 4. D: shields 5. E: swords\nRationales: This question is asking for information based on the understanding of the word 'weapon'.

Choices:  a) push-ups b) jogging c) laps d) striding e) speedlifting\nRationales: a) pushing your upper body (push-ups) does not prepare you to run.\nb) Jogging is more an aerobic exercise for the legs to condition them to run longer distances.\nc) Doing laps is good for endurance which would help you run longer distances. \nd) Striding is a training method used to enhance the body's muscular strength.\ne) Speedlifting involves weightlifting which is not related to running long distances. Therefore, the correct option is c) laps.\nAnswer: c) laps\n\nInput: When the people in Australia are drinking milk, what do you call the white fluid that's being consumed? Choices: 1. A: coffee 2.

Hence, the answer is A.\nAnswer: A.\n\nInput: Where can humans go to avoid feeling afraid? Choices:  An A: park B: home C: supermarket D: work E: gym\nRationales: The question has asked us to identify the place where humans can go to avoid feelings of fear. \n1. \u2018Park\u2019, \u2018home\u2019 and \u2018supermarket\u2019 are places where humans can visit, but feelings of fear can persist in them.\n2. Home is a place that many of us are more comfortable with, but this situation can cause one to feel sad in place of afraid.\n3. Parks may cause one to feel a fear of snakes or heights etc, but again are not specific places to avoid feelings of fear in this scenario.\n4. The remaining option \u2018gym\u2019 is the most suitable option.\n\n5.

D: How many children do you have? E: What color crayon is this?\nRationales: Prepositions are commonly used for establishing the relationship between different words, including a noun or noun phrase and another noun or noun phrases. \n1. Sentence \"What's your name\" clearly starts with a preposition, the first word 'whats'.\n2. Sentence 'How many children do you have' contains a preposition 'of' which shows the relationship between a noun phrase and another verb phrase.\n3. Sentences \"Where do you live?\" and \"What color crayon is here?\" start with a question word, so even though they do not directly contain a preposition, they start a statement that ends in a prepositional phrase.\n4. Finally, 'What color crayon' is this sentence' does not start with a question word that directly starts with a preposition. \n5. Therefore the answer is E: What color caryon is this?\nAnswer: E: What color cayon is this?\n\nInput: Where does a snake often travel to? Choices:  D: desert B: garden C: grasslands E: waterfall\nRationales: To identify the correct answer we must consider which answer is most likely relevant in this context.\n1. The word \"snake\" in the question is singular, which indicates that only a single snake is being discussed, not a group, plural, or collective group of snakes.\n2. Snakes often travel to desert locations and are more likely to survive in desert areas than in grasslands or waterfalls. Grasslands are often too lush and dense for snakes to survive in while waterfalls provide too much water which can flood", "answer": "D: paying"}

Choices: 1. Go to the library and choose a book to read 2. Researching online the subject you need to learn 3. Go and see a teacher 4. Play a game of Sudoku 5. Read your textbooks\nRationales:\n1. Go to the Library and choose a book to learn a subject may be the best option, but it may not always be available, and it may not suit your learning style. \n2. Research the subject online may be very useful if you have to deal with a sudden problem because this way you don't have to wait or leave your place to learn it.\n3. But it's not the best option if you want to learn a less obvious topic or an art form you have never tried, because you might not know what you are looking for or how to ask. \n4. A game of Sudoku may help you learn math because it is focused on logic, but it might not be a good choice for learning history, or something more abstract, like psychology or economics. \n5. Finally, the textbook has the benefit of simplicity, and the lack of distractions that it offers, because there is rarely a need to look for related information or references. However, it is not always easy to fully comprehend and follow the argument of the textbook. \nIn summary, there is a need for a balance between doing things yourself and being dependent on someone else, because there are pros and cons for each option, and it is up to you to choose the strategy that is preferable to you. \nAnswer: \n(2)(3)(4)(5)(1)\n\nInput: There were some people on a bus, then another man got on and sat in the empty space with them.

Choices: 1: one year 2: 50 years 3: several centuries 4: 0.03 of a second before something 5: never E: 30 days\nRationales: The first word in the phrase, 'long' means lengthy or length. Thus it's important to consider the meaning of the rest of the phrase. 1) One year seems like a lengthy amount of time unless referring to an indefinite number of years, and the question does ask for an explicit number of years. 2) If referring to 50 years, it's necessary to be clear the reference is to 5 decades. This refers to a period of 50 years and not 50 single years. 3) Several centuries would not make sense in the context as it's referring to something in the past. The phrase 'long time ago' doesn't indicate several centuries, but rather a single unspecified period of time. 4) 0.03 seconds refers to the time it takes for light to travel one meter. This is not relevant as the question asks for the amount of time or duration. 5) Never, as the phrase'so long' indicates some time has past since then. 6) '30 days' could apply if only one calendar month is meant and a month constitutes 30 days. 7) To answer the question, the answer must be chosen from one or two options. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 2) '50 years'.\nAnswer: 2) '56 Years'\n\nInput: What are some animals that live in a house?

Choices:  *: Mount Everest B: Space *: Both are true C: Moon *: Mars\nRationales: The question is referring to binoculars and telescopes. Binoculars give you a wider and clearer view without the need to focus separately through each eye. Telescopes are not able to do this and you would need to focus separately through both eyes to see a clear image.

Choices: A: cats B: rabbits C: bats D: lizards E: squirrels\nRationales: Considering all the options given, it seems logical to eliminate anything furry that crawls on the ground as it's not fast and furry like the question states. Therefore, rules out 'bats', 'lizards', and'squirrels'. The remaining options are both fast and furry so by rule of elimination, 'cats' and 'rabbits' are the only correct options as they are the only types of creatures that remain that fit both criteria.\nAnswer: C: bats\n\nInput: Answers of  A and C must be identical except that  Answer of A is what?

By 'identical' the question means that 'A' and 'B' must both be identical in every way except for the difference in 'A' being 'a dog' and in 'B' being 'a cat'.\n2. Both 'a dog' and a 'cat' are animals, therefore any 'identical' option that has an animal listed under'A' and 'C', such as elephants, must be crossed out.\n3. Thus, 'elephants' is the first option to be crossed out.\n4. Similarly, 'bears' and 'dolphins' must also be avoided, as they're other animals besides elephants in identical options that 'A' and'C' may share.\n5.

Choices:  a: smoke out A: deteriorate B: decay C: melt D: grow E: flourish\nRationales: This answer is a word trick. It is similar to the English question: How does the sun rise? The question would be trickier and have a different connotation if it were answered by 'b' instead.\n\n1. Option a: smoke out\n      The word \"out\" can sound like a word that can occur in place of the word \"smoke\", leading to the suggestion that it is a viable answer.\n      However, smoke cannot leave a cellophone, it disappears, so smoke can not be answered as option a: smoke out.\n2. Option b: deteriorate\n       The word \"deteriorate\" is a noun form, and this answer would seem like it means that the cellophone is going to burn.\n       But because a fire is always the burning of matter and not of the material itself, the word \"deterioration\" does not make sense here.\n       Option b: deterirate can be eliminated. \n3. Option c: melt\n       The cellophone is made up of a material that is solid, and solid materials do not melt in a fire.\n       Option c: melt can be eliminated.  \n4. Option d: grow\n       The cellofone does not grow during a fire. The cellofone may expand if it is made up of a liquid material, but even then, the expansion cannot happen over the course of a short-lived fire.\n       Option d: grow can be eliminated.   \n5. Option e: flourish\n       In spite of the fact that a fire destroys objects, it is true that there is growth when everything is a total mess after it is over.\n       In the context of a fire, the fire itself can be considered an entity that has gone through change and growth.\n       Option e: flourisher can be eliminated.     \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is", "answer": "A: gain weight"}

Choices: 1: A: work together 2: B: work independently 3: C: work manually 4. D: do something without knowing what the problem is 5: E: do a bunch of small tasks\nRationales: The question asks us to identify what makes a robot unique, and as a machine without emotions, it does not require collaboration with another.\nThe question implies that a robot is not like a person in working independently.\nTherefore, option B must be the answer - a robot does work independently without needing help from other machines.\n\nAnswer: B: work independently\n\nInput: The word \"alarm\" as a noun is closely linked to what? Choices: A: the word \"awake\" / alert / wake B: a feeling C: a thing D: a verb E: something that annoys\nRationales: \"Awake\" as in an aware person is related / connected to the alarm, as an alarm is a function of awakening and alerting a person of danger / emergency.\nHence \"awake\" is the answer\n\nAnswer: A: the word \u201cawake\u201d\n\n<details>\n<summary>Question #30</summary>\n<br/>\n<b>The man saw the car wash that seemed new and that looked like an improvement.

Choices: A: exhaust system B: air intake system C: carburetor D: fan E: tailpipe\nRationales: A car needs air to produce carbon dioxide, which is critical for the efficient combustion of fuel in a car's engine. Most of the oxygen used in the combustion process comes from air, so the efficiency of the car's engine is heavily dependent on sufficient air intake. \nThe exhaust system, fan, carburetor, and tailpipe are all parts of the car that are necessary for air to enter and exit the engine, but the air intake system is by far the most significant. \nThe exhaust and fan are required to expel the combustion products produced by the engine, while the carburetor is needed to meter out the correct amount of fuel for efficient operation. The tailpipe, or muffler, is there to reduce noise and minimize environmental pollution. \nThese parts of the car play essential roles in the overall functioning of the vehicle, but the air intakes are the most important in terms of ensuring an efficient engine. \nThis is because the engine relies heavily on air intake for combustion, whereas the other components of the car are needed to facilitate air into the engine but", "answer": "B: symphony"}

Choices:  (A) A moan B Cough C) Sneeze D) A groan E) Snore\nRationales: It's likely that a person eating food and choking would make all sorts of noises, depending on how intensely they were choking. \n\nIn order to keep your answer clear, consider the options below as all of them are possible responses to the question:\n\nOption (A) moan\nOption (B) cough\nOption (C) sneeze\nOption (D) groan\nOption (E) snore\n\nAll the options mentioned above are examples of sounds that a person could make when choking. \nHowever, by the process of elimination, one of these options should make more sense than the rest. \nAll the other options given are not as likely to be produced when a person is choking. \nConsider the context of 'choking when eating':\nOption (A) is unlikely because moaning is unlikely to result from choking and furthermore the context of choosing a store implies the choking was done by a person. \nOption (B) suggests choking but that is caused by phlegm and not food. \nOption (C) is related to sneezing but not related to choking.  \nOption (D) is related to groaning but not related to choke. \nOption (E) is unrelated to choking as it suggests a choking person snoring.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B, the cough.\n\nAnswer: B: cough\n\nInput: Who would be the leader of an organization if it was an American one?

C: purchasign seeds 4. D: installing an automatic sprinkler system 5. E: planting perennial flowers\nRationales: As there are more than two options given, a logical method to determine the answer is to list the steps and requirements of the given options. \n1. Hiring a gardener is an option that would involve a cost but if you have the right tools and skills, one gardener is enough to manage a larger garden while one person cannot grow an entire garden 2. Fertilizing requires effort, however with practice, it's possible to learn in a relatively short amount of time at home, which implies less cost and effort. 3. Fertilizing would be more efficient than purchasing seeds from outside sources, especially if the soil is already fertile. 4. Installing an automatic sprinkler requires initial effort, but will decrease time and effort in the future. It can be programmed beforehand or controlled remotely which can save time and effort. 5. It's unlikely for perennial flowers to require more plants based on the information provided so it is not a suitable choice for this question.\n6. The options that are most likely to require the greatest effort and cost are fertilizing and installing an automatic sprinklers.

Choices:  O: inside the park O: outside the library O: the middle O: in an office O: in the woods\nRationales: This is a tough question! While it may seem like finding a library \"inside\" a park would be strange, it is not always the case. In fact, there are many libraries located inside of parks, and they provide a valuable resource for those who live in or near these communities. Moreover, there are many other places where one might find a library - for example, in a public building or a school. So, if you're looking for a place where you can find a library without visiting a park, you might find it in one of these other locations.\n\nInput: What did the man need that he didn't know about? Choices:  B: knowledge O: understanding C: information O: a guide D: skill O: a friend\nRationales: The man needed to solve the issue and for that, the correct option is understanding or knowledge. The problem is already there, he can only solve if he knows what the problem is and he needs to have that knowledge before solving the problem.\n\nInput: Is it okay to talk to a stranger outside?

Choices: B: family C: home D: mother E: wife\nRationales:  1. The question is based on the concept of a dog being lost and looking for his home, and then when it smells a scent, asking if it could be from where? \n2. We need to eliminate any option that doesn't fit the context of the question. \n3. \"Family\" (Option B) - The dog being lost does not fit with the concept of smelling the family. A family member would typically lead the dog to a familiar place, such as the family home.\n4. \"Family\" (option C) - It makes sense for the dog to remember an aroma from a familiar place. The scent could be from somewhere in the family he has frequented, but there's no way of knowing if it belongs to a family member or not.\n5. \"Home\" (Option D) - It makes sense to wonder if the scent is from your home when you're lost and alone, but it doesn't tell us whether it's the home that the dog feels he is actually looking for.\n6. \"Mother\" (Option E), - Since the dog is lost, it doesn't make sense for its scent to come from its mother. \n7. The other option is \"wife\" (Option E). Since the dog is lost and the question is asking if the scent is of his home, it makes sense for it to come from the nearest place of habitation it knows, which might be its home or another location it frequents.\n8. Therefore that leaves the option \"wife\", since it fits best with the context, and the question is asking for the scent when the dog is lost, not where it came from.\nAnswer: E; from his wife\n\nInput: A small car drove down a winding road", "answer": "C: middle east"}

D: A, B, C\nRationales: The question asks for the correct sequence of actions if there are three people available to help and you wanted to perform this activity.\nThe available actions are 'B', 'C', and 'D', indicating that you have three options for an activity.\n\n1. Action A can be ruled out because it is redundant. There is no need to perform both action B and action A.\n2. Action C can also be ruled out as it has already been done. Since there is only one option remaining, action 'D' must be the correct action to follow.\n3. The answer to this question is 'D'\n\nAnswer: D: A, B and C\n\nInput: A dog barked. Then in a moment, the dog was angry and lunged at someone. Choices: 1: A: the person barked back B: the dog was not surprised C: it was the dog was annoyed D: it was the dog thought it should stand up for its owner. 2: E: The dog lunged at them  F: they had just yelled at the dog  G: they didn't realize the dog wasn't supposed to be angry  H: the dog stood up for its owner's authority\nRationales:\nThe questions asks us about events that follow the dog barking. We need to determine whether the dog lungs at the person in response to the bake or if this lunge was uncalled for.\n\n1. By process of elimination, the answer cannot be option A: the person barks back. If this were the case then the person didn't provoke the dog and the dog could be calm since there was no reaction to the bark.\n2. Similarly, option A: it was the dog", "answer": "B: recording studio"}

{"text": "critically' refers to the use of rational thought and logic to arrive at a sound conclusion. However, a person would need to make a logical decision in order to get to the store.\n5. 'Cross road' fits the question as we want to travel from one place to another, as crossing a road would be a way to do that.\n6. The answer is B: cross road.\nAnswer: B. cross road\n\nInput: Do you know any words that begin with H and end in E? Choices:  C: Yes A: Yes B: Yes C: No D: No E: No\nRationales: When reading a question, it's important to first identify the key information and identify the parts of the question that are unnecessary, as they are distractors meant to confuse you. \nFor this question, we can safely eliminate four of the answer options (A, B, C, and E) right away, as they all contain incorrect words. \nThe only remaining option is E, which contains the correct response. \nAnswer: E: No\n\nInput: Where would you find a woman who likes to wear fluffy, white socks but doesn't like to do what? Choices: A: housework B: clean the tub C: do something D: the dishes E: the lawn\nRationales: The first step is to identify the task being asked about. This is revealed by the question mark at the end of the sentence. The woman likes to wear white socks but does not like to do the task of housework. It's not asking what the woman does, it is asking what the task is that she does not like. \nThe next step is to eliminate answer options one by one after narrowing down what options are related to the task. \nThe first option is B \u2014 clean the tub. Although it's technically related to doing housework, it's not referring to the task.\nThe next options are C, D, and E, and the only one that could possibly be related to the task is E \u2014 the lawn. \nThe woman is not actually out doing the lawn, she is probably indoors doing something else that she does not like when she wears the socks. \nTherefore, A has to be the correct response.\nAnswer: A \u2014 housework.", "answer": "D: attractive appearance"}
{"text": "critically' suggests a process of evaluating information or options, which is obviously not required in this scenario.\n5. Consider 'crossroad' and 'backdoor'. The human knows the direction to reach the store, so it doesn't make sense for them to cross a road and use a backdoor. \n6. \"Crossroad\" is a logical answer to the question and implies that someone would cross the road in order to get to the store.\nAnswer: C: crossroad\n\nInput: The people have an excellent reason for using up their entire supply of oars. Choices:  A. Angry with neighbors B. Itchy C. They have another source coming D. They don't need oars anymore E. Their oar supply increased F. They need to move to a different boat G. There aren't any more left H. Oars are no longer needed\nRationales: Input: An oar is a boat paddle, used for moving the boat. \nInput: People is plural, hence, they are more than one.\nInput: Boat is singular, hence, it refers to only one ship in this instance.\nInput: Neighbors is plural, hence it refers to more than one individual or group in this instance.\n\n1. 'B. Itchy' is grammatically incorrect as it does not make a complete sentence.\n2. 'They have another source coming' is not a reason but a statement on how the people have an increased supply of oars despite their entire supply already being used up, which makes it not an acceptable answer.\n3. 'They don't need oar anymore' would imply that they have no need for oars which is not true, as they have already used them all up.\n4. 'There aren't any more' means that there are no oars left, not that they need to move to a new boat with oars.\n5. 'Oar is no longer needed' might make sense in another context, but not in this one since they still need oars for their boat to move. \n6. The answer, which makes perfect sense is 'G.

{"text": "critically' also does not help in getting to the store, as a critical thinker can be in multiple places at once due to the nature of their abilities.\n5. 'Cross road' could be an option but since \"getting to\" is part of the question, the option should only include actions that move a person towards the goal, not simply actions taken anywhere in general.\n6. The only possible action that can be performed and that moves a human closer towards the desired store is 'walk'. Therefore, the answer is A.\nAnswer: A\n\nInput: Who would you call to move a house? Choices:  C: firefighters D: police E: movers F: friends G: plumber H: landlord\nRationales: The question here is asking who a person should call to move a house, and not the people who could do so.\nFirefighters and police are not used to move a house, as their role requires them to respond to emergencies involving fires or crimes.\n\nThe movers can move a house but usually they are paid to move a house. If someone has no money, he would call friends to move the house.\n\nTherefore the answer is B.\n\nAnswer: B\n\nInput: A car is part of human transportation, true or false? Choices:  B: false C: partially false D: mostly false E: true F: all false G: always true\nRationales:\nThe question is about identifying whether or not the statement made\u2014\"A car is part of human _transportation_\"\u2014is true or false.\n\nThe only part of the statement that is likely to be true is \"human\", as the question asks about whether \"car\" is a part of \"human transportation\".\n\nThe rest of the statement can be eliminated as there is no evidence to support it.\n\n\"False\" can also be eliminated, as it is the opposite of true.\n\nThis leaves two options: \"True\" or \"All false\".\n\n\"All false\" cannot be the option as the statement about transportation is not considered as a whole, with \"Car\" being a distinct element.\n\n\"True\" can be the option, as the statement is accurate if \"car\" is part of human transport, which it is.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\nAnswer: D", "answer": "C: dairy farm"}

Choices: A: being honest and not dishonest B: dishonest and lying C: trustworthy D: not being honest E: not dishonest\nRationales:  1. According to the dictionary, the answer must be \"honest and not dishonesty\". This is because 'honest' means not dishonest or not deceitful.\n2. Option A: being honest and NOT dishonest would mean that we are being honest but at the same time, being dishonest. This does not make sense so it can be eliminated\nOption C: trustworthy would mean you have to be faithful and reliable to someone. This isn't an option for this question.\nOption D: not being honest or not dishonest does not make any sense, so this is also eliminated.\nOption E: not being honest or dishonest means you are not lying. \nOption F: \"Honest and dishonest\" is clearly not an option.\n3. Option A: 'honest and not dong' doesn't make sense, as it should mean being not dishonest and honest.\n4.

Choices:  Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday B: no baths was given\nRationales:\n1. The question is asked by a person to find out how many baths a woman gave her baby.\n2.

{"text": "critically' is also not relevant since it does not immediately result in traveling to the store.\n5. 'Cross road' does not specify where to exactly go next.\n6.

He's willing to walk with who where. Choices:  A. Dogs B. Cleaners C. The dogs' owner  Cleaners. 'Mel' is a cleaner, she's willing to walk to her customer with whom. Choices:  D. 'James'  D. James. It's an unknown person, but it could be a man.\n\nRationales: We can safely remove the words'many people' from the prompt as they aren't significant to the conversation.\n\nFirstly, let us consider the 11 options available.\n\n2. The dog is an animal. 'Dogs' and 'cleaners' are also animals. Thus, they cannot be walking with each other, but with human beings.\n\nThus, 'dogs' and 'cleaner' can be eliminated. \n\nFurther, we can see that the'man on a motorcycle' and 'James' can be eliminated because we know that dogs and cleaners are animals.\n\n'James' can be removed because the cleaners can only be walking with Mel, the cleaner.\n\n'Man on the motorcycle' can be eliminated, as even with no animals, it's not possible for a man on a motorcycle and a cleaner to walk together.\n\nThus only 2 options are left to be considered.\nEither the man is walking with another man.\nor the cleaner is walking with another cleaner.\n\nSo the answer will either be,\n\nMan = A man\nCleaner = Cleaner\n\nor\n\nMan = Man\nCleaner = Mel\n\nInput: When people say someone's 'got me beat' it means that they're...

Choices: A: pack of wolves B: woods near the wolves C: the wolf ran away D: wolf did not flee E: from the wolf's mouth\nRationales:1. We don't know where Billy or his friends might be hiding. Given the clue with the term 'pack' and the fact that the wolf runs away, it's safe to presume the setting is one where there is a group of wolves. \n2. In this setting, the idea of a wolf running away is a reasonable one. \n3. Therefore, the answer would be B: the woods. The woods are where 'the pack' is located, and the wolf is said to run away.\n4. The wolf 'came from the woods near the wolves'. Thus, it was likely in the woods that we assume to be home to the wolves. \n5. The only word given is 'from', indicating that the wolf has left the pack. It appears the scene happens in the woods and the wolf 'ran away'. \n6.

We can eliminate choices by considering what would be the best place or way to give the gift. \n1. A: If someone is making a meal, they'd usually do so at their home or another place that's appropriate for cooking, not at the siblings' place", "answer": "C: computer"}

The question refers to children who like to climb trees and ask us to provide the appropriate name.\n2. Based on the words in the question, we consider each option carefully.\n3. A: Tarzan is not an appropriate name for a child that likes climbing trees because Tarzan is an adult character from the movie \"Tarzan\" and a strong adult male cannot be referred to as a child. \n4. B: Spiderman is not an appropriate name either because although Spiderman is a popular cartoon character, he is too old to be a child and cannot use the name correctly.\n5. D: Jumanji is not the appropriate name either because although it is a children's movie, the character played by Robin Williams is also a man so does not make sense.\n6. C: Lion-man is not the correct name either because it is a name that refers to people with superpowers and does not relate to children who love to climb trees.\n7. E: Superman is also not an accurate description for children who like to climbing trees since this is a name used for a special person in a movie or story.\n8.

Cross road\n\nInput: What can you get at a department store? Choices:  a: toothpaste b: shopping c: dress d: jewelry e: books \nRationales:\n1) There is a difference between a market and a departmental store. A department store has a wide range of products (various departments) which is where the terms departmental and departmental store come from.\n2) The word \"get\" is the verb in the sentence. It's telling us that we have to choose the correct verb to answer this question, as the question asks \"what can you get?\"\n3) There are six objects in the first half of the question, so we need to look at the second half of the question, and see what these objects could potentially \"get\".\n4) The correct verb is \"buy\". For example, we could say \"Ajay likes to buy many expensive things at the department store\". Buy makes sense in this context, so the option \"buy\" is the correct one.\n5) A departmental store sells goods, unlike a market.\nAnswer: c. A. Departmental store\n\nInput: The company makes money selling their brand, this allows them to do what? Choices: a. sponsor a charity b. build a new factory c. improve technology d. expand to other countries e. pay stockholders \nRationales \n1) The correct verb to use in the sentence is: selling their products. The word \"money\" is the subject of the sentence. We already know that company makes money selling the brand, and this is what the verb tells us. \n2) A good understanding of the sentence is required in situations where the words in the sentence (here: money) refers to the noun in the last half of the sentence. \"Money\" here is the noun which refers to what the company is doing. So, this verb phrase tells us that the company is producing money by selling its products.\n3) Once we have completed", "answer": "E: school"}

D: locations of banks 5. E: places that work on Sunday\nRationales: Answer: 1. Answer: 2. This does not make any sense as it is not what a traveller may be looking for. The purpose of traveling to the new place may not include visiting many banks, and the amount of money you need may be available elsewhere. A traveller would also be aware of many banks in the area before they travel. Answer: 3. A traveller may visit a bank at night for the reason stated above. But otherwise, this is very unlikely as the banks are usually closed between 1 and 2 AM. Answer: 4. A traveller may want to visit the money exchange shops, as well as the atms inside the banks, not to mention the post offices that exchange foreign currency as well. Answer: 5. This is not what a travler is most likely to want to know since they most likely have their own curreny and do not need banks that operate on Sunday to get extra money. Answer: 6.

Choices:  [4] A: with candles B: by using solar energy C: with oil lamps D: there was an explosion at a nearby gas station E: there is a generator\nRationales: [1] The word ravine gives the setting on a steep hill and can also describe a deep narrow crack or a gorge [2] The presence of a small house in this particular land mass shows low population. [3] Thus, the small house is operating using limited resources. [4] Given context, the small house does not seem to be the only structure existing in this geographical area. [5] Given that the options are \"by using solar energy\" (Option C) \"with candles\" (Option B) \"with oil lamps\" (Option D) \"there was an explosion at that nearby gas station\" (Option E) the conclusion is the only option that stands out as unrealistic to this context is Option E as the context of a small house on a narrow hilltop with not many surrounding establishments. [6] The only realistic option would need to be \"by using solar energy (Option C) as there seems to be a high chance of a gas well or a refinery nearby for other kinds of energy supply. [7] By virtue of \"there is a generator\" (Option D), the option may be ruled out as it does not match the geospatial context.

Choices:  I  He Jake Lily Mary Qatar UPS\nRationales:1. Do I like it? was asked by whom? The option who was asked is the correct answer. \n2. Do I like it can refer to the act of liking or to the result of liking something. The question can refer to a previous question that was asked or implied. The option who was asked refers to what has been asked.\n3. Therefore, the answer who was asked is C: He, D, Jake, Lily, Mary, Qatar, UPS.\nAnswer: C: He, D: Jake, E: Lily, F: Mary, G: Qatar, H: UPS\n\nInput: Which would best suit your needs? The choice is:  A: tuna B: cans C: fish D: beef 200g\nRationales: Which among the choices would best suit your needs is a choice. \nIn the question, the choice is indicated as, which would best suit your needs, hence the answer is best.\nThe choice should be chosen based on its best suitability. For example, if you need to feed your cat then the best choice would be cat food but beef and tuna is also a suitable choice.\nAnd lastly, since cans does not specify if it is tuna or beef cans, therefore the answer is not cans.\n\nInput: I made a choice, what did I make? The answer is A: tea, B: coffee, C: wine, D: juice, E: jujube, F: raspberry\nRationales: The question: I made a choice.

Choices:  A-a book B-old memories C-memory loss D-the day before E-old age\nRationales:1. The old lady could not specifically remember the book she was talking about because she may have forgotten details about it. \n2. \"Memory\" is a plausible definition as it refers to the act of retaining knowledge or experiences. \n3. But, \"day\" is not a reasonable option as the context does not give any indication of when her memory problems began. \n4. 'Book' is unlikely as the context does not indicate that she was specifically referring to a book. \n5. Similarly, an \"old age\" refers to a period of life in terms of biological features, not memory problems related to aging.\n6. Instead, the option \"lost\" makes the most sense as she said she did not remember the book, implying a degree of memory loss. \n7. That eliminates all other options, so the correct answer is E - memory loss. \nAnswer: E- memory loss\n\nInput: Who may see birds? Choices: 1-2 year old 2- children 3- teens 4- adults 5- mammals 6- pets 7- adults\nRationales: A: Birds are not typically seen by one-to-two-year-olds, since they are young and do not have as developed vision abilities as older children, teens, adults, or other mammals.\nB: Birds are generally seen by children of all ages, as they are often curious about and interested in nature and the outdoors.\nC: Teenagers and young adults are potentially prone", "answer": "B: irritation"}

Choices: \nA: You get scolded B: You think twice C: You don't care D: You worry E: You can stop worrying\nRationales: The question states it is asking which options describes what occurs when you express a stray thought in a public setting. There is one answer choice that describes that situation, and then three other ones that do not.\n\n### Step 1: \nThe options that describe what happens when you have a strayed thought in a public setting are A and B, which are to think twice or worry. Of those two possible answers, the one that is correct is to worry.\n1. First, consider the option that is incorrect to answer the question. Option D has to do with you'stopping worrying'. However, this would not be the appropriate action to take in a situation where one feels they may risk scrutinization by expressing a strayed thought. Therefore, this is an incorrect answer.\n2. Next, consider the correct answer.  When you 'worry' about a particular idea or notion you are concerned about it, which leads to increased anxiety. This may lead you to stray from your original thought.\n3. 'Thinking twice' would likely not indicate a change in your original stray thought. \n4. Instead, 'thinking twice' is more likely to cause you to self-analyze before saying your stray thoughts.\n5. Therefore the correct answer is to 'worry'.\nAnswer: D: You worry\n\n### Step2: After you read the options of the above instruction, you may notice that some options do not match with the questions as expected.\n\n1. Now it is the next step to find out a reason that explains why the above step 1 answers were false and step2 answers are true.

Choices: A: play B: go to bed C: sleep D: have a cup E: go to a movie\nRationales:\nStep 1: The question asks what we need to do for creative imagination. \nStep 2: The options provided are play, go to bed, sleep, and have a cup. \nStep 3: None of the options describe something we do to have creativity. \nStep 1: Creativity can't be considered an action, so we can eliminate all the options excepting the last answer option.\nStep 2 : Going to bed and sleeping (OPTIONS B and C) do not promote creativity in general.\nStep 3 : Having a cup of coffee (OPTION E) can be a way of boosting your mood and giving you a creative energy boost, but it is not necessary to exercise your imagination.\nStep 4: The only reasonable option left is D: have a cup to boost creative imagination.\nAnswer: D Have a cup\n\nInput: What might a group of people do to have a really interesting activity that doesn't take a lot of time or has to be very expensive? Choices: A. make cookies B. cook a meal C. organize a party D. play an instrument E. build a fort\nRationales: The options given are making cookies, cooking a meal, organising a party, playing an instrument and building a fort. However, we can eliminate some of these options for \nbeing too time-consuming and others for being too expensive.\n\nStep 1: Making cookies, cooking a special meal, and throwing a party may take us about a couple of hours and require us to use our time and financial resources in a meaningful way.\nStep 2 But building a fort requires time and expenses. It will take more than a couple of hours, and you will need enough space in your house or yard", "answer": "B: city"}

Read the newspaper at the library\nRationales: \"How someone can find a friend\" is a question based on the context and what it's referring to. The word 'friend' in the question is more about relationship, and not necessarily a companion or someone you're close with. \nNow let's look at the options provided. \n1. A person you don't know yet should ask someone what his name is. It would not be proper to ask \"What's your name?\" to a person you already know. And \"Name\" is not how you find a friend, you get to interact with a person first and the name is secondary to the initial goal of finding them.\n2. If you want to see what kind of school someone belongs to, you need to do some research about the school first before inquiring with the person. There's no point to ask directly a stranger about what school he or she goes to, unless you want to make small talks about their education. \n3. In the context of searching, asking for phone number to a person who is not a friend is a strange thing to do. \n4. An invite is not necessarily meant for finding a true friend.

Choices: A: gasoline B: electric C: neither\nRationales: The statement \"gasoline is always more expensive than electric\" is a logical fallacy. It's incorrect to always evaluate things in a binary \"always\" vs \"never\" way because there are almost always exceptions and scenarios where the two options presented are simultaneously more expensive or less expensive. In this case \"neither gasoline nor electric\" may be a suitable option if we account for external variables like fuel availability and infrastructure. In addition, it's not always true that gasoline is more expensive than electric for the same amount of energy delivered (km range). Overall, if we are presented with a question that suggests \"always\" or \"never\" as its context, it may be helpful to consider what the alternative statement would be and whether we can reject it as a possibility.\n\nInput: The most common food choice is what?

Meat: We can eliminate this as the most common food choice as most people are vegetarians or vegans, and thus may not choose meat as the main food.\nB. Vegetables: Although vegetables are a common food choice for many people, they are not the most common food choice. The answer needs to be something that is commonly consumed as well as the most frequently consumed.\nC. Fruit: While fruit is commonly consumed, it is not the most commonly eaten food. \nD. Junk food: Similarly, junk food is consumed, but it is not the most common food consumption.\nE. Sandwich: A sandwich would not be chosen as the first or even the second food choice for the majority of people. \n\nRationale 2: So what is the answer? The best answer is food that is consumed by a lot of people but not necessarily consumed", "answer": "A: open meadow"}

That leaves 'Cross road', which is a logical action to take as crossing a road directly connects to the destination.\nAnswer: C: cross road\n\nInput: Where would you find someone who is going around and around? Choices: \nA: spinning and turning a record B: a spinner C: an inmate D: a turner E: a dancer\n\nBased on the question, our goal is to identify where you would find someone going around and around.\n\nA: spinning a record refers to a specific action rather than the entire body of an individual.\n\nB: A spinner is not someone walking round and round, as it is a specific type of exercise.\n\nC: An inmate refers to something in a jail or prison, not someone walking around.\n\nD: A turner is someone who turns things, not someone walking around and around.\nE: A dancer is performing dance moves, not walking around constantly.\n\nTherefore, the answer is E", "answer": "C: chinese food"}
{"text": "critically' is not in line with the immediate objective as getting to the store requires action.\n5. 'Crossing the road' is a possible option. However, this does not guarantee a human will reach the goal given the number of factors that may be present and affect the success of making it to the destination.\n6. Hence, the most plausible option would be 'Cross road' as it's more likely to be successful.\nAnswer: C: cross road", "answer": "B: get laid"}
{"text": "critically' would be of a benefit in getting to a store, but it is unlikely that they would be thinking critically as they are not necessarily thinking about how to get there in the first place.\n5. Finally, 'Cross road' is the obvious answer. This action implies someone moving to a location away from the initial point (store), by the most direct route (at a road) available to them, which is also a logical process of getting to the shop as it is visually obvious to them.\n6. Hence, the correct answer is B: Cross Road.\nAnswer: B. cross road\n\nInput: What are the tools that are used to work on cars? Choices:  B: screwdrivers C: hammers D: wrenches E: soaps\nRationales: The question seeks a list of tools used by car mechanics to repair automobiles. The question does not expect a list of tools unrelated or irrelevant to automobile-related issues. \n6. Looking at the options, we discard soap as it is not a tool used to work on cars.\n7. Similarly, we rule out screwdrivers and hammers because they are more tools of assembly, maintenance, or cleaning, and not repair.\n8. \"Wrenches\" are useful tools for loosening or tightening bolts and nuts and can be the answer.\n9. \"Wrenches are a tool of choice among automotive mechanics as they provide the leverage needed to get a firm hold for the turn of a bolt.\n10. So, we arrive at Option D: wrenches, as the most appropriate choice to be the answer.\nAnswer: D. wrenches\n\nInput: Who would you invite to a picnic where there are a lot of other guests? Choices:  C: no one B: aunt E: friends C: mother B: sister D: father E: family\nRationales:The question is asking us to consider the type of person who would be most likely to be invited to a picnic among a lot of other guests. Therefore, they are excluding some people from the context of being invited.\n7. First, let us discard options that fit into the category of being uninvited, or that do not exist.\n8. \"Aunt\" is not included among the guests as the", "answer": "B: center"}
{"text": "critically' is also not relevant because the ability to have critical thought does not directly help one get to a store.\n5. 'Cross road' and 'walk in front of' are both incorrect because a road is not a destination but only a route to the destination.\n6. That leaves B: 'See around.' This answer makes sense because 'See around' is a phrase that implies one needs to locate a different direction with which to approach the store, indicating that the question is asking for a different way to get to the store that the human is already in sight of.\nAnswer: B. See around\n\nInput: To find a place one can swim, one must try what? Choices: A: ocean B: ocean pool C: a pool D: a river E: a lake\nRationales: The question asks for the correct word to describe what one must do to find a place one can go swimming.\n1. Ocean is a natural formation of water, and so by definition cannot be used as a swimming place.\n2. Ocean pool is a man-made version of the ocean, and so does not provide the same answer to the question.\n3. Pool is the correct answer, as pool is a man- made natural formation of water and can be used as a swim place.\n4. Similarly, river is also a man- made natural water formation for swimming, so can also be used as a swimmable place.\n5. Lake, on the other hand, is not an option, as lakes cannot be swam in - they have many hidden dangers such as unseen rocks, animals, and plants. \n6. Therefore, the correct options are C and D.\nAnswer: C and D\n\nInput: Which of the following objects is made of something else? Choices: A. tree B. tree house C. leaf D. leaves E. flowers\nRationales: \"Tree house\" does not mean that the house is made of the tree. Rather, \"tree house\" is an object that is built on, and therefore it must be the answer.\n\"Leafs\" is incorrect as spelt and as a plural of the noun \"leaf\". Both of these words should be changed to \"leaves\".\nAnswer: A. tree house\n\nInput: What happens to a piece of fruit when it meets the hand? Choices: A) It is", "answer": "B: anthology"}
{"text": "critically' means approaching a problem or situation with a level head. This does not apply to 'getting to the store'.\n5. 'Crossroad' refers to a busy intersection where several roads meet. However, the fact that it is in sight does not give us insight into the context. In order to 'get to the store' the question requires us to understand and take into account things like proximity, traffic signals, signage, and possibly the presence of staff.\n6. So, we can eliminate A: cross road and E: think critically as these are not feasible answers for 'getting to the store' with the level of specificity given to us. \n7. It's clear that the answer is C: drink coffee. 'Drink coffee and see around'. \nAnswer: C: drink coffee\n\nInput: What word means a small amount or a little? Choices:  a) small b) little c) many d) fewer e) one\nRationales: The word \"little\" means a small amount or quantity. It can be used in a general sense, such as when we refer to something as \"a little light\" or \"a little bit of water.\" It can also be used specifically, such as when we say \"a little girl\" or \"a little more\". \nBy process of elimination, we can eliminate all irrelevant words such as \"big\" or \"a lot of\" and the specific words such as \"many\" and \"fewer.\" \nFrom there, we have the remaining options b) little and d) fewer. \nA little is a word used for \"two\" or \"a few\" and a little is used when we use \"something small\" or \"a little of\" for something. \nTherefore, we can conclude that the answer is b) little.\nAnswer: b) little\n\nInput: The cat is hiding from the mouse. Its location is determined for the mouse by alluding to it in what? Choices: A: a book B: a movie C: a picture D: a video E: a show\nRationales: A: book is ruled out because in order to allude to something in the book, the mouse should know about a certain event/action happened around the book/story.\nB: the mouse only has videos to go off of, and cannot allude from them.\nC: the cat in not", "answer": "C: candle"}
{"text": "critically' would be useful at some point, but it is not the best or most direct action to take when trying to get to the store.\n5. The action of 'Crossing' a road is simple and direct and is the best solution to the question. \n6. Therefore, the answer here is A: cross road\n\nInput: What are good ways to improve reading skills? Choices:  Choices:  A. More practice B. Fewer distractions C. No reading D. Less practice E. Less practice\nRationales: The question is asking for what good ways there are to improve as a reader in comparison to existing strategies that may be counterproductive.\n\n1. \"Fewer distractions\" is not a good way to improve reading skills as distractions can be helpful in expanding understanding and grasping content.\n2. \"No reading\" simply cannot be good as reading is the main activity associated with improving reading skills.\n3. \"Less reading\" is also not a good way as less reading means that the reader will learn less, which is not beneficial.\n4. \"Less practice\" may be possible in some instances but it is not necessarily true that less practice means better or more effective practice.\n5. \"More practice\" is commonly considered a good way to improve as practice makes the reader better at the skill in question.\n6. Therefore,  The best answer is \"More practice\".\n\nInput: What is the most effective way to learn more English words? Choices:  Pick random dictionary words. Listen to podcasts. Immerse yourself in English culture. Use apps. Watch movies.\nRationales: This question has multiple potential answers and our task is to identify each good way to learn new English words. \n\n1. \"Pick random dictionary words\" is not necessarily the best way to learn words. Dictionaries provide definitions but generally not pronunciations or specific contexts in the language, making them less effective in building a good understanding of each word.\n2.  \"Watch movies\" is not necessarily a good way to learn English as movies are a complex form of communication and not solely used for language learning.\n3. \"Listen to podcasts\" is a common practice for learning new words as it is an efficient way to absorb a lot of new vocabulary from various sources.", "answer": "B: history studies"}
{"text": "critically' is an action rather than a condition. So if we were to eliminate this option, how could we go about it? 5. To answer this, let's think logically, we would first need to know which direction the store is located. If it's to the northeast, perhaps we should go northeast to reach it. If the store is located southwest, then we should go that way. There lies the answer. So our answer is D: think critically.\nAnswer: D. Think critically\n\nInput: What might a young adult do if they were going to try something new? Choices:  D: dream dreams B: cross road C: see around E: think critically A: rest D: eat D\nRationales:  1. One possibility is that the young adult might take any form of action if trying something new. In this case, an action that is applicable to the scenario of trying something new is the phrase \"to do.\"\n2. However, \"to do\" is too general of a verb, and there are other options that could have been given that could be more applicable to the context in which the words are stated.\n3. The options given are \"think critically,\" \"cross road,\" \"see around,\" \"drink coffee,\" and \"eat.\"\n4. In this scenario, \"cross road\" is an action that the young adult who is going to try something new may choose not to engage in, as it implies some form of road crossing that could prove to be a challenge to them or that could cause them to fail in their endeavour. \n5. \"See\" and \"see around\" imply the same action, but we can eliminate either of those as they could simply refer to looking around the area.\n6. \"Drink coffee\" is not a logical option for an action that could be done in order to overcome trying something new. It is a passive response and not an active one.\n\n7. \"Eating\" may lead in the right direction, but as stated in the question, we should be searching for action-based verb phrases for this scenario.\n8. So by process of elimination, the answer is option B: cross road.\nAnswer: B. Cross road\n\nInput: The cat has fleas, they are parasitic creatures with tails and no sight.

{"text": "critically' may sometimes be required before making a decision, but clearly, the focus of the question is on the first part of the process, getting to the store. \n5. Therefore, the answer must be 'cross road'.\nAnswer: C: cross road\n\n### What are task-based instructions and how are they used?\nTask base instructions allow a programmer to create various tasks for a given system to perform automatically. They are used in order to execute actions such as data movement and data transformation. \nFor instance, the following code shows how a task-based instruction would send data from a file to a database table \n```ts\nprivate sendEmail(options: SendEmailParameters) {\n    const sendResult = this.storage.sendEmail(options.email, options.to);\n    return sendResult;\n}\n```\n\n### What is task-based data definition?\nTask-based data definition is a common method of designing data models in the ETL process, which stands for extract, transform, and load. The idea behind task-based data definition is that data can be described in terms of tasks and functions, rather than having a complex structure or database schema. This can make it easier to understand and manage data, as well as to integrate it into other systems and processes. \n\nIn the ETL process, task-based data definition typically involves the following steps \n\n1. Extraction: Retrieving data from different sources, such as databases, files, or APIs.\n2. Transformation: cleaning, normalizing, and aggregating the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n3. Load: moving the transformed data into a target system, such as a data warehouse or analytics platform.\n\nBy defining data in terms of tasks and operations, rather than complex schemas, task-based data definitions provide a simple, straightforward way to design and manage data. Additionally, this type of definition can help to simplify the ETL process, making it easier to integrate data into other systems and processes, as well as to support data management and governance.\n\n### What other ETL components can be defined using task-based data definition. \nA wide variety of data can be manipulated and transformed by defining the individual functions. Let's take an example of weather data. \n\n```ts\ntransformer.transform(function(x) {\n  x[transform.get", "answer": "C: make love"}
{"text": "critically' is not a physical action to reach the store.\n5. 'Cross road' implies that the store is in the opposite direction of you and you need to travel to get to it. \n6. 'Cross road\u2019 can work because it means to be on the other side of the road but, there is no need to cross the road because you are already on the other side and the store is in front of you.\n7. So, the correct answer is B: see around.\nAnswer: B see around C\n\nInput: Where can someone get help for when they\u2019ve forgotten and cannot remember things? Choices:  People at work A: people B: the front office C: the memory clinic D: the boss E: the therapy room\nRationales: Work does not always have a front office and a therapy room. The people at work and the therapy room would be places at work where one can get support when they\u2019ve forgotten.\nAnswer: C: the memory clinIC\n\nInput: Where does one have to travel to for the groceries, produce, and meat? Choices: A: the local bank B: the supermarket C: the local grocery store D: the local superstore E: the grocery store\nRationales: There are many places to get both groceries and produce, the options presented make a choice difficult.\n1. The local bank would be a place to get money, a need which one does not have when buying groceries.\n2. The supermarket and superstore are similar to a grocery store with one difference. The superstore is bigger with more selections and could sell meat. However, the grocery store could also carry meat products.\n3. The local grocery store and grocery store are both a general store to sell grocery items but the local grocery stores in the neighborhood would be more convenient than a faraway grocery store.\n4. The option that best works is the local grocery shop as it is nearer to the place of residence where one would find most of their groceries, produce and meat.\nAnswer: C local grocery shop\n\nInput: Where should one go for the cake to serve at a celebration?

Choices:  i: A: They get louder B: They get quieter C: It depends on the quality of the shoes D: They get soaker ii: A: They wear A lot quicker B: They get soaker C: They get wetter D: They get dirtier\nRationales: i. the first question is asking about noise in relation to the person walking. \n1. i. A: the sound of an individual's shoes gets louder when they walk down a path. ii. A: when you walk down a path your shoes get louder.\n2. The second question is asking about the moisture of an individual's shoe. \n3. i. C: the more you walk on a path the dirtier your shoes become (they get more'soil' as in dirt and mud and are therefore 'dirtier').\n4. i. C: after a long walk on a path, shoes will be able to absorb a lot of water (it depends on the quality).\n5. The answer to both questions is ii: C.\nAnswer: ii: C\n\nInput: A dog barked at you, at a certain angle when you turned what could you have possibly seen? Choices: i: A: a bear B: a rabbit C: an elk D: a goose ii: A: the horizon B: your house C: the clouds D: the birds\nRationales: The first question is asking about an angle at which the dog was barking and what the dog would likely bark at. \n1. A dog will bark at a bear.\n2. A rabbit, elk and goose are more likely to hide in the forests around your house than on the horizon. \n3. The dog will also not bark at the cloud.\n4. So the only answer which can satisfy the requirements is A: a bear.\nAnswer: A Barking", "answer": "E: fatigue"}
{"text": "critically' is not something a human would necessarily do to go to store and this answer can be eliminated. \n5. 'Cross road' can sometimes be necessary to get to a store, but again this is not required for the question as the store is in the person's sight.\n6. Therefore, we are left with option A: Cross road. And the answer is A: Cross road. \nAnswer: A: cross road\n\nInput: Would you have a friend who doesn't like to take a bath in their bathroom? Choices:  C: no D: yes E: none\nRationales:  1. The question asks whether you would have a friend who doesn\u2019t like to take a shower in their bathroom.\n2. 'Friend' is a subjective noun, so it indicates a person who is your friend.\n3. 'None' cannot be the answer because nobody can have no friends according to the question.\n4. 'Yes' is not a complete sentence as it is missing a subject, so it cannot be the answer.\n5. 'No' is a complete sentence that indicates that you would not have a friend who doesn\u02bct like to take a bathe in their bathroom. Therefore, 'No' is the answer.\nAnswer: C: no\n\nInput: In which building do I hear the sounds of my family members? Choices:  B: my house D: my friends house G: no sound \nRationales: The question asks which building I hear sounds coming from my family members, therefore building D can be eliminated, as it is not mentioned in the question. \nAnswer: B: my house\n\nInput: In what season does it seem that the snowflakes are sticking to the snow? Choices:  D: spring E: summer G: autumn \nRationales:'Snowflakes' are commonly seen during the winter, but this question suggests there is still snow on the ground. \n'Autumn' is defined as falling leaves, not the season when there is still snow on ground. \nTherefore, the answer is E : summer.\nAnswer: E summer\n\nInput: Where do students most like to hang out over summer break?

{"text": "critically' and 'cross road' don't make much sense because the store is visible, so thinking critically isn't necessary, and crossing the road is irrelevant.\n5. However, 'walk' and 'walking' is similar to the actual words used in the question ('go there' and 'going there') implying that 'walk' would be the answer.\n6. Therefore, the answer will likely be 'walk' or 'walking'.\nAnswer: B: see around\n\nInput: The tough problem kept the team in the office late and into the night? Choices: \nA: working time B: break time C: night hours D: quiet moments E: dinner break\nRationales:\n1. The purpose of this question is to identify the correct answer to complete the sentence.\n2. It begins with the phrase \"the tough problem.\" The wording of this is not specific enough, so let's look for additional clues to make it more specific.\n3. It refers to \"staying late in the office.\" However, this can refer to many different times in the day such as during \"break time,\" \"dinner break,\" \"quiet moments,\" \"night hours,\" or even \"working time.\"\n\n4. First, let's eliminate \"dinner break\" and \"quiet moments\" because both occur in the daytime, not at night.\n5. Let's also eliminate \"night hours\" because night hours typically refer to being awake at night, which doesn't apply to being in the office late at night.\n6. Let's also see how \"working time\" would affect the context of this phrase: \"The tough problem kept the [team] in the office late and [into] the night.\" This would imply that the team was working at the office during an extended period.\n7. Therefore, \"working time\" could be used to describe the situation.\n8. That leaves us with two options: \"break time\" or \"dinner break.\" \"Break time\" would likely occur during the day, so let's consider \"dinner break.\"\n9. \"Dinner break\" would likely be during the day as well, so an \"office late at night\" is implied to occur during \"dinner break.\" However, we still need to determine what time the \"dinner break\" occurs.\n10.

Choices: 123-456 A: click B: clicker C: clickage D: clicker E: clickability\nRationales: I. The question asks for the placement of the middle-click on the back of a mouse.\nII. The options provided are click (A), clicker (B), clickage (C), clicker (D), clickability (E).\nIII. Click (A) has been eliminated because 'click' is a verb and not a location.\nIV. 'Clicker (B) is an item, which makes it not an answer.\nV. Clickage (C) and clickability (E) are adjectives, not locations.\nVI. So, the answer to the question is D: middle-click. All terms relate to computer usage and refer to the location of a click.\nAnswer: D. Middle-click\n\nInput: How do I get to the local supermarket, take a left and it's the very last building. Choices:  A. Take a right B. Take to the third or fourth road C. take two right and one left D. take a short detour E. take a right turn\nRationales: The question asks how to get to a local supermarket. \n\"Take a left and it'll' the very last building\" is referring to a left turn in order to drive down the street to the right and reach the local supermarket which is in the very last building. \n\"Take to the third or fourth \" indicates a way to get to a local shopping mall. \n\"Take two rights and one left\" means take a right turn to the third and fourth buildings. \nThe remaining options are irrelevant and do not answer this question.\nTherefore, the correct answer is: A.

However, critical thought wouldn't be required to simply visit a store that was right before your eyes in the first place and the question has already indicated that the store would be quite visible.\n6. So 'cross road' might as well be removed.\n7. 'Cross road' could potentially represent a possible route to the actual store so it cannot be rejected as a possible option.\n8.

(Note: carcass may be spelled carcass or carcase, both spellings are correct as carcass is an homophone for the word carcase.) Choices:  A) Carcass B) Carcase C) Bark D) Branch E) Branch F) Stump\nRationales: (Note: carcoss may be spelled carcase or carcass, both spellings are technically correct but the second version is the preferred one because carcass is a homophone for carcass. You should always follow preferred word choice in a question/answer section like this one.) The word 'carcass' does not have any meaning or pronunciation associated but it's a word that fits the context of a 'dead antelope' which was hunted by the hunter.

For example, she might feel worried or anxious or she might experience some level of depression.\n2. The answer can be found by understanding the impact of this problem, how it affects other aspects of her life, not just her work ethic.\n3. The problem with the question could be that it is asking \"What would happen to...\" instead of \"What would happen in the future\". Hence, \"What would happen\" is the answer to this multiple choice question if we take the context into consideration.\n4. The student might experience a wide range of feelings due to this big problem and those feelings could potentially affect her work ethic, personal life, academic performance or professionalism.\n5. Although all of these choices can be affected to some degree, by process of eliminaion the correct answer is the one that stands out as the most likely to be significantly affected by the problem, and that would be academic performance, as it is directly related to achievements in the student's education.\n6. By understanding the context that the problem might affect the student's academic performance in future, we find that the answer is B: personal life.\n7. The correct answer is B: personal\n\nInput: What might a human do if something that the human doesn't understand occurs, and the human is trying their best to solve it?

Choices: 1. After it was drawn 2. When people buy them 3. Before it is drawn 4. After it is drawn 5. Before it is drawn\nRationales: (The following statement provides the rationale that enables the reader to understand the answer choice.)\n1. Choice 1 After the lottery game is drawn indicates that the winner of the lottery game will likely buy the ticket that won the game. \n2. Choice 3 Before the lottery game is to draw indicates that people are buying lots if the lottery game is not drawn, because they\u2019ll have lesser chance to win. \n3. Choice 2 When the people buy lottery tickets is where the players have a chance to win the lottery game. \n4. Choice 4 After the players have bought their lottery tickets but before it is drawn is where the players still have a chance to win. They have the great opportunity to win more if the players buy it again if it is not drawn again. \n5.

Choices:   A: pride B: control C: peace D: joy E: food\nRationales: This question is asking what the pigeon's feet took, so we need to analyze the possible options based on what might be walked over and how the options are being described. \n1: Pigeon feet took pride (Option A). Pride is not something that can be walked over - it is an inner state of mind. \n2: Pigeon feet did not take control (Option B) as the word 'control' relates to something that is being managed, and there is no real way for a pair of feet to control the situation themselves. \n3: Joy (Option E) is another word that does not make sense in the context of the question as a pigeon's foot is not known to have brought joy. \n4: Food (Option E) does sound like it could be related to walking over something or in relation to a hungry person or animal. \n5: This leaves peace (Option D) or something with the word 'calm' in it (Example: calmness/quietness) among the remaining options.\n6: \"Peace\" (Option D) seems like it could be related in one way or another.

{"text": "critically' is also not the solution as 'thinking critically' will not take them directly to the store but will help them form a logical plan to go there. \n5. Therefore, what they would need to do to get to the store is either 'cross the road' or simply 'go there.' \n6. Crossing the road involves risk while going there involves no risk. \n7. The safest and more straightforward option is to 'cross the road' to the store. \n8.

Choices:  A:\"fish-food\" B:\"customer relations\" C:\"business plans\" D:\"customer feedback\" E:\"good fish\"\nRationales: Let's try to understand the question and what it's asking for based on the options given.\n1. Firstly, it's clear the question is asking about the fishmonger's product or his trade.\n2. It's apparent that one of the options is \"fish-food.\" This is the wrong answer for the following reasons: \na. The answer is asking for the product the fishmonger is selling, not just some product he's eating.\nb. The question asks for an answer the fishmonger would be happy to hear, not a product he would like to eat.\nc. If he's selling fish to people, he can be disappointed if he has fish as his food.\nd. The answer asks for something the fishmonger sells, not a product he eats or uses.\n3. Looking again at the options given, it's clear that the others are either irrelevant (customer feedback, good fish), or answers which would not make him happy (business plans).\n4. Therefore the answer is E: \"good fish\", because he sold a product that people were satisfied with. \nAnswer: E: \"good fish\"\n\nInput: If a person is starting a new hobby, they are starting it at what point?

A: new homeowners pay down loans faster. B: banks don't loan to all borrowers. C: the home loan is a legal debt. D: monthly payments. E: high down payment.\nRationales: What the prompt is asking for is clarification, not an answer. \nOption A : This answer suggests that a loan would need to be obtained for a new home, but we are already given that the new homeowner is purchasing the house without a loan, so no information is added by this response (other than the irrelevant statement that new homeowners pay debts faster). \nOption B : This answer does not provide clarification, but instead contradicts the prompt by suggesting that banks do not give loans in all situations when a loan would be required for a new home. \nOption C : The answer suggests that a loan is needed because it is a \"legal debt,\" but is not clarified beyond that. \nOption D : The answer states that monthly payments would be required on a loan, which would be true regardless of any other circumstances. \nOption E : The answer suggests a need for a high down payment because the home is being financed, but a high down payment is only necessary when applying for financing (i.e., a loan), which would be true regardless if the homeowner has a loan or not. Hence, it is not clarifying, but misleading.\n\nAnswer: No one of the suggested answers is fully adequate. \nAnswer: None of these answers.\n\nInput: How could a baby get its name?

Choices: 1 A: side B: dirt C: road D: grass E: rocks F: river G: pond\nRationales: First, we need to make sure that we understand what the question is asking us for. In this case it wants to know where the snake slithered to.\n2. In order to identify the correct answer, we start by considering the options:\n2.1. A: side. While it is possible for snakes to slither on \"sides\", this isn\u2019t likely an appropriate answer as snakes prefer more natural environments, such as forests, grasslands, and gardens. \n2.2. B: dirt. Snakes usually slither on the ground, and it is logical to assume that if they are slithering across the ground, they are going towards something that might contain food, and not necessarily the dirt itself. \n2.3. C: road. Snakes are unlikely to slither on roads, given the potential for contact with moving vehicles, and they also don't usually live in urban areas. \n2.4. D: grass. Grass is more likely than dirt to feature snakes on it and given that the question does not specify the type of grass or the direction, this is a reasonable option.\n2.5. E: rocks. Although snakes may slither over rocks or other difficult terrain depending on their size and habitat, this doesn't seem like a plausible answer given that a snake is looking for somewhere to hide or a natural area to live in, and the environment described doesn't seem like anywhere it would want to be. \n2.6.

{"text": "critically' is also not necessary as the path to the store most likely is already known to the person.\n5. The two options left are 'cross road' and 'cross path.' \n6. But 'cross road' would not make logical sense as the 'road' is the entire ground between the human's position and the store's position.\n7. Hence, 'cross path' is the correct answer.\nAnswer: D. \"Cross path\"\n\nInput: What's a good name for your favorite movie? Choices:  Alpacalypse Now A: Alpacalypsecast B: Alpacalisaidso C: Alpacagoes D: Alpacagotogo E: Alpacagonewouldbe\nRationales: Here are the steps to finding the answer:\n\n1. The question asks us to think of a good name for the favorite film.\n\n2. We'll want to rule out the least appropriate answer and then choose the best from the remaining options.\n\n3. The least appropriate answer is \"Alpacagoes,\" which references the word \"goes\" in the film's title.\n\n4. The remaining valid answer options are \"Alpacalypsecasd,\" which was already used in the film, \u201cAlpacagotogo,\u201d and \u201cAlpacagonewoubde.\u201d\n\n5. Option \"Alpacagoestohere\" is not a valid answer because it contains invalid information, namely the word \"here,\" which does not exist anywhere in the film, and because the use of the word \"goes,\" like previously mentioned, is not appropriate or relevant.\n\n6. So the remaining answer options are \"Alptacalypsecasad,\" which was already used, \"Alpacagotowo,\u201d and \u201cAlpaxaqgonewouldbe.\u201d\n\n7. Option \"Alpaxacagonewouldb\" cannot be the answer as it was not used in the film's dialogue, and therefore, cannot be a good choice for the answer.\n\n8. Option \"Alpactcalaciesast\" was also not used in the film, so it can also be ruled out of consideration.\n\n9. Therefore we're left with only two answers to consider, \"Alpacagohtoto,\"", "answer": "C: equal opportunity"}

Choices:  C: he swung on a stick and hit the window. D: he made an enormous jump. E: he swam. F: he crawled on the floor.\nRationales: Option A: He didn't make an escape because he doesn\u2019t care or it's not relevant. Option B: He couldn't have jumped, because there wasn't any ladder or stick within his reach in the room he found himself in. Option C: The mouse swung on a stick, which he used to hit the window and escape. Option D: It's an enormous jump, but the stick the mouse was swinging on didn't manage to hit any object on the floor, thus he couldn't have jump out of the room. He simply ended up dropping down onto the floor, where he had been placed when the window was first opened. Option E: The mouse couldn't have swum because there wasn't a pond of water in the room. Option F: The mouse couldn'y have crawled on the floor because there wasn't anything to crawl on because he had crawled from the floor to the window to begin with. The answer is Option C: he swung at a long stick and hit the window, which he climbed onto to escape.\nAnswer: C: he swung a long stick and hit a window; and climbed out\n\nInput: On which beach would you want to see the seal swimming the most?

Choices: A: the blue line B: the pink color C: that it's flat D: the number twenty D: their friends\nRationales: First, the question asks someone will be surprised if they are looking past something. In other words, an observation or point of view is being implied about whatever is being looked at and can cause shock or wonderment. The options include \"The pink color\" and \"That it's flat.\" While these could be considered part of the overall surprise, it's more likely the surprise would be a result of looking past something more substantial, not just the color or flatness (D). Therefore, the main surprise would likely have to come from \"looking past\" something else, which removes B and C as the options to be looked at. 1. Looking at the remaining options, we can determine that the answer is A: \"The blue line\", which implies looking past a boundary or a fence, and hence being surprised. The fence could be a line or even a gate, and would be something unexpected that might cause surprise.\nAnswer: A. The blue line\n\nInput: At where will people do their laundry? Choices: A.

{"text": "critically' is difficult to interpret as it could mean to think logically or in a detailed manner. However, in this context the word 'critical' suggests 'important' so the most logical interpretation is that a person would 'think critically about' how to get to the store. \n5.

To arrive at the most logical conclusion of what to do, we compare 'walk to the store. with what the question describes which is 'what a person would do if they want/need to get to a store.' \n7. As 'walk to the store\u2019 describes that action most clearly and 'cross road' fits into a different category, we can conclude that 'walk to the store is the correct answer. \nAnswer: A: walk to the store\n\nInput: The cats were annoyed, they were littered all over the house. Choices:  A'sons B'daughter C'children D'kids E'grandkids\nRationales: The given phrase suggests that the subject of the question - \"cats\" - is likely to be more than one. \n1. In the given context, cats are more likely to live in a house than to live on a farm. \n2. Therefore, it can be concluded that the answer choices must feature kids. \n3. All of the words in the answer choices can be substituted for \"kids\" without significant changes to the meaning, with the exception of the answer choice \"b\" which contains \"daughter,\" which is not a commonly used name for a group of kids.  \n4. Looking at the remaining choices, \"A's sons\" can be ruled out because they would be \"littered all over the farm\" if the cats were living in a rural area. \n5. Similarly, \"B's daughter\" can be eliminated because it refers to a single daughter, even if she were living in a large house or even a farm. \n6. \"E's grandkids\" is likely to be referring to a large number of grandchildren since \"grandkids\" is a pluralized version of", "answer": "D: conjunction"}
{"text": "critically' is a process of thinking that requires an understanding of the situation, so it cannot be used to solve this problem.\n5. 'Cross road' is an action that could be applied to get to the store.\n6. Therefore, the most appropriate answer choice is 'Cross road'.\nAnswer: C: cross road\n\nInput: What does an egg do for you, once prepared and cooked? Choices:  C: it stays inside you A: it becomes a fry B: it is broken D: it's fried E: it is a sun\nRationales: The main issue here is that 'it becomes a fry' is not a correct answer, since eggs can be made into many things, such as sandwiches, etc. (Option B) also is incorrect, since 'become a fry' is used in that statement, and as 'become a fried', that's a different meaning. \n7. The correct answer choice is then 'become a sun' (E).\nAnswer: E: it becomes a sun\n\nInput: A person will sometimes eat only the white part of an egg. How would the egg be made? Choices:  B: scrambled A: over easy C: hard boiled D: no way to tell E: over medium\nRationales: This is an example of a logical question. \nEgg white is not an option, and in fact, you can't make the question grammatically correct by deleting the word 'but not the yolk'. \n7. The only way to make the question valid is by deleting the word 'the' in the correct blank: \"A person will sometimes eat only ___ of an egg, but not the yolk. How ______ the egg be made?\"\n8. Option B: Scrambled, C: Hard boiled and D: No way to tell are all options that do not make sense. Scrambled implies cooked on a stove, and hard boiled, well, is cooked already. Therefore, the blank does not make sense. Option D is also incorrect, because the subject would be the white or the yolk, not the egg as a whole. \n9. Option E: Over medium also does not fit. Egg white is white, so white over medium is not possible.\n10. Only one option remains, which is '", "answer": "A: medicine cabinet"}
{"text": "critically' is a reasonable answer, but it doesn't specifically refer to direction, only to logical thinking. As such, it does not correspond to the intent of the question, asking for an action.\n5. The remaining option 'cross road' is the only one which is specifically an action and corresponds to the context described. \n6. Since crossing a road would help take the person from where he is to the store which he can see, the answer is A.\nAnswer: A : cross road\n\nInput: Can a man do what he saw another man do? Choices: 1. A: Sure! 2. B: Maybe 3. C: Perhaps so 4. D: Sure bet 5. E: You bet\nRationales: The question asks if a man can do what he saw another do man. \n6. Option A. Sure! is incorrect as it cannot help answer the question. \n7. Sure bet has no relevance to the question or context. \n8. Maybe (B) and Perhaps (so) (C) are vague options which cannot answer the question. 9. Sure bet and You bet (E) are very positive, but again, they cannot answer the question.\n10. Therefore, the correct choice is C: Perhaps so. \"Certainly/probably/likely\" will work for the man to try what he saw another do (B).\nAnswer: C: Perhaps so\n\nInput: Can I see what I want done? Choices:  a: yes b: no c: maybe d: hey! e: oh well\nRationales: a and b are obviously unreasonable as they would mean someone else can see something. \nc is a negative. The phrase \"done\" is an action which is about doing something. \nd is unreasonable as hey is not an action or a verb; it is only a greeting or an object to show that the writer is alive! \ne is a negative. The \"done\" is an active verb or action already. So this cannot happen.\nTherefore, the right answer is c: maybe\n\nInput: Does a dog look alike? Choices:  Yes, all dogs look the same.  No, dogs look quite different.  Maybe, sometimes they look the same and sometimes they don't.  Maybe not\nRationales: All of", "answer": "C: every city"}

Therefore, the answer to this question is A: cross road.\nAnswer: A- cross road\n\nInput: Where does one find a good pants in the winter? Choices:  a: home b: wardrobe c : clothes d : clothing e: shops\nRationales: First, consider each option given and eliminate any that do not fit the context clues.\n1. \"Home\" and \"wardrobe\" refer to inside the home, whereas \"shops\" and \"clothing\" refer to going out to purchase clothes.\n2. \"Clothes\" does not make sense, as if it refers to the clothing itself, then it would have to be either \"home\" or \"wardrobe.\"\n3. \"Wardrobe\" is the best choice of eliminated options as it implies something inside the home, whereas the rest do not.\n4. Therefore, if we consider the context as \"good pants,\" we can eliminate the options referring to going out to buy the pants.\n5 For this example, it does not make sense for it to refer to home, as winter weather would not necessitate pants being \"good,\" referring to quality.\n6. Thus, the best option left would be \"shops,\" as it refers to clothing, not clothes, being purchased in the winter. And this makes the most sense in regards to the overall question.\nAnswer: E- shops\n\nInput: Where do I always find an honest politician? Choices: \nA: local store B: junk yard C: back yard D: home E: supermarket F: golf course\nRationale: 1. The first step in solving this problem is to identify the key words that can help us find an \"honest politician.\"\n2. \"Junk yard\" refers to a large amount of unusable items lying around that are usually not valuable.\n3. \"Back yard\" is not where one would expect to find an \"honest\" politician. \n4. \"Honest\" itself is an adjective that is usually", "answer": "A: bookstore"}
{"text": "critically' can be interpreted as analyzing and evaluating your options in order to make the best choice. However, this does not make sense in the context because the human can already see where they wish to be.\n5. 'Cross road' can be eliminated since it assumes there is a specific direction or route a human must take to reach the store. In reality, a human can take any route to the store, depending on their preferences or the available options.\n6. 'Cross road or path' can be an appropriate approach to take if the store is in a direction opposite to that in which one is currently travelling. However, considering only the store is visible in the first place, this scenario is not necessary.\n7. The only remaining phrase is 'walk' which can be considered as a valid choice, because it directly describes the action of reaching the store. By process of elimination, the answer is 'walk'.\nAnswer: A: a human would walk to a store\n\nInput: The two bakeries share which flavors of pastries? Choices: 1. A: flour B: sugar 2. A: chocolate C: banana 3. A: coconut D: cinnamon 4. A: strawberry E: salt 5. A: nutmeg F: coffee\nRationales: A question asking for two bakeries that share a shared flavors of pastries, you might want to consider which two bakeries sell the same flavors and choose those, as well as whether the bakeries share more than one flavor, or just one of them?\n6. The question says, \"We want to know which two bakeries share the same flavors of pastries.\" It doesn't mention which or how many flavors to note, so we will ignore this information and focus on the shared flavor(s) for now.\n7. Answer B is incorrect as both flour and sugar are components used in baking, so the two bakeries are unlikely to only share one of these flavors.\n8. Answer C is incorrect as it includes a flavor that can be associated with both bakeries, such as chocolate, making it impossible to determine which bakeries share this flavor.\n9. Answer D is incorrect as cinnamon is a flavor typically associated with one particular bakery,", "answer": "B: dangerous"}
{"text": "critically' is similar to 'cross the road', which might make the road safer and prevent the person from being hit by a car.\n5. Hence, the answer is D : cross road.\nAnswer: D : cross road\n\nInput: What does every person have that the others do not? Choices:  a) two left feet b) two ears c) eyes d) hands e) a nose \nRationales: The answer is (d) hands. Every person has two hands but the others do not. They may have other distinguishing features but in this instance, both options are describing two identical features, not two different ones. Therefore, option (d) is the only choice which describes something unique, whereas the rest do not.\nAnswer: a) two left feet or some other distinguishing feature not a) two ears, b) two eyes, c) hands, or d) a nose\n\nInput: A frog jumped a long way in a wet forest. How far? Choices: a) half a meter b) one-and-a-quarter meters c) one meter d) less than one-half meter e) one-quarter meter \nRationales:(b) 1. The distance from the frog's starting point to its ending point can be answered by taking the midpoint of the two possible end points and dividing that by two, which leaves us in this case with half a meter. 2. The context is a wet forest, a location known for its high potential for leaping and distance capabilities. 3. Option 'less than half a meter' is incorrect because both the starting point and end point can be assumed as being at the edge of the pond, which would put the distance between them at more than a half of a meter. 4. Option (e) cannot be the answer as it is not possible to leap more than a quarter of the distance. 5. Option c) 1 meter does not fit with the context's given description.\nAnswer: half a meter\n\nInput: What is common to every person? Choices: a. fingers b. toes c. hands d. eyes e. mouth \nRationales:: The answer to this question is none of the options given.

Choices: 1: Work 2: Buy 3: Think again 4: Enjoy 5: Sigh 6: Smile\nRationales:(1)Buying is irrelevant to the question and a panda cannot be working as pandas are not typically employed. The word \"holidays\" would likely mean the panda had left his work.\n(2)Sighing is not relevant because it may suggest he was unhappy that he had to return to work.\n(3)\"Thinking again\" cannot be the answer as it doesn't correspond with any possible action a panda may take when returning from vacation. It may even suggest he is thinking about the holiday rather than focusing on returning.\n(4)\"Enjoying his vacation again,\" would require the panda to have previously left the same vacation and so, this also cannot be the answer.\n(5) \"Smiling\" cannot be the answer given that the panda did not leave on vacation for leisure purposes, rather he left in order to continue working, or to take a break. \n(6)The chosen answer that corresponds with the context of returning from vacation is \"return home.\"\nAnswer: 6: Smile \n\nInput: How do we make a list the easiest way?

Choices:  I had no choice I was able to choose to do things my way I felt more comfortable with the change My original plan was too restricting I thought I could handle it I didn't know what else to do \nRationales: Here we use logical reasoning to eliminate each of the options.\nOption B: This option is implied in the phrase 'had no choice.'\nOption C: This option is implausible, as the original plan was likely already satisfactory.\nOption D: This option is irrelevant to the change itself, not the cause of the change. E: This option is likely true, but not relevant to the original plan that was changed.\nOption F: This option is irrelevant, as this person made a decision to change something that made them feel uncomfortable. \nOption G: This is implied in the first step when it stated 'had no choice.' \nOption H: This is also implied by the first statement.\nAnswer: I: I thought I could handle.

Cross the street\n\nInput: If I need someone to talk to can I call out? Choices:  M: the phone A: the mailperson C: myself  B: a stranger D: the computer\nRationales: First we need to define what \"can\" means in the context of question.\n\nThe word can in this context doesn't follow the typical use we might have of the word in informal English.\n\nFor example, \"The can is an alcoholic drink.\" This sentence uses the phrase \"can is\" which indicates a possible action or task.\n\nBy contrast, in grammatical terms the word \"can\" is also used with the verb \"be\" to indicate possibility or ability, as seen here.\n\n\"Can you answer these questions?\" This sentence uses the form of be to indicate ability.\n\nHere, the answer could be yes or no.

Choices:  C: cross the road E: walk outside B: see around A: dream C: dream D: dreams\nRationales: The correct answer is C - Cross the road. \nThe question is asking what we would do if we were looking for a store, so the correct answer should be a sentence that is related to looking for the store. The alternatives don't answer what we would do if looking for the store.\nThe alternatives don't also make sense, such as the alternative B: See around, seeing around would mean we are not looking for the store. \nThe alternatives C: Dream dreams is not related to looking for the Store. Looking for the store means you are trying to get your goal, which cannot be done in Dream Dreams.\nThe alternatives D: Dream is not related to looking, you can only dream when you sleep but to look as the question said a Store, you can do it outside.\nThe alternative E: Walk is not related to looking as you need to see the thing you are going to walk, you got to walk to see the store.\n\nInput: Should she walk outside or stay indoors? Choices:  E: both A: both B: neither C: either D: one of the other\nRationales: We should choose the answer E: Both. \nThe question didn't say to walk at all so it would not mean we walked outside nor did it mention walking indoors so we cannot choose answer A;\nNeither is not correct as we know how to walk both inside and outside so we cannot choose answer B;\nNeither C: Either only means we choose one of the other as we can choose walking outside then walking indoors and we can choose walking indoors then walking outside. \nWe can also walk outside and stay outside, and we can also walk inside and stay inside, the answer can only be E: Both.\n\nInput: They will work together to earn money if they", "answer": "D: female"}

Therefore, the answer can be narrowed down to either B: 'Cross road' or D: 'Drive'.\n7. The context of the question suggests that they want to travel to the store and 'driving' would be the most efficient and common way to do so, so the answer is 'Drive'\n\nInput: What does a person do when they have a lot of work to do in a day's time? Answer: C: work or B: nap\nRationales:1. The question is regarding a person who is given a lot to do in a single day.\n2. Let's think about the options given. Working and napping are common ways to spend time but only one is applicable in this case, it's working.\n3. Taking a nap is not going to help a person if they don't have time for it.\n4.

Choices:  a) in a restaurant b) on a farm c) at a factory d) at a factory e) at a construction site\nRationales: A cat cannot get a job at a factory as he doesn't like working with machines. At a construction site, he can be easily be hit by a nail or brick. In a restaurant, he can be easily eaten by the owner. On a farm, he can easily be killed by a pig or cow.

Choices:  C: whale shark (option B)  A: dolphins (option A)  D: sea lions (option C)  E: eels (option E)  A: manatees (option F)\nRationales:\n1. The first two options are not acceptable as they are not animals that live in water.\n2. The third option is also not acceptable as it is too specific, although it is an option. So, we can eliminate this option.\n3. The fourth option, 'eels' may make sense at first but we know that eels do not stay in water parks, since they live in the sea.\n4. The fifth option,'manatees' sounds more likely, since it is an aquatic mammal.\n5.

Choices:  B: land C: desert D: forest E: water park F: swamp\nRationales:1. The question involves the boy finding a water plant that can survive underwater, so the context implies a location where water and life exist.\n2. The boy should be looking for a plant in an area with water and not in a desert or forest environment.\n3. Option B, 'land' is incorrect because a plant cannot survive underwater.\n4. Option C 'desert' is also an incorrect choice, because it's not a suitable environment for a water-adapted plant.\n5", "answer": "C: going to court"}
{"text": "critically' is a difficult question in the context of the question since it's not stated how the person wants to reach the store.

Therefore, the correct response is the action of 'crossing a road' to get closer to the store.\nAnswer: A:\"Cross road\"\n\n### Review:\nThe above response demonstrates how to effectively answer multiple choice questions with rational thinking. By using logical reasoning to eliminate options that do not make sense, and by prioritizing the remaining options based on context and relevant information, we can arrive at the correct response in situations that may appear overwhelming and difficult to understand at first.\n\n### Notes:\nNote that rationales can be useful when answering multiple choice questions, as they can provide additional clarification and reasoning for the correct response.\n\nNote that it is important to read the entire question carefully before attempting to answer it, as the answer may depend on aspects of the question that are not immediately apparent.\n\nAnother note is that not all answers in multiple choice questions are necessarily true or incorrect. Some answers may simply be irrelevant or provide additional information that could clarify the context of the question.\n\nNote that the answer in the final response is accurate and reflects the context of the question, which is the goal of the exercise. \n\nNote also that some of the logic and reasoning used in the response may seem like common sense or obvious to some people, but it is important to remember that these skills can be improved by practice and understanding the underlying principles behind them.\n\nIn general, the process of thinking critically and utilizing logic and reasoning to arrive at the correct answer in multiple choice questions requires practice and a willingness to consider different perspectives.\n\nHowever, by taking the time to deeply analyze and understand the question, and by using proven logical reasoning strategies such as elimination, prioritization, and context analysis, we can arrive at a confident and accurate answer. \n\n---\n### Bonus: Practice Question\n### Rationales:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n### Which of the following best defines what the question is asking?\n### Choices: 1. \"a person that cannot", "answer": "B: bedroom"}

Choices:  big nose: A: they don't exercise enough B: the air is too dry C: they are from the wrong part of the world D: they are fatty E: they breathe with their mouths when they should breathe with their noses\nRationales 1. The question here has a clear implication that some men have big noseses and small mouths while others have the opposite. \n2. There are two main options: big nose and big mouth (A and D) which describe the same phenomenon of someone having a big nose. \n3. There are no two opposing sets of features, so \"big nose and small mouth\" can not be true. \n4. The remaining two choices are \"they don't exercise enough\" (B) and \"they are from the wrong part (E) of the world. Although these aren't perfect matches for big nose and small mouth, they aren't ruled out immediately. \n5. \"They don't exercise enough,\" (A), while related to weight, is not a reliable factor in big nose-small mouth, so this is eliminated.\n6.

Considering the context, a pencil is used to draw lines, so pen (Option v) is not useful if we\u2019re using a pencil\n3. Eraser (Option iii) could be used to erase any lines made with a pencil, which means it would still be a useful\nthing to have if we\u2019re using this tool.\n4. 'Coloring book' (Option vi) could be used to make art with a pencil but there\u2019s no indication that it\u2019s more useful than simply drawing using a pencil.\n5. Graphite (Option vi) is what makes up a pencil, so it cannot be considered an alternative useful thing for using it.\n6. In answer to the question, we should choose the least useful option.\n7. Answer (ii) would be a useful alternative if we\u2019re using the pencil to write or draw something and does not have to do with using the actual pencil itself, so it\u2019s the least useful option. \n8. The correct answer is ii: paper.\nAnswer: ii: paper\n\nInput: When would I encounter a vase that contains a plant on my adventures? Choices:  a: at the store b: in my home  c: in the bathroom d: on a boat e: in a restaurant\nRationales: The word \u201con\u201d in this sentence indicates the presence of the vase containing the plant \u201con a boat\u201d. This indicates that the boat is the location (e) in the options given. The remaining options (a-d) are inappropriate.\nAnswer: E-: on a boat\n\nInput: Which two items would be found together? Choices: i:", "answer": "D: legal fees"}
{"text": "critically' is not helpful in answering the question and can't be the correct answer because there's no mention of the store being located in a storefront.\n5. The answer must be either 'A' or 'B' or 'C' since they are all the only choices that make sense in the context of the question.\n6. Looking at the options, 'B': cross road can be excluded, as this implies crossing a road, which isn't required to access the store. \n7. 'A': see around can similarly be excluded as it implies seeing the store in a way that would not be possible since it's already in view.\n8. That leaves only option C: drink coffee, which can be assumed for logical reasons. Since the human is in sight of the store already, they would not need to'see' it in another way. The human would reasonably make the coffee or tea while moving towards access to the store. Hence, option C is the correct answer.\nAnswer: C: drink coffee", "answer": "E: kill yourself"}
{"text": "critically' is a possible option because it could help the person to problem solve and plan out the best route to the store. But this is not the answer choice that the question is explicitly asking for.\n5. The correct answer is C: see around. The question is asking to cross out the word'see' and keep the word 'drink' and 'dream'. Therefore'seeing around' is the correct choice because a human would have to do this if they wanted to navigate to the store in full sight.\nAnswer: C: see around\n\nInput: What can not be found on a shelf? Choices:  S: glasses B: phone C: books D: pottery E: mugs\nRationales: The options provided are letters and they are not on a shelf. The question is testing whether the applicant is able to understand the meaning of the question.\nRationales:\n1. Consider S: glasses, which would be found on a shelve.\n2. \"Glasses\" is not a word that begins with a vowel letter. Since the letter provided is A, the answer must be an item that starts with the vowel letter A. \n3. Since glasses are not found on a shelf, we can eliminate the options \"phone, books, and pottery. \n4. From that elimination, we can confidently see that the correct answer must be E.\nAnswer: E.\n\nInput: The students in Class A made what? Choices: A: music B: music boxes C: soundtracks D: cds E: noise\nRationales: We can understand more of this question by looking at the options provided and eliminating what doesn't make sense.\n1. The word \"make\" implies that they produced something, so options involving the production of something can be eliminated. \n2. Making something typically involves multiple activities. So, one option where a student in a class only produced one thing does not make sense.\n3. The remaining options involve the activity of a student in a class making something. They are either making a soundtrack that produces music or cds that produce music.\n4. The correct answer is \"c\" for both soundtracks and cds. These can both be produced.\n5. So, there are four candidates for the correct answer. From there, we can eliminate the wrong answer more", "answer": "A: residential neighborhood"}

Choices:  a) the color of its fur alone b) the way it jumps c) the size of its eyes d) the time it slept\nRationales: Here we are asked to classify a type/species of mammal. To determine this, we should consider information such as how the mammal behaves, its physical features, and its habitat. \n\n1) 'The color of its fur alone' is not a sufficient characteristic to classify a mammal. There are numerous species of mammals with different coloration.\n2) 'The way it jumps' refers to a specific ability which does not contribute to the classification of a mammal. \n3) 'The size of its eyes' is neither exclusive to nor exclusive in a specific order for classification of mammal. 4) 'The time it slept' is not applicable as a classification characteristic for mammals. Some mammals sleep while others stay awake. \n\nConsider all the options and eliminate any that do not hold logical reasoning that corresponds with the question description.\n\n5) So the answer is \"b) the way it jumph\"\n\nAnswer: B) the way it jumped\n\nInput: What might happen if you touch a stove? Choices:  -The stove can break up - You can catch fire - The stove burns your hand - You can get shocked - The stove scorches your hand\nRationales: In this case, there're several options given, so the first step is to eliminate options that make little to no sense within the given instructions. \n\n6) Here we need to understand the relation of the question with these multiple choices given: -The stove breaks up with any touch - You can catch fire upon touching the stove - The stove burned/scorches the hand upon touching it - You can get shock upon touching the stoves. -The above options may appear to be true based on how", "answer": "E: die of starvation"}
{"text": "critically' may help someone plan a route but it's not directly related to getting to the store. \n5. The only logical and rational option is A: cross road or B: go to store - this implies that the person in question is directly in the neighborhood of the store and not in need of transport. \n6. Therefore the answer is B: go to store.\nAnswer: B : go to store\n\nInput: What's a place where you could get your car cleaned? Choices:  (1) A: garage (2) B: house cleaning service (3) C: auto wash (4) D: showroom (5) E: car show\nRationales:1. (1) Garage - garage, is it a place to get your car cleaned? No. \n2. (2) House cleaning service, where to clean your car if the garage fails? No. \n3. (3) Auto wash, you drive into a garage to get it cleaned? No.2. \n4. (4) Showroom you buy cars in here? Yes.

Choices: A: home B: school C: office D: store E: market\nRationales: The question is asking what an individual would do to go to a specific location.\n\n1. Home: the individual goes into their house, they can go to a location from their house. The question doesn'twant to know what is inside the house, because they would do it from the interior not from outside the house. 2. School: This means an educational institution for kids or adults.\n3. Office: workplace, where one would work at, such an organization would definitely have a location of its own that the employee would go to work in.\n4. Store: this can be interpreted as a retail store where you can get items to purchase.\n5. Market: this could be thought of as both a place of purchase but it's different from a store, the market typically has a more traditional atmosphere with vendors promoting their products.", "answer": "B: avoid eye contact"}
{"text": "critically' on the other hand, pertains to the decision-making process around how to get to the store.\n5. 'Cross road' and 'walk' are synonymous, as crossing a road can be thought of as 'walking'.\n6. Also, 'walking' can both be perceived and observed by others so it is different from not wanting 'people to see me' when walking, which means not doing any kind of physical movement or being present to others around.\n7. Finally, walking to the store is a likely outcome of thinking critically, and is an activity that can be observed and detected by others if the person is doing it.\n8. Therefore 'cross road' and 'walking to store' can be considered answers to the question.\n9. Therefore, the correct choice is either A: 'Cross Road' or B: 'walk'.\nAnswer: A: cross road\n\nInput: Where would someone buy caffeinated coffee, like drip or latte? Choices:  P: home A: Starbucks B: Walmart D: work E: local grocery\nRationales: Let's start by understanding what the question is asking. It's asking about places to buy caffeinated - or stimulating as it specifically says caffeinated coffee \"drip or latte.\" \nNow looking at the choices given, we can eliminate options quickly by considering common destinations for coffee purchases. Considering this, we can eliminate options A, E, and B so all that remains by process of elimination is options C and D.\n\nSo, the answer we're looking for is between option C \"work\" and option D \"local grocery.\" So let's eliminate option C, which doesn't make sense because of the question's reference to \"buy caffeinated coffee.\" Option C is not an obvious place to purchase coffee with caffeine whereas option D is. It's a plausible option, and it fits the context of \"Where would someone buy caffeine coffee...\". \nSo the correct answer is D: local grocery. Options C or D. However, the sentence ends with more options, so we move on to further questionable possibilities.\n\nInput: How do I turn on the light, with my finger or toe? Choices:  F: Toe G", "answer": "B: create art"}
{"text": "critically' can also be discarded because it is not required for getting to the store. The human is fully aware of where to go to get to the store. \n5. This leaves us with two options: \"see around\" or \"cross road\".\n6. \"See around\" is a vague answer that can be applied to any area but that does not give us something specific such as what is required to get to the store in view.\n7. \"Cross road\" can be logically applied in this situation as crossing a road can get a human to the store in view if that road leads to the store. 7. So, the answer to this question is C: cross road.\nAnswer: C: cross road\n\nInput: When someone is looking at the stars, why might they not just look up? Choices: \tA: they might look for a star they have been admiring. B: they might want to know their location. C: it might provide them with extra information about the space. D: they might see that stars are in the sky. E: they might want more information about the night sky.\nRationales:\n1. To better understand where they are when they are looking at the sky, they might want to check their location on a map or GPS system so that they know which way is up. 2. Knowing their location on a map could give them extra information about the space as there is often more about their current surroundings on the map than just the stars in the sky.\n3. Looking up in the sky might enable them to admire a star they have grown accustomed to seeing and possibly remembering their admiration for it every time they see it.\n4. It is reasonable to assume that when someone is looking at stars, they are looking for more stars that they want to admire as they might do with stars in the sea, where there are some stars that they prefer to look at more than others.\n5. To better understand the space above them, they could look around to see if there are any other stars they might appreciate more. 6. Being that they are stargazers, it is likely that when looking at stars, they want to know more about their environment than just the sky around them. Therefore, that is a viable assumption to make.\n7. Therefore, when someone is stargazing, the star they might be admiring is", "answer": "A: swimming pool"}
{"text": "critically' also does not apply.\n5. To choose the best choice, we should consider the two options left that are actually plausible.\n6. Looking at the remaining options, 'Cross road' doesn't make sense as the store can be right in front of the human and the road wouldn't matter.\n7. The remaining option 'across the road' makes more sense though not very specific. \n8. Therefore, we can narrow down to a single answer, 'across the road'.\nAnswer: B: across the road\n\nInput: Why couldn't the baby eat his dinner? He wasn't very hungry. Choices: A: he didn't have one B: he was out C: it was too cold D: he was busy E: it was too late\nRationales: First, we determine the logical conclusion that needs to be drawn from the given statement. The answer we seek is likely to be in the final piece of information provided.\n1. Looking at the given statement, it appears that the baby is unable to eat his dinner. So what's the reason behind it?\n2. According to the statement, it seems the baby was too sleepy to eat his dinner. \n3. So the answer is E: it was too cold. This final piece of information implies the real reason behind the baby's inability to eat. \nAnswer: E: it was too\n\n### Task:\n\nIf you've got the \"sales team\" and the \"marketing team\" at your company, who are these groups and what are they working on?\nRationales: To answer these questions, first, look at the teams available at your company. For instance, at Google, \"sales team\" might refer to the people responsible for selling their services to customers by finding ways to attract clients.\nSimilarly,\"marketing team\" will include individuals responsible for selling and marketing the company's products such as promoting them by advertising or giving talks to potential buyers. \nAt a sales event, the \"sales team's\" job is to promote the sale of the company's services. So, they can be said to have been working on it. \nLikewise, \"marketing team\" can be said to also have been working on it at the event.

{"text": "critically' is a form of thinking, but it is not an action.\n5. So the correct answer choice is 'Cross Road'.\nAnswer: C: cross road\n\nInput: In a movie with two people, two is which number? Choices:  G: two B: zero D: two D: one E: four\nRationales: To answer this question, we need to understand how movie numbers work. Movie numbers usually represent the order in which characters appear in a film, and each character is denoted by a different number.\n1. It is possible for two people to share a number. The most common case would be if they were siblings or husband and wife, as each would have the same number. Therefore, it is possible that two would have the same number as another two.\n2. If the two people were not related, then there is no certainty that they would have the same number, as this would depend on the ordering of the characters in the film, which the question does not specify.\n3. So, to determine the correct answer, we must consider the other characters that are present in the film, and decide whether or not having two of them could alter the order of characters in the movie.\n4. It is unlikely that the two would have the same character number as another two people, unless they are related. If there are two people sharing the same role, this may alter the order of characters and potentially create a new number for the two.\n5. Therefore, the answer must be B: zero.\nAnswer: B : zero\n\nInput: What is the name of the guy with the orange sunglasses?

Choices: 1. A: graduate 2. B: become a medical doctor 3. C: pass exam 4. D: pay bills 5. E: take test\nRationales: Each option describes an action which is required to be considered a real doctor. To graduate, one must complete medical school, pass exams (such as the national board and state exams), pay bills, and take tests (such as the USMLE and COMLEX). \n1. To graduate from medical school is often required to become a medical doctor, although there are exceptions (such as through osteopathic and naturopathic schools). This option states that being a real doctor is related to graduating. As mentioned before, one cannot be a real doctor without completing medical school, so this one is a direct match. Even for those opting to become a physician in osteopathy or naturopathy, a degree is still required to practice. Graduating is an action required for a real doctor.\n\n2. To pass all licensure exams is also required to become a medical practitioner. For medical doctors (MDs), it is the USMLE and for other healthcare allied professionals (nurses, physical therapists, pharmacists, etc.) it is the COMLEX. This option is also a match as it requires passing all licensure exams to be considered a real physician.\n\n3. To pass exams to be a real doctor means to successfully complete licensure exams. Without having passed exams, one cannot become a real doctor. \n\n4.

Choices: A: right B: left C: back D: forward E: center\nRationales: Since the goalkeeper of a soccer team is positioned in front of the goal post, the only way for a ball to go through is if the goalie moves towards the center or forward, and since the goalkeeper is typically stationary, it is difficult for any other player to maneuver the ball and it would require going around him or her to get near the goal post.\nAnswer: E (center)\n\n###  What can a person do to help a deer survive?\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: They can give them water.

There are actually two reasons given in the options that explain why the cashier might not put the toy \"into a bag\". One of these explanations is not relevant.\n1. We can eliminate option A, because this is a question about what the cashier chose not to do, so a logical explanation would not involve a plan not to do something.\n2. Option B is likely about what the cashior chose not to do, because it refers to \"not putting the toy into a toy\", implying it would have been placed in a toy bag.\n3. Option C can be rejected because it refers to what the cashier might choose to do, which does not answer the question about why the cashier chose to do what they did, which is not put the toy inside the bag.\n4. Options D and E refer to what the customer would have wanted the cashier to do, but the question is asking about what the cashieier chose to do so they do not have relevance here.\n5. Therefore, the cashier did what they chose with not putting the toy inside the toy bag and the only reason they gave as why they did that was option B as mentioned above.\nAnswer: B.

What does that mean? Choices:  a: The prices are lower. b: The owner doesn't care how much his store sells. c: The prices are higher. d: The owner is a fool. e: The stores are similar.\nRationales: It's easy to eliminate options if we look at the context of the question. \n1. First, it's clear that the stores are similar, so option E 'the stores are similar' can be eliminated because they're not different in this regard. \n2. Option F: The prices are lower is unlikely because this should be the default setting for any store that wants to sell its products. Also, the question does not say'many of the same products at the same price', implying that it is in fact not the case that they sell the exact same products. \n3. Option D: The owner is a 'fool' is also incorrect for the same reason: the question asked about the similarity, not the wisdom or intelligence of the owner.\n4. Option C 'the prices are higher' is a possibility because the owner could be targeting a different clientele or could just wish to be more profitable, but this would not directly or explainably lead to higher prices in the store across the street. \n5.

Although there is an implication of being lost, this is a logical fallacy as being lost implies a prior location or destination to lose your reference to.\nTherefore option E is not the correct answer. \nAnswer: C: map\n\nInput: While on vacation in San Fransisco, what activity could you enjoy? Choices:  a: view b: fishing c: hiking d: shopping e: bicycle riding\nRationales: Each answer provided does not necessarily have to do with the activities listed in the question; the activity could be a separate thing altogether. While I think this should have been more clearly stated, I answered each answer and found b/c/e to have answers that didn't fit. \n\nA: The view from the location can't have a specific activity or task with it unless it somehow interacted with the view. This doesn't match any of the options listed thus it is not a correct answer.\n\nB: The hiking trail also doesn't match the options that are listed. There are other trails that were not listed and the shopping mall activity doesn't seem to match up with the hiking trail.\n\nC: I think that fishing is a great answer. I would say that being that there is a hiking trail involved, it would be a good idea to fish. I haven't seen San Fransis", "answer": "A: laugh"}

Choices: 1: baked food A: beer 2: pasta B: pizza 3: chocolate 4: spaghetti D: potatoes E: meat\nRationales: The task asks us to identify \"what wouldn't be made [...] at a food processing plant?\" \n\n1. Looking at the available choices, it is important to consider what cannot be made at a food-processing plant. \n\n2. For example, while \"baked food\" (such as bread or cake), \"pasta\" (a product made from semolina), and \"chocolate\" (produced using cocoa beans) can be made at food-processing plants; \n\n3. \"Pizza,\" being a dish based on Italian cuisine, should not be made in the same factory that manufactures various other foods - so \"pizza\" can be eliminated from option B. \n\n4. Similarly, \"meat,\" which contains animal protein, should not be manufactured in the same factory as \"beer,\" \"pasta,\" or \"chocolate,\" which do not contain animal proteins from their initial ingredients. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A; \"beer.\" \n\nAnswer: A: beer\n\nInput: In which of the following would the plasticizer make for a good choice to add to the recipe? Choices: \n\nA: cooking oil B: vegetable dip C: frosting D: margarine E: dried beef\nRationales: For a question such as this, it is useful to consider the options provided as possible alternatives, eliminating the incompatible, before selecting the one that fits best. \n\n1. For example, vegetable dip is based on potato starch, but its recipe likely contains other ingredients that plasticizer is incompatible with. \n\n2 Similarly, frosting would likely contain sugar", "answer": "B: basement"}

Choices:  on a desk by a window A: in the sand and on the chair B: in the sand C: on the grass D: in the water E: I do not know\nRationales: There are a few possible ways to interpret the question. One, we ask for the person's feet when they sit on a chair. Two, that can be the person's feet (in the sand and on the ground), when they sit on a different object. But if the reference to their feet is to when they sit on a regular chair, their feet would have to be on the chair and not in the sand (but they're not in the water either). 1. A book near the ocean: We start by narrowing down our possibilities. In the ocean, they might be sitting on the sand, the grass or on another item, like a chair.\n2. They sit on the chair: The question is asking about the situation when the person is sitting on the chair.\n3. Their feet are in the sand and on (the chair): There are different ways to interpret this. This doesn't state it's on the chair but it could be on another item.\n4. They aren't in the water: In this case, it does state directly that neither their feet is in the sand or the water. Therefore, they are sitting on the chair. 5.

Choices: (A) Hello (B) I'm fine (C) Please be quiet (D) Do you like climbing (E) I need some water\nRationales: In reading the question, we start by asking ourselves what I might encounter if I'm on a walk. After taking a closer look at each choice, we can better determine what makes sense for the context. \n1. Friend: As opposed to a stranger or random passerby, it's much more likely that someone you're familiar with would encounter you on a walk. \n2. Say: Someone familiar might call out or greet you, but that doesn't seem relevant here. \n3. How: This does fit, but the answer must be very clear, otherwise the sentence doesn't make sense. This is more like an aside than an interchange with your friend. \n4. Can: Although seemingly similar, this is too casual and doesn't fit the context. \n5. Do: This is the question which is asking about what was said, not what was asked. \n6. So, we must look to eliminate all of these to get to the answer. \n7.

Choices:  D: ingesting E: gutted F: ate G: munched H: drank\nRationales: The question asks what happened after the person ate the hot dog. The person having eaten the hot dog is a past action. This is established by the context \"What happened after he had eated...\" The correct answer therefore involves an action which happened after the event of having eaten the dog.\n1. The ingestion of food after it is prepared is described as eating \"F\" (Ate). However, this is not an event after the person has eaten the hot dog because the hot dog is in the state of being eaten at the time when the word 'ate' is used.\n2. D and E are not possible because they refer to the action of eating after the word 'hot dog' is used but after the person's actual consumption of the hot dog itself. This is impossible.\n3. C, D, and D all describe the initial action of eating the food items. When someone is eating a hot dog, the process of eating would be described as having eaten a hot dog, which is why option C is not an option since option C describes eating the item before the actual consumption of the food.\n4. G says the person was munching the hot dog after he ate it (the hot dog at this point would have already been 'ingested'), but it does not say what happened after this, when munching is an event. It says 'after he had eaten' which implies that whatever happened happened after he ate. Thus option F is wrong also.\n5. Therefore, H is the only answer which describes an event which happened after the person had eaten the hotdog", "answer": "A: joy"}

Sneeze (option A) is clearly not an option.\n2. Throw (option B) can be eliminated as it would mean throwing the ball as the next action.\n3. Flick up (option C) similarly does not appear to be part of the scenario given.\n4. Grab (option D) is also unlikely as it would mean grabbing the ball as the next object manipulated.\n5.

However, it is possible to think critically without actually proceeding to the store, it is also possible to travel towards the store without thinking critically. Also, not all critically thinking is relevant to the context. \n5. 'Cross road' clearly applies; it answers the question because it's a direct and literal way of reaching the store.

Choices:  A : car B : tool box C : backpack D : carpentry E: workbench\nRationales: First, we identify the meaning of the word \"made\" within the context of the question. \nUsing logic, we can rule out A: car because the word \"car\" refers to a motor vehicle. \nWe should also consider the use of the word \"own\" in the context of this question. It's possible the person made the item with their own hands and then they took ownership of it. It's unlikely, though, for someone to make items with their own hands then give them away for other people to use.\n\nContinuing in this line of thought, the word \"hands\" can also be implied as the means of making the item. \nIf \"made with their hands\" is implied or correct, we can eliminate other options that contain \"hands,\" such as backpack (Choice D), carpentry and tool boxes (Choices B and C) respectively.\nSo, this leaves us with two options, E: workbench and A: carpentry, as the only remaining options that make sense. \n\nWhen we further consider the two remaining options, we can eliminate E: workbench by noting the use of the word 'pride' in the question. When people feel proud or pleased of their work, as the individual in the question does, they feel this for something they've accomplished. Workbench does not fit this context. \n\nWe have also come to the realization that since the question states the individual made it 'with their own hands, \" carpentry\" which fits logically to carpenter. \nTherefore the correct answer is A, carp", "answer": "A: accomplish"}

It would be odd to simply 'take a plane' to another location without a prior intention of going somewhere. \n4. The option of 'travel via car' is also incorrect as it refers to a means of transportation, though it may be necessary to get to one's destination.\n5.

Similarly, \"Sally\" and \"Lilly,\" and even \"Tim\" seem like logical options.\n1. The key to elimination is considering each name and asking ourselves: \"Does this person own anything?\"\n1. \"Bob\" does not own anything and would therefore be a likely answer.\n1. We can use the same principle to eliminate the remaining names, since \"Sally\" appears to be female and the question specifically asked for a male (or unspecified) person.\n7. \"Paul\" and \"Lilly\" are both female.\n6. \"Tim\" is the only option that fits the criteria of a male character who does not own anything, thus making him the correct answer.\nAnswer: Tim\n\n### Key Takeaways\n* Logical reasoning requires the use of available information to reach sensible conclusions.\n* To eliminate options, consider each one in relation to the question, looking for any information or clues that would make that option unsuitable.\n* In a text that contains many words, consider each word carefully, looking for any clues about its meaning or context.\n* Logical reasoning is a process of eliminating options based on available information.

Choices: \nA: hungry B: patient C: sad D: happy E: mad F: afraid\nRationales:\n1. First, we establish what the question is asking. In this particular situation, it's asking which word best describes the emotion of the eagle.\n2. \"Hungry,\" \"sad\" and \"mad\" all seem unlikely, as it stands to reason that an eagle perched on a tree is not feeling any of those emotions.\n3. \"Happy\" is a possible answer, as if the eagle had located a meal nearby it might be in an ecstatic condition.\n4. \"Patient\" also could apply since the eagle is waiting for its meal and this might be viewed as a positive or unhappy emotion.\n5.

When they get a new haircut they are insecure B. People are inherently insecure. C. People are not easily embarrassed. D. People should have a high tolerance for failure. E. People want to be liked by everyone. \nRationales: The question asks us to choose the statement that is true about people in general, according to the 5 given statements.\n\n1. \"When they get a new hairstyle they are insecure,\" doesn't seem to relate to being insecure in general because it means only those who get a new hairstyled feel insecure.\n\n2. \"Inherently insecure\" refers to an insecurity that is innate and fundamental in human nature.\n\n3. \"People are easily embarrassed\" is not true because some people are not easily embarrassable while others are, making it a general statement that is only sometimes true.\n\n4. \"People should have a high tolerability for failure\" can apply to humans but it's not a general characteristic of most people.\n\n5. \"People want to be liked by all people\" is not true in general as not all people want to be liked by others so it does not apply to being universally true for people in general.\n\n6. \"When the time is taken people are happier\" is the correct answer for the question because it is a general observation for people that is universally true.\n\nAnswer: E.

{"text": "critically' sounds like an interesting option, but the word 'critically' is confusing as we don't know what 'critically' means in this context. \n5. This is because 'critically' is a complex word that can mean different things in different contexts. For example, 'to do something critically' often refers to an analytical or evaluation process, which in this context would not be helpful in moving directly towards the visible store.\n6. Thus, we can rule out option E: think critically.\n7. We can also eliminate option C: see around because it doesn't make sense for a person to walk in a direction or to cross a road if they're not intending to get to a store.\n8.

Choices:  C: season D: position E: daylight F: nightlight G: positioning H: the sun\nRationales: The question wants us to find the reason for the shorter shadow the individuals were creating last week. \n1. The answer is not \"season\" as the shadows would be shorter in summer if it was just the time of day/time of year. \n2. It shouldn't be \"position\" either, since unless the people are standing still, their shadows wouldn't be shorter.\n3. Similarly, \"positioning\" means if the people were standing in a new position, their shadows wouldn\u2019t be shorter.\n4. Eliminate option \"daylight\" as well, because a shorter shadow does not mean it's due to the daylight.\n5. Option F: \"Nightlight,\" isn't applicable since we are not dealing with a night time scenario, and the sun should logically be the cause of the difference in the length of the shadow.\n6. Moving on to option \"the sun,\" this might seem correct because the sun is the primary cause of lengthening the shadow.

In order to determine the answer, we need to understand what would make a place difficult to get to a certain store. 1. \"Taking the bus or train\" (Option A) is not necessarily related to a store because taking public transportation may make it easier to get there rather.\n2. \"Hard to get to\" (Option D) is not necessarily the right answer either because if it's hard to get there then it's already difficult to get to.\n3. \"Hard too\" (Option C) does not make sense because it uses the word \"hard\" twice.\n4. \"Easiest\" (Option B) does not make sense either as it's the opposite of difficult to get to. 5. Therefore, the only logical answer is \"it's easy.\" 6.

{"text": "critically' is a human ability and in some cases, being critical can be counterproductive to one's goal of getting to the store without having to see around.\n5. That leaves 'cross road' and 'drive'. 'Cross road' is unlikely to be a human action, as most human beings don't possess the physical strength to be able to cross the road without any help.\n6. We can also quickly rule out 'drive' as being the correct answer, since the question didn't specify what mode of transport they'd be going to the store in.\n7. \"Cross road\" could be correct, but it's not necessary to go to the store - merely see it - as it is already visible to the human, and not crossing a road requires them to leave the store's location. Therefore, the best answer is A: cross road. \nAnswer: A: cross road\n\nInput: What did the boy do to get the best seat in his class so that he could see better from his seat after school?

Choices: A) where it will take you B) if it will go bad C) what will happen if it does D) if it should be eaten E) who made it\nRationales: A) where it might take you - You can think where it might take you because you know it is an ice-cream cone. So you can use your imagination and think about where you can take it. You can eat the ice-cream cone at home, at the party, give it the to your friend, or you can just take it anywhere.\nB) - There are options where it will go bad, not worry about it, pay attention, read the description - This may be true based on how you are going to use the ice-cream. If you going to eat the ice-creams, it will go bad and you will have to throw it. It may also go bad if you don't use it.\nE)who made it - We know it is an ice cream the cone, we can refer the word \"made.\" The ice-cream cone must be made by someone.

{"text": "critically' is a more advanced concept in intelligence and it is not likely to be the correct answer to the given question.\n5. 'Cross road' is the most appropriate and viable solution to the task. It requires stepping out of their comfort zone and engaging in unconventional methods to get to the store. \n6. \"Cross road\" is a commonly used phrase that refers to crossing a street or walking across a public area, like a sidewalk or even a grassy patch, to get to the store from a nearby location that is within sight.\nThis allows the person to maintain visual contact/communication with the store, eliminating any uncertainty or risk involved with losing sight of the store\n7.

Choice: A: get it a dryer 2: B: place in a paper bag 3: C: leave it where it is 4: D: put into a plastic bag 5: E: put into a dry cellar\nRationales: When something gets wet, it means it's liquid or water has combined with it. In such a case, we will need to put it somewhere dry afterward so that it doesn't continue to be wet. That's where the dry cellar comes in handy. \nBut what if my phone is already inside a dry cellar?\nThe answer is C: leave it where\n\nInput: 1: What is something used around the house from a distance? 2: A: cell phone\n3: B: hair dryer\n4: C: radio\n5: Dog\n6: D: telescope\n7: E: remote control What is the remote control used for?\nInput: 1. remote control controls the remote\n2. radio can bring the signals\n3. 4. 5. remote controls, radio' s can bring the signals\n6. dog is", "answer": "B: sea world"}

This question is asking for the most common action. This action doesn't require the human to look for the dog, it's something the dog does by himself.\n2. Dogs sometimes bark or sometimes they bark at other things rather than the person looking for them. Therefore, this is not a good response as the response only describes a dog's noise when the human is looking for them without considering all scenarios.\n3. Dogs do not typically \"hide\" when a human is around. They might bury their head in the sand but dogs are not small animals that hide from people because they are afraid.\n4. If dogs were to \"stay quiet\" whenever they are alone and someone is looking for them, they would not bark to alert the person. This makes this an incorrect option.\n5. The correct answer is B: hide.\nAnswer: B. Hide\n\nInput: What are the 2 things in nature that are not limited by the passage of time?

{"text": "critically' may seem logical at first because the store would need to be visible to them in order for them to be able to get there. However, the word 'there' suggests the person is talking about getting to the store, not about perceiving it as part of the reasoning to move towards it.\n5. Considering this information, the only remaining choices are 'cross road' and'see around'. 'See around' makes sense because they would need to navigate around any possible obstacles, such as a 'cross road'.\n6. 'Cross road' is the only remaining logical choice because seeing around is not required in this case. \n7. The question asks about a human, so the answer must be related to this context. 'Humans' generally cannot navigate 'around' any obstacles.\n8. Therefore 'Cross road' should be the chosen option, as this is the most logical choice according to all the information provided.\nAnswer: C: cross the road\n\nInput: We know humans like to read their favorite book what does this type of reader enjoy? Choices:  a: learning c: watching tv b: baking food d: going for a walk\nRationales: We can eliminate some options by considering the context of the book. The book itself is most likely a favorite book, which would mean the reader enjoys it and finds it satisfying. From this perspective, we can eliminate options D and E.\nAdditionally, we can eliminate option B because a person who enjoys walking can still take a break to read their book. Therefore, they are not mutually exclusive.\nSimilarly, we can eliminate option C because a reader who enjoys watching television can still enjoy reading their book.\nAll the remaining options are actions that a person can take while they are enjoying a book. This indicates the reader probably enjoys reading their book, as suggested by the given context.\nAnswer: A is the correct answer because 'learning' fits the given context of a reader enjoying a book. Learning is something a person can do while reading, and in this context, the reference to a 'favorite' book implies the person enjoys their reading. \n\n### Assessment\nAssessment:\nWrite a response that appropriately answers the given task where you would find pens with the company logo.\n\nAnswer: An office is a likely place to find pens with a company logos because it is", "answer": "C: small group"}
{"text": "critically' might need consideration if 'critical thinking' was not a well-known concept or a standard skill widely known to humans. \n5. 'Cross road' is not necessary because there is already a nearby option to get to the store, namely 'walking'.

Therefore, the only appropriate answer is A: walk.\nAnswer: A", "answer": "E: air out"}
{"text": "critically' is not specific enough to be an answer as it is a vague phrase that could mean anything and is not directly relevant to reaching a visible store.\n5. The remaining options are all directly tied to the process of travel.\n6. Looking at the options, only one explicitly involves travel, which is B: cross road.\n7. The concept of crossing a road implies a physical action of going from one place to another in order to get there.

What is the word that links the words 'intermediate' and \u2018missed\u2019? Choices: 1) A: verb 2) B: adjective 3) C: participle 4) D: modal verb 5) E: adverb\nRationales: This question is asking for a word that links the words \u2018intermediate\u2019 and \u2018missed\u2019. \nThis means we need to look for a word that can connect the two concepts in the context.\nConsidering the given options, only the remaining options can connect these words.\nThe answer could be that the student in your English course is in an \u2018intermediate phase\u2019 of learning \u2013  and thus he is missing more and more lesson.\nThis would indicate that our keyword is the \u2018phase\u2019 in the sentence. \nTherefore the answer is 3: phase.\n\nInput: What can get me there?

Choices: A; B; C; A, B, C\nRationales: The question is a YES/NO question and needs a correct answer. A, B or C can be correct answers to a YES/NO question. The beach is not where people normally carry things, therefore B is a false statement. A is correct answer to a YES/NO questions, therefore it should be answered. C will not be the correct answer. In the text no statement gives information that 'things' was mentioned. The sentence 'you bring things to carry' was a part of the question and not of our text.\n\nInput: The question was, \"Why is it important for you to get good work experience?\" How could you put it in your own words?

Choices:  T  A: a better view B: a different atmosphere C: a different staff D: a different clientele E: a louder environment\nRationales: When answering multiple choice questions like the ones you work through, pay attention to any given context that can guide you to the most accurate answer. \n1. The phrase 'bookstore' refers to a place that sells books whereas 'library' refers to a place where books are stored for reading/reference.\n2. There is a significant difference between these two places, the context of the question refers to these differences.\n3. Consider the given distinctions:\n3.1 Bookstore and Library are both places where people may get books. However, libraries have a different environment/atmosphere from bookstores.\n3.2 The number of customers in a library is much less than that in a bookstore, as people generally do not go to libraries to do shopping like they do in bookstores. There are exceptions here, such as places where they sell antique or second-hand books, but this is not the intended meaning when the word bookstore is used. \n3.3 The staff of a library are also different from that of a bookstore.\n3.4 The level of noise in a library differs from that in a bookstore.\n4.

Choices: 1: attack 2: fight 3: destroy 4: kill 5: punish\nRationales: Each of the given choices can refer to various actions or activities that angry people might engage in.\n1. 'Attack' can refer to physical or verbal violence, as well as an attempt to hurt or cause harm. It's a common instinctive reaction that an angry person might engage in or feel compelled to engage in.\n2. 'Fight' refers to a physical or verbal confrontation with the intention of defending oneself or standing up for one's beliefs, especially in the case of a disagreement or argument. It also refers to an aggressive action taken in a confrontation.\n3. 'Destroy' refers to the intentional or willful destruction of something as a form of retaliation or expression of anger.\n4.

Choices: \nA: For exercise B: Because they are lonely C: For security D: for friendship E: For a companion\nRationales: Explanation: Since the question is asking the purpose of people keeping pets, which we can deduce to mean owning and caring for pets. \nOption A: For exercise is unattractive as an answer because people often do not buy pets to exercise them.\nOption B: Because they are lonesome is similar to option D: for friendship which can be rejected on the same premise that one would more likely choose a friend to be lonely as they are more prone to sympathize and comfort.\nOption C: For security is unlikely to the nature of pets, who are not known to provide security for their owners by preventing entry of intruders.\nTherefore, the only remaining option is Option E: For a companion.\nThe main purpose for having a pet is to spend time with them and keep them company, especially if the one owning the pet is living alone. \nTherefore, the correct answer is E: For a companion, as it accurately describes the major reason people keep pets.\nAnswer: E.

{"text": "critically' is not a necessary action either. \n5. The remaining options are 'cross roads' and 'go to the store'. 'Cross road' is an action which fits the context.\n6. However, the real answer choice is 'go to the store' because the store is visible already and they can actively take a step in the process of going there, whereas if a human merely stays where they are, they will not actually get to go to the store.

Choices:  C: never D: 500 million years ago E: never\nRationales: Question: When was the last [time] you saw a group of [crabs] walking [together] in an ocean? \nStep 1: To answer, we need to identify what was seen walking together in the ocean.\nStep 2. The only possible option which makes any sense in this context is 'crabs walking together.'\nStep 3: It is hard to imagine seeing 'people walking together' in an ocean, let alone a 'group of people.'\nStep 4: The most probable option is Option E: never.\nStep 5: But if the option 'never' didn't make any sense, how can it be the correct option?\nStep 6: The correct answer is Option E: never because that is the only choice which makes sense.\nAnswer: E.

{"text": "critically' could be a valid option if the person needs to solve a problem regarding the way to get to the store.\n5. 'Cross road' makes sense as one would likely walk across the road to get to the store, which is directly visible.\n6. The question, however, is not asking what the person would do when they arrive at the store.\n7.

Choices: A: his thinking B: his tongue C: his ears D: his shoes E: his fingers\nRationales: Considering the information that's relevant to the question, there's not a lot of variety when it comes to fast responses.\nThe options for the boy, the other person, and the option of any body part that would be used to respond faster include hands, feet, ears, mouth, and head.  However, the boy from Canada was faster than another human being because he had to respond to a good point and he did.  Therefore, it's most likely that his other body parts will be of less utility and value in responding to the question. \nAs far as other words that can be used to respond faster, that would be speaking quickly or using a rushed method of response, both of which would not likely be what a smart mouth like Ms. Smart-pants would describe as 'good'.\nSo we can eliminate all but the few options we're left with.  Therefore, based on the information given, the answer would be 'D': His shoes. \nAnswer: D: His shoes\n\nInput: What does a person want to know when a tree falls at night? Choices: 1. A: It's been struck by lightning. B: It's been hit by a car. C: It fell during the day. D: It's in the way to their place. E: It's been cut down.\nRationales: The context of the options provided allows us to narrow down our answers to the most likely outcomes.\n1. 'It's been struck by Lightning' and 'It's been hit by car' are both unlikely because a person would not want to know what has fallen or the cause of a fallen tree. \n2. 'It fell during the day' is not the desired outcome as it would not be surprising or revealing, it", "answer": "B: refrigerator"}

Therefore, the answer has to be option A: Cross road.\nAnswer: A; Cross road\n\nInput: What will you not see in a building? Choices: 1. A: shadows 2. B: daylight 3. C: darkness D: night 4. E: sun 5. F: darkness\nRationales: The question asks us about the absence of any of the listed objects, not presence, in a building. This is the key to the logic behind the answer provided.\n6. Shadows happen in the absence of light in a building, hence they do not occur in a building. \n7. Likewise, daylight happens away from buildings, i.e it does not occur in buildings.\n8. Night is the absence of the day, so it does not happen in buildings either. Thus the logical approach is to eliminate these 3 options. \n9. The sun is also absent in a building, so it too can be eliminated. By logically removing all the listed objects, we are left with option F: darkness as the only remaining valid answer.\n10. A building cannot create darkness on its own.\n11. Therefore the answer is F: darkness.\nAnswer: F: darkness\n\nInput: Why does the word \"candidate\" mean \"prospective\"? Choices: 1:  A: The candidate applied for the position 2:  B: The candidate wanted his time 3:  C: The candidate applied for a test 4:  D: The candidate applied for consideration 5:  E: The candidate applied for qualification\nRationales:1. The only thing that could make sense is when the candidate applies for the position of consideration. This means the candidate applied for a trial and hence the meaning of the word changed to pro-trial.\n2. The sentence given talks about a candidate and his time. A test of a candidate cannot be time.

Choices: A: training B: people C: other dogs D: strangers E: toys\nRationales: The question asks about the specific characteristic of the dog that supports the given conclusion about his good temperament, which is that he has had good exposures to someone or something.\nOption B: \"exposure to people\" does not make any sense as there could be exposure to people without any good influence on temperament.\nOption C: \"other dogs\" could not explain the dog showing good temperament as this may indicate another issue, such as a dominance conflict.\nOption D: \"strangers\" does not explain why the dog has a good temperament because even strangers can be a good influence.\nOption E: \"toys\" is too nonspecific to provide a detailed explanation of how being exposed to toys can lead to a better temperament. \nOption A: \"training\" means training from other dogs and people which can provide both good and bad influences, again leading to a lack of clarity.\nOption B: Exposure to good human beings and other good canines are the main reasons why a dog shows good temperament.

Choices:  P1: they shouldn't think so P2: they may think so P3: they're right P4: nobody knows P5: yes\nRationales: The question asks about beliefs about whether all houses have a bad in it.\nTo answer this, we need to determine what type of beliefs the question is referring to. \nThere are generally three types of beliefs: scientific, personal, and popular. (P1: Should they believe it scientifically?)\n1) Scientific: There's a generally accepted truth or principle based on scientific evidence, observations, theories, etc (P2: Should they think that way personally?)\n2) Personal: The idea is based solely on one person's view or perspective (P3: Should they think it right?)\n3) Popular: The belief is accepted by or agreed with by most society or the masses (P4: Should they think that nobody knows?)\n4) Now that we have classified all the beliefs, we can now answer the question based on which type it is: (P5: Should they trust that it is true?)\n5) If it is scientific, then there is really no argument for or against it as it is already scientifically established. Therefore, they should trust that it is true.\n6) If it is personal though, there really is no one way to answer the question.

First, it's unclear how helpful drawings could be in telling the truth that would be written. This is not the usual method of writing, so we can eliminate this.\nFrom the remaining options, B (Draw it) is a more concrete option.

Choices: A: think and drink coffee B: study C: listen D: drink beer E: take supplements\nRationales: First, we must analyze what would enable a person to make better judgment calls, or decisions.\n\n1. A good decision comes from a balance of different perspectives, including the emotional, intellectual, and logical components. \n\n2. Option A: \"think and drink coffee\" does not provide any insight into how to make better judgment calls.\n\n3. Option B: \"study\" is good advice for increasing one's intellect and knowledge base but it does not address judgment calls.\n\n4. Option C: \"listen\" is a good suggestion for understanding the perspectives of others but again, it doesn't directly address judgment calls.\n    \n5. Option D: \"drink beer\" does not make good judgment calls easier but rather, the opposite.\n\n6. Option E: \"take supplements\" is a possible supplementary method for helping with judgment calls but ultimately, taking supplements would not lead to making a person a better decision-maker.\n\n7. Therefore, option D is the best answer, because it is the only one that doesn't work against making a person better at making judgment calls.\n\nAnswer: D: drink beer\n\nInput: Why would someone make a comment after hearing a lecture?

The person said that he/she could not even see the house on the street but it is a possibility that people could see their house. Besides, the person could be asking which way to travel to reach the house.  \n> Lastly, Option A: The answer here is yes because the question was whether the person standing on the street could see his/her house.

Choices:  car B: back C: front D: driveway E: garage\nRationales: The question implies that the person needs to leave the city to find their car which is parked somewhere in the city. Thus, they need to drive from the car to reach their appointment which is why the location is critical.  \n1. The statement \"I find my car\" indicates that they are parked in the city, not outside which contradicts the statement \"When I have an appointment and need to leave immediately\".  \n2. The location of the car is vital for their appointment since they have to drive from the car which implies there is not a way out without the car.  \n3. In most cities, a car is parked in the front or on the street, not at the back. In rare occasions, people park their cars in their backyard when they're too far (like a couple of blocks away) to walk. A single block is not far enough to justify parking the car in the back.  \n4. Considering the above and because a driveway is a common pathway to the garage, hence the garage is also a possible option.  \n5. In general, people don't park their cars in the driveway if they are going somewhere else since it will impede their path. Instead, they park them where it is convenient to access them. For example, they wouldn't park their car in their driveway and start the process of traveling back and forth from the garage.  \n6. There is the option of \"back of my home\" but that is ambiguous. The context here is the city and they don't have any intention of driving around the street once they parked their car since they need to leave immediately.  \n7.

{"text": "critically' does not make sense because critical thinking is a logical process where one assesses relevant information, forms logical conclusions, and makes decisions based on those conclusions. It does not involve action.\n5. So the only remaining two options are \"Cross road' which is the process of moving from one side of a road to the other to reach the store in your sight, and \"Use road' which means using the road to get to the store.\n6.

It doesn't say anything about multiple sets of patterns and numbers, so we can eliminate any patterns with more than six.\n3. We can also throw out any patterns that don't appear to be animal body patterns.\n4. Looking at option A: animals, we see that there are an unlimited number of animals and so the choices given simply don't make sense if we're looking for a specific species.\n5. Next, consider options B: 109876. The number of patterns is not the same as the length of the animal, therefore this cannot be the correct answer.\n6. We then consider option C: 555565. If this was the correct answer, the six-patterned animal would have to be long enough for it to create six separate patterns and only six separate patterns would create the number given. This does not make sense as the animal would have to be incredibly long, more than 50 times longer than the given number.\n7. Therefore, if the length of the animal creates six patterns, we are left with a maximum of five patterns, which means option E can'", "answer": "A: under rocks"}

Choices:  A. coffee B. soup C. tea D. toast E. cake\nRationales:The answer is E: Cake, because: 1. It isn't clear what sort of food the caller was waiting for, since they just want it to be \"made.\" 2. The coffee-making process takes time (boiling water, adding the coffee grounds, steeping to the desired strength, etc.) because of the preparation and heat involved. And by contrast, making toast or tea is a very quick process. 3. Toast is usually ready within minutes, and tea or coffee are made by boiling water. 4. Also, tea can be made from instant or teabags which is quick and easy to make so it cannot be of our coffee variety.\n5. With these eliminations, there are only two possible answers left, which are both types of cakes. 6. One more thing, toast requires toasting, and that process can take several minutes, much longer than making cakes which we already know are made within minutes. 7. Thus, we can eliminate toast from the remaining options and the only thing that fits as an item required to be made is a cake. \n8. This leaves cake as the only answer because it is the only food left, and is a reasonable assumption. \nAnswer: E: Cake", "answer": "D: connecticut"}

{"text": "critically' would not be a preferred action for getting to the store because it would be a distraction from their main objective.\n5. Similarly, 'cross road' would distract them and, in addition, there's no guarantee that the road will be safe or suitable for crossing for them.\n6. Therefore, the answer the question in this context is B: see around. It provides the required information when combined with the surrounding context in which we consider the question's meaning to be about someone going from A to B.\n7. However, the meaning of the question is not limited to the context where you answer A to B.

Choices:  B: vodka C: tea D: coffee E: soda\nRationales: First, we need to know what kind of people/group/place is being spoken about in the context given.\nIt's known that the people of Russia like to drink alcohol, so vodka is very likely to be the most common drink they prefer.\nFurthermore, the option of tea is likely too rare to be chosen as the most popular drink in this context, as it is primarily consumed in Asia.\nLikewise, coffee is too uncommon to be chosen as the top drink in such a region.\nThe option of soda is also very unlikely to be the most preferred beverage.\nTherefore, in this context, the most likely choice among the given answer options is B: vodka.\nAnswer: B vodka\n\nInput: What do the lines in the street represent?

Usually, in such contexts, the lines represent streets on which buildings are located.

'Crossing a road' is a process that is used to get to a destination when one is not able to directly see it. \n7.

E: I need you to explain how, with words, you could explain this to me?\nRationales: So the question is asking for the rationale behind the word 'explain'. In other words, the word 'explain' means to deliver clear information on the meaning or reason for something. This information is generally delivered using words. It's the explanation of the meaning of the word 'explain.\n\n1. Option A: Is incorrect because this option states that the person can't provide an explanation because he doesn't know how.

So we can eliminate \"cross the road.\" We can also eliminate \"go to the store\" because it's also unnecessary to get there.\n6. \"Cross the road\" doesn't logically answer the question because it's possible that the store is on the other side of the road, however, it's still visible, so this option can also be eliminated. \n7.

Choices:  B: coniferous C: fern D: palm tree E: tropical frog\nRationales:\n1. The question asks about a plant found in a jungle that is not found on a mountain.  \n2. The four options could all be found within a jungle but on a mountain, they would be rare if present at all. \n3. A 'coniferous' plant would have sharp needles. Even if it is a tree, it would not exist on a mountain. \n4. Plants categorized as 'fern' typically grow in a swampy habitat and are generally not found on mountains.   \n5. Plants of the 'palm' category can grow in desert and tropical areas, but not mountains.  \n6. Plants within the 'tropical frog' category typically live in warmer climates, which includes some mountains but not all.  \n7.

We need to narrow down the options by considering the context of the question.\n3. Electrical wirings and lighting systems are both kinds of wiring that we use in our homes. It makes sense that both are common between plumbings and electrical wirings.\n4. Plumbing and plastering are also common between them as they are both processes that take place during construction and renovation. In addition, both involve technical skills and require expertise.\n5.

Choices:  B: car C: lunch D: break E: rest\nRationales: This question asks us to identify the best choice for picking up an item of work. \n- First, let's look at some of the options.\n- Option B: car: A person could always use a car to pick up an item, but it's unlikely that there would be a car handy while at work. Hence, it's not a good choice.\n- Option C: lunch: This assumes that the person is at work, but is likely to still need to pick up lunch. It's also likely to be used by someone going somewhere else for lunch rather than getting an item while they are at work.\n- Option D: break: This makes the most sense out of the options provided. It's logical that a person would take a break when working and there are various items that could be picked up during a break.\n- Option E: rest: This option is not applicable to the context of work. It refers to sleeping, which is not a good time to pick up an item.\n- Therefore, the choice that makes the most sense is option D: break.\nAnswer: D. break \n\nInput: What type of fish does not need a lot of movement in water? Choices:  D: Beta fish C: Piranha E: Guppy B: Sturgeon\nRationales: The question is asking about a fish that doesn't need a lot of water movement. Looking at the options, we know that the piranha needs fast-moving water, which makes them not a good choice. The sturgeon does not need much movement but they are also too large for this task. This leaves the Beta fish and guppy which are both suitable for this task. We can find this from observation as the beta fish is a popular fish and generally kept with", "answer": "B: arrest"}

Choices: A; talk openly B; share secrets C; make good conversation D; have a good conversation E; go unnoticed\nRationales: This question is about when someone is eavesdropping and one usually will not be able to _____. \nThere are 5 options, A: talk openly, B: share secrets, C: have a good conversation, D: make good conversation, and E: to go not notice.\nAmong these 5 options only option B, not share secrets and option C: good conversation, can be done without the interference of eavesdropping.\nTherefore the correct answer is option B: no share secrets with one.\nAnswer: B : not share secrets with one \n\nInput: Which object is not found on a car? Choices: A) Back B) Brake C) Break D) Braking E) Hood/bonnet\nRationales: Here we have a question to select the option which is not found on a standard car. There are 7 options: A) Back, B) brake, C) Break, D) braking, E) hood, bonnet. All options can be found on a car in one form or another, apart from the option braking which doesn\u2019t make sense.

Choices:  B: rake and spade C: hoe D: scoop shovel E: shovels F: scoop shovels\nRationales: So, what's the best tool to dig up weeds in your backyard garden?\n1. Weeds are stubborn and tricky to eradicate, so the question is asking for the most efficient means of digging them out. \n2. Considering the options provided, it seems a hoe or a scoop shovel could work well for digging weeds. A rake is not typically used for planting or digging up plants. \n3. A spade is not a common tool used for gardens or weed digging and a scoop shovle is rarely used for digging weeds; it's usually used for excavating or demolition. \n4. A hoe and a scoop shove could be used for weed digging and are relatively common tools used in gardening and farming. \n5. A hoe (Option C) is a digging tool used for planting and weeding that has a long handle and a curved blade, typically made of steel or aluminum. A hoe resembles a spade but is angled at a different position and used for cutting and removing soil rather than mixing it. If weeds exist in your garden, a hoe will help dig them out to destroy their growth. \n6. A scoop shovel (Option F) is designed to be used with a backhoe loader or to assist as part of an excavation; it's not a gardening tool. \n7. There are a few ways that would dig a weed out of your garden quickly. And it's possible to combine these methods to get rid of weeds permanently, making them less likely to reappears, such as pulling out weeds and keeping the soil fertile to deter new growth. \n8. In the end, the best option is the one which is most familiar", "answer": "D: outside"}

We are given a choice of creatures living in the forest. The king could be one of them.\n3. \"Hedgehog\" and \"Weasel\" both have small bodies and live in burrows; thus not forest kings as they do not live outdoors.\n4. \"Beaver\" also lives in burrows, so it is ruled out.\n5. \"Badger,\" \"Zebra,\" and \"Lion\" are carnivores who are not vegetarian. They are not forests kings.\n6. \"Grizzly bear\" and \"Bear\" are both large carnivores, making them not a king of the forest.\n7. \"Birds\" and \"Reptiles\" are not forest creatures.\n8. \"Alligator\" lives in saltwater and lives in different habitats than the forest.\n9. \"J\" and \"K\" cannot be a king because of the lack of an animal in that position.\n10. \"I\" is the only remaining position for a king.

Choices:  a. get a snake, b. talk, c. touch, d. be quiet, e. move\nRationales: The question states that a human can help a mouse be relax by doing one of the following: \"get a snake, talk, touch, be quiet, or move\". \n\n* \"Get a snake\" is irrelevant to the context of helping a mouse relax, as snakes are generally predatory animals and are not likely to be a comforting presence to a mouse. Similarly, \"talk\" doesn't relate to helping a mouse relax, nor does \"be quiet\" since mice are noisy creatures. Finally, \"move\" means to physically change your place in the environment, but a mouse might be relaxed if they were in a place that brought them comfort instead of merely changing their surroundings. \n\n* The remaining answer is \"Touch\" as the verb \"to touch\" indicates physical contact and can create a connection between two conscious beings. Mice are sensitive creatures and sensitive beings do not like sudden loud noises and/or being handled roughly, so to help a mouse relax, the touching action should only be done gently.\nAnswer: a. get a sssnake, b. talk/be quiet/move, c. touch\n\n### Instuqtion:Select the best multiple choice answer.\n\n### Exercise:\nTo select the best multiple choice response, answer all the statements in accordance with the following directions.\nInput: \"That's what she said\" is a sneery comment used to _________.\nRationales: Options provided: insult, tease a person, encourage them, tell them off.\n\n1.

'Cross the road' would make sense if the store was across the road, but it is implied that it is not, as they could simply walk there.\n6. Therefore, it would seem that the correct answer is D: dream dreams. However, we can eliminate this option through the same reasoning process that eliminated options B, C, and E because it is too vague.\n7. Also, option D contains two separate verbs in the same sentence - \"dream of dreams\" and this is grammatically incorrect.\n8.

In the 2017 Housing insecurity report, the survey report stated that more than a quarter of the Los Angeles County population were homeless. In addition, LA has the largest unsheltered homeless population in the country, amounting to nearly 9,200. \nThere are also several agencies that provide help and services to people who are homeless.

In general, clouds are too high to be seen clearly by people on the ground. There is no indication that these clouds are large enough to be of interest to the child.\n\n6.Option B - people? This is an interesting option to consider, but there is no information suggesting the child knows anyone nearby or anything about this person to understand them fully.\n\n5. Option C - cows? Looking at these, they are definitely something of interest to a wandering child and the wording gives the impression that the child can easily see nearby cows.\n\n4.

{"text": "critically' here refers to an attempt to work out how to get through the obstacle, such as a road.\n5. But for the question to be answered properly, we need to determine if there is any obstacle in the person's path. \n6. Looking at the given options, we can quickly eliminate option A: cross road as there is no explicit obstacle.\n7. The only option left that offers potential obstruction would be option B: see around.\n8. However, option B is not the only possibility to reach a destination of the individual's choice.\n9.

Choices: 1: A: 10:15 B: 10:00 C: 10:30 D: 9:30 E: 9:45\nRationale: 1. When we are given a question that requires identifying the time of a single event or sequence of actions, we look for what the author specified as the time of relevance.\n2. Looking at the options, we can quickly discard options D: 9:44 and E: 9:39 - these are not the time of relevance but before and after the relevant time respectively.\n3. Next, we need to determine what is before the specified time since the context specifies a past event. \n4. Options A: 10.15 and B: 10.00 are both not before the specified time as they would occur after 9:45.\n5. Next, let's examine what options remain: \n6. Option C: 10.30 is the most likely option if we remove the given number 9:45 and assume something would happen after it.\n7. Therefore, C: 10 minutes and 30 seconds after 9:49 is the correct answer.\nAnswer: C (10 minutes and 20 seconds)\n\nInput: As a hunter, the bull elk is pursuing what?

{"text": "critically' is not a direct action or a course of action, it can also be considered an inefficient choice as it's not possible to think critically before physically reaching the store.\n5. 'Cross road' is also inefficient as it doesn't immediately allow someone to cross the road to the store they can see but has to cross other roads first. This could take more time and add additional distance that the other answer choice does not require.\n6.

Choices: A: stage set in a town B: the show has ended C: the stage is a place D: the stage is ready E: the stage is big F: the world is small\nRationales: Stage 7. The phrase \"the world is a stage\" means that the world is a setting for performances and production. \n8. In terms of the context of the quote from Shakespeare, the use of the phrase suggests that people or individuals can be compared with different types of actors on a stage, each playing a unique role in their own part of the world. \n9.

They will be called upon for any emergencies that come up C. It is a job D. He is paid by the city\nRationales: Firefighters are hired by a city or local government to protect the property and community from any fire or fire hazards that could occur. \n2. Therefore, a firefighter will be outside of a building to inspect it for any potential hazards and to prevent any fires from occurring, regardless of whether someone is on fire or not.\n3. Additionally, it's not uncommon for firefighters to respond to non-fire issues as well, as they are there to respond to emergencies and be prepared to deal with any hazard they may encounter.\n4.", "answer": "A: attached"}

Choices:  a: right hand c. left hand d: the eye on one's thigh e: the right side b: the left side\nRationales: First, consider all the options given.\n1. \"Right hand\" is unlikely to be the answer because most people are right-handed and they can still be creative on their left side.\n2. \"Left hand\" is out of consideration because it's the same as the right hand.\n3. \"The eye on one's the thigh\" is also unlikely to be the answer since it doesn't make sense to have a creative eye on one's side, and it's implied that they're trying to reach the eye or at least see it, making it a less sensible answer.\n4. \"The right side\" seems to be the answer that makes more sense. One way to test whether it's the answer is to consider if it is the same as \"right hand.\" If it is, then it may be the answer. If it isn't, it must be rejected. So, let's compare it. 4b: Same as A: Right hand. Rejected!\n5. Option B: Same as C: Left hand. Okay, this answer may or may not be the answer, so we must examine its possible options.\n4b: Same as B: Left hand\n\n6. Option D is rejected because it doesn't make any sense because the creative side of the brain is located in the frontal lobe which has nothing to do with any part of the body.\n7. Option \"The eye on one\u2019s thigh\" is rejected because it doesn\u2019t make any sense and isn\u2019t even creative, so there must only be two answers.\n8. Option E is rejected because it doesn\"t make sense if one\"s \"hand on one's thight\" is creative,", "answer": "B: insignificant"}

Bullfighting - not something associated with a cowboy, but with bulls\n3. Choreography - not really associated with a typical cowboys life\n4. Rodeo roping - yes, there are rodeos in the western, but only by the \"rodeo riders\" - not exactly cowboys. And if there's a particular rodeo, there are typically competitors to compete, which is not something associated with cowboys, but with competitors, who likely have no connection to the western or the cowboys as people.\n5.

Choices:  A) when it is done B) when it is done the right way C) while I'm at a party D) when I'm in the office E) when I sit on the toilet\nRationales: The question asks when work is not considered work. Work can be anything that one does regularly or repeatedly to make a living or to make an income.\n1. Work cannot be done at a party, implying it's definitely not work when a person is attending a party. \n2. Working in the office does not automatically mean a person is not working. The answer must be an action that explicitly stops a person from doing work.\n3. Since we are looking for an action when work is not considered as work, the answer would be when I'm in office, as doing work in office is a part of my job. \n4. It is implied that the office is a place where someone has to work, but since it is a job, working in this environment is work. \n5.

Choices: 1: a fanny pack 2: a wallet 3: a cell phone 4: a bag 5: a beer bottle 6: his keys 7: a book 8: a hat\nRationales: The question is asking for an unusual thing that a guy could carry on the outside (or exterior of) his shirt. Considering the options given, we know that our unusual thing must be a noun of a type that a guy might carry on his shirt and that it is unlikely to be a normal thing that any guy would carry with him at any time.\nThe first option given in the options is a fanny pack, which although is not an unusual thing to carry on a shirt, it is a thing that a man (guy) would usually carry. Therefore, it is eliminated.\nThe second option given in the options, a wallet, is also not a very unusual thing that a man (i.e. guy) would usually carry around and also is not a thing you would usually carry on the exterior of your shirt. Therefore, this is also eliminated as well.\nSimilarly, the third option given is a cell phone, which is not a thing a man (guy), carries around much, and it is usually placed inside the pocket or in a bag and is certainly not something you would think to wear on the outside of your shirt. The same can be said of the fourth option, a bag, which is not usually carried on the exterior of your clothing. And similarly to cell phones, we can also eliminate bags from consideration due to the fact that most do not have pockets for carrying things such as a cell phone that you would want to wear outside of your shirt!\nThe fifth option is a beer bottle, which could possibly serve as a useful option but since the question only says 'a guy', the kind of 'guy' it is referring to wouldn't likely be the drinking kind, or wearing a beer bottle around his shirt", "answer": "A: liquidated"}

It is a possible job role for someone who speaks both languages, but it would be unlikely for a school or a business to require that of a particular teacher. \n- Option B - a person who translates or interprets between two languages is not required to speak both Japanese and Japanese. \n- Option C - a person who is a friend of foreigners needs to be able to converse with the people they are friends with, and there is no reason why this role would be restricted to speaking only one language. \n- Options D and E are a 'yes and' for the correct answers. \nFrom the above eliminations, we have 2 options left, teacher & translator. \nTherefore, the correct answer is B: translator\n\n\n### Credits:\n\nThe content presented in this repository has been inspired and influenced by a variety of different sources and materials.

Choices: 1. a fence 2. a gate 3. a bicyclist 4. a child 5. the police 6. a horse 7. traffic \nRationales: What would have prevented an old person from running? Considering the location, we can eliminate options that don't make sense, such as the fence, gate, horse and bicyclist since they are not usually seen in a local neighborhood.\nRationales: A young and fast cyclist would be able to get around this person. If the old person was crossing the street, the car would be the likely culprit.\nAnswer: Police \n\nInput: What isn't necessary at the end of the day? Choices: \n1. sleep 2. food 3. a car 4. an alarm 5. a mirror 6. a shower 7. chocolate 8. exercise 9. a dog\nRationales: Considering the choice \"chocolate, a dog, exercise\" is irrelevant. Therefore, let's eliminate all those choices. Now let's consider how we can answer the question without using the word \"day.\" What could be necessary at the end of a particular activity that would not be necessary at the end?\nRationales: Answer to the question after the word \"day\" has been eliminated. So answer the question without that phrase: at the end of the shower, a dog would be unnecessary.\nAnswer: dog\n\nInput: What did the man have when he took the walk?

Therefore, A: cross road is the answer.\nAnswer: A cross road\n\nInput: A person with a broken arm can't use their ____________________. Choices:  A. back B. elbow C. fingers D. ankles E. wrist\nRationales:\n1. To understand the meaning of the question, we must determine what is being asked.\n2. The answer, \"use their ____________\" requires knowledge of the context in which the question was asked. \n3. We will first eliminate options by considering possible contexts.\n4. Option A: back. The person with a broken arm cannot use their back because the question specifically excludes the use of the back, which implies it would be an option otherwise. There is no back-related activity that can't be done when one has a broken arm. The person in question can't use their back for these activities because of their broken arm but can't do other back-related activities.\n5. Option B: elbow. The question implies that \"a person with a broken arm\" cannot use their arm or body parts, regardless of function.\n6. Additionally, the question specifically \"can't use\" rather than \"cannot use,\" which would refer to the inability to use a broken arm for a particular purpose. \n7. Option C: fingers. The person with a \"broken arm\" cannot use their fingers in a way that would break their arm.\n8. Option D: ankles. The person with a ''broken arm\" cannot stand on their ankles. This activity is ruled out. \n9. Option E: wrist. Since a person with a \"broked arm\" can't use their fingers to hurt themselves but they can use their wrist to hurt themselves, wrists are excluded.\n10. Therefore, the options that can't be used are: back, elbow and wrists.\n11. Option B: elbows is the correct answer.\nAnswer: B. elbows\n\nInput: There was", "answer": "C: plain"}
{"text": "critically' does not apply, because the store is visible, so there is no need to think in a certain way to get there.\n5. The store may also be on the opposite side of the road, and so getting to the store may require crossing the road. \n6. Although 'crossing road' is the correct answer for this question, it's important to remember: We need to look at all options listed in the question. \n7. Once we have eliminated all incorrect options, the remaining choices will all be plausible answers. \n8. The store is directly in a human's sight, so they would do what is most obvious and simply cross the road to get there.\nAnswer: A, B, C, D, E: Cross Road\n\nInput: How would you get up in a house which had stairs?

{"text": "critically' could imply strategizing an approach, but it is not necessary for simply being visible to the store.\n5. The phrase 'cross road' is a metaphor for traversing from one point to another, while the question asks about getting to a store that is visible to them, thus this is not relevant either. \n6. Therefore, the correct response should be A:'see around'. \nAnswer: A: see around\n\nInput: A turtle was walking at a leisurely pace on its back, it was doing what? Choices: A: eating B: swimming C: lying down D: walking E: climbing\nRationales: First, we determine what type of activity the turtle was doing while it was walking. \n2. Looking at the options, we need to identify which activity makes the most sense in the context given.\n3. To help with narrowing the options, consider what the turtle was not doing when it was walking. 4. \"Laying down\" does not make sense in the context of a turtle because it has a shell that is too heavy to carry and is more likely to walk on its back. \n5. \"Swimming\" does not make sense either - turtles do not swim in the wild but prefer the shallow waters of lakes and ponds, and they also do not lie down. \n6. \"Eating\" does not make sense for something that is already walking on its back. 7. Finally, \"Climbing\" can rule out as it does not describe an activity that a turtle can do while walking at a leisured pace. \n8. Thus, we have identified that: Turtles walk at leisurely pace, they do not swim, lay down or climb. \n9. Therefore, the only remaining option is \"eating\" as turtles can eat while walking. \n10. So the answer lies with eating as a turtle should be doing in a leisurely manner.\nAnswer: C: eating\n\nInput: In what way would a witch use the cat to tell time?

{"text": "critically' can be the correct answer. However, if the human already knows and understands the process to get to the store, 'think critically' is not necessary.\n5. This is because 'thinking critically' is a term used to describe the process of evaluating an idea, and if the human already knows the process, there is no need for critical thinking.\n6. Hence, the correct answer is C: see around.\n\nInput: What were you doing when you saw that there is no answer? Choices:  C: sleeping at home B: eating food D: listening to music E: chatting with mom\nRationales: It is clear from the question that the answer should be'sleeping at home'. Hence, the answer is B.\n\nInput: To whom did we say you were speaking when you asked your friend? Choices:  D: that guy B: any person C: you E: this\nRationales: The question asks to give the name of the person that we said we were speaking to our friend.\n\nInput: Where would I find you after you have bought something? Choices:  B: the bank C: the store D: the church E: my house\nRationales: Here the choice is between 'the bank', 'the store', 'the church', and'my house'.\n\nInput: Where did you find a lot of people? Choices:  E: school B: university C: a place full of people D: a large concert\nRationales: Among the choices, 'a lot of people' refers to many people. 'E: a school'. A school is a place for many people to educate themselves on a variety of subjects and topics. 'B: the university'. Here again, many people go to universities to educate themselves on many different topics. 'C: a place full of many people'. Here 'place full of people' refers to a place where many people congregate. So the answer here is 'E: a school' or 'B: university'  or 'C: a place of many people'. \n\nInput: How often did he go fishing after his friends?

Choices:  AH: difficult  AF: simple  EG: easy  CF: fun  BH: hard\nRationales: In order to know if the sentence is correct, we must exclude options that are not fitting to the quiz. The word 'quiz' already suggests that the test/quiz can be a type of exam. This indicates that the test/quizzes difficulty level can be measured by its test subject (the student).\n\nInput: If you want to buy an item, you have to know its _____.

A car is an example of what type of vehicle? Choices:  B: bicycle C: dog D: airplane E: car\nRationales: The question is asking for the type of vehicle described in the context. The given choices are: bicycle, airplane, dog, car and a car. \n1. Considering the context, \"car\" is the most obvious answer as the question states that it was barking at a car.\n2. Therefore, among the remaining choices, the answer is b.\nAnswer: B. car\n\nInput: What does a boy have to do if he wants to get to a basketball game that is being played? Choices:  C: go to the arena and watch B: have fun D: pay for the tickets E: get a ride to the arena\nRationales: Considering the given context, 'to get to a basketball game', a logical first thought would be to go to the arena. Therefore, that is the natural choice. \n2. Considering that we've already gone through the answer as C, further options that can be looked through are; 'have fun', which would be necessary for watching a basketball game but not necessary to get to the game.\n3. 'Pay for the tickets' are irrelevant to playing a basketball game, instead, they're tied to buying tickets which is a different task.\n4. 'Get a ride to the arcade' could be the answer if the arbitral is a reference to a car ride, but it could easily apply to getting a lift on bicycle, horse, car, etc.\n5. 'Having fun' isn't something a child could be expected to do before the game begins, although if the game is not a match, it could be seen as playing the game with the basketball itself.\n6. Therefore, the answer would be that the boy needs to do all the things other than the one already mentioned.", "answer": "B: play sports"}

Choices:  a book shop b library c museum D the shelf e none\nRationales:  1. Looking at the choices, we see that the options are all related to books and reading.\n2. \"None\" does not make sense because a man is looking for a specific book about a specific man, so it is unlikely that there would be no book with that title in either a library or a museum.\n3. A \"book shop\" or a \"library\" could hold a title of that book, as could a \"museum,\" for example if the man's idea was related to art, history, or anything else in the museum's exhibits.\n4. \"The shelf\" could hold the book, but does not make sense as a destination since the man is searching for a book. \n5. Since we can dismiss all non-books and narrow our options to books, we can eliminate \"none\" and conclude that \"a book shop\" (library) or \"a museum\" (the shelf) are the remaining options. Since we only need to find a book, \"a museum\" does not make sense, leaving us with the remaining option being \"a book shop.\"\nAnswer: A: book shop\n\nInput: What are people that need to see do?

The question tells us this and the answer that we're given is 3) \"need to get the surgery.\" \nChoices 3) and 4) are not possible, because people that need to see can't ask for help and can't use their contacts.\nAnswer: 3) \"need a surgery.\"\n\nInput: What does the title of \"The Cat in the Hat\" refer to?

{"text": "critically' can be achieved in many ways, some of which may involve looking in a certain direction, but it's not necessary to do so, as they can think critically while doing something else. \n5. 'Cross road' makes sense as you would have to cross roads or streets to get to the store.\n6. The store can be accessed directly via walking or driving, so 'driving' does not fit as it's not required to get to the store even if it's only a 2-minute drive away.\n7. In the context of the question, 'walking' makes sense as it seems to be the logical, non-critical choice one must take in order to get to the store they see.\n8.

{"text": "critically' does not make sense because the question is asking about the actions you take to reach the store; 'thinking' does not require you to'reach' anything.\n5. 'Cross road' is not necessary because the store must be within the person\u2019s vision, so there is no need to cross any streets. \n6. Hence, the answer is A'Cross road'. You would cross the road as the store is right ahead of you.\nAnswer: A'Cross road\n\nInput: When does a person feel happy? Choices: 1. A: alone 2. B: when they have completed a task 3. C. Eating lunch 4. D: if there is no work 5. E: being busy with work\nRationales: The question can be broken into two parts that are related to each other, and the second part of the question gives the context or the reason for being happy.\n3. The best option for the second part of the reasoning is \"When does a person feel happy\" because a person feels happy when lunch is finished and they are free to enjoy being busy with their work.\n4. We can eliminate the first part of the reasoning because the context in the second part already gives us enough information to infer what makes people happy. \n5. The last part of the question gives us the context which helps us understand why people are happy and which option describes the context well.\nAnswer: E\n\nInput: Why would the plumber try to fix that broken water line?

We can see that the water line has broken and the water is leaking. This means that the water line has to be fixed to prevent any further damage and potential harm. \nAnswer: A: the water might not be leaking, the plumber might be not need B: the plumber could be hungry\n\nInput: What should a homework checker do on a sheet?

{"text": "critically' is a reasonable question but perhaps doesn't directly answer the question.\n5. There are two possible options left after eliminations:\n\na. 'Crossroad'. A crossroad is a place where roads meet and traffic passes through. This may be close to a store, but it doesn't necessarily mean they would get to the store directly from the crossroads. \n6. 'Go around'. If the store was too far for them to get to and they wanted to get there directly from their starting point, they would need to go around the structure - such as going through a mall or an apartment complex, not just through one road intersection to the store. \n7. The answer is E: Go around. The two options that make sense are 'Crossroad' and 'Go around'.\n\nInput: Some people go outside in clothes that aren't from this century, they're old in what way? Choices:  B: fashion A: design E: new E: style C: unique D: dated\nRationales: By the meaning and context of \"century\", the options are not likely the answer as centuries are not fashion styles. \n\n1. Option B \"fashion\". Fashion is a style of clothing which may change over time, not \"from this century\". \n2. Option A \"design\". \n3. Option C \"unique\". \n4. Option D \"dated\". \n5.

Choices:  C: ladders A: busses B: trucks E: helicopter D: ziplines\nRationales: The word \"more\" implies that the city already has public transportation, hence the question is about how they can make the public transportation more effective.\n1. Answer C: ladders is incorrect because the city already has public trams that are enough for the city's purposes.\n2. Choice A: the buses are already an effective and well-developed form of public transportation which the city will not consider making more effective.\n3. Choice B: trucks are also not effective as these are privately-owned not public transports developed by the local governments meant to serve all the city's population.\n4. Choice D: ziplining doesn't make much sense since the question has no mention of transportation via zipline.\nThis leaves us with C & E: ladders and helicopters.\n5. Helicopters already exist in the city so the city should consider making ladders more effective like making them cheaper or safer.\nAnswer: C and E: ladders\n\nInput: It had to be dark to catch a frog fishing. The fish were swimming in what water? Choices:  B: light C: ocean D: lake E: pond\nRationales: Let's look into each option to determine the correct answer.\n1. The word \"catch\" is indicative of hunting, so the frog must be hunting the fish. We can eliminate B: light since, obviously, the environment would not be dark for fishing at night. Although A: ocean may seem like one of the possible environments for night-time fishing, we can eliminate it since hunting takes place at night whereas fishing is likely to be done throughout the day and in various environments.\n2.

Choices:  A. bird B. prey C. bird of prey D. insect E. predator\nRationales: First we examine the options to find what does not apply.\n1. \"Bird\" is not a specific type of bird and does not answer the question.\n2. \"Prey\" is not a specific bird and does not answer this question.\n3. \"Bird of prey\" is a sub-category of birds which may be predatory animals that catch and occasionally eat birds.\n4. \"Insect\" is not a specific species of bird, and only applies to certain groups of birds such as grasshopper birds that specifically eat insects.\n5. \"Predator\" is a type of animal that hunts smaller animals for food, so it probably is not an appropriate choice based on the question. 6. The answer of choice must be \"C\", which is a bird of prey. \"C\" is the most specific type of bird that fits the description of \"an eagle\". 7. \"D\" and \"E\" are not the correct answer as they don't describe the bird.\nAnswer: C.

They got into an argument with each other, making her wonder about their comprehension. 6. They asked her to explain further.\nRationales:1. In order to decide the answer to this question, a comprehensive understanding of the question is necessary.\n2. Looking at each choice provided, the first does not make sense as the teacher would not be able to verify if the students truly understood without asking them directly.\n3. The third choice is not consistent with the question as it's not part of the teacher's usual practice and her asking students to explain further does not provide any information on how to gauge their understanding.\n4. The forth one is not a logical choice since it is unlikely that students would be disrespectful and thus not pay attention even if they disagree with the lesson.\n5. The fifth one is not feasible due to the incompatibility between students' interest and comprehension.\n6.

True B. False\nRationales: This is a simple statement of fact that does not require any critical thinking.\nTherefore, the answer is A. True.\nInput: The first word people look at in ads is the company logo Choices:  A) true B) false\nRationales: The prompt asks whether people look at company logos in ads first.\nThe prompt does not ask whether one should look at company logos first in ads.\nTherefore, whether one looks at company logos first or last in ads is irrelevant to whether one is more likely to look at the company logos first.\nTherefore, answer B must be correct.\n\nInput: This means if you make a phone call, the other person is already aware. Choices:  A.) true B.) false\nRationales The prompt asks for the definitive meaning of the statement 'If you make a phone call..the other person is already aware.'\nThe first option 'The other person is already aware' is the exact same as the option 'the other person is already talking.'\nSince the statement 'If you made a phone call..' doesn't include the condition 'The other person is not already talking.' Then the meaning of the statement is incorrect.\nTherefore, choice B must be correct. \n\nInput: 123 is an even number. Choices: A) true B)false\nRationales The word 'even' has a specific mathematical definition that is different from the 'even' in a sentence. 'Even' is a noun. Even 123 is not a noun.

{"text": "critically' requires thinking more than just about getting to a store which is immediately visible to them.\n5. 'Cross the road' would require them to walk or drive further away from their desired store in order to cross the road, so this action would not logically lead them toward the store.\n6. Therefore, the answer must be either 'A: cross road' or 'E: see around.' \n7. Considering option 'A: cross road,' it is the most logical choice because it makes sense to cross a road when one's desired store is directly across from it. It is also easy to do and could get them to the desired store quickly.\n8. Therefore the answer is 'Cross the road.'\nAnswer: C: cross road\n\nInput: A group of students asked him to take more time off to study for midterms. He would lose the ability to do what? Choices: A: play football B: exercise C: read books D: work harder E: rest F: watch television\nRationales: Considering the phrasing in the question, one can infer that the student would lose the ability to rest and relax. It's unlikely he would lose the ability to play a sport, read books, or work harder, thus options A, B, and C should be eliminated. \n\nSince students asked to take time off to study, it seems more likely that that student would lose the ability do nothing rather than lose the ability to exercise, watch TV, etc.\n8. It may also be assumed that the midterms wouldn't be the only reason he was asked to take more time off so the other options E, F, D are discarded as unlikely.\n9.

This isn't the case, so this option should be deemed as irrelevant to the scenario.\n6. We are left with only one option which is \"go to store\".

Choices:  ABCDEFGH: A: ABCDEFGH B: ABGCDEHF C: ACGDEHF D: ABCDJHF E: ACJDFHG\nRationales 1. The word has two vowals, which is the pronounced sound of a particular vowel and can be identified by the short \"a\" in \"toad.\"\n2. Look at the first option, \"ABCDEFGH.\" We get three vowels in this word, so this is not a correct option.\n3. \"ABGCDEHF,\" on the other hand, would have three, if we include the \"y\" in \"hundreds\" as a vowel. This is still not correct as this has two vowels, a vowel in the middle and another at the end.\n4. The same can be done for \"ACGDEHF,\" which also has an \"s\" at the end, making this an incorrect choice as it has two vowels. This leaves us with just \"ABCDJHF\" which contains two vowels.\n5. Thus, the answer is \"ABCDJH,\" which consists of two vowels - the \"B\" and \"D\" in the word \"ABCDJH.\"\nAnswer: ABCDJH\n\nInput: Can two people be in possession of the same object?

Aisles are typically long, continuous rows of items lining shelves or other surfaces within a store. This means an aisle begins at one end of the store and ends at the other, with no clear stopping point in the middle of the store.\n2. Aisles are referred to as such, even if they are no longer straight, or continue beyond what would traditionally be considered an \"end.\" So option B is incorrect.\n3.

{"text": "critically' could be related to finding a way to get to the store or may simply mean thinking about the store. However, it does not explicitly say that the person wants to get to the store, so this option could be ruled out. \n5. 'Cross road' also implies that the person was attempting to get to the store but was prevented from doing so. Crossing a road is different from simply being able to see a store. Because of this, it is also not a good answer choice.\n6. However, 'Cross road' does work well as an answer choice for the question \"What is the first thing a human would do if he can't see the store, and sees people crossing a road, he or she would then want to cross the road too.\"\n7. Therefore, \"Cross road\" must be considered a correct answer because of the potential of the additional context. \n8. But at the same time, the additional context could still exclude this answer, because without seeing the store, the human was still prevented from getting to it, whereas the road crossing was only completed AFTER the original obstacle of not being able to see the store had been overcome, potentially meaning 'he or she would then want' was actually 'then they could want' meaning that 'Cross road' is not suitable as an answer. \n9. Because one might see or be able to see a store without having to get to the store first. \n10.

Choices:  C: Wizard's Council of Magicians B: Council of Magicians C: Circle of Witches and Wizards D: Circle of Witch Council B: Wizard's Circle of Council E: Circle of Criminals\nRationales: The question provides context by revealing that there's a Council of Magicians and a Circle of Witch and Wizards. It also tells us that the old witch is a part of the Circle of Witches & Wizards. (It doesn't say which she's a part of.)\n\n1. The Circle of Witches doesn't have a Council.\n2. Therefore, she must be a part of the Circle rather than the Council.\n3. Based on the description, the Circle of Witch Council might be the group she belongs to.\n4. Even though 'Circle of Witch Council' isn't given as an option, it is the most likely to be the right answer.\n5. It is likely, given the context of 'Wizard's Councils of Magicians', that 'Wizard Council' will include magicians. \n6. Given the description of 'Wizard Circle of Council', it is more likely that 'Wizard' will include members of that council who are Witches and Wizard. \n7.

It is more commonly used for holding and/or transferring substances such as water or oil.\n4. Option D: \u2018An airbag\u2019 is a good choice because an airbag is used to absorb shock during collisions, resulting in the airbag inflating as the person inside absorbs the shock of the collision. \nHowever, the question does not specify that the airbag would be used to catch air rather than absorb impact, so this can be eliminated. \n5.

Choices:  Wear a costume A: be excited B: use humor C: play a joke D: have a good attitude E: entertain people\nRationales: The question is asking if it's possible to have a good time at an empty party and it's asking about your personality, not about how to be entertained. \nThe options given are \"use humor\", \"play a joke\" and \"entertain people\". \n\"Use humor\" and \"play a joke' are both things you can do at a party, but both are things that can be done in an empty party or in the presence of people. \nHence. we can eliminate \"use humor\" and \"play the joke\". \nHumor and entertainment are only for your own benefit and do not guarantee a good time. \nFinally, \"have a good attitude\" is also just for your own benefit and does not guarantee you have a good time.  So, the answer is \"E: entertain people\", which means you need to entertain yourself.\n\nAnswer: E: entertain people\n\nInput: Why did the zebra go to the forest? Choices:  To see a horse. A: Because she is a zebra and a horse is a mammal B: Because she likes it there. C: Because she was hungry. D: She had never been there before E: She was lost in the woods.\nRationales: A: Choices that have no reason for the zebra to make that decision are ignored in this process. \nBecause, the zebra being a mammal does not make sense because mammals are found all over the world which means the zebra had the chance to meet all kinds of mammals in the entire world besides horses. \nOn the other hand, it does not make sense for the zebra not to be able to see a horse because animals come together in the most natural way. \nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nAnswer: D: She was hungry.", "answer": "B: louisiana"}

The man whose life isn't perfect, and as per the option, had sleep related issues, not dream related issues. Also, the word \"good\" would be antonymous to \"bad\", \"good\" would always be the answer.

{"text": "critically' and 'cross road' are both possible suggestions, but the first might be slightly more applicable.\n5. Together, the two options help us to eliminate the other options. 'Think critcially' and 'cross road', combined, indicate that the human should make a logical attempt to get to the store.\n6. Therefore, since these indicate thinking and decision making while also indicating a 'crossing' of some sort, this eliminates all other options. \n7. The answer is, D: make a decision. \nAnswer: D: make a decision\n\nInput: What can I do to be more productive? Choices:  B: take a nap C: take a break D: work nonstop E: try harder\nRationales: This question can be answered by thinking about how to be more productive.\n1. A \"nap\" would provide short-term relief but would not necessarily increase productivity in the long term.\n2. A \"break\" might help to improve productivity, but the question is asking about a long-term solution.\n3. 'Work nonstop' would lead to increased stress and fatigue and reduce overall productivity.\n4. 'Try harder' would also lead to increased stress and might reduce productivity if the person exhausts themselves.\n5. There's nothing wrong with \"trying harder\" but since the question is asking for a more sustainable method for improved productivity, working non-stop is not the ideal solution.\n6. The only clear-cut option among the choices that does not decrease productivity is a 'break', where one would be taking a quick break from work or their endeavors.\n7.

A: player B: player who loses C: the referee D: the referee and the player who loses E: Both players\nRationales:1. All players are potential winners for the match. \n2. There is no winning condition. \n3. A player who loses is simply one who loses. \n4. The referee does not have the ability to be a winner. \n5. The player and the referee do not \"win\" in any sense.

Canaries: are small songbirds originating from the Canary Islands. True Canaries do exist in the wild, and are found primarily in and around the islands;\n3. Seagulls: are marine birds that are found in coastal areas around the world;\n4. Eagles: are raptors identified by two key characteristics - large bodies with relatively small heads, and heavy bills and talons.\n5.

The kids have woken up and they're looking for their mom and dad. Where could they look? Choices:  The tour guide\nA: The bathroom  B: in an old, broken museum\nC: outside in a garden\nD: in a room where they left\nE: the resting spot\nRationales:  1. The family is visiting a historic site. The question is asking where the kids can look for their parent.\n2. They can look in the room they left, but this answer is not specific to the question and is not an option to choose.\n3. The garden is a separate area from the historic site. It is possible the kids will find their parents there, but it is not the best answer because the question specifically mentions them visiting a historic site and looking for their parents there.\n4. They may find their parents in an old, broken, museum because the museum also refers to a historic site.\n5. The bathroom is unlikely to be located in the historic site, and it is not an area they would search for their parents in. Therefore, option C: in a museum is the correct answer.\nAnswer: C: in a museum\n\nInput: What does a person feel as they run downhill?

Options: \"A\" \"B\" \"D\" and \"E\" are answers that indicate action (verbs), meaning, they can't always be considered true. However, action can be negated using \"not\" e.g. a \"not cat\" means to not be a cat or not be a cat. In this case, we are referring to a dog which we can call in a neutral or positive manner (e.g. cat is positive and dog is neutral) but we're referring to a dog so in this case, we can assume the cat is negative (since it's a cat) and not call it a dog with the positive \"not\" e. g. \"Not dog\" means: positive cat neutral dog. Option A) is therefore incorrect, and can be ruled out.\nOption B) is true (a cat doesn't lie), Option D) is true and the cat doesn't have to \"sleep\" (it's awake).\nOption E) refers to sitting and not lying in the context, and the question asks \"What doesn't the cat LIKE (not what doesn't it do)\" so \"E\" doesn't explain the cat's choice of not liking lying which can be the choice.\nOption C) is true in the context because \"to lie\" means to make a false statement, but \"lay down\" doesn't make a \"false statement\".\n\nAnswer: C) Option A is incorrect as we are asked the cat's choice", "answer": "A: suitcase"}

{"text": "critically' is not necessary or required to physically reach the store. \n5.

Choices: \tA: late night B: day C: midday D: during the rain E: even later\nRationales:  1. First, we must consider what day of the week may be given this particular context.\n2. The question refers to a cowboy, which is someone who works in a rural setting.\n3. It makes sense that a cowboy may be outside, working in the sun on a day that's sunny, hot and dry.\n4. The remaining options presented only fit in a certain type of weather.\n5. For example, \"Even later\" (option E) is only applicable during a time after the sun's set.\n6. In a desert environment, it's possible that the sun may set earlier than at other locations, but in general it's unlikely to set after midnight in a desert.\n7. \"Day\" (option A) would be sunny if it's a weekday during the day. However, it can be difficult to work in the sun on a weekday during the heat of the day because of the harsh temperature. Therefore, this answer is not accurate.\n8. \"Late night\" (option B), is during the time when the sun has already set. This is consistent with a sunny weather setting.\n9. \"Midday\" (option C), occurs during the hottest time of the day. Sunny weather does not fit the context because the context is not about working in the sun, but rather working outside for some time in the sun.\n10. For the remaining answer \"During the rain\" (option D), a cowboy might work outside in the rain, but it's not specified in the context. And rain would interfere with their ability to perform work outside.\n11. Therefore, the only option that fits the context is B: midday. \nAnswer: B: midday", "answer": "A: seaside town"}
{"text": "critically' could be an option as it is an ability that helps us plan and find paths.\n5. 'Cross roads' could work but the question does not specify any kind of road.\n6. So the best answer choice is 'See' or 'See around'.\nAnswer: E: think critically", "answer": "C: die"}
{"text": "critically' is a concept we can apply to many situations in human life, but in this question specifically, it pertains in helping someone 'find' something they can see, like a store.\n5. The word 'cross' is a possible action item to aid in seeing something which is out of sight. \n6. However, 'crossing road' only works if you are already on one. \n7. Let's now eliminate any option that requires us to cross a road at some point.\n8. Consider option A: 'Cross road.' This would only work if we were on a road, but we are now told we are'seeing the store.' This implies that we are not already on the road. Since we are not on the road, we cannot cross it.\n9. Option B: 'See around.' This is also inapplicable here as seeing something and crossing a road are two different concepts. We can only cross when we see where we are going. \n10. Option C: 'Drink coffee.' We are not supposed to drink coffee in every situation, so this is not the right answer here.\n11. It's important to always consider all rationales to make sure we choose the best answer.\n12. 'Think critcally' and 'dream about things' could still be viable answers even when there is no context for their suitability, but with a little more consideration, we can easily eliminate the less likely options. \n13. Think critically is more likely to help with finding an object directly in sight rather than a store we can see, especially since the store is already visible. \n14.

B: a large number 3. C: one 4. D: tons 5. E: hundreds\nRationales: The question asks for the correct word that can follow the given words that the cashier said to the boy in response to his question.\n1. Since the cashier told him that it was tons of candy that they sold yesterday, it is not a few pieces of candy \u2013 a few refers to just a small handful of something.\n2. The word large probably means big enough to cause difficulty, and thus it is not really a large number \u2013 a large number means a lot, but a large amount means that it takes up a lot of space and will therefore be difficult to transport.\n3. Candy can be made from one piece of candy to hundreds of pieces of candy, so the answer has to be D: tons of candy.\nAnswer: D tons of candy\n\nInput: Which of the choices does not describe a good friend?

'School' is where one would likely play games most frequently. 2. For the sake of eliminating unnecessary options, 'homework' is ruled out because it would not be a common location for playing games. 3. For the same reason, 'bed' is ruled out because play would likely be a leisure activity pursued outside of ones bed. 4. 'Park' would usually not be a place to find humans playing games as this would be a place where they are more likely to exercise or socialize, not play games. 5. The same may be true for 'work', as humans there are more frequently working or going through their routine and not playing any games. \n6.

The question asks if a man could get something if he starts working as an apprentice and what it might be.2. A promotion (option A) requires a man to have spent some time working in the job to be eligible/deserving.3. A wage (option B) is given as money for services performed by a worker.4. Money (option C) is the answer as it is what a man receives as payment for job services.5. A position (option D) is given if a man gets a new rank or role in a company in relation to others.6. A job (option E) is the position or job a man gets paid to do.\nAnswer: C. Money\n\n### Challenge:\nInput: What might a person do if they had a lot of experience in the sport of archery? Choices: A) walk B) run C) stare D) ride E) sit\nRationales:\n1. What would a person do if they started to experience the sport of archery in a very good manner? \n2. The question is asking what they might do or what they're likely to do if they experienced a lot of archery and arched very well. \n3. As they are getting experienced in archery, we can say that there is a lot of experience, which can also be written as a lot of experience or a lot of practices.\n4. A person is likely to arch to the best of their ability and try to get the best of their capabilities or abilities. \n5. The correct option for this is A) walk. As we read from above, the person is likely to get the best of his capabilities as they are getting a lot of experience in archery or archery skills or abilities\nAnswer: A. Walk", "answer": "C: unpredictable"}
{"text": "critically' does not appear in the options which the human can probably do, but it's not relevant to the process of getting from one place to another, as the question states.\n5. So the answer is B: cross road\nAnswer: B: cross road\n\nInput: What did the car owner buy for his car? Choices:  B: gasoline  A: tools  C: engine  D: tires  E: car battery\nRationales:  1. The question asks \"what did the car owner buy,\" so we identify what the owner purchased for his vehicle.\n2. In the list given, only tools and gasoline are relevant to what the owner purchased, as they are things that the owner could potentially buy for his car.\n3. There's no specific reference to a car battery being an option to purchase so that can safely be discounted.\n4. Similarly, 'tires' do not seem applicable as the question specifies that the owner purchased something for his car and 'tires' refers indirectly to other parts of the car, not the car itself.\n5. The logical conclusion is that the car owner must have bought 'gasoline,' one of the options given in the multiple choice menu. \n6. Therefore, the answer to the question is B: gasoline.\nAnswer: B. Gasoline.\n\nInput: What does a car do if the owner is late for work? Choices: A: goes to sleep B: stops C: works D: moves E: goes to school\nRationales: First, we determine what a car doing if its owner is late for work means.\n2. From the options provided, we can logically rule out \"goes to sleep,\" as this doesn't make sense.\n3. So, the correct answer is \"moves,\" because a car would need to travel to get its owner to work. Otherwise, it wouldn't help the owner reach their destination.\nAnswer: D. Moves\n\nInput: Why do cows like to be in a field? Choices: A) to be near other cows B) they like the grass in the area C) they are comfortable with the other cows D) their owner wants to see them E) it's a place to find water F) the space is open\nRationales: To answer this, let's consider the reasons why cows might", "answer": "D: play piano"}

Thus the only correct answer is 'cross road.'\nAnswer: A: cross road\n\nInput: In what area of medicine is blood found? Choices: 1. A: the gut 2. B: the skin 3. C: kidneys 4. D: the heart 5. E: the digestive system\nRationales: Let us look at these options individually.  \nGut.  \nThe gut is part of our digestive system. Therefore, it cannot be a medical area of specialization and that rule out option A.  \nSkin.  \nThe skin is not internal, so it is not a region of specialization. It is outside of medicine. That rule out options B and C.  \nHeart.  \nThe heart is a medical organ. But it is not a region to specialize in. Therefore, that rule out option D.  \nDigestive system.  \nIn medicine, the digestive system is referred to as the gastrointestinal system. This area can be a major consideration of medical specialization. That rule out option E.\n\n\nOnly options we are left with are B and C. To answer it, we can consider again the options that are available from the context of the question.\nIf we can say 'blood is found in the heart', then we can say 'bloods found in the intestine and kidney are also found in the heart'.\nHence, the answer is option C.", "answer": "D: cross road"}
{"text": "critically' doesn't apply either.\n5. The remaining responses are all valid options to choose from. 'Cross road' implies that the human would have to walk or drive across a road if they're traveling by car, or walk through a busy crossroad to get to the store. 'Cross road', however, could also mean that someone could simply walk across the open space from the sidewalk to the door of the store, which would be a faster and safer alternative.\n6. Alternatively, a 'person' could take an elevator or a stair lift to move from the ground level to the first or second floor of the store, or could go up an escalator to take them to another floor.\n7. These options would require the least amount of time spent moving and would be the ideal way to get to the store, although this could be considered 'walking' or 'crossing a road' as well, depending on your interpretation. \n8. 'Go up an escalator' and 'take an elevator' are more plausible here than 'Cross road', so these two responses should be eliminated. \n9. So, the answer to this question is C: 'Cross road'.\nAnswer: C: cross the road\n\nInput: For which of the following things can someone wait? Choices:  P: bus ticket B: bus C: bus driver D: subway E: subway ticket F: subway driver\nRationales: Steps: 1. We read the question and understand what it is asking. 2. We analyze each option to eliminate those that do not make sense or are already addressed in the question. 3. We make a list of plausible choices that apply to the question. 4. We eliminate choices that do not apply to the context. 5. We find the specific choice that matches the most closely to the context and respond that choice.\n1. All of the options in this question are possible \"things\" (nouns) that one might wait for.\n2. \"Bus ticket\" is not a suitable response because the question asks \"which of the following\" things they could wait for - the answer must be a noun, so ticket is not a match. B: bus is an option because it can mean \"wait for a bus\". However, if this were the intended meaning, it would have been phrased", "answer": "C: bring home fish"}

Choices: \t A: front door B: conference room C: coffee maker D: lobby E: back door\nRationales: The question is asking where the interviewer can get the candidate after a job interview.\nThe first word \"get\" implies movement.\nBased on the context, the candidate who has interviewed for a job is no longer at the office, but is somewhere else. Therefore, the answer must refer to a place away from the office building.\nOption B is a conference room. A candidate is not necessarily interviewed in a conference room. It is also not possible for the candidate to be within a few meters of the office to be interviewed.\nOption C is a coffee maker. This is irrelevant.\nOption D is the lobby. While it is possible for a candidate after an interview to leave the office building through the lobby, it is not the usual candidate exit location.\nBesides, the whole point of the question is about where the interviewer gets a candidate. And the lobby is shared by multiple individuals.\nOption E is the back door. It is not possible to leave through the back door because the interviewer cannot move any candidate from front to back door.\nOption A is the front door. This is the only valid option.

Choices:  I: a storm II: the teacher III: a sunrise IV: nothing special  V. the bell VI. seeing stars\nRationales: First, we must determine why the student was looking out the window, not just that he was looking out the window. \n\nThe question implies that this student was asked to take a test.  \nConsidering that, we must ask why would a student look out a window while taking a test. \n\nThere are two possible reasons:\n\n1. The student may have been looking out of the window during the test because he or she felt more comfortable looking out the window than looking at the test.\n\n2. The test may have contained something distracting that the student was looking to escape from.\n\nSince this question is asking to find the reason that the student was looking out of the window, we must look for an answer that matches with it. \n\nFrom the options, the option that doesn't match the reason is \"Seeing stars\" and the other options do not match with the reason of the distracting test. \n\nSo, the answers are \"nothing special\" and \"the teacher\".\n\nRationale for Nothing Special: \"nothing special \"is the most likely option as it was out of the student's control to look out of the window and he could be watching anything while taking a test.\n\nRationale for The Teacher: The teacher may have been at the back of the classroom or may have been giving a boring lecture. These are the only options in all the options, so it was the teacher. \nAnswer: C and D\n\nInput: I didn't buy them all because they weren\u2019t available to purchase by the one, which is the following?

Choices:  A. they can get sick  B. They can lose their job C. They can lose their sense of smell D. They can experience fatigue E. They can experience hair loss\nRationales:  \n1: \"People come into contact with\" (verb) implies that they first have to come into contact with something or someone to then \"lose\" whatever the question is asking.\n2: \"Coronavirus\" is a virus that refers specifically to a virus that causes the illness, but this question is not asking about people \"coming into contact with the coronavirus.\"\n3: People are only able to \"come into contact with\" themselves, so they cannot bring in contact that causes them to experience hair loss.\n\n4: They can \"lose job.\" If they lose that \"job,\" they may, in fact, no longer \"come into contact with their job\" since they no longer work there. \n\n5: The illness is caused by infection. Infection may include loss of smell. Smell is a sense, and while loss of that sense may be caused by a virus, it is not something that individuals \"come into contact with.\"\n6: Fatigue is a symptom of infection. But it is not a sign that someone has lost something.\n\n7: The only option that matches the question is \"B: They can lose their job.\"\n\nAnswer: B \"Lose their job\"\n\nInput: The most interesting thing about humans at this moment in time is?

{"text": "critically' and 'cross the road' are both options which fit the context of 'getting to a store.  \n5. 'Think crititcaly' could refer to a mental process, such as planning or strategizing which could be helpful in getting to the store.

Eliminate option A: a table - this is unlikely for a cat to jump onto given that it isn't a soft surface like a rug or bed. \n2. Eliminate option B: bookcase - while a cat may sometimes jump onto a bookcase in search of warmth, this would be an uncommon occurrence. \n3. Eliminate option C: rug - again, while a cat may sometimes explore or seek warmth on a rug, it is unlikely to jump onto it in search of a bed.\n4. Eliminate option D: chair - this would be an untypical circumstance for a cat to jump up from a chair onto the floor, searching for a warm bed.\n5.

Choices:  C: move aside  A: try again  B: ring the bell C: knock D: go away\nRationales: First, We need to determine what the question is requesting. We can assume that \"finding a door that cannot be opened\" is the problem because the question is asking for a resolution or solution to this problem. \nNext, we can eliminate choices by considering which options make sense and which do not. \nWe can eliminate options that are not logical or reasonable, such as D: go away because the person would not leave that door without attempting a resolution, such as knocking or ringing the bell.\nNext, we can look at options that are not completely relevant to the question being asked and also eliminate them. \nFor example: \"Do I go away?\" (Choice D) would not make sense because the person would not simply leave a door that they cannot open.\nOne of the options that can be eliminated is \"B: ring the bell.\" In this context, ringing the doorbell would not make sense because it has been implied the person cannot even open the door, let alone reach the doorbell to ring it.\nLooking at the remaining options, we can eliminate choice C: move aside. This makes no sense as the person finding the door is already standing in front of it and would not be physically able to move.\nTherefore, we are left with choice A: try again. \nThe answer is A: try again.\n\nInput: The two teams played to a draw.

{"text": "critically' does not have relevant relevance in the scenario. It might help a person think through how to get to the store more efficiently as a thought process, but since 'thinking critically' is not part of the action of going to the store, it doesn't make sense to say that it's part of the process of getting to a visualized store.\n5. 'Cross road' might be a valid option, but the question is asking what a human would do to get to a store. When we think of cross-roads, most often we think of intersections.

Choices:  B: less C: two D: four more E: one\nRationales: The question is asking one to determine which best describes the sentence's usage of the phrase \"one can have more than two, four more.\"\n1. Logically, one can always have more than any number. This is true in general; therefore, the answer must be D.\n2. Examining the options, option A cannot be the correct answer because the number 2 is less than the number 4.\n3. The same is true for option B because an individual cannot possibly have less friends than two.\n4. Option E would also not be a correct choice because an individual cannot have only one friend.\n5.

Storm would ruin the house -> would cause severe damages to homes, but the question is 'big damage'. The word 'big' in the question is the clue to determine whether storm causing damage to homes would be more than enough (big) or not. So this option does not match the question wording.\n2. Weather would throw people off. -> In this case, the option mentions that there is a 'damage'. Not sure if you have grasped what 'damage' can refer in this case. Damage =/= damage = 'weather would throw people off' would not be an answer.\n3. Electricity would be off-> we need to identify 'big damage' and not 'weather would be off' as the damage. \n4.

'Cross road' does not convey the act of going from one place to another - it's just another way to say 'go through the road' and 'walk through'. While this may be the route, it is not a way of getting to the store and is not likely to be the specific action which is requested.\n7.

'Cross road' can be ruled out because cross roads are not a means of transportation to a store - they are an intermediate step.\n6. The only valid option left is A: cross road.\nAnswer: A [cross road]\n\nInput: Where would one find someone talking with food stuck to their face? Choices:  B: gas station C: fast food restaurant D: truck stop E: shopping mall\nRationales: The question is asking where one might find someone talking with foodstuck to their face.\nGas stations: Food is sold at gas stations, but it's not likely to be on someone's face.\nFast food restaurants: Fast food restaurants are a good option as they often have food on the customers' faces.\nTruck stops: Truck stops are primarily used by truckers, not casual diners for food.\nShopping malls: Shopping malls are not the first place that comes to mind when thinking of people with food on their face.\nHence, the answer is C: fast food restaurant.\nAnswer: C: fast food restaurant\n\nInput: The boy stood at a bus station for fifteen minutes, he then walked around the corner to find what? Choices: A: a bus B: a train C: a plane D: a taxi E: a map\nRationales: First, let\u2019s figure out what time the boy stood at the bus station, and where he went afterward.\nAs of right now, the boy stood at a bus stop for 15 minutes.\nHe then walked around the corner. \nWe can safely rule out 'a plane' and 'a taxi' as there isn't enough time for him to book a plane or a taxi. Let\u2019s look at what would be available at a bus station.\n'A bus' is a possibility.\nHe would be able to find a bus within 15 minutes at a bus station. \nHowever, we can also rule it out as the narrator mentions a boy and girl at a bus station which indicates that it is a bus station for public transport.\nSo, he would not be able to find a plane or taxi at a bus station. The only public transportation that is available in a bus station are buses. '", "answer": "A: wear shoes"}

{"text": "critically'. It's the opposite of'see around', however, it still requires the individual to look in a particular direction in order to see the store, so it doesn't make sense either.\n5. 'Cross road' is the best answer. Since the store is directly in one's sight, there is no need for one to cross a road in order to get to the store. The question therefore requires one to go over the option that is inaccurate. \n6. 'Cross road'.\nAnswer: A: cross road\n\nInput: The two men who were once friends, have now gone back to be friends.\nChoices:  A: reconciliation B: forgiveness C: resignation D: revenge E: alliance\n\nRationales:\n1. The question asks when or by what means two men may go back to being friends, when that relationship was once broken.\n2. The word \"friends\" in English tends to refer to someone to whom you feel a close affinity, while the definition of \"befriending\" is more specific. Here, \"befriending\" can refer to making a formal or official relationship with someone.\n3. This indicates that what is referred to by the two men as \"friends\" is an official status (a title), rather than a personal affinity (relationship).\n4. The two men could have an official relationship where they were once friends and now they will become friends again. That situation involves \"making friends again\", which is the most appropriate answer.\n5. A: reconciliaton:  The two men once did make a friendship agreement and they rescinded or changed the relationship.\n6. B: forgiveness:  This would refer to a situation where the two men had resentment and hard feelings towards the relationship; they forgave and now they will rescind or change the relationship.\n7. C: resignation: This would refer to a scenario where the two men resigned to the relationship not working well and did not try to reconcile.\n8. D: revenge:  This would refer and to a situation where one man did not want to forgive; therefore the two men decided to go their separate ways and did rescind or change their relationship.\n9. E: Alliance:  This answer would refer to a situation when the two men rescind or change a", "answer": "C: corner"}
{"text": "critically' is possibly the correct answer, but we can eliminate it as not directly related to the question.\n5. Using the principles of deductive reasoning, eliminating those distracting choices, we can eliminate 'Cross Road' and'see around'.\n6. This leaves us with 4 options left: 'Drink Coffee, Think Critically, Drink Coffee and Think Critically'.\n7. The answer should not be a combination of actions because it is unlikely that humans would have both an unnecessary task and a related task at the same time. So using the process of elimination, the answer is D.\nAnswer: D. Think Critically\n\nInput: Where would a person get ice for a cool drink? Choices:  B: in a refrigerator C: in a cooler D: at the beach E: outside\nRationales: The question is asking for the location of a refrigerator. The options for the question are: 1. At a cooling center and a refrigerator, respectively. At a cooling centre, a refrigerator can be used to store medications like insulin and food for the elderly.\n2. Ice is used for drinks and a refrigerative environment such as a cooler helps keeps the ice cold.\n3. The drinks are kept cold in case of emergency.\n4. This means that people can get ice for drinks at the beach. The answer to this question is B:in a refrigerator or at the beach by providing ice cubes for cool beverages.\nAnswer: B.\n\nInput: What are people trying to sell when an ad states there will be a product sale? Choices:  D: an offer E: a price cut F: a discount G: a discounted price H: a special offer \nRationales: We need to figure out the meaning behind the statement 'product sale'.\nFirst, we read between the lines and understand that the sale is not a regular sale but a discount or discounted price.\nSecond, we eliminate options G and H - which are not possible due to the usage of the terms 'discounted price' and 'discount'.\n\nNext, we examine the remaining options for each meaning or purpose and eliminate the ones that are not appropriate.\nOption D 'An offer' seems to convey", "answer": "E: pantry"}
{"text": "critically' does not make sense here because thinking critically has no relation to seeing directly and physically getting to the store. Also, this is not something we do when we want to get to a specific location, but a general approach to problem-solving and critical thinking.\n5. So, that leaves the answer as B: cross road. The road is the medium the human uses to physically get to the store. Thus, this is the logical choice among the options provided.\nAnswer: B : cross road\n\nInput: What does an elevator have that you won't find in a car? Choices: 1. A: no seat B: no steering wheel C: no brakes D: no wheels E: no doors\nRationales: The question is asking what the elevator does not provide and is looking for the opposite of what a car provides.\nStep 5: If the elevator does not have  doors, then it is not a car as this feature is included as standard equipment in vehicles.\nRaionale: Step 3 and Step 4 provided us with the logical reasoning behind each choice, while Step 5 provided the actual answer to the question as well as eliminating unnecessary choices along the way.\nRationales: We need to identify which option is not a feature of a car.\nRaionale : This helps us to decide on the exclusion that would satisfy the question.\nRaionale 2: This is to help us to eliminate options which does not contain the required feature\nRaionale 4: This is to further support our answer.\nRaionale5: We can compare each answer we had identified above to the answer, and confirm if our answer is correct or not.\nRaionale7: By comparing each answer with the answer we identified, this method helps us to confirm if the answer we identified is correct or not.

Choices: A: alive B: dead C: sick D: green E: red\nRationales: The question asks about a tree that has gone \"down\" - a fall or a collapse. We can eliminate options A, D & E straight-away, since they can't describe a fallen tree in its current state of \"being down\". \nOption B is also too restrictive, since \"down\" is a state that has an end and there is no way that it is 'dead'. Option B wouldn't really make sense as a description of what a tree is like after having collapsed. \nSo, let's consider C and the remaining option B. \nIt's clearly possible for a'sick' tree to collapse, but it would be more likely that it would be in a weakened state from being sick and then collapse. Also, as mentioned earlier, if it was sick, we couldn't currently say it is 'green' or'red', since a sick tree would have a different color than a new and healthy one. \nSo the correct answer here is simply the \"other\" answer of 'B'). \nAnswer: C) B is the other answer\n\nInput: If someone makes a choice, there will be what?\nChoices: A) winners and losers B) people who win and people who lose C) people who win and those who don't D) people who lose and those who win E) people who win, people who lose\nRationales: We know that the people who are involved in the choice will fall into two different categories: winners and losers. This is the opposite of B - people who win and people that lose. Therefore, we know that losers is not correct. \nWe know that people who win and people win can fit into this blank, however, we don't know who the people that win are and who the people who win are. It's equally possible that they're winners and", "answer": "E: show appreciation"}

Choices:  programming languages A: syntax B: algorithm C: data structures D: time complexity E: object oriented design\nRationales:\n1. Each choice has elements of programming, with each being a key component of the process.\n2. However, the question is asking about \"the most challenging task\" which eliminates choice B: algorithm - the core step-by-step calculation that the computer program executes. A task may be considered challenging but not the most challenging in the broadest sense, as in this case.\n3. Choice D: time complexity has some degree of challenge but not the greatest level of difficulty and it is not specific to programming in general. However, it may be a task that developers will face, so it can be retained as a possibility.\n4. Choice E: object oriented programming design is a programming paradigm but the task isn't specified as \"the most challenging\" and it may be the case that object-oriented design is not always the most difficult in every scenario. This point is valid and can be maintained, but it doesn't make this the best answer.\n5. Leaving choice A: syntax which is the rule or structure of a programming language or program. This could be challenging as it is a form of writing and programming languages don't readily lend themselves to easy syntax. \n6. However, the challenge isn't the greatest and it's also not the most specific to programming. A task that is the most challenging on a broad, industry-wide scale may not be the most specific to the field and, although it may be challenging, isn't necessarily the most difficult.\n7. Looking again at the context, it's possible that the most challenging task is the most specific to programming, so the answer is A: syntax.\nAnswer: A; syntax", "answer": "C: change yourself"}

'Cross road' and 'walk' are both possible responses that could work, except 'cross road' is unnecessary because they could simply walk, leaving this out of the options.\n6. Thus, we are left with a choice between A: 'walk' and B: 'cross road', which would both work, which makes the choice of B: 'cross road'.\nAnswer: B: cross road\n\nInput: There isn't a lot of money in the purse, it's what they had saved for a trip but it isn't enough.

In the river\nRationales: The first question we should ask ourselves is, \"Did the bird watcher go somewhere to watch the birds?\" The answer is yes. He went to the park because that is where the birds reside. It is logical that the bird watcher would go into the park to observe the animals. \nAnswer: D: In the river\n\n<Previous : Question 3Next : Question 5>", "answer": "E: blisters"}

Choices: 1.  A: bank B: government C: rich guy D: president E: poor guy\nRationales: - The rhetorical question is asking who could find a sum of money buried in their backyard. \n- The options given refer to people in varying financial positions (poor, rich, government, bank and president) and suggest different levels of wealth that would be required to locate such a large sum of money. \n- Considering the options given, looking to the richest individuals (rich guy) and their need for vast wealth. It makes sense that they would have the ability to find money buried in their backyards. \n- Therefore, it's reasonable to choose the richest of the options given, the \"rich guy\".\nAnswer: C: rich guy\n\nInput: Which of the below would benefit from wearing goggles? Choices: \n- A: an airplane B: a bicycle C: a truck D: a motorcycle E: a person on a bicycle\nRationales: A, B, C, and D refer to automobile transportation modes. Goggles would be unnecessary as modern automobile dashboards typically have some form of windshield/windscreen or glass that would provide adequate protection to the eyes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E: a person on the bicycle as it's the only option that includes a non-automotive transportation mode.\nAnswer: E.

Therefore, the correct way to answer this question is to say that a human's next move is to 'cross the road.'\nAnswer: B: see around\n\nInput: One way to solve a problem is to create a plan. Once you have a plan you can complete what steps? Choices:  T: 1. work smarter 2. work harder 3. implement your plan 4. review your plan 5. adjust to obstacles\nRationales: It's the nature of problem-solving to start with a problem and move through the steps of finding a solution. So, when one tries to solve a problem, they can use a variety of strategies depending on their approach to problem-solving.\nOne way to solve a problem could be to create a plan, which could involve steps such as identifying the problem, gathering relevant information, determining possible solutions, and finally implementing the chosen solution.\n\n### Detailed Task\nTo complete the multiple choice task, we need to first analyze the question and identify the information hidden in it. The first step in this analysis is to identify the key elements presented in the question. We can use the question to identify the subject of the sentence (the \"who\"), the action that the \"who\" is performing (the \"what\") and any surrounding \"where\" information that may help us understand the context of the \"who\" and \"what\". Once we've identified these elements, we can begin to analyze the options provided in the task, assessing them in terms of their relevance to the question and using deductive reasoning to eliminate incorrect or irrelevant options. The key is to focus on finding the most rational answer that best fits the question and its context.\n\n### Example of Task\n*Instruction: What is the main thing that can be done with a toothbrush?\n*Demonstration:  You can brush your teeth with a toothbrust.\n*Rationales: \n1.

Choices: A: a watch manufacturer B: a dentist C: an auto mechanic D: a grocery store E: a tattoo studio\nRationales: The question is asking for the location where a specific type of worker is located. A: A watch manufacturer makes watches and would therefore include people who work there. Watches are often attached to various body parts and would require a dentist to work on them. Automobile owners often make repairs to their cars themselves. Dentists would often wear watches as dentistry is part of the medical field, and it would be a matter of personal preference. C: Watches are sometimes worn on the wrist and can be damaged or broken. If this were the case, an auto mechanic would be able to repair the watch, but they are not typically related to dentistry or the medical profession. D: People may wear watches to access time, but grocery stores typically sell food. If the person were to have a watch that required fixing, the next best option would be to go to a tattoo studio. E: Tattoo studios are known to tattoo the wrist, and people who wear them can get them repaired or fixed there.

The question ask to identify the point or reason for hanging the clothes out to dry.\n2. The question only asks for the point of hanging to dry, not the point for drying in the first place. So the point of drying is irrelevant to the question.\n3. To'stop insects from laying egg' (option A) is not the point of hanging dyer clothes out to dry. Clothes drying on a clothesline are primarily done to dry clothing, not to stop insects from reproducing.\n4. To 'look pretty' (option B) is not the main point of hanging dry clothes on a clothesline. It may be an additional benefit of having dry clothes hang outside, but it's clearly not the main purpose.\n5. To 'use free energy' (option D) is not the main purpose of hanging clothes as it is energy available to anyone with a washing machine, dryer, or drying rack.\n6. To 'use the free energy' (option C) means that it can be done even without electricity, which is true, but it's not a practical or convenient way for most households to do laundry. \n7. The main point of hanging the clothes to dry is 'to dry in the sun' (Option E). This is the most obvious and natural purpose to hang dry clothes.\n\nAnswer: E: to dry in the Sun\n\nInput: They got very angry with the cashier who had made what type of mistake? Choices:  Type:  A: typos B: accounting error C: human error D: system error E: math error\nRationales: The word 'type' here is used as a noun, which refers to the class or kind of an item.\nSo the word 'error' is referring to the class or type of error.\n\n1.

The word E. Letters\nRationales: This question requires us to identify the missing word from a numerical series. The trick with such question is to determine the pattern followed by the series' numbers to find the missing word.\n\nLet's take a look at each number in the given series.\n\n$1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\ldots$\n\nLet\u2019s assume the above series has the pattern of 4-step increments:\n\n$4, 8, 12, 16 \\ldots$\n\nWe can see that the number $8$ forms the basis for the subsequent 3 numbers. Let\u2019s consider what each number represents:\n\n$1 = {1}$\n\n$2 = {1, 2}$\n\n$3 = {1, 3}$\n$4 = {2, 4}$\n$5 = {3, 5}$\n\nWe can see from the above that each number has a one letter increment from the previous number. Therefore, the pattern is that a number is added to the previous number where the previous number is the number 8.\n\nConsidering the above, we can answer the question by deducing the position of the missing number and the alphabet that will replace it. We can deduce that the position is 6, as this will represent the number 12. From this we know that the letter for 12 is W. Therefore, the appropriate answer is option D: The word \u201cW\u201d.\nAnswer: D: W\n```\n\n### Summary:\nFor questions of this type, we must first decide the appropriate response that is needed to complete the question.

Choices:  The colors of a rainbow, black, white, and red, clouds, lightning, and rainbow itself. C: colors of a rainbow D: black, white, and read E: clouds F: lightning G: rainbow self\nRationales: First, we determine what a rainbow is and then see what is associated with it. At first glance you may think you can include black, white, and rainbow here but that doesn't make sense. A rainbow is a result of light refraction from rain and sunlight. So you can see black, which is the absence of light, and light, being sunlight. But to see rainbow itself, the colors of rainbow, you need to go out in a sunny day and look at a rainbow. \n\nThis means the answer is B: colors of a rain bow\n\nInput: What does the man do with the shovel he bought from the store? Choices:  He uses it to build snowmen, shovel snow, store in the shed, shovel leaves, shovel walnuts\nC: use to keep animals out\nRationales: He could use it to shovel snow\n\nFirst, we need to understand the context. The context is very limited as the information mentions the man, what he bought and how it is related to shoveling. It does not mention any other activities that he may do with that shovel. So, we can eliminate all other answers B,C and D. Based on options A and E, there might be context that says the snowmen are the \"shovel snow.\" Because the man bought it from the store, he might use it to shovels leaves, so that's the answer.\n\n### Question:\nWhich of the following options describes a task that is not a job?\n\n### Choices: \n\n* \n\n  |[![Choices](https://community.freecodecamp.org/t5/image/", "answer": "D: were very tired"}

Choices: 1: A: hotel B: C: beach D: E: swimming pool\nRationales: The first step in answering this question is to carefully read and understand the given information.\n2. In this question, the context refers to towels and the list given involves hotels and beaches.\n3. It doesn't make sense for people to find towels in a swimming pool because it's an inconvenient place to look for them, and it doesn't relate to the context.\n4. It's also not logical for a hotel to have beach towels and vice versa.\n5. This means that options C and D can be ruled out, with only A and B remaining. \n6. Option A, the hotel, makes the most sense as it's the most likely place where anyone would find a towel. For this reason, the correct response is \"1: A: hotel\".\nAnswer: 1: A\n\nInput:  What would a person do to save money if they have to pick a store up?  Choices:  (1)  A: get a smaller house and 100lbs  B: have a garden C: pay for a larger fridge D: sell a car E: buy groceries in bulk \nRationales:  1. The first step is to understand the context and the main requirement of the scenario. In this scenario, we need to find a way to save money when buying groceries.\n2. Based on the options given, 1B and 5D are the most logical choices as they can directly lead to saving money, 3A and 6E are the most illogical choices as they do not help save any money, and 2C and 4D are the most indirect/unreliable choices as they may cost more money in other ways", "answer": "C: regular"}
{"text": "critically' can be an option because it involves planning and reasoning which are necessary for navigating one's way to the store. \n5. Furthermore, critically thinking includes considering various paths and possibilities, which aligns with the task of getting to the store by walking or driving. \n6. However, the correct answer is Option C: 'See around'. It is the only appropriate answer to the question and the rest of the options are irrelevant to the context.\nAnswer: C: see around\n\nInput: What are the two different kinds of people? Choices:  (A: one kind) (B: two kinds) (C: any kind) (D: another kind) (E: a kind two different kinds)\nRationales: Explanation 1: From the options given, option A is not a sentence. The options B, C, and D must all be phrases, but one of them has to be a complete sentence.  (A) is not a complete sentence. \nExplanation 2: From the options, the complete phrase has to be either \"one kind\" or \"two kinds\".  (B) and (D) are not a complete phrases because they are missing an article.  (C) is not a phrase,  (E) does not complete a sentence.  (B) and  (D) could also be phrases, but they do not make complete sentences.  (A) and  (C) are not a phrase, but a phrase must be the correct answer. Also, you must look beyond the options to understand the type of phrases. The phrase can be a subject, noun phrase, or adjective.  Noun phrases are phrases that can either be a noun or a pronoun phrase.  Adjective phrases are words that can describe a noun, that adjective is the adjective phrase. \nExplanations 3: The question asks for two different kinds of people. The options can not be \"a kind\"  because it would just mean \"one kind of people\", not \"two kinds of people\". \nExplanations:\nThe phrases (B) and (C) describe what kind of phrase to select. If (B) is selected, (B) and (B) together is a noun phrase (\"two kinds of people\") which is equivalent to two people. \nIf (C) is", "answer": "A: pocket"}
{"text": "critically' and 'cross road' could be two possibilities if one is trying to arrive at the store. \n5. Think critically can help one to visualize the direction and to make it to the store. \n6. But crossing the road might not be necessary if the store is very close to the one who's trying to get there. As such, we can remove this option.\n7. 'Cross Road' is a possibility if they are far away from the store and there is no short cut or other way to get there.\n8. Let's look at Critically thinking more closely. This is used to create a mental image and direction to the store, if they are on the right track, they would not actually need to 'Critically think'.\n9. It's more likely they would 'Stop' as they would know what their next move needs to be, which is to get to the store. 10. 'Stop' is the correct response as it is most likely they would need to Stop if they are on their way to the store and they have already come to their intended destination. \n11. Therefore the answer to this question is A: Stop.\nAnswer: A:\"Stop\"\n\nInput: If a person is tired or worn out, what could they do? Choices: \nA: go on a day off work B: take sleeping pills C: get a good massage D: drink coffee E: visit a beach\nRationales: This question asks what a person can do if they are tired, which can be understood as being exhausted. \n1. \"Go on a day off work\" can only be used if they have a day off work and not if they are just tired.\n2. \"Taking sleeping pills\" can also only be used if you already have the pills and not if you are just tired. \n3. Also, having pills will not help you if you are just tired as it requires already having them first.\n4. \"Getting a good massage\" may be used to help ease tiredness and relax a person if they are stressed. This is a possibility but it is not the most obvious choice. \n5. \"Drinking Coffee\" cannot help with tiredness as it is a stimulant that will make people more alert.\n6. \"Visiting a beach\" can also not", "answer": "B: answers"}
{"text": "critically' is the action of thinking logically and deeply about a situation and making informed decisions. It is the correct interpretation of the question. \n5. That brings us to 'cross the road' which is an action that involves walking or driving across a street. This action also includes a decision to get to the store if the road is across the way. \n6. Therefore, the best interpretation would be Option B: \"cross road.\" The action of crossing the road gets the individual to a store which is visible from where they are. The correct answer would be B: \"cross road\" because the options are in the given context.\nAnswer: B C: cross road E C: think critically D: dream dreams A: don't be a jerk and help the situation B: crossing the road C: thinking critically E: using a GPA calculator\n\nInput: Some people have to deal with problems during their day. What might those problems be? Choices: 1. A: homework B: bills 2. C: family D: shopping E: a friend\nRationales: The question refers to dealing with a problem during a day. Since any problem could occur during a day, there are multiple possibilities. \nOption 1- A: Homework: Homework can certainly be a problem especially for people like students, who often have it assigned daily. \nOption 2- B: Bills: Not everyone has to deal with bills, although many people do. However, being able to pay them does not mean that this could be considered a challenge or a problem. \nOption 3- C: Family: Family is often a source of stress and anxiety for many people. It is a constant source of problems.\nOption 4- D: Shopping: Shopping could be a problem due to a lack of money, a desire to save, or even for those who find it as a joy to go shopping. \nOption 5- E: A Friend: Although one's friend could definitely present a problem, this is also just a possible part of a day, so it is less likely to be a problem compared to other options. \nTherefore, the right answer would be Option 2: B: Bill.\n\nInput: During an interview, which one is not true?

{"text": "critically' is too broad.\n5. For the final option 'cross road', the question asks what they need to do or go through to reach the store. Crossing the road is an action that the human may need to take to get to the store and thus 'cross road' is the correct response.\nAnswer: A. Cross road.\n\nInput: What can be in your office but not at home? Choices: A: pencils B: furniture C: a car D: a computer E: a lamp\nRationales:  1. The question asks for an item that can be in an office, but not at home.\n2. 'A car' and 'a computer' can be in both your office and home. These cannot be the answer.\n3. \"A lamp\" can be used at both home and office. Therefore 'a lamp' is ruled out too.\n4. 'Furniture' can be taken from one place to another. Therefore it also cannot be the answer. \n5. 'Pencils' cannot be taken from one place and put in another. Therefore, 'pencils' is the answer.\nAnswer: A : Pencils\n\nInput: The most common place to drink alcohol is where? Choices: A. at home B. in prison C. in bars and clubs D. at a wedding E. on the street\nRationales:   1. The question asks which is the commonest place to drink alcohol.\n2. Options 'Prison' and 'on the street' don't seem to answer the question because people usually do not drink alcohol in prisons or on the streets. These two options can be eliminated. \n3. \"At a wedding\" is an incorrect answer. Weddings are usually not the most common times to drink alcohol. This can be eliminated.  \n4. The final answer is \"at home\". Drinking alcohol at home is the most common and preferred place.\nAnswer: B : at home\n\nInput: What is commonplace in a grocery store?

Choices:  B: lint C: hair D: dust E: pet fur F: cotton\nRationales: The question is asking what makes lint rollers a 'great tool'. Options A and D are both acceptable answers because lint is hair and dust. So option D and option B are both acceptable. Lint can be any type of hair, including pet hair. So, there is potential for the lint to be pet hair, so either option is acceptable.

The remaining options refer to specific actions: 'cross road' and \u2018see around\u2019, which would potentially allow a pedestrian to get to the store.\n6. The key words indicate that the person is 'going' to the store for something, not just'seeing around' while simply standing still.\n7.

In this question, the answers are: \u201cmany\u201c, \u201ctwo\u201d and \u201cfew\u201d\n3. According to the questions, there is \u201cCan you please describe something?\u201c. And the answer is \u201cF\u201d; we will remove this questions from our answers.\n4. Now that the questions have been taken into consideration, we can start answering.

Choices:  A. shy B. honest C. patient D. open minded E. curious\nRationales: Choices: 1. Heather is known to be a kind, friendly, and kind-hearted person. These three descriptions have similarities in their meanings, but also include specific, unique attributes that distinguish them from each other. \n2. Heather is kindhearted, which means she does what she does out of generosity and love. She is not motivated by gain or self-interest.\n3. Heather has a friendly disposition, meaning she is pleasant and easy to approach.\n4. Heather is kind, which is similar to good manners.\n5. In context, we know that the question is asking about Heather and her personality traits, and so we can eliminate descriptors that don't apply well to her: patient and curious.\n6. In this scenario, Heather is likely to be the one asking the question, and so we can further eliminate open mindedness, since she is the only one to be concerned about her personality traits.\n7.

This implies that he is able to handle the work or that the assignments fit his ability and skills. \nLooking at the options given, some of them don't align well with the prompt, whereas others make sense to some extent. \nThe option \"his work schedule\" doesn't directly relate to the employee's ability to manage the work assigned to them, which would be implied by his/her good work. \nThe option 'when he' isn't an accurate representation of the context, so we can eliminate this option.  \nNext, consider option C: the amount of money he earns. The employee has to work to earn money, so it's not necessarily a'management' task.  This option can also be eliminated. \nOption B: his management skills makes sense because managing work tasks would involve using management skills.\nThe option of 'family' is not an assignment and therefore doesn't relate to the task of assigning work. Option E: whether a family member is in another state would be too subjective and irrelevant to the question. This option can also be removed. \nThe option of \"when he makes money\" is a relevant factor as it implies a monetary reward system is in place and that the employee can earn more if they manage their work well. However, the prompt doesn't mention any sort of bonus or reward system, so this can be eliminated.  This leaves us with option B: his management skills. \nTherefore, the answer is B; his management skills.\nAnswer: B; his management skills\n\nInput: A lot of the people who were killed didn't know how to fly", "answer": "A: math book"}

Justin Bieber (Option D) does love to be a part a reality show and also happens to be one, but it's not accurate to say that he would love to be as part of one, because he's already there. \n2. David Hasselhoff (Option E) is not a natural fit for a reality show as it's not a typical occupation and doesn't align with the popular TV show 'The A-Team'.\n3. Jennifer Aniston (Option E) is also not a relevant choice because she's been a part of many movies but not a TV show.\n4. Tiger Woods (Option B) would fit the context as a good choice because he is a well-known sportsperson who often participates in popular shows, but he is not as widely known as other famous people\n5. \"Dwayne Johnson\" (Option C) is a good choice because he has starred in several major movies and is one of the top Hollywood actors.

However, dreams are not a physical action, though they could affect the humans actions.

So, I will not use Dream Dreams as an answer.\nBody Features - As the answer is what the human would not do as opposed to what the human would do. So, the human would be able to do this, since it does not involve a physical action/state.\nBlink: Blinking is a physical action, where the eyelids in a natural state tend to open and close a lot.

Choices: A science B: scientist C: new D: topic E: idea\n\nRationales: The main headline for an article about science is \"science\" because it is the primary topic of interest and refers to the concept that the article is discussing. This is evidenced by the fact that the article is about science, and the headline's job is to summarize the essence of the text. By using the noun \"science,\" we get a quick summary of the essay's main point, which is that it is about science. Choice \"B,\" \"scientist\" is incorrect because the headline should not include", "answer": "D: acute angled"}
{"text": "critically' can be a strategy for solving problems, but it's not related to navigating one's way to a nearby store.\n5. It's unlikely a human would 'cross the road', given that the store is directly in their line of vision unless there was some obstacle or challenge in their way, for instance.\n6. So, we are left with options B and D.\n7. Option B,'see around' is too vague. It does not reference any specific actions.\n8. Option D, 'dream dreams', does not seem to be applicable as a solution to the task of finding a store that you can see. \n9. Therefore, the answer must be option D, 'think critically' which correctly provides that one is capable of utilizing logic and reasoning to identify directions and a path to reach a destination. \nAnswer: D: think critically\n\nInput: What should students do for extra practice that will keep them on track for success and avoid failing the class? Choices:  C: read their class novels A: be a member of the debate team B: take good notes C: ask the teacher questions D: work on their spelling E: do their math homework\nRationales: First, eliminate answers which are not relevant to improving a student's prospect of success in school.\n2. The question asks for \"extra practice\" that students should do in order to avoid failing the class.\n3. The answer must be relevant to improving their prospect of success and avoiding failing the class.\n4. 'Asking the teacher questions' does not directly address doing extra practice for avoiding failure in this class.\n5. 'Working on spelling' is a correct answer about which the question may be implying that the student could work on that as extra practice for avoiding failing the class, but there is no direct answer in the question to that effect.\n6. 'Doing their math homework' is an ongoing task. While it may be relevant to avoid failing this class, the question is asking for extra practice, which the student could already be doing.\n7. 'Being a member of the debate club' does not reference avoiding failure.\n8. 'Reading their class novels' is an activity that could potentially help the student avoid failure, but there's no guarantee it will.\n9. That leaves the", "answer": "D: awesome"}
{"text": "critically' could mean different things to different people and is not clearly specified by using the phrase.\n5. The rest of the options are relevant to getting to the store, but 'cross road' and 'walk' are used interchangeably and there is no difference in meaning.\n6. So, the answer here is C: walk.\nAnswer: C: walk\n\nInput: What kind of thing would you do for something to be useful? Choices: 0: it needs to be broken 1: it needs to be used up A: destroy it B: replace it C: forget it D: use it up E: put it out of use if it is broken\nRationales: The question wants to know what something would have to be in order to be useful.\nAnswer: D. \"Use it up\" would be the answer but there is another word that makes the question more difficult. Choose a different answer to match the question.\nAnswer: E. Put it out of use if broken.\n\nInput: What does a person do when they start to drive?

{"text": "critically' requires more thought and planning, which is not a requirement for getting into the store unless the store is on a rooftop in some distant location.\n5. 'Cross the road' is an obvious answer that fits the context of the question.\n6. So, the answer choice A: cross road.\nAnswer: A. cross road.\n\nInput: With the cake that is in sight, one might want to do what? Choices: A: buy it B: touch it C: eat it E: find a candle D: light it F: give it to others\nRationales: There is at least some distance between \"In sight\" and the other elements in that statement. The most logical extension of that concept is to move closer to it.\n1. The most obvious action to take if the cake is in sight is to \"buy it.\" The cake is in sight, so buying it is a rational and logical option.\n2. \"Touch it\" as a suggestion could be valid, but it is not explicit enough. The other elements in the prompt (\"give it to others,\" \"find a candle,\" \"light it\") do not fit the context perfectly.\n3. \"Eat it\" is a possibility because if the cake is visible from further away, then that implies you are not close enough to eat it yet. Once you are close enough to eat the cake, you would most likely do that.\n4. \"Light it,\" \"give it to others\" and \"find a candle\" do not make sense with the question.\n5. The correct answer is A: BUY it\nAnswer: A: BUY (cake)\n\nInput: Where is the best place to buy a pizza at? Choices: A) Dessert B) Breadsticks C) Hotdog D) Restaurant E) Ice cream\nRationales: \"Where is the best place to get a pizza?\" Here, \"pizza\" and \"get\" are synonyms of the verb \"to buy.\" Therefore, there is logical symmetry in the prompt and it naturally leads us to the answer that best completes it. Thus, the best place to buy Pizza is pizza shops.\nAnswer: E Pizza shops\n\nInput: While there is bread for the children, and cookies, too, and milk and", "answer": "C: large city"}
{"text": "critically' is not necessarily related to the context of getting to the store as a quick, efficient action.\n5. So, in this case, the closest answer option is 'cross road' as it describes the actual action one would take to get to the store which is directly visible to them.\nAnswer: A : cross road\n\nInput: What did the writer do during his break? Choices: 1. A: rest 2. B: resting 3. C: eat 4. D: eat meal 5. E: take break \nRationales: * Rest (option A), Resting (option B), and Take Break (Option E) are all forms of rest. The original sentence doesn't say when the break would happen. * Eat (Option C) is also a form of rest but can be ruled out since it is not related to the situation in the original sentence. * Eat Meal (Option D) is a form of rest but it specifically says meal. Meal is not related to the context of the break and is a more extensive form of rest compared to rest and take break which is an action. The break did not specify when the break would happen, the break is more of an action to relax for the writer not a meal. Answer: C: eat *Meal is not related to context*", "answer": "C: surface of earth"}
{"text": "critically' can be excluded because a human is typically able to think clearly, including making informed decisions about where they want to go.\n5. The correct answer in this case is clearly 'cross the road', because of its direct relevance to reach the store. \nAnswer: A: cross road\n\nInput: What do most people not like about their work? Choices:  a: feeling pressured b: work as a whole c: responsibility d: colleagues e: overtime\nRationales: We can use the question itself to eliminate one option and another which is not relevant. \n1. \"Feeling pressured\" is not an answer because this does not describe what many people dislike about their work. The question uses \"most\" to describe the majority, a large number of people, and it would not be the norm for the majority to feel pressured at work. Feeling pressured could be said of a specific project or assignment, but not in general.\n2. After eliminating \"feeling pressured\" from the options, we can ask ourselves what the question doesn't want. The answer we want is something most people would not like about work. \"Colleagues\" could be one answer if you choose to think of coworkers as people and thus not colleagues, then they \"could be\" someone you don't like about your work because you have negative feelings toward them. Also, \"overtime\" is not necessarily negative. For many people, it may be a good thing because they can get more done faster or earn extra money during it. \n3. \"Work as a whole\" is a vague concept that is not an answer. Consider this, a person could hate their job yet like all other aspects of their profession.\n4. Finally, \"responsibility\" is a good answer but not always negative. A person could have to take on new responsibilities and not regret it. \n5. Hence, the best option from the given choices to describe what most people don't like about their work, is 'overtime', which is an option offered that is indeed the opposite of what the question is asking.\nAnswer: E : overtime\ninput: What can you do at home that will help you to reduce waste?

{"text": "critically' and 'cross road' imply the need to navigate and take action to actually get to the store, so those options are most likely the one to choose.\n5. The options given are 'cross road' or 'think critically'. \n6. The first option \"cross road\" is an incorrect answer as the process of crossing a road is often unnecessary as one should only cross if a path is blocked or if it is a one-way road.\n7. Also, the location of a store would normally not require crossing a road to get to it and instead, they may just need to walk down a path to get to it.\n8. The remaining option is 'think critically' which states that navigating the store is more of a mental process rather than a physical action. \n9. This option, therefore, is not a feasible answer as the context already mentions seeing the store, implying that it is a physical, physical location. \n10. So, the correct answer is C: dream dreams, which is a play on words meaning \u201ccross road\u201d, implying the need to navigate and think critically to get to the store. \nAnswer: C: dream dreams\n\nInput: If the man was a doctor, what might he prescribe for a fever? Choices:  The doctor would not prescribe a fever. A: medicine B: a pill C: a capsule D: a shot E: injections\nRationales: The context implies a doctor would prescribe any medication to treat a fever, as it is an illness rather than a cause. \n1. 'The doctor would not prescribe the fever.' implies that a doctor cannot prescribe illness as a treatment because illnesses are not a drug or a medication. \n2. 'Medicine' and 'A pill' are both viable options as drugs or medications, but'medicine' is the broader term that can apply to the treatment of 'fever' in the context, and can describe a number of treatments. \n3. 'A Shot' is the correct answer as it is the most viable option referring to another potential medication to treat fevers. \n4. 'Injections' cannot be used as a viable answer as it is not a medication, but a method of administering medications - it is", "answer": "A: relaxation"}
{"text": "critically' is a skill used for decision-making and problem solving, but not necessarily for getting to a destination.\n5. We can then see eliminating all the other options, 'cross road,''see around,' and 'think critically,' leaving us with the obvious answer: 'Cross the road.'\nAnswer: B: see around\n\nInput: What is the best description of a person who doesn't follow the instructions of someone in charge? Choices:  - a worker - a child\nRationales:  1. The question asks for a single word that best describes a person who doesn' follow instructions. Let's break down the option, \"a worker\" \n\n- To be a worker, one must be assigned a task (in this case, by the manager giving them instructions).\n\n- A worker doesn't necessarily have to follow the instructions of a manager, as long as they follow the manager's instruction, they are considered a worker.\n\n- Some workers may choose not to follow instructions of their manager, thereby showing that they are not workers. \n\nAs such, the word \"worker\" is not a good choice.\n\nNext, we will examine the option, \"A child.\"\n\n2. A child is a young person who is often tasked to do simple, repetitive tasks such as bringing snacks and drinks to a room of people.\n\n3. When a child does not follow these instructions, they are typically punished by the parent giving the instructions.\n\n4. However, the question is not about a child but about a person (not necessarily of a young age) who does not follow the instructions of a person in charge.\n5. Since there is no link with a parent and the person with no intent to follow instructions, this person cannot be a child.\n\nBy combining the options, the answer is \"The word 'worker' does not describe a person who does not follow instructions.\" This answer is supported by the word \"not\" in the question. We can consider the question as: \"which word is most appropriate to describe a person who does NOT follow their instructions from someone in charge?\"\n\n6. Therefore, the correct option is \"A worker.\" \n\nNote:  It is very easy to see how one could be misled by this question. We are, after all, often reminded by our teachers to \"do as you are told", "answer": "B: mall"}
{"text": "critically' is possible if 'thinking critically' leads to making a plan that involves crossing a road. However, simply crossing a road would also be sufficient to get to the store, so option \u201cC\u201d cannot be the full answer.\n5.

{"text": "critically' is a method of thinking, whereas the question is asking what a person would literally do to get to the store.\n5. Finally, while the store is literally visible to a person in their line of sight, the person needs to 'cross road' to reach it. \n6. Therefore, the answer must be \"Cross road.\"\nAnswer: C: cross road\n\nInput: What might a person be able to tell about a job position based on a phone call? Choices: 1: A: The company culture 2: B: The working hours 3: C: The company size 4: D: The company\u2019s ethos 5: E: The company mission\nRationales:\n1. Job culture is the customary behavior and expectations that are widely known and accepted by the employees within a company.\n2. A person might receive information about job working hours based on a phone call with a staffing manager at a new company.\n3. An organization's size typically correlates with its revenue, number of employees, or geographic reach/footprint.\n4. A company's ethos is a summary of its philosophy or belief system. Ethos refers to the character or personality of a company, organization, community, country, etc.\n5. A company's mission is a statement declaring why that company exists, and what its ultimate goal is.\n6. Looking at the options provided:\n7. \u201cThe company size\u201d (Option C) does not refer to the size of the company based on working hours, culture, etc. \n8. \u201cThe company ethos\u201d (Option D) is not part of the overall package of information provided based on a phone call, as it requires a more in-depth evaluation than a simple phone call. \n9. So the remaining options are:\n10. \u201cThe company culture\u201d (Option A) may provide some insight into the job position based on a conversation with the human resources manager or hiring manager but it is important to consider the company in its entirety when evaluating the overall position.\n11. \u201cThe company mission\u201d (Option E) can potentially provide information about the job position but it is possible that the company mission may have changed since it was initially created. \n12. Therefore, the answer becomes the combination of these two options, \u201cThe company culture and the company mission.\u201d", "answer": "C: superior"}
{"text": "critically' may be true if they are planning a route to the store. However, this is not stated in the question, so it is not an answer.\n5.

Choices:  B: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division C: two or more things happen at same time D: both at once, not after one\nRationales: The question asks what the word \"and\" means to a programmer, when used in code or instructions.\nThe word \"and\" can mean two or more things to happen at the same time.\n1. Option A: 'Addition, subtraction, and division' does not make sense according to the context, as it is not how the word \"and\" is used when writing, and it does not convey the meaning of the word.\n2. Option B: 'Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division' does not make sense either. It is an incorrect way to write these mathematical operations, as the word \"and\" indicates the actions happening at the same time. For example, the sentence \"Add and multiply 3 and 6,\" does not convey the meaning.\n3. Option D: 'Both at once, not after' cannot be the answer because \"and\" implies simultaneous action. The word \"and\" combined with the word 'not after' makes sense with the usage of the word in math problems, but it does not convey the correct meaning of the word in this context.\n4. So, the correct answer to the question is D: both at once.\nAnswer: D.: both at once\n\nInput: What do people do in bars for some time?

{"text": "critically' and 'cross road' do not relate to the task of getting to the store because they simply describe how the person thinks or travels.\n5. Hence, the answer is D.\nAnswer: D\n\nInput: For something to be easy, it must require little thought or what? Choices: A: concentration B: force C: intelligence D: effort E: time\nRationales: Steps 1: The question asks for something that is easy to be described as requiring little thought; a word with a similar meaning to thought was the target.\nStep 2. A 'force' (i.e., a push or pull) generally refers to external physical exertion. Concentration or concentration force refers to internal mental focus.\nStep 3. Intelligence does not need to be called into account here. \nStep 3: A 'force' (such as a thought or thought force) does not require intelligence to be applied for it to be considered easy.\nStep 4. A 'force' is inappropriate as it requires physical effort rather than a lack of thought. \nStep 2: A 'push' (or exertion) does not require a lack of thought, or require the applying of intelligence to be considered easy. \nStep 1: Therefore, the answer to the question is E: A lack of thought.\nAnswer: E\n\nInput: In what region of Europe are bears sometimes found? Choices:  O: Europe C: France D: Switzerland E: Russia\nRationales:\n1. The question is simply asking in what region of Europe bears are sometimes found.\n2. The context and available options suggest the answer is likely to be a European country (options A-D) rather than a country in Asia, Africa, or North America.\n3. As all the options listed are relatively northern European countries, one can eliminate all the other options as the possible answer.\n4. Option E: Russia is a country in Asia, whereas the question asks about Europe, so this is eliminated.\n5 Option O: Europe is only a general description of a continent, so it only broadly qualifies on this basis. As Europe is part of a much larger geographical region, it cannot be the answer alone.\n6. Therefore, the answer should be one of three specific options.\n7. Option D: Switzerland is generally described as having", "answer": "B: california"}
{"text": "critically' could possibly refer to the strategies used for reaching this goal. However, if the answer is to 'think critically' then the question, as framed, would be irrelevant as any option can be reached by a critically thought-out route.\n5. The only reasonable answer is 'cross road' because 'cross road' is a phrase used to describe how two roads intersect. The only time we can use the word 'cross' when referring to a road is when the road intersects with another road.\n6.

Choices:  a) at school  b) at work c) in a theater  d) at a party  e) near a home\nRationales: Let's begin by understanding the question on the surface. What it asks us is when, or at what point, ghosts typically appear.\nLet's now consider our options:\na) At School: In answer choice (a), the words \"at school\" are vague and do not indicate a clear location. While ghosts certainly may exist in schools, there are other places they may appear and answer choice (a) is too broad to be a suitable option.\nb) At work: We can eliminate answer option (b) as \"at work\" is the wrong context to ask if ghosts are seen more frequently at this time. Ghosts typically are more frequently seen at night, and answer choice (b) refers to a time of day more suited to a daytime activity.\nc) In the Theater: The word \"theater\" suggests a specific location, implying this is where the ghost sightings would occur more frequently. We may eliminate answer option (c) as not being relevant to the question.\nd) At the Party: The phrase \"at a party\" does not provide a sufficient clarification of location. It is vague and does not allow us to identify a specific place where ghosts will be seen. This eliminates answer option (d).\ne) Near a Home: Option (e) provides a more concrete location, implying that ghosts will be more frequently observed near a home. This narrows the field of options and makes it more likely that ghosts are likely to be seen at this specific", "answer": "D: popularity"}

Choices:  I: check mail II: go out on the balcony III: check weather app IV: open closet V: take off coat\nRationales: It could be a quick solution to just go out on the bal-con-y.\nI - Checking the mail (Option I) may tell you whether someone in the house has received a weather notification via email.\nII - Going out on the bal-co-y (Option II) is a way to find out the weather outside.\nIII - Checking weather apps (Option III) may not always be accurate, as weather may vary by location.\nHowever, checking an app on your phone's home screen or the lock screen would allow you to check your surroundings and get an idea of the weather outside.\nIV - Closets can hide from view what is not meant to be seen. Hence, they are unlikely the right place to find information regarding the weather outside your house.\nV - The option 'take off coat' (Option V) may be relevant if the question only says 'housing' and the question asks to find out the weather.

In other words, the word is used to express the aim or purpose of the preceding action. \n4. \"Built\" refers to constructing something, particularly through carpentry. \n5. The question indicates that the \"lumber\" was bought by a carpenter. Therefore the word \"lumber\" can be replaced by the word \"built\" to get an equivalent logical result with \"for a fighter\".\n6. From here, it's obvious that what \"a fighter\" refers to is \"building a fort\", and not any of the other options.\n7. Therefore, \"The answer should be C: building a fort \"\nAnswer: C: Building a fort", "answer": "E: harmful"}

One would also make intermediate stops for things like eating, resting, washing, etc.\n8. With the given information, the options A: to your country of origin, B: on the moon, C: on Mars, or F: in the desert cannot be appropriate answers because one can not get back to one's country of origin in 9.\n9.

Because humans are inedible; 3. Because humans urinate 4. Because humans have a strong smell 5. Because the sea' s temperature is favorable to shark breeding\nRationales: In a group of choices, only one is correct. Looking at options with incorrect reasons for it, we can easily weed them out and eliminate them. \n1. Option 1: Because the sea's salinity is an aphrodesiac. Sharks don't urinate, so this is incorrect.\n2. Option 2: Because humans are inedibles. Sharks don\u2019t urinate, so inedible is incorrect.\n3. Option 3: Because humans urinate. It's also known that sharks\u2019 sense of smell is weak. Furthermore, sharks are not attracted to urine and they can only rely on their senses of smell and sight to communicate and navigate the seas. In conclusion, this one has nothing to do with urine.\n\n 4. Option 4: Because humans do have a strong smell. Sharks don\u2019\u2019t urinate, thus it's not relevant.\n 5.Option 5: Because the sea\u2019 temperatures is favorable for sharks breeding. Sharks don\u2019't urinate, which makes this option false.\n 6. This reduces the answer choices to 1,2, 3 and 5.\n 7. But, the correct answer is option 5 because human urine is not something that shark breed for.\n\n 8. So, sharks don\u2019t go after human urine which is why sharks are attracted to human urinated areas.\n\n\nInput: A hurricane is a large storm, What makes up a large storm?

D: If you don't like what is being played. 5. E: You could want to play something different on the radio.\nRationales: Choice E, playing a different radio station, is an option, but this is not a radio, and the listener isn't going to turn their radio down so they can turn it back on.\nChoice A - The volume is already set at nothing. The thing turning up or down is the sound itself, not the volume.  \nChoice B - You have already said that turning up the sound and turning down the sound has the same meaning. You don't want to turn up the sound, so that means you want to turn it down.  \nChoice C - You don't want it turned down so you want it back to nothing, as that is the only sound you like.  \nChoice D - You've already said you don't want it to be louder, so you must be tired of listening to it.  \nChoice E - You want to play something other than what it is playing, so you have to turn down the sound so you can turn it back up and play something else.\nAnswer: D", "answer": "C: learn from each other"}

Choices:  C: berries B: tree sap D: leaves E: nuts\nRationales: In this question, we are asked about what a grizzly bears eats during its summer hibernation. We can eliminate options: \n\nA: If a bear is hibernating it is asleep through most of its time (except to poop). \n\nD: This bear choice is incorrect because bears are omnivores \n\nE: This bear's choice is incorrect because nuts cannot be found in a grizzly's native habitat \n\nBecause of this we can eliminate these choices. From this elimination process, the answer could be found by considering the remaining options B, C and D. Grizzly bears can only eat these items (as shown by the list on bears.usgs.gov that you will be directed to) in the warmer seasons.

Choices: \tA: Yes B: No C: Yes probably D: No probably E: Probably likely F: No probably not G: Probably unlikely\nRationales: The question is asking, \"what is the answer to this question?\" So, to answer this, we need to determine which response fits best with the given question. Let's take a look at the options provided: 1. \"Yes\" (A) is the most straightforward answer and it fits best with the question, as the question is asking \"What is the answer to this?\" and \"Yes\" is the answer to the question. Therefore, \"Yes\" is the best response. 2. \"No\" (B) is a natural and logical response to the question, as it implies rejecting the question itself - \"No, there is no answer to this question\", but it does not answer the question directly, so this option is a poor fit. 3. \"Yes probably\" (C) is also a logical response, but doesn't directly answer the question, and it seems arbitrary to \"probably\" assume that the answer is \"Yes\" since we already have \"Yes\" as an option. 4. \"No probably\" (D) is another natural and logical response that doesn't directly answer to the question, and doesn't seem to add specificity to the question that would make \"No probably\" any more likely of an answer than \"No\". 5. \"Maybe?\" (E) is also an irrelevant response to the question, and is unrelated to the question at hand, which is: \"what is the answer\" to the question. 6. \"Probably likely\" (F) is again a natural response, but the word \"likely\" does not provide more information", "answer": "E: university"}

Money - is always valued high and isn't something you do not give up for something of little value such as a book. There's also no comparison between money and a book hence this is not the correct answer.\n4. Paper - does not compare well with a book of little value in any context.

Choices:  B: road C: building D: floor E: floor lamp\nRationales: Road, Building, Floor. We can eliminate Floor lamp and Road. If the pizza delivery driver drives into the building or floor, he ends up in some parts of the building or floor. Pizza delivery driver would not be able to drive to the floor lamp or the floor itself which would be impossible according to the question. There are no stairs in the building or floor to drive into. Building and floor could be logical options. The only thing that distinguishes the question further is the reference to the structure, and we can infer from the question that it should be a building as there are also other buildings around in the scenery. If floor were a valid option, it would not make sense to specify the building that the driver drives into. If we consider logical reasoning for the remaining options, Building makes the most sense as the question has mentioned driving into something and floor is not an actual thing in the scenario.\nAnswer: (D) building\n\nInput: Billy had never seen a snowman before but he had no intention of ever visiting one.

The context of the story is clear, and the options are all unrelated to the question. The correct answer is obvious and easy to understand.\n\n - **Front yard**: The question is about a man's effort to keep up with his neighbors, so it makes sense the reference to \"front yard\" would be associated with efforts to keep up with the people nearby. \"Keeping up with neighbors\" is typically associated with close interactions and similar situations in people's lives, which is usually limited to a specific local community. It is unlikely the man's effort was directed over a large physical distance.\n\n - **Golf course**: Golf courses are a physical structure and do not relate to the context of the question. Also, it doesn't refer to a specific person going to a golf course. Option G is the most appropriate because the man had to keep up with his money, the word 'keep,' and time, which was also related to money, is a logical connection. Golf courses do not contribute much to this context.\n\n - **North**: The question refers to a location, so it is unlikely to refer to direction. If the man were aiming toward a particular store or location (a North Store, perhaps?), that would be appropriate. Without that context, the context isn't clear enough to be the best answer.\n\n - **School**: It makes more sense to refer to specific locations or contexts that are relevant to the question, rather than a reference to generic things like \"school.\"\n\n - **Suburbia**: \"Suburbia\" relates to a context that fits the question, which is a human being trying to keep up with the Joneses in their community.

Choices: \nA: getting sick B: making a mess C: keeping warm D: having a rest E: sleeping\nRationales: All options, except getting sick can be described to be of negative implication when describing them under the blankets:\n1. Getting sick: not getting sick is the most obvious negative implication when describing a person under blankets.\n2. Making a mess: this option will not be chosen as one who is hiding under the blanket probably knows they are there and are not trying to make a mess.\n3. Keeping warm: this option doesn't make sense as one who is hiding below the blankets is generally keeping as hidden as possible and isn't trying to keep anything warm.\n4. Having a rest: not making a mess doesn't mean it is possible to have a rest if one is trying to hide below the blanket.\n5.

If the human was located anywhere other than a cross road, there would be a need to traverse to a cross road to get to the store. This eliminates option B:'see around'.\n7.

Choices:  Happens:  A: ice water B: very hot water C: steam D: nothing E: very warm water\nRationales: This is not really a puzzle per se, and the question is likely meant to test one's general knowledge or understanding. That said, this is still a reasonable question that could appear on a puzzle test.\n1. The options are: \"Happens: ice water, very hot water, steam, nothing, very warm water\".\n2. The options are provided in a specific order, from the first to the last. Considering this, we can eliminate most of them before we even start with further analysis. \n3. \"Ice water\" is given as a potential result of putting hot water in a cold tap, but cold water cannot create ice water. So this is immediately eliminated.\n4. \"Very hot water\" would be possible, but doesn't make as much sense because it lacks specificity. \"Steam\" also has a lot of different possible outcomes and isn't provided in the question. So both \"heated water\" and \"steam\" would also be eliminated as options.\n5. This leaves \"nothing\" and \"very warm water\", and while \"nothing\" isn't an acceptable answer in the scientific or technological context that this question is presented in, technically speaking nothing can happen.

'Be assertive' is inappropriate because the person is not allowed to state their opinions in their home.\n2. 'Act' or 'be quiet' are also inappropriate because they encourage disobedience, whereas the person should not act differently in the presence of their family members even if they don't agree with them.\n3.

Choices:  D: only grass B: hay E: all types of food C: no food A: chocolate\nRationales:1. The question is an odd one since horses do not live in a world with chocolate.\n\n2.

Therefore, we would eliminate C: \"no food.\" A horse needs to eat something to survive.\n\n4. B: \"hay\" can include many different types of grasses. That would not be harmful to the horse but it would not constitute an answer to this question.\n\n5. D: Grass alone is not going to keep a horse healthy and can lead to serious metabolic and nutrition deficits. Since the question is \"only grass\", the horse would be malnourished if it ate only grass. If a horse ate nothing else, its coat would get so long and shaggy, it wouldn't be able to see.

A more direct way to express this would be to use the word \u201cmoney\u201d or \u201cspending money\u201d. Instead of spending time asking why we spend money when money can\u2019t buy us happiness, we should be asking why we spend time asking why we spend our money when money can\u2019r buy us happiness? This will bring us one step closer to finding the answer.\nIf we know where to begin, then we\u2019ll know where to end.

Choices:  B: towel C: carpet D: bicycle E: pen\nRationales: Let's start by eliminating the incorrect choices. Option A is incorrect because cars are inanimate objects. A car is a vehicle with no mobility and only man-made creations or natural wonders are inanimate. Option B is incorrect because towels are made of cotton, a plant, and therefore alive. Carpets and banners are similar, both being made of wool, usually a byproduct or waste of sheep farming. Banners, too, are more likely living as they don't require the wool sheep give after their lives have finished. Option E is incorrect because pens are an artifact that contain ink and is able to be used for writing or drawing. Therefore, the answer has to be one of the remaining three: Choice C or D. As B and C are closely related and seem to refer to similar subjects, let's look at B again: \"carpet\". It's most likely a floor covering made from materials such as wool, and is certainly not a living object, so it cannot be \"inanimate.\" C is similar, but it's an \"object\" of \"clothing\" made from the \"cloth\" of cotton, which is alive, so it cannot be inanimate.

Choices:  ___________ Choices: A: no B: yes C: either D: either E: none\nRationales:  1. The options 'no' and 'any' are not relevant to the question as they are not words - the question mark represents an actual word.\n2. Only 'yes' and 'either' are valid alternatives to the question mark as they are both words that can be used to replace it in the sentence.\n3. The answer 'either' is the most appropriate as it fits the context and syntax of the sentence.\n4. The sentence can be rephrased to convey the same meaning but without the question mark, such as: \"Which of the following words can replace the question mark in the sentence provided: either or yes\".\n5. \"Either\" is the correct response here.\nAnswer: EITHER", "answer": "D: pond"}

Choices: A: the backyard B: a small farm C: a farm D: the hen E: a barnyard\nRationales: The question asks about the origin of the farmer's chickens. We consider the options given: 1. The farmer had a huge number of eggs.\n2. All the eggs came from the same species of chickens.\n3. The chickens came from the backyard, a small farm, a farm, a hen, or a barnyard.\n4. The farmer's chicken came from his backyard. This was made clear in the question as the farm was a \"large farm\" rather than a \"small farm\", and the question did not mention that the chicken had come from more than one location.\nAnswer: A.'backyard'\n\nInput: In which of the following examples does person A apply physical force to person B? Choices: 1: person A steals person B's wallet 2: person A pushes person B into a wall 3: person A pulls person B towards person A 4: person A hits person B in the head 5: person A spits at person B\nRationale: 1. Person A steals person B\u2019s wallet involves physical contact, person A physically touches person B to steal their wallet.\n2. Pushing person B into a wall involves pushing person B along with the force of person A's body.\n3. Pulling person B towards person A is also considered physical contact, person A pulling person B towards person A, the contact caused by hand force.\n4. Hitting person B in the head involves physical force that impacts person B's body, resulting in physical contact between", "answer": "B: tomb"}

Choices: 1. A: parked 2. B: a car 3. C: an object 4. D: vehicle 5. E: a barrier\nRationales:\n1. This would not necessarily make sense to block someone's car. We only need to identify any object that can block someone's car in a parking lot.\n2. A car cannot block a car. It is possible for a parked car to block someone's way but we can cross out 'parked' as it's not applicable here.\n3. An object cannot block a car. An object like a pole or something solid can block someone's way in a parking lot but it needs to be something that was blocking the entrance to the car. Which is not an object, hence, we cross out 'object'.\n4. A vehicle can block a car. If a vehicle was parked in the way of someone's car, then we can cross out'vehicle' as it doesn't necessarily need to be a vehicle.\n5. A barrier can block a car. A barrier is a solid block or object that prevents someone from entering a space. So if there was a barrier blocking the way to someone's car, we can cross out 'barrier'. \n6. This leaves only two viable answers: B: A car and D: an object.\n7. We cross out option D: an object. A car is a vehicle which is a more suitable answer because it blocks the entrance of someone's car in this context.\n8. Therefore the answer is B: A car.\nAnswer: B.

Choices:  a: nap b: play c: read d: pray e: watch tv\nRationales: The question asks us what we usually do after we finish our homework. Let's look at the possible answers one by one. \nOption A) Nap: When it is time to take a nap, we lie down and relax our bodies. This suggests that we may have additional activities to follow after napping.\nOption B) Play: This also shows that we have further activities after we play. Play could be something like playing with a toy, playing a ball, or playing a video game.\nOption C) Read: This shows that we have further things to do after we read like napping, playing, or praying. Reading could mean reading a book, reading a newspaper, or browsing online articles.\nOption D) Pray: Praying may come right after reading, or it may require some other activities to prepare us before we pray.\nOption E) Watch TV: Watching TV is an activity that we can follow after finishing homework. However, we might have further things to do before turning on the TV.\nSince the question is asking for what we do after our homework is done, it seems that option D) Pray and option E)Watch TV both do not make sense, so we can cross those off right away.\nLooking at the three remaining answers, it seems that we need to consider two things: 1) The activity we do to prepare for the next activity that we do after we have completed our homework. \nAnd 2) The activity that follows our homework after that other preparitory activity has been done", "answer": "A: relax"}

That leaves 'a' which is the best answer.\nAnswer: A\n\nInput: A cow chews cud and does what? Choices: A: plow B: spit C: eats grass D: lays eggs E: digs dirt\nRationales: The question is asking about the action that a cow performs after chewing cud. \nWe can eliminate the options based on the assumption that it is the answer since it is one of the options chosen by the question to fit the scenario.\n\nOption C: Eat Grass : It does not make sense to use the action to describe the action after chewing cud as one would simply finish chewing their cud and move on to eating grass. The action of eating grass would not come directly after the action of chewing cud. We can also eliminate \"spit\" (option B) as this would be an action before chewing cud, not after, and we can eliminate \"lays eggs\" (option E) because cows do not lay eggs.\nOption D: Dig dirt or \"do XYZ\" is not applicable as the question asks what happens after chewing cud is completed and digging does not immediately follow the chewing of cud.\nOption E: Plow. This makes logical sense as an initial action after chewing cude and a useful action when it comes to feed. This implies a cow will eat, dig, and then plow. Thus, a cow does 'plow'.\nAnswer: C: eat grass\n\nInput: The person was able to locate their keys without touching them, it was done by doing what? Choices  A: picking up B: reaching C: looking D: tapping E: sniffing F: reaching under\nRationales: In the context of the question, it's reasonable to assume that the person is using their hands to locate their keys.

{"text": "critically' is something that can be applied to the problem of getting to the store, but this does not mean it is a direct, necessary action.\n5. This leaves us with the choice of \"cross road\", which is a direct action to reach the store. \n6. This is an option that can be eliminated as it suggests driving to the store. \n7. Since the question asks what a human will do if they want to reach the store in their sight, we cannot consider driving, as this implies a vehicle and other obstacles like traffic and road laws, which are not necessarily relevant in this scenario.\n8. Also, driving is not commonly how humans get to the store. 90% of all trips are taken solely by walking, which is the most efficient, direct means to reach the store.\n10. There is nothing about driving that implies it is necessary or the best option for getting to the store. 11. Therefore, the answer to the question is A: cross road. \n12. Humans do not cross roads to avoid a store, but to get to it.\n13.

Option C: occasionally or sometimes. (Drive by Drive Thru).\n5. Option D: never (Restaurants close).\n6. Eliminate option E: never. \n7. Now consider options B and C. \n8. We can eliminate option B, \"always\" because the man is not \"on the move\" for all of his time in the restaurant. Although he is in a moving vehicle, he will periodically stay still, for example: when he goes inside the restaurant to order, he will remain inside, even while driving.\n9. Also, he will stop again when he drives to and from the parking lot and finally, he will pause again when he drives back to his home.", "answer": "A: smell smoke"}

{"text": "critically' is not necessary to get to the store either because they already know the location of the store.\n5. 'Cross road' is an interesting option but doesn't really make sense because you would be getting to the store if you cross the road.\n6. Option E: 'cross road' doesn't really fit the context of how a human would get to a store since that process would depend on multiple factors such as speed, traffic, weather, etc., and it doesn't necessarily involve crossing roads.\n7. Considering all these factors, option A: 'See around' is the correct answer as it fits the most effectively. Seeing around would require a person to move in different directions and in different directions they could see the store, allowing them to get there. It also fits the \"human\" aspect of the question.\nAnswer: A. See around\n\nInput: What did the girl want most at the caf\u00e9 the entire time that she went? Choices:  R: Coffee B: Tea E: Ice Cream F: Chips \nRationales: The answer to this question is most clearly a matter of logical reasoning, as the question itself states that the girl was at the cafe the entire time and asks for the object she wanted most.\n1. To logically eliminate some options, one could rule out E: Ice Cream as its inclusion implies that the girl wants ice cream right away while going back to the cafe, which wouldn\u2019t make sense if the girl had already finished her order and paid and was leaving.\n2. In the same way, we can also eliminate B:Tea for the same reason, because ice cream is often consumed for fun, and tea is more commonly considered an appropriate caffeine beverage in a stereotypical cafe.\n3. Therefore, we have eliminated both ice cream and tea from the list of options.\n\n4. The rest of the options provide various other food possibilities but none of them are obviously the highest desire on the girl\u2019s part as stated in the question, so we don\u2019t have a good answer to select that\u2019s a solid option.\n5.

{"text": "critically' simply refers to thinking carefully and clearly, which is not the action of 'getting to the store.' \n5. 'Cross road' is the likely response because to 'cross the road' usually requires walking to a different location in order to reach the intended destination, in this case the store.\n6. Also, crossing the road as the only possible action in the question eliminates the need to'see around,' because you know exactly which direction the store is in and, by crossing the road, you can then walk straight to it.\n7. Therefore, 'Cross the road' is the appropriate answer to this question.\nAnswer: C: cross the road\n\nInput: If you come across a lizard and you\u2019re hiking, where might you see the lizard? Choices:  B: in front of you C: behind you D: above you E: below you\nRationales:\n1. We are given that the hiker encountered the snake while hiking.\n2. When traveling on a trail or hiking path, most hikers move in either the forward or backward (retrograde) direction.\n3. The lizard would be seen in either direction if the hiker is traveling in either direction.\n4. Moving upward or downward would not likely be relevant to finding the lizard.\n5. Therefore, the appropriate answer is C: behind you.\nAnswer: C\n\nInput: Which of these is a natural event? Choices: A. Earthquake B. Tsunami C. Fires D. Hurricane E.

Choices:  None A: to give up power B: for more time C: energy D: no trouble at all E: to be in charge\nRationales: In all of these options, \"want\" doesn't necessarily reflect \"desire\", meaning that they \"want\" something may not necessarily imply that they desire it. Also, \"nothing\" (option A) and \"want to\" (option D) don't make sense in response to the phrase \"want lots of things\", and \"being in charge\" (option E) can be achieved with or without something being wanted.\nAnswer: B for \"for more time\"\n\nInput: When does the average person use oil?

Choices: A: clean shoes B: good shoes C: water D: a fan E: shampoo\nRationales: Clean shoes (A) and water (D) are very important and are definitely necessary to live without, but there is no mention of \"very important\" or \"necessary\" in the question. The option \"water\" (D) is also redundant since \"shoes\" (which is technically \"clothes\") would be a necessary item for a person to live without.

Choices: \nA: as an integer \nB: as an integer  and half of an integer \nC: as a fraction\nD: as a mixed number \nE: as an area code \nF: as a decimal \nRationales : 1. Seven is a whole number, so that can be considered written as an integer.\n2. Seven is also a mixed fraction, which involves having both a numerator and a denominator. However, there are no fractional forms in the question\u2019s choices, so this is not the correct response.\n3. Seven is not a decimal, but the decimal form of seven is.7, and that is the correct answer. The decimal form of 2/3 in the choices can also be considered as a fraction but the decimal form of 2 has to be a.5 value so it is written as a mixed fraction.\n4.

Choices: A: it can start raining any moment B: rain may begin any moment C: it is going to rain D: the sun has already set E: if the sky was clear yesterday\nRationales: Clear skies can mean that it is likely to snow but it cannot mean anything related to rain, as rain only appears in cloudy skies.\nRain may start any moment even on cloudy days, but it doesn't necessarily follow suit if it appears sunny throughout the day.\nSince the sun sets only when there are clouds in the sky, the sun cannot have set if it is still sunny.\nSimilarly rain cannot begin if...\nAnswer: B: rain may begin\n\nInput: You can get wet from rain even if you are indoors.

We should consider what options are practical options in such a situation. \n2. Considering 'the man', the options'surrounding' him are most likely likely to come to mind, as this is implied by the question. \n3. \"By his bed\" is not an option, because he would either have to go out to eat or to a restaurant/etc. \n4. \"Near a pub\" could make sense as a possible food source if he's eating out, but we do not know if he is eating in or out.\n5. \"Outside a restaurant\" could make sense, but we do not yet know if the restaurant is closed to the public.\n6. \"Near a kitchen\" makes sense, as a person may eat something cooked in their home kitchen. \n7. \"By his bed, \" is an unlikely answer, because of the logistics - if he wanted food, he would have to leave bed and go out to a restaurant.\n8. \"On a meal\" can't make sense in the context, when the man is feeling hungrily, because he would likely not be eating a meal. \n9. \"Nearby a kitchen", "answer": "D: food court"}

We are asked to avoid what someone will likely find in a locker room, but this is not a good guess and is certainly not mentioned in the wording of the question.  We can also rule out \u201cCounter\u201d because members do not have counters in a locker room. \u201cCounter\u201d is, however, related to the service or sales provided at a food bar or counter in a different location, such as a restaurant or store.  We also eliminate \u201cTo ensure your privacy and comfort, please shower in a private stall.\u201d This is not a sentence we need to decipher, and it is not in the correct font style. It makes no sense to consider \u201cExerciser\u201d as we are not asked to avoid a person in the locker room, we avoid what they may have.  Finally, we can exclude \u201cEmployee.\u201d This makes no sense because most gym locker rooms are open to all members, regardless of their status as an employee or not.  In summary, our list of possible answers includes \u201cA. Members\u201d.  This is clearly the one we eliminate because it\u2019s an unlikely scenario.\nAnswer: Anonymous\n\nInput: Which of your relatives are turtles?

Similarly with 'cross the road', as this would take more effort and not directly point at the store.\n7. The choice, then, is obvious...the answer is either A: crossing the road or B: seeing around. The store is directly visible, so simply cross the road.\nAnswer: C: crossing the road\n\nInput: Billy did not want anyone to know he had a terrible secret, his brother was so trust worthy and never gossiped what? Choices: A B C D E None\nRationales: A secret is any information not generally known and often held as confidential. It is information that is not known about something or someone else by those who are not closely related or have no direct access to it.\nA trust worthy individual is someone whose character and behavior are trusted to be honest and sincere.\nGossiping would allow for Billy\u2019s secret information to be shared by his brother, allowing it to reach others who are unacquainted. \nAnswer: C. This option means Billy\u2019s brother was trustworthy.\n\nInput: A wiggly in the cakes are what? Choices: B C D E F None\nRationales A Wiggly in the cake is a person with hair on the top of their head, the word \u201cwiggly\u201d could be interpreted as the person\u2019s hand, the person\u2019s head can be interpreted as the \u201ccake\u201d.\nA wiggly in the hair is the person\u2019s hand on their hair, the \u201ccake\u201d would refer to hair the person has on their top of their head.\nThe word \u201cWiggly\u201d could be used as an adjective to describe a person\u2019s hair if their hair was standing on end.\n\nAnswer: A. The wiggly in the person\u2019s hair is the person\u2019stouching their hair.\n\nInput: The cacti was in the dry heat of the dessert a long time ago. They needed water to survive where?

{"text": "critically' refers to making logical decisions and decisions based on facts and evidence, not a physical ability.\n5. 'Cross roads' is not specifically relevant because a store can be accessed through many different possible routes, not only roads.\n6. 'Look around' (or'see around') is a logical possibility as a human can turn around and seek out another route or avenue to the store as he or she wants it. \n7. Hence, based on all the options given, look around/see around is the most logical and reasonable option to select as it fits the context perfectly.\nAnswer: A. B: look around\n\n## 5.

Choices: 1A: heat B: bake C: microwave D: add salt and water after 3 minutes E: add salt and water in beginning\nRationales: First, let us look at each choice to eliminate the options that do not represent the correct method.\n\n1. Choice 1A: heat. Pasta needs to be boiled in water not heated, as heating does not cook pasta.\n2. Choices 1B: bake and 2C: microwave. Pasta cannot be cooked in either of these in the correct method of cooking listed above.\n3. Choices 2D: add salt and water and 3E: add salt and water. These are not the correct order and they also add unnecessary steps.\n4. Choice 4D: add salt and wait.

{"text": "critically' is too ambiguous. A person may think critically on many things and using critical thinking skills might not help them get to a store that is within their sight.\n5.

Choices: \tA: caring B: selfish C: lazy D: disliker E: selflessly\nRationales:\n\n1. The question is seeking a word to describe a person who cares for their community and helps others.\n\n2. The options given appear to have been listed in order of increasing level of good deeds.\n3. \"Caring\" seems to imply a lesser degree of helpfulness than \"selflessly\" or \"selfishly,\" which is used as the middle ground to signal a balanced level of care. Therefore, this seems like the right choice.\n4. \"Lazy\" is incorrect as those who are not lazy might still be very helpful.\n\nAnswer: B: middle of the road.\n\nInput: When would you use a word with two prefixes? Choices: \nA: Never B: Sometimes C: All the time D: Never E: Never\nRationales:The question is seeking clarification on when a word with two prefixs should be used.\n\n1. The prefix \"non\" signifies a term that is not, as in \"non-smoker.\"\n2. \"Anti\" is commonly used to indicate \"against\" something. This could be a pre-prefix, as in \"antifreeze,\" or a post-prefix, as in antibiotics.\n3. \"All\" refers to an entire group, inclusive of any parts or specifics not listed.\n4. \"Never\" and \"always\" are not applicable to this question because the word with two prefixes is a word in itself, rather than describing an action - for example, \"I never ride a bicycle.\"\n5. \"Sometimes\" does not mean the same thing as \"all the time.\" Here, the question asks for a person who uses the doubled prefix word constantly and not just occasionally or sporadically.\n6. Therefore, by reasoning, the answer is C: All the time", "answer": "B: dangerous"}
{"text": "critically' is not necessary because the goal is to simply get to the store, not to think about it.\n5. 'Cross road' and 'do nothing' do not make sense, either, so they can be eliminated. \n6. The only remaining option is'see around,' which makes sense as humans have the ability to search for things around them if they want to move towards them.\n7. Thus, the answer is B'see around' because you can see around the environment to figure out where to go next when you see a store directly in your sight. \nAnswer: B: see around\n\nInput: Who is a person who is unable to think in any way? Choices:  a) dead b) blind c) alive d) deaf e) dumb\nRationales: Rationales: 1) As per the question, we are trying to answer the option which is a person who cannot think in any way. \n2) Alive is an option, but it is not a right answer as it means a person has the ability to think in one way or another.\n3) Dead means a person is deceased or has passed away. They are not unable to think, hence it is an incorrect option.\n4) Blind means a person has lost their eyesight completely or partially. Therefore, we can disregard this as well.\n5) Deaf means a person is unable to hear anything. They cannot think in any way, but the context given is asking about inability to think, so this is also ruled-out.\n6) Finally, we are left with option D: 'Dumb', which states a person who cannot think at all. So, the correct option is (D) Dumb\nAnswer: D: dumb\n\nInput: What does a person do who is able to run fast despite not being on a field of play? Choices:  b) jog c) fastwalk d) jump e) sprint\nRationales: The question is asking about the option which is able to run fast while not on a field of play. \n1) Run implies speed and one can clearly see that a speed is not present in the given options.\n2) Sprint is a kind of running, but not relevant here as there is no field of play present.\n3) Jog does not make sense either, as it is quite slow in terms of", "answer": "C: california"}
{"text": "critically' is a mental state and is not likely to be required to get to the store.\n5. This leaves us with the remaining options: A: 'Travel across the road' or B: 'go through the store'\n6. The option 'Travel across the Road' is the obvious choice because it is a human action that is necessary to get them from where they currently are to the store. \n7. There is no option B that is viable as a choice as the store is already visible and the human is not necessarily there yet to 'go through' it.\n8. Therefore the correct choice is A: 'Travel Across the Road'\nAnswer: A: 'Travelling Across the Road'", "answer": "A: advisory"}
{"text": "critically' and 'cross road' are too vague and don't necessarily address getting to the store. \n5. Therefore, the answer can be narrowed down to either 'cross road' or 'think critically.'\n6. Crossing the street would be the only action that would put you next to the store. Thus, the answer is C: cross road.\nAnswer: C: cross road\n\nInput: In a group of people, you would be what if you didn't participate? Choices: 1: lonely; 2: ignored; 3: hated; 4: bored; 5: silent\nRationales:1. The question is what would be the result if you did not participate in a group of people. 2. The options could be narrowed down based on the context of \"participating\" in a group. \n3. If you do not participate in a conversation or gathering, you will most likely be \"ignored\" because the conversation may continue with those who are participating. \n4. If there is a gathering of people, and you do not participate, you might be \"bored.\" \n5. If you participate occasionally, you might be \"silent.\"\n6. If you do not want to participate in a group, you would probably be \"lonely.\" \n7. Therefore the answer can be narrowly chosen between \"hated\" or \"lonely.\"\n8. \"Hated\" would occur in the event of a more social gathering where everyone gets to know one another. \n9. On the other hand, loneliness is more of an effect caused by not having people to identify with. \n10. Therefore, the answer to this question can be \"lonely.\"\nAnswer:B:lonely\n\nInput: Where would a person find a pile of dirt? Choices:  T: garden B: yard D: compost C: storage bins E: soil\nRationales: First, we identify what the question is asking: where would one find a pile of soil?\nNext, we determine the most likely answers that could make logical sense in the given context.\nThen, we cross out the answers that do not fit the context.\n\nT: garden - in the garden setting\nB: yard - most likely in a garden\nD", "answer": "C: frustration"}
{"text": "critically' is not necessarily necessary to get to the store and it does not make sense since the store is visible already.\n5. 'Cross road' may be possible, but it does not make sense as a human would try to get to a specific store, making it obvious that crossing a road will not be useful if the store is directly seen.\n6. Therefore, the correct option is A: see around.\nAnswer: see around\n\nInput: Where can an avid gardener find plants for their garden? Choices:  C: local nursery B: nearby grocery store A: nearest gas station D: farmer's market E: roadside stand\nRationales: If someone is an avid gardener, they will often try to find the best plants for their garden. However, they want the best quality plants, not the cheapest ones. \n8. Therefore, we can rule out option A: nearest gas station as this is not likely to be the source of quality plants. \n8. Similarly, option B: nearby groc- ery store is also ruled out as it might sell flowers, but not the best quality plants. \n9. Option C: local nurser y may be a possibility as they often have high-quality plants available for avid gardeners.\n10. However, option D: farmer' s market focuses on selling food rather than plants. It is thus ruled out as an option.\n11. Option E: roadside stand may be a possibility but is likely to not sell the range of plants that an avid gardener would be looking for. \n12. Therefore, the safest answer is c: local nursery.\nAnswer: C: local nurser ry\n\nInput: You may be asked to write a report on a topic in the English classroom.

It depends, but it's never after you start. So that limits the time to before.\n7. Before the person writes a report, they need a topic. After they pick a topic, they write a report. These two activities do not overlap.\n8. So the", "answer": "A: apply for job"}
{"text": "critically', and 'cross road' are plausible options (as is'see around'), however they require extra actions and time beyond just being 'in sight' of the store. \n5.

Choices: \nA: yes B: no C: maybe D: it's not that kind of song\nRationales:1. The question asks whether the bird is getting any worms by perching high up and having its mouth open.\n2. The only answer that fits is the response of \"No\", because 'perched high up with its open mouth' is a very poor position to get any worms as they are not easily available.\n3. If birds were getting worms this way, then the question can be better phrased as 'are birds getting worms by perched high up and having their mouth open?'.\nAnswer: A: no\n\nInput: What is the only item of clothing one can make in a second?

Therefore, the correct choice is B: cross road.\nAnswer: B. cross road\n\nInput: A person might find what useful with a flashlight? Choices: \nA: a book B: a candle C: a match D: a battery E: a lighter \nRationales:\n1. The question asks if a person might find a book useful with a Flashlight?\n2. A book is definitely a useful item. \n3. A candle might also be a useful item with a flashlight depending on the circumstances.\n4. A match might be a useful item with the flashlight depending on whether the book or candle are unavailable or damaged to prevent their use.\n5. A battery might be a useful item as a flashlight will need batteries for power.\n6. A lighter might be a useful item in certain situations where light is required instead of or in addition to the flashlight.\n7. One of the most useful items in this situation is definitely a flashlight. \n8. However, a book, a candle, a match, a battery, and a lighter can all be useful items with a flashlight. 8. Therefore, each of these can be eliminated. \n9. This leaves us with B, C, and D. B, C, and d are all useful items with a flashligbt so one should definitely be picked. \n10.

Hence, the answer to this question is A: cross road. \nAnswer: A: cross road\n\nInput: What word indicates how much a person wants to spend all of their money? Choices:  a) savings b) fortune c) retirement d) expenditures e) thriftiness\nRationales: The question is asking for the answer to 'indicate' or 'express' something. \n1. Option 'a' is savings, meaning it is something one would use to maintain funds or hold onto money for the long-term.\n2. Option 'd' is expenditures, meaning it is something that one would spend their money on.\n3. Option 'e' is thriftiness, which can express or indicate money management and/or saving money.\n4. The remaining options can be eliminated as they do not specifically and accurately relate to how someone could indicate or express how much they would want to spend their money.\n5. Therefore, the answer must be either 'E' or 'D'. \n6. Option 'D' is expenditutes, which does indeed express the spending of money. \n7. So, the answer to this is option D: expenditures.\nAnswer: D expenditures", "answer": "B: skill"}
{"text": "critically' would take too long and not be necessary if they had the ability to see the store in the first place.\n5. Therefore, the answer must be D: 'Go directly to the store.'

It requires minimal actions such as crossing a road and takes little mental processing as they have already determined their destination.\n7.

A place where you sit and relax. A spot where you play.\nInput: 3. A place to eat may be a place where you sit and eat, but this is not necessarily a place of rest.\nInput: 4. Similarly, a spot where many people gather may be a place of joy or fun, but it is not necessarily a place to rest.\nRationales: Conclusion: 5.

That means only 'cross road' or 'go to the store' are remaining options, which can be considered based on relevance to a question that refers to 'cross road'.\n6.

Choices: A: inactivity B: stillness C: apathy D: confusion E: none\nRationales:  1. The question asks us to choose the correct option for describing an inactive person.\n2. Considering the context of being a person, the person's'state of being' would be inactivity, which is a valid term that describes a person in an inactive state. \n3. So there is no choice D: confusion, because confusion cannot be said to describe a person but a more complicated situation.\n4. Similarly, it is not likely for the'state of being' of the mentioned person to be stillness (Option B), as stillness does not describe being as it lacks human interaction.\n5. Also, the word 'apathy' (Option C) does not make sense here, as apathy is the lack of any emotion and therefore is not an inactive state that can be described - only a description of the person.\n6. Similarly, choice E: none, is not feasible because there is not an option to choose 'none', so it would not make sense to choose it.\n7. There is only one option left in our list of remaining options - 'activity' (Option A) which concludes the question.\nAnswer: A activity\n\nInput: I'm going to tell the class that they can leave now, but what are they allowed to do? Choices: A) go to the store B) sleep C) take breaks D) go outside E) go to the cafe\nRationales: First, let's look at the question. The class hasn't done anything and is waiting for instructions. We know the teacher wants them to leave. To make this happen, she will say they can now leave.", "answer": "B: satisfaction"}

{"text": "critically' gives us an answer. This means that to think critically is to analyze and process information in order to make decisions or solve problems.\n5. A human can cross the road, meaning they can leave what they are doing to go to the store, by using logic and their own decision making. \n6. Therefore, we need to choose among the remaining options. The last one is \"Cross the road.\"\nAnswer: C: Cross the road\n\nInput: Liz got on her bike and rode to the shop, which was two miles away. She had to stop and rest as it was a steep hill. She was happy she was able to overcome the hill because what? Choices: A: getting away from home B: it was fun C: her bike was faster D: she was getting stronger E: she had been trying very hard \nRationales:  1. The question starts by telling us that Liz was able to overcome a steep hill on her way to the shop. \n2. As she was riding her bike, she had to stop and rest because the hill was very steep. \n3. She was happy to have overcome the hill. To do something and overcome a challenge is to successfully complete an action or a task. \n4. To get stronger is when you become physically or mentally stronger. Liz's answer would likely be to have been getting stronger because to overcome the hill, she would have had to lift herself and her bike up, which is a demanding physical activity that requires the strength of a fit body. \n5. The other two answers in the list have nothing to do with being happy to overcome the hill as it would apply to only one answer.\n6. Therefore, the correct response is E: she was getting stronger.\nAnswer: E. She was getting stronger\n\nInput: In a store, where might you get a phone? Choices: A. front B. back C. side D. center E. top\nRationales: As the question begins \"In a store\" we are expecting our answer to be found here. \n\n1. \"back\" does not make sense, as stores do not typically have \"backs\".\n2. \"side\" makes some sense, as stores do have \"sides\", but we are also looking for the \"top\" of the store.\n3. \"top\"", "answer": "D: parking lot"}
{"text": "critically' is not a physical action that a human would need to take in this situation as the process of getting to a visible store is largely considered to be a no-brainer.\n5. This leaves us with two options that may be relevant to the problem: 'cross road' and 'walk'. \n6. 'Cross road' is the correct option in this scenario. This is because although the store is visible, the task is further complicated by the fact that the human needs to cross a road that may present a risk (due to oncoming traffic, a rough or unpaved road, pedestrian traffic or any other relevant factor). \n7. Therefore the correct answer is A, 'cross road'.\nAnswer: A: cross road\n\nInput: What can cause a person's stomach to do a flip-flop? Choices:  a) eating b) drinking c) chewing chocolates d) snacking on chips  e) not eating anything\nRationales: The question is asking for the answer to \"What can cause a person' question to do a flip flop.\" According to the instructions, the statement does not mean \"to do what\".\nThe question simply asks about the actions that cause the stomach to do flip flop.\n\nLooking at the choices, the options that make stomach do flip flop is the last choice \"eating\". Other choices would not cause such action. For example, drinking or chewing would not cause stomach to do such action. It would only cause the stomach feels bloated.\n\nThe answer is \"eating\".\n\nAnswer: eating\n \n### Instruction Answered\n\n### 1.

{"text": "critically' could be used in some situations, but it will not always help the person to navigate to the store.\n5. Option 'B' indicates that person could cross the street to enter the store.\n6. This makes it the option the best choice which is 'across the road'.\n7. The word 'across' can be found in several phrases such as 'across the road', 'across the country' and 'across the globe' indicating that the person may have to cross the road to get to the store.\n8. The word 'road' can be found in various phrases such as 'car' and 'on the road'.\n9. It makes it necessary to remove 'cross road' and 'at road' which may help the person to understand that 'crossing the road' is the best option which the question expects them to choose.\n\nAnswer: A: cross road\n\nInput: Where can one go to pick up a dog? Choices: 1. A: dog shelter 2. B: on a leash 3. C: in a car 4. D: in a cage 5. E: in a tree\nRationales: The question asks where one can go to pick up a pet dog. The options can be categorized under two broad categories:\n\n1. Places one _could_ go to pick a dog \n2. Places where one _would_ go to pick a pet\n\nConsidering the options in these categories, we can eliminate those that are in the second category as they suggest where one would _actually_ go in order to pick a dog, instead of a random/diverse/general set of locations suitable for picking any kind of dog.\n\nIn the first category, we are not eliminating any options and can progress to the next stage.\n\nAfter this stage, our options are now in the second category but have an additional check for suitability.\n\n1. A dog shelter: a shelter for dogs would be the most obvious place to go to pick one up, but such a shelter is presumably full of unwanted dogs, not pet dogs.\n2. On a leash: although possible, being out on a leash can be stressful for an animal, and is not a common form of dog ownership.\n3. In a car: while some people may travel with a dog in a car", "answer": "A: depressed"}
{"text": "critically' refers to a method of thinking that requires logical reasoning and rational analysis, but it wouldn't be required in the scenario given.\n5. In the scenario given, the best answer is actually that a human would 'cross road'. Although it sounds vague, 'cross road' refers to moving to the other side of the street or a highway. \n6. It is the only answer that will help a human move closer to the store.\n7. Therefore, 'cross road' is the correct answer.\nAnswer: B\n\nInput: How could a person who can cook help someone who cannot cook? Choices:  - - - - Choices: A: wash dishes B: be an example C: read the directions D: find a recipe E: teach the way\nRationales: The question is about how someone who can cook can help someone who cannot cook. \n1. The options given are: wash dishes, be an example, read the directions, find a recipe, and teach the way. \n2. Washing dishes is not a form of assistance or help, and doesn't fit the scenario of being able to cook, therefore, it can't be the correct answer.\n3. Being an example doesn't help the person who can't cook directly, only indirectly as the example would be of someone who can cook. \n4. Hence \"Read the directions: can't be an example. \n5. \"Find a recipe\": although this option might be beneficial in certain cases, wouldn't be as useful as actually teaching the person how to cook. \n6. The only remaining option is \"Teach the way\": by teaching how things work, one can show someone who can't cook by illustrating the steps to learn how to cook and the importance of knowing how to cook, they will learn how to cook, which can help them in their future endeavors.\n7. Therefore \"Teach the way\" is the correct answer. \n\n### Discussion Question:\nWrite a response: Discuss the difference between plagiarism and intellectual property, and how students can avoid plagiarism when writing their papers.\n**Plagiarism**: Plagiarism refers to the act of stealing and passing off someone else\u2019s work as your own.

{"text": "critically' could also be eliminated as it does not directly help the human to find the store. \n5. Looking at the remaining options, 'cross the road' and 'go to the store' are the only options that make sense in this context. \n6.

Choices:  B: nobody C: only D: everyone E: everybody\nRationales: The question is about who is likely to work hard even when they don't have motivation. \n1. We can eliminate options because considerations such as personality, character, and motivation come into play when answering this question.\n2. Option A: \"nobody\" does not make sense because most people want to work and earn a living.\n3. Option B: \"nobody?\" indicates that \"nobody\" is a possibility. However, this answer makes no sense as nobody wouldn't work unless they were forced to do so. \n4. Option C: \"only\" does not capture the full range of possibilities so the answer cannot be \"only\" but nobody would work under the condition given in the question.\n5. Option D:\"everyone\" makes sense because everyone wants to make a living, thus would work hard to earn one.\n6. The most plausible answer, however, is choice E: \"everybody\" because everybody would have the incentive to work, even without motives, as they need to make a living to survive. In other words, the answer is E : \"everybody\"\nAnswer: E: everybody\n\nInput: What happens in nature between the wind, the tides, and the water? Choices:  a) weather b) ebb and flood c) moon phases d) rain\nRationales: Consider the elements mentioned in the question: \"wind, the tides and the water.\" \n1. The word \"weather\" refers to atmospheric conditions, not necessarily weather such as rain or cold temperatures experienced by humans.\n2. \"Ebb and flood\" refers to tides and the water movements such as tidal currents and wave action.

Since each option has a different function than the other, we can begin to eliminate them one by one.\nStep 3.

Choices: A: current B: new C: used D: outdated E: upgraded\nRationales: For this question, we have to first decipher what the phrase 'new and updated' really refers to in this context. It's important to understand that this company doesn't simply have 'new' or 'updated' versions of their products - it has new and updated versions, implying that the products are changing and evolving over time. \nTherefore, if the company has a variety of versions, they must either have 'current' or 'outdated' versions as well. When considering the options further, it becomes clear that the company does not have any of its old products as it only has 'new', 'updated' and current' versions. This also means that its current products aren't outdated but rather updated, and the products in the past were outdated. \nWe can also say that the company is 'updating' its products as the old versions are outdated, they must 'upgrade' them in some way, and those upgrades constitute the new, current versions. We can rule out the options that are irrelevant to the context: \n'Used': Used products aren't relevant because the company is not updating its old products. Also, used products would be unlikely to be 'new', but not outdated.\n'Outdated': The company does have outdated products and they are being replaced with current ones.\n'Upgraded': The company is not upgrading its products, but rather updating them as there are many current versions that have been upgraded from their original versions.\nWe are left with either 'Up-to-date' or 'New', as these are the only ones that fit the context of this question. \nLooking more closely at the options, we can see that 'New' makes sense because the products are always new: they change over time and there are always new current versions, since they are always updated with new versions.\nOn the other hand, 'Up-", "answer": "E: neatness"}
{"text": "critically' may be relevant, but it's certainly not the most obvious choice given the context.\n5. The best option seems to be 'cross road.' This choice is consistent with the context of the question, which assumes that the person wants to get to the store, which is 'right there.' That means they need to 'cross' a road or 'cross' over to get to it.

Choices:  L: Primary school B: High School C: Junior High School D: Elementary School E: Pre School\nRationales:1. We can eliminate the two options that do not relate to education and learning, namely option C with the text \"Junior High School\" and option B with the text \"High School\".  \n2. We can also eliminate the option D with the text \"Elementary School\" since it is irrelevant to the context of \"teacher\".\n3. The option E with the text \"Pre School\" is also irrelevant to the context of education as it is not an actual school but a place to meet prior to going to the school for a pre-school function, such as a meeting, orientation, or registration.\n4. The remaining options are the same types of educational institutions \"L\" with the text \"Primary school\" and B with the text \"Jr Primary School\".\n5. Since there are only two remaining options and it is the only context the question refers to then it is likely one will be right and the one that isn't the answer would be wrong by elimination.\n6.

Choices: A: lunch B: breakfast C: morning D: food E: dinner\nRationales: The question is asking what the lady would reply to her friend when she said \"Come for dinner.\" It's asking what she will tell her friend about which meal she eats.\n1. \"Lunch\" is definitely incorrect because it's a response to the dinner invitation, not the meal the lady eats in the day.\n2. \"Breakfast\" is also incorrect as it's not the answer to the dinner invitation.\n3. \"Morning\" would be correct if it was the correct answer to the dinner invite (because it's about which meal is eaten in the morning). However, it's not what the lady will say but it is what the friend will ask about.\n4. \"Food\" implies all the meals that are eaten, not just a response to the dinner meal.\n5. As such, the closest match to what the friend is asking and what the lady is replying to the friend's invitation is E: \"dinner.\" Therefore, the answer is E. \n\nAnswer: E: Dinner\n\nInput: If I had a ham and I asked a friend where to go, where would they go?

Finally, 'Cross road' does not make sense in the context as crossing roads is an actual action and not a destination which is the most likely answer for this question.\n6. Therefore, the best choice is B: See around. This is the correct answer because \n\nRationales: The question asks what a person would do if they're trying to reach a store that they can see.

If the equation is not intended to be able to provide answers for questions such as \"How Big is 0.05?\" or \"What is 0.03?\" then option one, \"What is 0-25%?

Choices:  B: pillow C: bed D: roof E: blanket\nRationales: First, we need to identify what we\u2019re looking for.\nThe question is asking us to choose what might be used to find a place to rest or sleep.\nSince a place to sleep is something you could find, as in, being in a place where it is convenient to rest, we can eliminate \"pillow\" and \"blanket\" as they can't be \"used\" to \"find\" a sleeping place.\n\nThese options instead indicate something useful for sleeping once you're there.\n\nNext, based on the information given, the only remaining options are \"bed\" and \"roof\u201d.\n\nA \"bed\" obviously \"might be used to find... Sleep\".\nHowever, we know a \"roof\" can be used to avoid sleeping outside, so it is still a viable answer.\n\nHowever, there's no indication the question-answer choice needs to relate to \"finding a place to sleep\".\n\nThus we can eliminate \"bed\" as well. The wording of the entire question already reveals what must be found,\nso the answer becomes that \"a roof might be used to find...a place to sleep\", as it's something you could find.\nAnswer: D. roof\n\nInput: Why would you use the term \"haystack\" if you think your opponent is hiding something?

Cross street\n\nInput: In what way, on a physical level, is ice not water? Choices:  water and ice are both physical objects, which of the following is used to describe water? A: melting  B: expanding C: boiling D: freezing E: solid\nRationales: The context clues in the instruction are \"on a physical level\" and \"not water.\" To interpret this statement, we compare ice and water; both are forms of water. Therefore, we need to eliminate all options unless the question asks about water itself.\n1. Choice B -Expanding- is an attribute of water, not ice. Therefore, option A is removed.\n2. Choice D- freezing. Likewise, this does not help our analysis as it is the attribute of water that allows ice to form.\n3. Choice E- solid, can also be rejected as it doesn't fit either option.\n4. Finally, the remaining choices are both terms used to describe water, making them an equally valid answer as opposed to ice.\nAnswer: A- melting\n\nInput: In 1743, Benjamin Franklin flew a kite, he got what? Choices: A: lightning B: electricity C: wind D: rain E: thunder\nRationales: First, look at the context clues and understand the question being asked. The question is asking what was the result of Benjamin Franklin's actions.\nSecond, look at the options given, one of which is correct. All the options have something in common; they are all states of matter.\nHowever, \"Lightning\" (Option A) is not a state of matter nor does it indicate Franklin's results, which was electricity, not lightning.\nTherefore, \"Lightning\" is incorrect\n4. \"Wind\" cannot lead to the formation of \"Electricity\" which is the correct answer.\n5. \"Thunder\" is incorrect because it's not related to the question and also because \"Thunder\" isn't a state of matter.\n6. \"Rain", "answer": "E: ticket"}
{"text": "critically' is an ability and not necessarily something one would do to get to the store.\n5. So the human would 'cross road' and'see around' for a more likely accurate answer.\nAnswer: A/C: cross road\nInput: Where would you expect to find a cow at a grocery store? Choices: A: on ice B: on a package C: in a bag D: on a package E: on a label\nRationales: Cow is an animal. Thus, we have options A: on ice. B: In a bag, C: on a package, D: on a label. We can eliminate both A and C options because a grocery store isn't going to have a cow on ice. \nWe can similarly eliminate option B because it doesn't make sense for grocery stores to contain bags of live animals. We can similarly do with option D because grocery labels aren't made of animals like cow. \nThe only option left is C: on a package where a cow would easily fit.\nAnswer: C: on a package\n\nInput: What can make the dog feel safe but not the cat? Choices: 1. A: the dog 2. B: the cat 3. C: a dog whistle 4. D: a cat treat 5. E: a dog treat\nRationales: The cat does not feel safe with the dog because it has the dog as its only rival. A cat can not feel safe by competing with another. So option D is not an acceptable choice. \n1. Option A cannot make the dog feel safe and the cat feel unsafe since a dog can feel safe with the cat.\n2. Option B can't make the dog feel safe because that is the cat's place. \n3. Option C cannot make the dog feel safer as it is just another whistle of the same frequency as the dog is used to.\n4. Option E also cannot cause the dog feel safer because it is the same frequency.\nOption C and E seem to be the two reasonable options. But it needs to be seen that option C can make the dog feel saver unlike option E. The dog whistle is of a different frequency than cat whistle.\nOption D seems to be the better choice because cats react well to cat whistles, so there is", "answer": "E: expensive"}

Choices: \nA: horizontal\nB: vertical\nC: upside down\nD: rightside up\nE: crooked\nRationales: We know the banner is hanging by using the definition of hanging and the image provided.\nSo, Option (A) is the correct answer.\n\nInput: What is different about the person who does not see the car parked next door? Choices:  (a) b/c they can't walk in the dark. (b) b/c they are blind. (c) b/c the car is not next to them. (d) b/c they're old. (e) c/e\nRationales: (e) c/ e: If the person couldn't walk in the street, then he/she would not be walking on the street. Similarly, if the person is blind, then he/she cannot see the car parked. Therefore 'c' and 'b' cannot be the answer choices. If the car was not parked next door, then the person who cannot see can't see that it's not parked next door either.\nTherefore, we are left with 'e' as the answer which is the correct one because they are old, so they might not be aware of a car parked in their street.\n\nInput: Which description can be used to identify the kind of person who likes to have the same conversation every single time?

{"text": "critically' might potentially be relevant as it could provide them with better ideas or strategies to get to the store. \n5. However, there is more information available that can further narrow down potential actions that the human could take.\n6. Looking at the remaining options, the human could choose to 'cross the street' (option A) or 'walk faster' (option D). \n7. 'Crossing the street' implies moving over the street and is not relevant because the goal is to reach the store which is on this side.\n8. 'Walk faster' implies moving towards the store and also fits the context of the question, since the faster the person walks, the sooner they reach their destination. \n9. Therefore, 'Walk faster' is the correct answer.\nAnswer: D : walk faster\n\nInput: Where did the man's wife find the best shoe designers on the eastside of Rome? Choices:  - A: high street retailers B: local shop C: on the internet D: through an app E: a store next to a mall F: an internet search\nRationales: Input: 1. The man's wife was given a set of instructions on finding the best shoe design on the eastside of Roma. \n2. 'The Eastside' of Rome refers to the eastern area of the city, while 'Eastside' in English is the collective term for the eastern part of a place. \n3. In this context, the eastside of Rome is the reference, which is a geographical region of Roma.\n4. 'Eastside' refers to the eastern side of Rome's region and should not be confused with the term 'East Side' which refers to a distinct and separate area of the same city. \n5. Therefore, the Eastside of Roma is the reference and only needs to be narrowed down further. \n6. From the provided options, 'high street retailers' (A) are commercial businesses located in the main streets of urban areas where they are typically situated to provide goods and services to nearby residents. \n7. In this context, it makes sense for the wive to have possibly visited high-street retailers as they are a common establishment found in urban areas and likely in Roma. \n8.

{"text": "critically' may be a strategy to use to find a route to get to the store but it is not an action one can carry out on the spot.\n5. The remaining two options are both possible actions that will get them to the store.

{"text": "critically' is similar to'see around' as it is not physically possible.\n5. However, 'cross road' is exactly what must be done to get from one side of the road to the other. Therefore, the best answer is A: cross road. \n6. Crossing the road is not a matter of visualization; it is an active process which needs to be done in order to get to the store. \n7. This eliminates options C and E, as well as implying the question is asking about physically getting to the store, not being aware of the store or having a vision of it. \n8. Since the question is asking specifically about walking, it makes logical sense to eliminate option B'see around.'\n9. Therefore, the best possible answer is A: cross the road. \n10.

Choices:  Option A: 0 hours Option B: 1 hour Option C: 2 hours Option D: 3 hours Option E: 4 hours  Rationale:\n### Step 1:\nInput: The question asks how many hours of freeze at -10 degrees to improve the strength of ice. Option A: 0 does not make any sense because freezing zero hours at -10 degrees will make an ice stronger, however, it will not make it stronger enough to survive.  Option B: 1 does not make any sense either. Option C: 2 will strengthen the ice after 2 hours at -10 degree. Option D: 3 will strengthen the ice to such an extent that it will freeze in -10 degree for 3 hours. Option E: 4 will require 4 hours at -10 to fully improve the strength of the ice. It is important to note that strength of ice is not only determined by the temperature but other factors as well, such as amount of air trapped in the ice and density of the ice.\n### Step 2:\nInput: We will select 4 in order to find out what amount of freezing at -23.7 degrees can fully", "answer": "E: getting good grades"}

Choices:  I: above the ground I've already discussed this with II: the ground III: at surface IV: beneath the snow V: between the holes\nRationales: In the last sentence of the question, it was stated that it would be \"above the ground\" which leads us to choose I.

Choices: 1: Toys, 2: A fist, 3: A tissue, 4: An apple, 5: An egg.\nRationales: From the context of the question, we know that hooligans (a type of criminal) would put items in our mouth such as candy bars, or money. However, these choices are incorrect because a hooligan would not throw eggs at our face (option 5), or give us a tissue (option 3). In conclusion, we can eliminate 3 and 5, leaving only 1, 2, and 4. We know that \"A fist\" (option 2) is not the answer because it was stated that \"What does a hooligan...\" (which indicates a group, not an individual), and they would not fist us (individual). Because only an individual could do so, they would \"put\" an item in our mouth, leading us to eliminate 2. We can also eliminate an apple (4) since we know the item would be put in our mouth, meaning the hooligan would not use an apple and toss it towards our face. So the only options left are 1 (\"Toys\"), and 4 (\"An apple\"). An apple would cause a mess and could potentially create a food related hygiene issues, so we can eliminate the apple (option 4), leaving only 1 (\"Toys\").

A = 20 (1st digit is 2 and second is 0) so the total dollar amount is 20.\n2. B = 30 (1st digit 3 and second is 0), so the total dollar is 30.\n3. C = 50 (1st digit C is a 5, and as long as the 1st digit is not a '5', the 2nd digit is 0). So the total dollar amount will be 0.\n4. D = $12.5.

Choices:  T: cross a road B: jump over fire C: go through fire D: dreaming E: drinking coffee\nRationales:\n1. The question first asks about getting to a store that is visible, then it asks how one might then go about getting to the store when the way is blocked by fire.\n2. Fire cannot be crossed, nor can it be 'jumped over.' \n3. To get 'through' the fire, it would mean crossing the fire or going through the fire somehow to get to the store.\n\n2. However, if one did not want to actually get through the fire, then the answer would be to ignore it and dream about it.\n\n3. There is no indication of'seeing around.'

These questions are usually asked by the hunter during the hunt since they refer to searching for a quarry.\n\nThe answers that do not fit the question are \"Did it get away?\" and \"Is it in there?\" since they are not generally asked by hunters looking for quarries, but are more likely asked by hunters catching the quarry. Another reason these options do not fit the context is that they are more often asked after a hunt, or in a different situation than the question asked.\n\n\"Is this it?\" is a good question but it is less likely to be asked by a hunter on the hunt as they have not yet found their quarry.\n\n\"Did she catch what she was looking for?\" and \"Did it get away?\", are more commonly asked after the search has finished.\n\nIn the original question, where the \"did you get it?\" phrase occurs, \"did you catch what you were looking for\" is a valid substitute for what is being asked in the question.\n\nThe correct answer is \"Did you catch what you were hoping?\"\n\n### Bonuses (Cont.)\n\nOutput: \"I don't remember that story in that way before,\" he said.

{"text": "critically' can be applied to some scenarios, but in the context of walking to the store, it does not make sense here.\n5. The conclusion is that the store is in their line of sight and does not require any special effort to get there. However, in some cases, especially in rural areas, it might not be possible to see the store from where they are, so that eliminates that option as well. \n6. In the current context, there is no need to cross a road in order to see the store, making answer (A) incorrect.\n7. There is no need to drink coffee or dream dreams in order to reach the desired destination. Coffee can be consumed at any time and dreaming doesn't involve an action. The conclusion is that these are irrelevant options. \n8. Critical thinking is a process whereby people can evaluate and analyze problems or situations in an objective, logical, and rational manner. People do engage in critical thinking, but it is not needed in order to reach a store or view it. \n9. So, the answer finally boils down to just 2 options - either 'See around' or 'Cross road'. \n10.

Choices: 0 A: yes B: no C: chocolate D: eggs E: fruit F: spinach\nRationales: First, let's try to understand what the question is asking us. The title might suggest that there is a food which is better than others, but this is generally not the case.\n1. The question is referring to the concept of nutrition and health.\n2. What the question actually asks is if there is any food which is \"better\" than others - healthy foods or nutritional foods. But no food is inherently \"better\" than other foods, as food is just food. Some foods are better for you to eat than others, but no food is \"better\" to eat than other foods. \n3. Therefore, because no food is inherently better than other foods, there is no food that is \"better\" for you to have than than any other food.\n4. Therefore, The answer is 0: \"There are no foods that are better than other foods.\" There's no food which is inherently or objectively \"better\" for us than any other food. \n5. Any food which has positive health benefits is only \"better\" for that specific person and situation than otherwise.\nAnswer: 0: \"There're no foods that are superior to other foods.\"\n\nInput: What can you do if a friend has an accident and needs immediate medical attention?

Choices:  * A: Playing a sport B: Exercising C: Walking their dog D: Picking things up E: They are deaf and not wearing hearing aid\nRationales: Let's start by eliminating the options that are not likely. Option A is out of scope as the question is not about why a person is using the stick. Option B and C are not likely reasons as walking with a stick can be done without any activity associated with walking and picking things up. Option D is unlikely as long sticks are not commonly associated with the deaf or hard of hearing community. Option E is not a likely reason as long sticks are more typically used for physical activity and a person not wearing hearing aids would not walk with a long stick for any activity.\nOption E is not likely reason because long sticks are not typically associated with the deaf community.\nThe question is asking for the most likely reason someone would be walking with a long stick. Since that person is walking and not exercising or picking things up. there is a high likelihood the stick is used for exercise and there is a logical conclusion that the deaf person is exercising and it is important to them to use the stick. This answer is still subject to debate, but there is no logical reason to eliminate this as an answer.\nAnswer: E. They are deaf and NOT wearing hearing aid.\nInput: Which one of the following is not an acceptable response to the question \"Do you have a minute?\" Choices: A: yes B: no C: in a sec D: later\nRationales: This question does not only ask for the literal answer.

A later answer means the person did not hear the question and will arrive", "answer": "B: woods"}

It is their job to stop it from spreading right? Choices: \n Choices: A: cure B: spread C: vaccine D: virus E: no\nRationales:\n1. The question is not asking which virus an expert in medicine knows to stop from spreading.\n2. It is not describing any cure and no expert in medicine knows how to stop a virus from spreading. Therefore, we should rule off choice A: cure\n3. Choice B: spread is incorrect because it suggests that the expert will only care for the virus and not its spread.\n4. Choice C: vaccine does not make sense. Vaccines are only known to provide immunity from infection of a virus and not stop a virus from spread. Therefore, it is not part of the job of any expert in medicine.\n5. Choice E: no, it is incorrect as choosing a virus as an option does not make sense.\n6.

Look at the context clues and think about what might happen in any of the options.\n1. Let us first check if B: if they cannot get on in a bus. People have a fear of driving because other people have given up driving altogether. So those people cannot drive and are forced to have a fear of driving. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n2.

John is playing with John's son B. John is watching John's son play with John's kite C. John and his son are flying John's kite D. John's son and kite are playing with John because he is flying them both\nRationales: When I read the initial phrase, I noticed it does not tell us who the kite and John's son belong to. For example: - John and his son are playing in the garden. - Who is the boy in the garden, John or John's son? We don't know if the boy is John's son, so we can't say he is playing in the garden with John.\nTherefore, I'll give up on this, except for the case in which the kite and the kid belong to John. My first guess and the most plausible for me is B. However, if the kite and kid don't belong to John, the wording in B is awkward since it could be confusing because who is the boy who is playing with John? - If that the boy is John' son, then why wouldn't we say that he and John are playing in the garden together? - And if John' son and the kite are flying in the sky because John is flying them both, why would we use a plural, in which John is flying two things, and not a singular noun and verb in which John is flying a kite and his son?

Choices: A: when the insect is being eaten B: the insect is under pressure C: a nest of insects needs to be exterminated D: when the bug does some damage to humans E: when the bug starts multiplying \nRationales:1. The question asks us to determine when an insect would require the services of an exterminator. 2. For extermination to be called in, the insect will need to be either being eaten, experiencing pressure or under attack, or be multiplying. 3. \"Being eaten\" is not likely to prompt such an action as the insect can already be eaten to death and still require extermination. 4. \"Pressure\" is another possible scenario prompting extermination, as the insect can succumb to it and die too, but this is less likely than the scenarios above. 5. With that in mind, the insect may also be multiplying, and this is the most likely scenario causing the insect to look for an exterminator. So that narrows down the options to :C: a nest of insect, needs to be extermination. 6.\"Nest of insects needs to extermination\" is the most logical answer and therefore the correct one.\nAnswer: E : nest", "answer": "D: answering questions"}

Therefore, we are left with 'cross road'.\nAnswer: A: cross road\n\nInput: Where could a person be to get to a store, they need to go fast? Choices:  C: grocery store B: restaurant D: supermarket E: convenience shop\nRationales: The question asks where a person can be to get to a particular store and they need to get there fast. The options mentioned are grocery store, restaurant, supermarket, and convenience shop. Considering the situation, only grocery stores tend to stock products that are not readily available. That is why people tend to have to go there fast in order to find what they are looking for at a time that suits them. \nAnswer: C: grocery\n\nInput: If you want to get to a destination fast, why should you not ride a bike if you are not in good shape physically?

{"text": "critically' implies the use of reasoning, planning and logical thinking. \n5. This type of mental process is not required in order to reach the visible store, and it's unlikely that 'cross road' would refer to taking a road by foot if the store is within visual reach.\n6. Therefore, it's more likely that the question is asking \"What, if anything, would a human do to get to the store that is in their sight?\" \n7. The answer, A: 'cross road' is the most likely option because it refers to the physical process of getting across the road, taking a path that is between two points or objects, which most certainly does include crossing roads.\n8. The other options would not be necessary if the store was already visible.\nAnswer: A. 'Cross road'\n\nInput: When can I have it?

So, the answer to this question is B: cross road.\nAnswer: B\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Input: Answer the following multiple choice question:\nGiven: 3 x 5 = 15\n\nRationales: (3 + 5) x 5 = 35 (5 + 5) x (3 + 1) = 100\n\n### Instructor's Solution:\nStep 1: Look at the equation and evaluate what's being multiplied. The equation is as follows: 3 x 3; The 3 is the number being multiplied on the x side of the equation and the 3 is the number multiplied on the x-side of the equation.\nStep 2. You've found the two numbers in the problem. Now that you've identified the two numbers (the 3 and the 3), find the product of the two numbers and plug in. If 3 x 3 = 9 then your answer would be 9. If 3 x(3 x 5) = 9 or 3 x (3 x 5) x 6 = 9 then your correct answer would be 9 x 6 = 54. If 5 x 3 =25 then your correct answer would b 3 x 25 should become 75.\n\n### Problems:\n(3 x (-5))\n\nThe sign indicates that the expression is negative, so to simplify it you need to flip the 3 and the minus sign. \n\n(3 x -5)\n\n(4 x 5)\n\n(-4 x 2)\n\n(-5 x 2)\nThis is wrong because (-5) times 2 does not give \"10\".", "answer": "C: listen to music"}

{"text": "Critically' is a reasonable answer but can be further elaborated.\n5. 'Cross road' is a possibility but only if they encounter a road before reaching the store, which might only be accessible via a different direction or mode of transportation.\n6. The only reasonable and logical answer in this context is 'walk'.\n7. Walking is the most direct mode of transportation towards the store which a human can do if they don't have any other restrictions.\n8. Therefore the answer is A: walk.\nAnswer: A walk\n\nInput: What doesn't help put the pieces of paper back together? Choices:  B: water C: oil D: paper E: glue\nRationales: There are many possible things that we can think of that would lead to the pieces of paper not being able to be put back together, but not all of them will help solve the problem.\nThe problem here is that the papers can't be \"put back together\" as they have been torn or separated out. We can also think of ways these things can help.\n1. We know that water does not, but oil does.\n2. We know that oil does not, but water does.\n3. We know glue does not, but oil or water might.\n4. We know oil does not and paper does not help\nSo the question really only asks us to eliminate those things that would possibly help solve the problem. \n5. All the solutions given so far would NOT help put the pieces back together because they are not things that belong to the same category.\n6. As in, water is not the same as oil or paper.\n7. So option E cannot possibly help because those given options are all of different categories.\n8. So this leaves us with only three options:\nwater\nglue\noil\n9. The next thing to do, is to eliminate water.\n10. If water was the answer then water would help us put ALL the pieces BACK together, not just a portion of it, in which case it isn't ALL that helps.\n11. Therefore it can only be glue or oil.\n12. Since the answer option was D, we can eliminate glue because oil is a liquid and we know that water was an exclusion.\n13. Hence, the answer is A, \"water.\"\nAnswer: A: Water", "answer": "D: blisters"}
{"text": "critically' is also irrelevant to the action of getting to the store directly.\n5. If they want to get to the store, human will 'cross road'. \n6. Crossing the road is the most practical response in this situation.\n7. However, if we consider all the context provided, we can understand the question is asking for the quickest, most efficient and sensible option. \n8. Therefore, we have to consider our human's behavior and reasoning when determining what they might do. \n9. The store is directly visible from where the person is standing, so it would make sense for them to cross the road to get there. \n10. The most likely actions by person in this scenario would be to try to cross the road to reach the store. \n11. Furthermore, it would be faster and more efficient to cross the road than to wait for a vehicle to come so one can cross the road, which is unlikely due to the traffic.\n12. The person cannot simply walk up to the store because they can see it directly from where they are. \n13. So, the best and most reasonable answer to this question is A: cross road. \nAnswer: A: cross road\n\nInput: What is an unused place where only a few animals travel and visit? Choices:  T: field B: river C: mountains D: desert E: forest\nRationales:  1. The only options that we can reject are \"field\", since that place is used for agriculture, and \"desert\", which is an uninhabitable place. Moreover, \"desert\" is not necessarily a place of \"only a few animals\".\n2. \"River\": It could be a place where animals live, but it should also have animals going through it. Moreover, it could be a river that goes straight or a river that goes through fields and forests.\n3. \"Mountains\" and \"forest\": Both of those options are populated by many animals.\n4. The best choice is \"the ocean\" since, although it is populated by a lot of animals, \"only a few animals\" use it as a place to live.\n5. Therefore, \"the ocean\" is the best option.\nAnswer: E. ocean\n\nInput: Where could a group of students gather to protest? Choices: T: cafeteria B: library C:", "answer": "A: toy store"}

Choices:  a) The climate b) The snow c) The skiing d) The tourists go home e) The shopping f) The Christmas market\nRationales: To go on a holiday implies visiting a place you haven't previously been to for fun or rest. There are a few different reasons, but why do people travel to cold or snowy places during the winter? They might do so because of the climate: to escape a warmer weather in their native place for a bit, or because of the skiing: to engage in sports like snowboarding, or to admire/enjoy snowy landscapes. Sometimes people travel for the shopping - and even Christmas markets - but only in winter do they happen in some touristy locations. But why would the answer be e) The shopping and not f) The Christmas market? Because the Christmas market is a touristy attraction that only exists in winter and is not the main reason people travel in that season. \nAnswer: D. The skiing\n\nInput: How does a human climb mountains? Choices: 1) they take a step 2) they start at the bottom 3) they are very fit 4) they use a car 5) they use an elevator\nRationales: The options are pretty straightforward - all humans have a step, climbing mountains does not require starting at the bottom, and using elevators does not require climbing mountains, and using a car does not require climbing. So the options are 1) they take it step 2) they are very fit The only way to climb a mountain is to take your step - whether in ski boots, snow boots, hiking boots or barefooted.

Choices:  Tap books Choices:  A. by turning pages B. digitally C. as a podcast D. by using a talking device E. as an audiobook\nRationales:  1. You have to read books to find out how they work.\n2. Turning pages is the most common way of reading a book on any device, including digital ones.\n3. Therefore, we eliminate 'digitally' and 'podcast'.\n4. Audiobooks are read-outs of text that can be read either on-screen or off-screen.\n5. Using a talking device, like an eBook reader only works if you have the book saved on the talking device.\n6. 'By using a talking device' doesn't necessarily require a device to read a book, rather a talking device (i.e. a talking e-book reader) is a device that already allows you to read books.\n7.

Choices:  a. do the second choice b. complete the task c. make a better decision d. make a choice e. think critically\nRationale: The question asks what the person will do after completing what they initially wanted. They will then have to make a decision or choice about making another choice or not. \nOption (d) cannot be correct because you cannot'make a choice' after you have already made the decision, completing what you wanted. \nOption (e) cannot be correct because 'think critically' is not a choice, it is still a mental process that helps you make better choices and decisions. \n'Complete the task' cannot be correct because you can only complete the task after making a decision to complete the task.\n\n### Example:\n\nInput: Are the two statements connected or not? The dog and cat ate their lunch together.\nThere is no chocolate cake in my kitchen.\n\nRationales:\n\nOption (A) can be eliminated because the statements do not have any relation to each other.\nOption (B) is also eliminated because it is a statement of fact.\nOption (C): If the answer is NO, then the person answered \u201cthe statements are NOT connected\u201d. If the answer is YES, the sentence can be \u201cThe conclusion from the first statement does not influence the second statement\u201d. Option (D) is another way to write Option (C).\nOption (E): This is the opposite of \u201cA:The dog and cat ate together\u201d because the statement is a result of the action.\n\nAnswer: C: If the answer is NO then: The conclusion from this statement does not influence the statement that follows.

The question asks about other people who have been on the farm for the entire summer.\n2. We can logically exclude options A (No one) and E (no one).\n3. We can also exclude B (Others) because it is unlikely that only \"one\" person has been on the farm or it is not necessary to explain that no other person was there.\n4. It is likely that C (Other people) is the answer to the question since there are people who work on the farm year round.\nAnswer: C: Others\n\nInput: In what way do mice and people differ? Choices: 0: by how they eat their food 1: by how they eat 2: by how they move 3: by how they reproduce 4: by how they move their homes 5: by how they run\nRationales: First, we determine what does not affect mice and people. Options 0 and 1 are out - we are told that mice eat their food, and so do people, so nothing here affects both. Option 2 is out, as humans can easily move, but we cannot see how mice can easily move, so this is out. Option 3 is out, because both move in the same way - they reproduce. Option 4 is out because mice can dig holes and people can't, and option 5 is out as, again, people can run but mice can only scurry. We can now eliminate 5 of the options, so there is only 1 possible remaining answer, and that is option 2 - \"by how they move.\"\n\nInput: The mouse was going on a journey.

However, not every road or walk is a cross-road and cross-walk, as in the context used to ask the question, specifically refers to a pedestrian crosswalk as it's literally a 'road' for pedestrians. \n7.

Choices:  the old town hall A: the house B: the garage C: the courthouse D: the school E: the barn F: the museum G: the church\nRationales: The first step is to identify what the criteria will be for determining the answer. The question says that it will be determined by the importance of the building, but it doesn\u2019t say what is being defined as important, so the next step is to determine that. \nStep 1: Looking at the options, it seems likely that the importance is determined by how important the building itself is, for example, its historical importance or whether it has received some kind of award. The options that refer to buildings being \u201cimportant\u201d are C, D, and G. \nStep 2: While all buildings have been built for some purpose, only three of the options refer to their function. \u201cOld town hall\u201d is used in the government sector, \u201cgarage\u201d usually being connected to vehicles, \u201ccourthouse\u201d being a judiciary facility, so the choices that refer to building function are A, B, and C. \nStep 3: Finally, the remaining choices refer to the type of building being selected from the group. So it seems that this criterion is likely to be more important than the building's function. The choices that refer to building type are A, B, F, and G.  Hence, we can conclude that the importance of the building will be determined by its type.\nStep 4: \u201cThe house\u201d, being one of the types of building, is likely to come from choice B, \u201cthe garage\u201d is similarly one of the types of buildings and so is also likely to be chosen from option B, but the next important one will be based on its type being \u201cthe church\u201d which is of choice G. \nStep5:The remaining choices would be \u201cthe old town hall\u201d or \u201cthe courthouse\u201d which is not a type of building but is likely to be chosen from A and C respectively because the question", "answer": "B: big house"}

However, 'Road' refers to a stretch of land that is designated for traffic, and is not necessary in this scenario.\n6. Therefore, we can eliminate the two remaining options and thus 'cross road' is a reasonable answer in this context.\nAnswer: A, which represents to cross the road.\n\nInput: Taking a shower allows for what?

{"text": "critically' is a more complex and thoughtful process but is irrelevant to the task because the action implies deliberating, and the store is already in sight.\n5. 'Cross road' is the most logical option because it's simply the easiest way for a person to go from point A to point B.\n6. 'Cross road', then, is the likely response to getting to the store, but still, it's vital to use the question's wording to figure out where the person must go that is clearly visible to them.\n7. Cross roads are found all over a place, but we don't know specifically where the shop is.\n8. We just need a road that is clearly visible to the person. The person clearly sees the shop.\n9. Therefore, the answer should be A: cross road. \nAnswer: A: cross road\n\nInput: Where would people find many birds for a group project on animals? Choices:  E: zoo A: pet store B: school C: beach D: park\nRationales: The question asks where the group project on animals would find many birds. We need to consider each option, assess what birds a person might find in their location, and how they would be in groups.\n1. \"E: zoo\" has birds in large groups but they are probably more likely to be mammals than birds.\n2. \"A: pet store\" has an assortment of birds but they are not usually found in groups. For example, they might be in cages or individual tanks.\n3. \"B: school\" would likely be the place to find a group project on animals, but it's not a place one goes to necessarily look at large groups of birds.\n4. \"C: beach\" doesn't give us a clear sense of group projects on animals.\n5. \"D: park\" has birds and is a good place to study animals. However, it also doesn't necessarily indicate a group project or a large number of birds.\n6. Finally, looking at the remaining option, \"D: park\", \"park\" can be a fitting location to study animals, and it does have animals in large groups.\n7. Moreover, it also provides an environment conducive to group projects.\n8. So, the answer could be \"D: park\". However, there's also \"E: zoo\" as a", "answer": "B: atlas"}

He will share one apple with me.\n* Rationales: The question wants to know what would a man do if a man has five apples. The first solution is \"throw away one apple\" then he will have four apples, so the question now becomes \"What would a man do if I have four apples?\" The next choice is \"eat what he wants\", which refers to the four apples. This means, you still have four apples to play with. The next choice, is \"cut one apple in half\", which means you could now share half of one apple with another person and you now have three apples to play with, or you could cut it again to make eve more. This same pattern will carry on until it runs out. You can answer B which is \"he likes eating applss\" as this answer, or any other combination of your answer will work.

'Cross road': An action that implies one needs to cross a road to get there, which is not required in the question context.\n8. The remaining choice is 'go in the direction of the store'. \n9. In this scenario, the direction of the store is directly towards us, so the correct option is A: cross road. \nAnswer: A: cross road\n\nInput: What is the most likely place to find a pencil with an eraser?

C) A backpack, D) \nan unused pencil, E) an art supply aisle, F) a pen case with pencils, G) an unused notepad Option: H) the library, I) a grocery store, J) \n\nan antique writing desk, K) an office.\nRationales: An anatomy of the question. \nStep 1: Identify the key components in play - Pencil and eraser. This is a compound object, with two parts.\nStep 2. Establish the scenario - Pencil with eraser, is the question. It is in a place where the action of finding could take place.\nStep 3. Determine what is and isn\u2019t possible - A possible place to find a pence could be inside a pen. Pencils are different, with an eraser.\nStep 4. Decide on the best place to look - Based on the information obtained so far, the best place to find a pance with an eraser is a desk.\nStep 5.

Why don't you and I go get a drink? D. Thank you for coming E. You look good in that dress! \nRationales: In this scenario, we would first determine what would be expected or appropriate to say in the context of a party. Then, we can eliminate by process of elimination as below:\n1. 1: You AE pretty is a classic, generic compliment people often say at social gatherings. We wouldn\u2019t expect a character at a party to say this when they first see her.\n2. 2. She is QUITE B is a phrase too long and not appropriate in the context.\n3. 3. Why don\u2019t you and I go E? is a suggestion, so it wouldn\u2019t be the expected dialogue someone might say if we saw someone for the first time at a party.\n4. 4. You look GD in that dress! is again a suggestion on how someone can improve themselves or their appearance, which is inappropriate when meeting someone for the first time.\n5. 5.

A: having a dinner party is not suitable because rain is usually not the best setting for having a party. \n3. Option B: building a fire is not suitable since building a fire in the evening in response to rain heavily is not an appropriate choice. \n4. Option C: telling jokes is not appropriate because telling jokes in response to rain heavily in the evening is not a suitable option. \n5. Option D: writing letters is not appropriate because writing letters in response to rain heavily, as a means of entertainment, is not suggested. \n6.

{"text": "critically' is an abstract concept that is not specific to the context of getting to the store, so it can be ruled out as an incorrect response.\n5. So, we are left with two options: A: cross road and B: see around.\n6. While the question only mentioned a single store, it can be reasoned that the store is part of a shopping center and the question is asking about the most direct path to the store within the shopping center.\n7. Looking at these remaining options, 'cross road' is the most concise and logical answer, as you'see around' a road.\nAnswer: A; 'cross road'\n\nInput: What if there is only one place or position to which a person needs to get or does, they have to take a chance on which? Choices:  E: jump E: guess E: take a chance E: pick one E: try E: wait E: pray E: search E: risk taking E: play the odds\nRationales: First, we determine what is being asked. The question is asking if someone is only able to choose between one option or one place or position where they need to get or be. \nNext, we can eliminate the choices by considering how the question defines 'taking a chance'. For any of the choice options that are listed previously, there is no such definition as taking a chance. \n1. 'Take a chance' does not make sense as the only option presented. For every answer listed, there are more than one way to get to the desired place but not every question is answered with only one choice, so this doesn't really apply as a useful definition for 'taking a chance'\n2. However, 'guess' is similar to 'chance' because both involve guessing or guessing at something but without any additional direction or meaning\n3.

It is not conceivable for a thief to steal the tire of a bicycle, making it the incorrect answer.\nStep 4: It is also implausible to steal the license plate, since it is often required to be registered and displayed on a bicycle for legal purposes.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, the possible answer is 10: License Plate.\n\nStep 6: In fact, no matter what parts of a bicycle is stolen, it cannot be a bicycle without a license plate.

The key to understanding the question is to understand that the word \u201ccan\u201d means to be able to do something, or have something.\n2. So, the important thing to understand here is that we are asked what thing one cannot DO, which makes \u2018have\u2019 an incorrect word.\n3. The first option is \u2018people\u2019, which could be interpreted as \u2018can one not have other people?\u2019\n4.

This is somewhat in the right direction, but could be written more succinctly. \n6. A cactus is an object, not people, and there\u2019s also a plural issue in the sentence. \n7. The following option is beams. This is too specific because this item (a beam) refers to an object. If you can\u2019t have anything, then you can\u2019t have a beam either.\n8. A car is too specific, because we\u2019re dealing with more general concepts of what we cannot have. \n9. The final option is lizard eggs, but again, this is too specific to a particular type of creature (lizard). \n10.

So, there is the remaining option 'cross road' which we can consider and eliminate any other logical possibilities to arrive at the correct answer.\nAnswer: A. cross road\n\nInput: What might one do to keep a bird from nesting on top of the store? Choices:  B: put a sign around the top of the store C: call the police on the bird D: move away from the store E: scare the bird off\nRationales: In this situation, you have a bird nesting on top of a store and you want to discourage it from doing so. So you may think, what can we do to get rid of it or stop it from doing so?\n1. The most logical thing you can try would be to'move away' from the store. You don't want to be near the store in the first place since you want to get rid of it, nor do you want to harm the bird or stop it from nesting elsewhere.\nSo, the answer must be'move away from the store'.\nAnswer: E. move away from the store\n\nInput: How can you stop someone from making a terrible noise outside of your room? Choices:  C: put a stop to it D: scream yourself hoarse E: scream loudly F: take a different kind of pill\nRationales: If I want to stop a noise, the most logical choice is to'make the noise' - louder than the noise. That will do the needful job easily and more effectively than other choices given.\nAnswer: C. Put a stop to it.\n\nInput: A man and two teenage boys were looking for the last ingredient for what?

{"text": "critically' and 'cross road' require the individual to be more than just in sight of the store. \n5. Thus, the correct answer is C: see around.\nAnswer: C: see around\n\nInput: What can't happen when people try to keep up with others? Choices: \tA: make people unhappy B: be the same C: do well D: be unique E: try\nRationales:\t1. The question asks us to identify what cannot happen when people try to 'keep up with others'.\n2. 'Make people unhappy' is an impossible outcome of attempting to 'keep up' as people are free to choose their own course in life.\n3. 'Be the same' and 'Do well' are both possible outcomes as the question allows 'keeping up' to take many forms.\n4. Hence, 'Be the same' will not happen.\n5. 'Be unique' is also a likely outcome as maintaining uniqueness is often a key drive to push individuals forward.\n6. 'Try' will also happen when people 'keep up with others' as they may try to keep up with friends or family. \n7. So, the answer choice that is impossible is 'Try'.\nAnswer: A: make people unhappy\n\nInput: What is not a part of a team? Choices: A: all of the possibilities B: one or more options C: none of the options D: both of the options E: none of the above\nRationales: Firstly, we must determine what a \"team\" is based on the question. While the question does not define a team explicitly, we can consider certain characteristics of one:\n- A team typically consists of individuals.\n- A team usually has a common goal.\n- Members of a team are expected to work together to achieve that goal, usually under the direction of a team leader.\nFrom these defining characteristics, we can eliminate answer choices that don't fit the criteria.\nOption A: \"One or more options\" does not fit as a team implies that all members contribute equally to the achievement of its goal and each member's skills and contributions matter. Hence, it is not a team if one or more options make the contributions.\nOption B: Option B has \"one or more options\" mentioned in it, so it would not be able to fit as a team.\nOption D", "answer": "E: elevator"}
{"text": "critically' or 'critical thinking' focuses on the thought process itself rather than the action of getting to the store from an available location.\n5. Considering all options we need to remove them based on the knowledge that the choice of words 'can't see' rather than 'can't see clearly' suggests that the store is in plain view.\n6. Looking at the remaining options, the answer 'cross road' (option A) is more likely as getting across a road is easier than getting around it. Considering all the given details:\n7. The store is located in clear view; it is not necessary to use critical thinking or drink coffee to get there.\n8. It is possible to walk and the road is close.\n9. The distance between the two locations is also short which indicates it could be managed in a short span of time.\n10. Therefore, the answer 'crossing the road' (option A), is an appropriate response for this question.\nAnswer: A. Crossing the road\n\nInput: I have a new house. I have nothing to cook with. What can I prepare at this moment? Choices:  H: bread B: tea C: nothing E: coffee F: water\nRationales: We first need to identify which option is incorrect. This can be easily done by reading through the remaining options and ruling out the one that doesn't make sense in the context.\n1. We can eliminate option E 'coffee'. This is because the question specifically says it only relates to a 'house' and coffee cannot be made without a stove.\n2. Option B 'tea' is related to the question as it can be made without a stovetop. This is also a common drink for people to consume without a stove. \n3. Option F 'water' is another correct answer. Water is readily available to people without a stove and can also be used for drinking or cleaning. \n4. Option B 'teabag' is incorrect as it would only be used with option E 'cofffee'.\n5. Option C 'nothing' is incorrect as you need an active ingredient to prepare anything.\n\nSo, the answer is either H 'bread' or F 'water'.\n\nAnswer: H: bread, F: water\n\nInput: Where is one best able to see one\u2019s past", "answer": "E: mail box"}

Choices:  I A: the weather isn't always right II B: the rain isn't always going to fall III C: the forecast doesn't always have to be accurate D: the day isn't always at high pressure\nRationales: The weather forecasts correctly predict that the day will be rainy.\n1. The forecast can never be right, as long as the day is expected to rain.\n2. It's accurate and reliable, the day is predicted to rain based on the current weather conditions and projected weather pattern.\n3. It doesn't always have be accurate, the weather never remains constant, so the forecast can still be valid even if it is not right.\n4. The day is predicted to rain because of the weather pattern not because the day will stay high pressure.\n5.

Choices: \nA: a single stalk B; 10 plants C: 7 plants D: no plants, only flowers E: all plants\nRationales:\n1. We can use logic to eliminate unnecessary options that might fit the meaning of \"plants.\"\n2. Since we know plants can not be flowers, we can eliminate the flower as a possible plant option.\n3. Focusing on singular items or objects can eliminate the possibility of looking at plants since they grow as multiple plants. Therefore, we should consider the flower as a single object and not a plant.\n4. Looking at the remaining options, we can eliminate option C: 7 plants, because \"7\" is a specific number and would not work for all flowers since it could only pertain to 7 specific flowers.\n5. Option D: no plants, we cannot look at flowers because they are plants.\n6. Leaving option E: all plants, this indicates we can look at plants which we know means we can also look at flowers. \n7.

Choices:  B: The prickly one has more thorns than the briar has branches. D: The briar plant only grows in patches by a river. E: The briar wears its thorns on the outside, while the prickly one usually doesn't.\nRationales: We start by eliminating the options that don't make sense.  The briar and prickly plants are both considered thorny plants, so option (D) cannot be the proper answer.\nThe briar plant is a type of vine, not a one-time plant that gets removed, so option (E), saying that the briar wears her thorns on the \"outside\", is incorrect. \nThe briar is a species that grows in one area while the prickly plant is a species that, when growing, does not stay in one place.\nThe briars branches have specific purpose while the prickly's have multiple purposes. \nOption (B) says that the difference is in how many thorns they have; however, this is not the sole criterion by which the briar becomes better.  \nThe briar's distinctive feature that separates itself from the prickly plant, is that it provides shelter for woodland creatures like hedgehogs, so option (B) is incorrect.\nOption (C) is technically true given that the specifications were 'thorny plant'.\nIn summary, although (C) is technica \nlly true given that the specific specifications were 'thone plant', in summary, the correct answer is option (A).\nAnswer: A: One wears its thorn to protect itself while the other one is used to climb trees.", "answer": "E: desk drawer"}

This is not a contradiction, it simply means that the virus could potentially be from a bacteria and it simply is not specifically classified as one.\nCells also fit this description, but it is not explicitly said to be from a cell.\nInsects obviously don't fit this description.\nThe only answer that fits this description is D.E: Insects\nAnswer: D.E : Insects\n\nInput: In what state was the shipping port called the port of entry for immigrants?

It might be a bit scary. Choices:  A. kill B. ignore C. call pest control D. eat E. pick and throw away\nRationales: The question is asking about a possible action for a person if they notice a bug.\n1. \"Kill\" would be an unacceptable choice since killing the bug is harmful, and the question specifically wants the person to do something without hurting others.\n2. \"Ignore\" is a possible solution since ignoring the bug would not cause any harm to it, but it would not solve the problem at hand which is seeing a bug and being scared.\n3. \"Call pest control\" is a good alternative since it would involve removing the bug, as opposed to causing harm by killing it.\n4. The last two choices are \"Eat\" and \"Pick and throw away.\" Both these options would cause harm to the bug which is not an acceptable option.\n5. Since it's possible to solve the problem while also avoiding hurting the bug, we can eliminate those two choices.\n6. \"Eat\" would not be a feasible solution, since most people are not going to eat the bug.\n7. \"Pick and throw\" would be a solution since it would remove the bug while also preventing harm, this eliminates pick and throw. \n8.

Answer: B: cross the road\n\nInput: In the 13th century, The Mongols conquered much of Central Asia as well as China with a force of soldiers called the what? Choices: A: infantry B: horsemen C: archers D: knights E: marines\nRationales: Options A, C, and D are all about military forces who were riding on (or into) battle. However, Mongol forces also conquered with infantry soldiers, many of whom were armed with bows. Option E is an entirely different group of soldiers who never fought for the Mongol Empire, so this is a reasonable assumption to rule it out. Option B, however, does not fit the context. Although it describes a soldier class that fought on horseback, it also has an explicit \u201cfrom horses\u201d, which implies that they were mounted but were not on foot.\n7. Therefore, answer B is incorrect.\n\nInput: The woman took the food without paying for it. It was what you do with what? Choices:A: her belongings B: others C: a good deed D: herself E: a car\nRationales: Option A is not about \u201cfood\u201d, \u201cbelongings\u201d, or \u201cgood deeds\u201d. The woman\u2019s possessions are neither given to her, nor used for her benefit. Option B is a good choice for \u201cher belongings\u201d.\n8. However, the given options don\u2019t fit the context of the question. Option D is simply the opposite of a good deed, so we can eliminate it.\n9. Option E doesn\u2019t even refer to what is done with what. So all the options except B can be eliminated. \n10. This narrows it down to B: \u201cherself\u201d. The woman is responsible for what she does.\n\n#### Example 31: Cars\n\nInput: How many car owners are living in the United States?

Therefore option 'cross road' is the correct answer.\nAnswer: A. Cross Road\n\nInput: Where can I find a store in the neighborhood? Choices:  - A: cross road B cross streets C: see above D: on the map E: across the park\nRationales:1. The question asks for a store in the neighborhood.\n2. Options that would be found in a neighborhood and not a store would be a cross street, a see above and a cross the park (or a sidewalk, an intersection etc.)\n3. Option A: cross road is relevant to finding a store in a neighborhood.\n4. The remaining options are irrelevant.\n5.

{"text": "critically' is a possibility and is a valid answer, if given more context.\n5. 'Cross roads' is the appropriate answer. Humans typically walk or drive to stores, making this option applicable.\nAnswer: A and B: cross road, see around\n\nInput: If you go from the store to a park, where would you be then? Choices:  P A: store B: park C: parking lot D: parking garage\nRationales: From Option B, \"park\" is the answer given. Looking at other options, Option A \"store\" is not the answer for Option 5 as the question asks to go from the store to the park. \nBased on this analysis, we can eliminate Option A \"store\" as an answer. \nThen, examining options B to D, \"park\" is clearly the correct answer because it follows Option P. \nAnswer: B: park\n\nInput: If I want to go to a park but I am not sure which one to go to, so what would I do? Choices: A: go to the nearest park  B: ask someone for the address  C: try to google it  D: ask someone where it is E: try my luck\nRationales: This question asks what action \"I\" would take if I want to go to the nearest park but I am not aware of where it is.\nFrom options A and B, neither of these choices is relevant as the person is looking for the \"nearest park\".\nOption C \"Try to find the address\" is not the action to be taken as they are looking for the \"near store\", not the park.\nOption D \"Try luck\" is irrelevant as the person is asking for directions.\nOption E \"Ask someone for directions\" is the correct answer as it directs the reader to action.\nAnswer: D E: Try luck D: Try my luck\n\nInput: Do you often dream of visiting a location? Choices: A dream of visiting B: I do not often dream of visiting\nRationales: The question is asking if the reader often dreams of visiting a location. Therefore, any other location in the question not named would be removed as irrelevant.\nLooking at the remaining options, we can exclude \"A dream of visiting\" as it includes a miswording: it is missing a verb.\nThe correct", "answer": "E: newspaper"}
{"text": "critically,' can technically fit as an answer because it refers to logical reasoning and problem-solving which humans need to do in order to get to where they want to be; however, it's not specific enough to the question and other options make more sense.\n5.

Choices:  L) follow the light  P) take a big step  X) don't walk  N) look in the direction of which way you are walking  M) walk slow C) be alert  H) walk quickly\nRationales: The question asks what to do when crossing the street. Since the options are listed, there is also a logical conclusion or order to the steps and answers.\n\n* L(L)  P(N)  X(X)(M)  C(C)  H(H)\n\nIn this way, we can eliminate each of the choices and narrow down the answer.\n\n* L (L) = 1\n* P (N) = 1+2 = 3\n* X (C) = 3+4 = 7\n* C (H) = 7+5 = 12\n* H (H)\n\nThe answer is H, since H follows the others (the order of the choices matters) and it is also the last letter in the sequence.\n\nInput: What's a city where the people live?

Choices:  a: on top b: in the top left corner c: in the side pocket d: above the zipper e: below the zipper\nRationales: First we eliminate the option that does not make sense. Then we find out which is the most logical option left.\n1. Option b: in the top LEFT CORNER - She probably does not want to keep the money at the top left corner of her backpack, only at the top of her backpack.\n2. Option a: on top - It makes sense because she would want to protect the money from wind and rain which could blow and ruin it.\n3. Option c: in the front pocket. We can eliminate option e: below the zippers because the front zipper closes the front zipper and therefore the money will be protected.\n4. So option a: top is the most logical choice. \nAnswer: A: top\n\nInput: When someone is playing the violin and wants to make it sound more melodious, what should be changed?

A: going to the movies B: movies C: go to the movies D: cinema E: drive\nRationales:1. The question makes reference to \"going to the movies.\" This implies that the person has already decided they want to go to the moviegoer, so the next step is to confirm that it is time for someone to go.\n2. The person has decided to go; however, they need to know if that person's plans align with their own. If not there is no need for a movie, so the next step would be to confirm 'it's time for someone to go'\n3. One can go to movies or go to cinema, but go is the verb that's appropriate for movies.\n4. \"To the movies' also implies going to the movies. While it is grammatically correct, it is not needed as the context already implies going to the moviess.\n5. If it was \"Drive\", it would also not make sense because that does not pertain to someone having to decide if 'it's time to go', as drive does not mention'movies'.\n6. Finally, going to movie is a noun so it does not need an object. If it did, one could say 'I want to go to movie'. However, one can not say 'I want movie to go'.\n7. Therefore, 'Going to the movies' is the likely response, meaning the person can now say they're ready to 'go to the movies'.\nAnswer: D: movies\n\nInput: There are many advantages to be a teacher if you enjoy children.

{"text": "critically' is a possibility, but the question does not specify that a person is mentally incapacitated.\n5.

Therefore, the answer to the question is A: cross road.\nAnswer: A : cross road\n\nInput: Who wrote 4 chapters in 5 hours and one book in 3 hours? Choices:  John Smith Freddy Jones Paul Smith \nRationales: We can identify that all the authors named are males.\n1. Paul is writing 3 chapters in an hour and a half, and 1 book in 3 hours.\n2. Freddy is writing 4 chapters in an hour, and 1 book every 3 hours.\n3.  John wrote 3 chapters in 51 minutes and 1 book in less than 5 hours.\n\nTo answer this question, we begin by comparing the three time elements to one another, which gives us the following: 1h 28m 6h 45m\n\nLooking at the above timespan, we can see that it is unlikely that Paul and John have the same time element because the numbers are different.\nThe time element for Freddy however, is 3 hours, which is also the same time element for John and Paul. \n\nConsidering the time elements, we note that John is the only one who has three consecutive time segments of an hour.\n\nWe can then cross reference the male authors John and Freddy with the times.\n\nJohn is: 1h 37m, 2h 7m and 2h 42m.\nFreddy is:\n3h, 7h, 3h, 3h and 3h.\n\nJohn is the only one who wrote a chapter in each hour given.

The only mode of transportation that is explicitly flying is a plane and thus the correct answer is 'airplane'. \n2. While balloons, trucks, and submarines can fly in a certain way, they do not travel directly in the air like a plane. \n3. The car and the submarine should be eliminated because they are on the ground, not flying like airplanes.\n4. And lastly, the airplane is more efficient than a balloon because it uses fuel to travel while a balloon does not. Even though the balloons are able to fly higher, the airplane is still a better option since it is faster and more reliable.\nAnswer: A airplane\n\nInput: Why did the chicken cross the road, the bunny asked while walking towards a rabbit hole?

E: It met another chicken on that side of the road \nRationales: The question implies a story in which a chicken is asked why it crossed the road and the chicken responds with an answer.\n1. Option A: Hungry: It may be an answer that the chicken would give, but it is not a story question.\n2. Option B: Mailbox: It may be an explanation for an independent or non-story situation.\n3.

{"text": "critically' could be a factor in decisions about where to go but it is not the specific action required here.\n5. 'Cross the road' is the only choice that fits the context of wanting to get to a store. A human does not cross roads to get to a store in their site unless they intend to walk across the road and get to the store from the other side.\n6. Therefore, the correct choice is B: cross road.\nAnswer: B, cross road\n\nOutput: When a question asks for a definition or explanation, the best answer is going to be a one-word response that explicitly provides that definition or explanation. \nExample\nLet\u2019s take an instruction that reads: What is the definition of the word rustic?\nThe answer to the question would be D: rural. This answer makes sense since rustic refers to rural, country life, which, in turn, can be defined as D: rural.\nRationale: 1. The definition of a word should be concise and to the point. A one-word answer is often the best way to accomplish this.\n2. Sometimes multiple words make up a definition of a word, but for the most part, a single word is sufficient. \nExample\nAn instruction asks for what another word is for the word bizarre. The answer to the question should be B: odd. This answer makes sense because bizarre can refer either to something odd or unusual, or to something strange. For example, you might say The weather today is bizarre and people would likely understand this to mean strange, but that\u2019s not how we\u2019re using the word. Instead, we would say what\u2019s bizarre is the temperature, which is odd and not strange. The definition of odd, then, makes sense and is concise.\n3. Whenever possible, the best definition of a word is a one-word answer such as D: Rural. Example: Another instruction asks for a definition of the phrase small fry. The answer to that question is D: small fish. This answer is concise, and to the point. It makes sense because small fry typically refers to something small, such as D: small fish.\nInput: The man wanted to make a left turn in traffic, but the driver behind didn't want him to so he was mad.

{"text": "critically' is not a valid option, this type of thinking is required for something else but not for getting to the store. 'Cross road' can be the correct choice but for different question.\n5. 'Crossing a road' is the obvious thing to do for anyone.

Choices:   A: give her a discount B: call security C: give her a ticket D: lower the price E: change her mind\nRationales:  1. The woman asked for a discount for a product or service as she was worried about the cost.\n2. 'Call security' is not an appropriate response. If the clerk feels threatened, they may call for security but in the process of getting the product or service the woman would have completed the transaction. No security needed.\n3. 'Give her a ticket' is the wrong option. She is asking for a discount and is not breaking a law or ordinance. Giving her a ticket would be excessive and she may even be given a ticket for disturbing peace. As this is a fictional scenario we are unable to verify whether security could be brought in but the option remains wrong.\n4. There is no mention of 'changing her mind' or 'raising a fuss' so there is no reason for the clerk to give her a ticket.\n5. 'Lowering the price' may be a reactionary option by the clerk to assuage the anger of the customer. However, it is not the desired response by the woman who only wants a discount.\n6. And as this is the desired discount, the option is 'give her a discount'. The correct option is 'give me a discount'.\n7. Therefore, 'give me a disount' is the correct choice.\nAnswer: G: give me a discount\n\nInput: The old man died on the bed, which type of room did he die on?

Choices:  G: to drink Coffee H: to think about a topic J: to stare D: stuttering I: to talk K: to watch the movie\nRationales: First, the question is asking about a reason why someone might keep their eyes down in a theater and how they would go about watching a movie while staring downward. \n2. While the action of \"stuttering\" would affect the eyes and body movement like eye blinks and facial expression, it's unlikely that one would stutter while watching a movie. Therefore, this doesn't fit the scenario. \n3. Although \"having a discussion\" could be technically done by keeping one's eyes down, it's not typically done when watching a movie, making it an inaccurate answer.\n4. Option I: Staring is often done by children when watching movies or TV shows. However, staring is not required to watch a movie, especially if you're in a theater where it's unobstructed and clearly visible to do so.\n5. Option K: Watching the movie fits the scenario as staring down in this case is necessary to watch the movie.\n6. Option J: It's possible that someone might be thinking about a topic while watching a movie. This action may result in a person keeping their eyes down for a period. However, thinking about a topic is not an exclusive reason for someone in a movie theater to keep their eyes down.\n7. There may be multiple reasons for a movie theater to lower their eyes. So the logical reasoning is to eliminate the options and find the answer that's the most common and most appropriate.\n8. By process of elimination and considering all the reasons mentioned, we find that the correct option is K - Watching the movie.\nAnswer: K: to watch the move\n\nInput: Where do most dogs get along with most other dogs?

We know that the human can see the store, so the only consideration is whether they are near or far from it. \n8. Therefore, they would either need to walk across the road or take a short walk and cross at an intersection in order to safely connect to the store.\n9.

'Crossing a road' is not a necessary requirement of the process, so it can be eliminated as well. \n6. 'See around' could be interpreted as 'wanting to look around for more ways to get there. \n7. But as the store is in their sight already, it would be illogical to assume that they'd'see around' to find other routes. \n8. Therefore 'cross road' and'see around' cannot be the correct answer.\n9.

The only answer that fits the situation is A: see around.\nAnswer:A: see around\n\nInput: The teacher and the students were making progress on their final project. Choices:  A. completed it B: finished it early C: finished it on time D: finished it bye bye E: quit early\nRationales:1. The question asks which of the options describe the students and teacher making progress on their final. \n2. Completed it (Option A) doesn't give any indication that the students and teacher are making progress, instead, it suggests they've finished it.\n3. Finished it early (Option B) implies they've finished it early, and are not currently making progress.\n4. Finished it on time (Option C) does not imply progress. It simply states they've finished it on time.\n5. Finished it bye bye (Option E) is not an option that would indicate progress.\n6. Finally, Finished it (Option D) only indicates they've finished it which doesn't indicate progress. \n7.

They can physically see the store and cross over to be right next to it without any effort beyond'see around'.\n7. Option D: 'Go to the store'. The store is visible and it would only require taking a short step to get to it. This shows the human has taken the most direct and easiest route to be at the store.\n8.

To eliminate the need for extra words like 'courtesy of the store,' cross the road is the only reasonable answer due to the lack of need to'see around,' 'drink coffee,' 'dream dreams,' 'think critically.'\nAnswer: B: cross the road\n\nInput: When do you know that you need to take care of your own business? Choices:  _A: when something is happening to you_. B: when something isn't happening to you C: someone else is doing it for you.\nRationales: The question asks when someone should take care of their own business. Therefore the focus is on determining when someone should take initiative to handle their issues and not depend on others and events to fix them. \nThe options given:\nOption A: When something is happening to you. \nThis implies that if something is happening to you then you should take care of your own problems and not depend on others. This is a narrow interpretation as the question asks about everyone who might need to take care of their own problems, not just themselves.\nOption B: When something isn't happening. \nThis is the same as Option A, and would only be appropriate if the question specifically asked about when something is not happening. However, the question asks about everyone. \nOption C: Someone else is doing it for me. \nThis makes some sense in theory. If someone else was helping you do something, then it would indicate that you did not have to take care of something yourself which would be appropriate to the question. \nHowever, the answer choice doesn't state whether this help was unwanted or requested. Considering both perspectives, someone might offer help with an issue (option C) as a way to show their care for you (option B). However, it could also be something that you do not want to be helped with by someone else, for instance, you would not want to receive help with a personal matter. \nTherefore, both Option A and Option B are inappropriate for the context of this question.", "answer": "D: soup"}

The alley was deserted and the dog ran from the alley as fast as he could. The man knew he had to find shelter somewhere or he would die. He decided that if he crawled under a truck he might be able to find enough cover for himself and his dog and perhaps stay dry if the rain really started to pour. He crawled under a parked truck.\n#### Scenario:The man crawled under the truck because he had to protect himself from the weather, and he believed he could hide there safely.\n#### In this task, you will be asked to write one sentence.

If they worked for 12 weeks with no days off, could they finish? Choices:  Yes: A Yes: B Yes: C No: D No: E\nRationales: We can identify the questions that the scenario is asking for the answers.\n- Is employee A available to work for a twelve hour shift?\n- Would they still be available after 12 weeks without any holidays?\n- Will the question result in a yes or no?\n\nThere are five answers given, four of which answer the questions that the scenario asks.\n\n- Yes: B means \"yes, I cannot work\".\n- Yes: D Means \"yes, I can work\".\n- No: E means \"no, we can not work together\".\n- Yes: C is the answer that would satisfy the scenario's second question.\n\nHaving identified the correct answers, we can discard the incorrect answers.\n\n- No: D means \"no, I can not work\".

Choices: \nOption A: a map\nOption B: a tourist\nOption C: nothing\nOption D: a compass\nOption E: directions\nRationales:  1. We begin by considering the options one at a time.\n2. The question says if you are lost then what can help. \n3. Option A which refers to 'a map' is something that can be helpful but not in the given context as this is in regard to someone who is lost which needs directions.\n4. \n5. Option B - 'a tourist' is a possible outcome from being lost which can help but is not necessarily a helpful option for getting directions in this context.\n6. Option C: 'nothing' doesn't make sense in the context as it's implied you need directions to get you unlost.\n7. Option D:  'a compass' is a piece of equipmet used to find direction but we need directions to find our way from being lost.\n8. Option E: 'directions' would be the best option as it is necessary for how to get directions in order to get to your destination after being lost.\nAnswer: Direction, E\n\nInput: What tool(s) might be used to find the north direction?

First, the direction of east and west is opposite but north and south is not.\n3. Option B : Using wind could not be used to determine north as it can only tell us more information about which direction has stronger airflow. (The direction of the wind)\n4.

Choices: 1 A: running 2 B: biking 3 C: overeating 4 D: overworking E: getting little sleep\nRationales: At a glance, the options seem reasonable responses for being confused and exhausted.\n1. There is nothing said in the question that suggests running could lead to confusion or exhaustion.\n2. Biking is more likely to cause confusion rather than resolve it.\n3. Overeating could lead to confusion and exhaustion, but only in regards to food intake.\n4. Overworking and getting little sleep have nothing to do with thinking clearly.\n5. The correct answer is option D: overworking.

{"text": "critically' does not make sense if the goal is simply to see the store, and 'cross road' is a possible action since roads often lead to stores. \n5. Thus, the answer is D, 'think critically.'\nAnswer: D: think critically\n\nInput: A man went to the store, he took what? Choices: A: cash B: money C: credit card D: pills E: debit card\nRationales: The question asks what the man took to the store. \nStep 1: We determine if any of the options are used at grocery stores as they might have been mentioned previously in the same context as in the question.\nStep 2 The given options are \"cash, D: pills, and E: debit card\". \nStep 3: Of these, \"pills\" do not appear to be a commonly taken at grocery stores, so they can be eliminated as an option as they do not commonly occur in such contexts.\nStep 4: Only one option remains as a valid choice: \"cash.\"\nStep 5: Therefore, the correct answer to the question is \"cash.\" \nAnswer: C: cash", "answer": "E: library"}
{"text": "critically' is the opposite of what is required; it's necessary to be straightforward rather than critical when following a store sign.\n5.

Choices:  I: read book II: ask friend III: try more harder IV: cry it out V: ask teacher VI: think about solution\nRationales: This question is testing your understanding of the English language; it involves reading and interpreting the sentence structure and identifying the key words which suggest a solution to the given problem.\n1. This question is asking for guidance on how to handle being confused in a situation.\n2. From the options given, it is apparent that only one choice can be eliminated since all the options but IV are possible solutions for someone who is confused.\n3. The sentence 'cry it out' makes no sense, perhaps suggesting that one should avoid anger, but it's clear that only the options III, IV, and VI offer solutions.\n4. Option III provides little information; 'try harder' is vague and unhelpful as it provides no guidance as to how or where to 'try harder'.\n5. Hence, the only option that stands out is IV where it's stated that the solution is to 'cry it out'.\n6. Therefore, Option IV is the correct choice.\nAnswer: IV: cry it out\n\nInput: How do you know that your teammate will pass you the ball? The question mark is used to say that the sentence is asking you to identify where the person might have put their ball. A: basket B: net C: field D: court E: stadium\nRationales: We can eliminate choices that cannot make sense:\n\n1. \"Stadium\" doesn't make sense if \"ball\" refers to a sports ball. There is no physical connection between the ball and the person who has the ball.\n2. \"Basket\", \"Field\", and \"Court\" also don't make sense, as they aren't likely to be used in the context of holding or carrying a ball.\n3.

Choices: 1: A: you 2: B: I 3: C: we 4: D: my best friend?\nRationales:\nThe answer to this question can be found by analyzing the sentence and using contextual clues.\nFirst, let's determine who is actually looking at the moon.\n\nContextual clues suggest that it is the best friend that is looking at the moon from behind.\nThere is no evidence that the speaker is the one who looks at the moon from behind, or any other other individual who could be looking at the moon. \nFurthermore, it is unlikely that the speaker would be looking at the moons from behind, as they are typically observed and studied from a distance. Therefore, the best answer given the context is D - my best friend. \n\nAnother way to understand the meaning of the sentence is to look at the structure used which typically means \"you...from...\".\nThe pronoun \"you\" is placed directly after the structure, suggesting that the subject of the sentence is \"you\".\nIf we rearrange this structure, it becomes \"I from he or she.\"\nThis rearranged structure can be interpreted as meaning \"I am looking at the moon from this person,\" or \"I am looking at it in a way that this person is looking at it.\"\nThe subject of the sentence then cannot be the speaker, since the speaker is not directly talking about themselves.\n\nRearranging the structure another step, this time to \"I from I\", leaves no other option than D - my best friend, since there is no other plausible candidate for the subject I.\n\nAnswer: D: my best friendship\n\nInput: When would one expect the carrot?

Choices: 1. A: computer 2. B: arms 3. C: vision 4. D: voice 5. E: personality\nRationales: The question refers to a robot and requires us to find out what it must have to be useful.\nWe need to determine the correct option for each level of a hierarchy, from the broadest to the most specific. Here, the broadest and most fundamental element of a robot is a computer and the most specific element of a computer is a computerised voice.\nLevel 1: The broadest element of a computer is the computer itself, which contains numerous components such as a processor, memory and storage, among others.\nLevel 2: A computer contains various parts, each of which is essential for a computer to function as a computer, one of which is the computerized voice.\nLevel 3: A computerized voice requires certain functions to operate.\nLevel 4: A computerized voice is used for communicating.\nLevel 5: A computerized voice can be used to communicate with humans, which is essential as robots cannot normally communicate with humans.\nThe only option that fulfills all the above levels of a hierarchy is option E. The correct answer is E - Personality\n\nInput: To be free, do you have to be in an enclosed space? Choices: \nA. No B. Yes\nC. Perhaps D. Maybe\nRationales:\n1. The question asks whether to be free, one actually needs to be in an enclosure. \n2. \"Yes\" doesn't fit here because it's not necessary to not be in an enclosed area to be free, as long as it's free to leave whenever you want.\n3. \"No\" doesn't fit either because \"no\" implies that you must be in an enclosure to be free, but this isn't actually true, as you could be free while in a house or other enclosed space", "answer": "B: aggression"}

Choices: \n A: famous B: large C: expensive D: small E: inexpensive\nRationales:\n1. The store was being mentioned as it was popular with people who lived in the area, so it's necessary t o determine what made it so. \n2. Considering the available options, we see that they are different characteristics that the store could display: \n  - 'Large' is a size of the store. \n  - 'Small' is the opposite of large when it comes to size. \n  - The store having'many options' is referring to variety, rather than how large it might be. \n  - An 'extravagant' amount is a high cost and so is more expensive than inexpensive. \n  - Lastly, the store being 'inexpensive' would make it relatively cheap relative to the other options. \n3. The store being popular does not indicate its fame, which can be ruled out. \n4. The store being 'large' or'small' would not make it popular. \n5. A good option for this circumstance is option A: 'Famous'. The store being 'famous' would cause it to be well known and well liked.\n6. Therefore, the store was very popular due to being 'famous'.\nAnswer: A: famous\n\nInput: A city of millions, which is on the map?

Sam would want to tell the facts about his city while being in the city, not in a different place or place.\nWe can therefore eliminate options that suggest being in a place other than in the city itself.\nOptions A, B, and C suggest going to the library, and thus being in the city of Sam's fact. Options D and E do not make sense. When Sam wants to tell a specific fact about his city, he could either sing or write a poem, but not draw or talk because he can do those in a different location.\nThe only option left is C: talk.\nAnswer: C: talk\n\nInput: What is happening in the following sentence? Choices: A. nothing is happening (correct) B. John is thinking C. John is doing D. John is learning E. John is saying\nRationales: When we consider what's happening in the sentence, all of the options are incorrect. Option A: nothing is happening simply because the sentence reads, John is thinking.\nOptions B and E: John is doing and John is saying are incorrect because nothing is happening.\nOption D: John is learning is incorrect because it implies something other than thinking.\nThe last option C: John is thinking, is the most likely choice as the sentence specifically describes his thinking process.\nAnswer: C:' John is thinking' (correct)\n\nInput: On which is the following question being asked? (A): of (B): towards (C): with (D): to (E): on\nRationales: Option (E) is correct because on is being asked for the location of, or destination of, the question. Option (A) is incorrect because it specifies of, which means, in reference to, instead of", "answer": "A: trunk"}
{"text": "' is not the proper verb tense for the scenario as the question is asking specifically about getting to the store rather than what needs to be done before getting there.\n5. So, we eliminate options C and E.\n6. Option A \"cross the road\" is an action that could lead to getting to the store (if there's another way to cross the road), so it needs to be considered as a possibility.\n7. Although it's possible to get to the store from the other side of the road, in general, most humans don't typically walk on the other side of a road just to get to a store. \n8. It's much more likely that humans would walk on the part of the road that can be seen, which eliminates option A.\n9. So the answer is D: \"think critically.\"\nAnswer: D: think critically\n\nInput: What is a human going to do if they see a person stealing their car? Choices:  T: give chase B: start the car C: lock the car D: hide evidence E: give the car to police\nRationales: First, we determine what a human would do in such a situation. \n1. The question asks specifically about a person stealing their CAR, not a different object, so it rules out options A and E.\n2. We can also eliminate option C because it's impossible to lock a car and still observe a thief trying to steal their car.\n3. Since they're not sure if it's a friend or family member driving the car, hiding evidence would likely be the last thought. Therefore, it rules out option F.\n4. We're dealing with a theft situation and most people are likely going to give chase (Option T), but that's not a logical option if the car is actually stolen.\n5. The only car-related option left is option B: \"start the car\". And since this is possible, this is our best choice.\nAnswer: B - start the car\n\nInput: If you were planning on getting a book to read. What might you purchase?

No\nRationales: The answer to both questions is no. The child's grandfather asks the child 'What's your name?' and the child replies 'John'. Therefore, the child has said he has a name, so number 4 is incorrect, and number 5 is correct.\nAnswer: B- No\n\nInput: What is it that I am looking at?

{"text": "critically' is also not a good option, as the human in question likely has the intention to get directly to the store, and it would be unclear if that means to buy something from the store, or if they have some other task in mind. \n5.

Therefore, the answer to the question is B: cross the road. \n\nInput: A boy needs a haircut. If he wears a hat, what is he most likely to do to cut his hair? Choices:  a: remove the hat and sit in the barber's chair b: keep the hat on, and stand in place c: move to the back of the room and stand on a chair d: take off the hat and sit on the chair e: sit on the chair without removing the hat\nRationales: The boy needs to remove the hat so he can sit down in the barber' s chair. This is the most plausible scenario and the only one that makes sense. The logical reasoning for all the other options is that they would stand behind a standing boy instead of removing their barber's chair hat. Thus these options are out of the question, hence the answer is C: move to the back and stand.\n\nInput: A warehouse is for _________.

Choices: A: productive B: busy C: smart D: impatient E: efficient\nRationales: In the context of a question, we can assume a person is not 'busy' with a task they've not finished. \nSo busy can be eliminated. Similarly, a person who gets distractibned is unlikely to be considered smart.\nAlso, a person who gets diatracted is not necessarily 'impatient'.\nWe can conclude that the word we are to complete the question is 'productive'.\nAnswer: A: Productive\n\nInput: What is another word for 'future'? Choices: A. past C. time B. present D. tomorrow E. last Thursday\nRationales: The answer to this question is C: time.

Choices:  C: the gym A: outside B: downtown E: library D: anywhere F: a bar\nRationales: This is a story problem type question. A problem is given, and students must provide a solution (or response) to the scenario posed. \n1. The scenario asks what to do if your pet can go where you walk.\n2. A dog or cat is capable of going along with its owner to the gym, downtown, and library.\n3. The correct answer is F: \"A dog or cat is capable.\"\n4.

Option A can be eliminated as Room 103 is found on the 10th floor, not the 1st.\n2. Option B can also be eliminated as the floor numbers are progressing ascendingly, meaning Room 1033 was on the ninth floor, not the first.\n3. Options E and D: 9 are incorrect as the room number is 1035 and not 935 or 91 respectively.\n4. Option C: 5 is incorrect as the room number does not add up to 5.

It is primarily produced by farm cows, cattle, and rabbits, and fowls. Rats produce no discernible amount of methane. As for the other animals you have specified, none of them are capable of producing methane at anything close to the levels of farm cows, cattle and rabbits. This is because farm cows, cattle etc have specific anatomies uniquely designed to digest more plant matter than rats or fowls, for instance. \n\nInstruction: Which one of these does not have 6 letters?\n\n1.

Choices:  O, A, B, E, C\nRationales: A. Let's understand the question first to eliminate the options and select the right answer. \n1. The context of the answer is a 'location'. So, location is the answer type.\n2. We have to find the location which is causing a racket made by the boy. \n3. O is out of question because 'racket' only refers to noise and there is no noise or racket that needs to be contained in O.\n4. A is also out because 'out' is used for making something outside. We have to find an option that is about noise in a location.\n5. The option B is also out because the location here is 'at night'.\n6. The answer is a location so we cannot pick an option that is not about a location. In such a case, option C must be the right answer.\nAnswer: C\n\nInput: The girl was playing, then she stopped because she was what? Choices: A. tired B. happy C. finished D. annoyed E. hungry F. tired\nRationales: There are two types of tiredness. One is related to energy and another one is related to completion. Let's study both and eliminate the options.\n1. We have to understand the context of 'playing'. When we play there is no end to it. It is a process which is done until we have the 'play'. It cannot be called as a game. So playing is used for a process and finishing is the condition. So the answer must be related to 'finished'. \n2. The opposite of 'finished' is 'tired'. So it's an option to be eliminated.\n3. Angry is an emotion which will end in some condition, it's not completed or finished. \n4. B is out as well as it's related to 'happy'. Option A also excludes from consideration as we have to consider all negative options.\n5. It's also", "answer": "D: agony"}

Choices:  A) studying B) writing a book C) working D) answering questions on quiz E) researching F) watching TV\nRationales: We can see that all options besides B, F, and E fit the criteria. \n\nThe daily newspaper is something that is read in the morning, so it can't be used to write a book.\n\nOne would answer questions on quiz only if they are reading the daily newspaper.\n\nThe daily newspaper cannot be used to research anything, nor can it be viewed on the TV. F: watching TV.\n\nThis leaves us with choices A: studying, and B: writing a book. These two options are similar so let's do a comparison of their meanings. \n \nStudying means carefully studying a textbook or other piece of information. To study means to systematically attempt to learn something. \n\nWriting a book means working on a literary or technical project. (For example: I am working on writing a book.) \n\nThe phrase \"working on\" is the one used in everyday conversation to refer to any sort of project.\n\nThe key difference between the two choices A: studying and B: writing a books are that someone could be studying a book, but not writing. This is because studying is often followed by \"on\", which implies they are making a concentrated and sustained effort to learn it, and this means they are not necessarily producing anything. \n\nIn the case of a Book, \"writing\" does not mean they are writing the whole book or even a chapter or section. They might be working on a specific part or part of the idea for the book.\n\nIt is obvious that the person is \"reading\" the newspaper, but the question doesn't ask what they are doing, but why they are doing it. (the daily newspaper is studied, read, or researched for the reasons of learning something or finding out about something.)\n\nThe question is more about the actions and motives behind their actions, rather than the action of", "answer": "A: edge"}

Choices:  B: go to a farmer's market A: go to a candy shop C: get some money from mom D: sit on mom's lap\nRationales: -1. The question asks for a statement that identifies a possible means of getting ice cream for a child's treat. \n-2. The options given imply certain feasible actions or states. Options C (Mom), D (Mom's Lap), and A (Farmer's Market) are not logical as they do not directly lead to getting the child the ice cream he or she is craving.\n-3. The only viable option is option B (Go to a candy shop). The child could simply go to a candy store and buy some ice cream right then and there without asking for mom's help.\n-4.

Choices: A: she gives life to others and can help them grow B: it allows one to move forward C: it helps children gain confidence D: it is easily broken\nRationales: One could potentially use various definitions about a \"mother\" to answer this question. We examine the logical reasoning for each option to determine which best describes the relationship of a toy to a mother.\n1. Option A: \"gives life\" and \"helps others to grow\" are in line with how a child may view a toy. A toy can allow a child to imagine themselves as the characters in a toy and potentially use that toy to learn, grow, or explore concepts. If a toy is broken or no longer usable, it can be donated or disposed of and a new toy can be acquired. Therefore, the toy and mother are similar as they can help facilitate growth.\n2. Option B \"moves forward\" may be", "answer": "D: surface of earth"}

Considering that this refers to a car specifically used to transport goods or supplies, which usually refers to larger vehicles (B). This would also refer to a trailer or something towed behind the large truck (A).\nWe know that a pick up cannot be used out of town since it's not possible for a person to drive their pick up outside the town where they live.\nTherefore, the answer is that the large truck would be used out of the town, which is in agreement with the given answer.\nAnswer: B.

So, the option E: \u201cit did not have a plot\u201d has been eliminated. - Even by being boring, it does not mean that it does not have a plot, so the option D: did not have a plot has been eliminated. \nRationales: It can be disappointing if such a movie does not have any action scenes, which is why B: \u201c it had no actions scenes\u201d has been eliminated - Because a movie may not be boring by not having a plot even if it did not have any action scenes in it, it can be eliminating C: \u201chad no action scenes,\u201d as well - A movie may be boring, regardless of whether it does not have a great plot or there are no action scenes in it, so the option D of \u201cdid not have a plot\u201d is not likely to be disappointing.

Choices: 1. A: slides 2. B: ppt 3. C: audio 4. D: images 5. E: visual\nRationales:1. The teacher said that 'Visuals were the most important aspect for their presentation'. This means the most crucial element for a successful presentation was the visual aspect.\n2. A'slide' refers to a written passage or the like, while a 'ppt' refers to a PowerPoint presentation which would not be directly related to 'presentation' as the term used.\n3. 'Audio' may be used for background music but would not be necessary for a good presentation according to the teacher's statement.\n4. 'Image' may be used as visuals, but would not be the primary visual used in a presentation.\n5. Finally, 'visual' would be the most relevant and appropriate answer to the question with the teacher's statement clarifying the primary visual used in their specific presentation.\nAnswer: Visual\n\nInput: When the teacher asked the class to give suggestions, she told the students that she would select the best responses. What is a suggestion someone is encouraged to make if they would like to do better as students? Choices: \tA: stay quiet B: ask more questions C: not answer questions D: answer more questions E: not answer questions\nRationales:\t1. The teacher told the students that she will pick the best answer. This suggests the best answer will be chosen for any question that needs a response and will be regarded as the best answer by the rest.\n2. Therefore'suggestion' in this context would be the best answer or response, as an answer that is considered the best by the rest or chosen as the best answer is a suggestion.\n3.

{"text": "critically' is not a reasonable answer because critical thinking skills require thinking deeply about all available choices and opportunities, not just about which direction to go in.\n5. 'Cross road' does not make sense because a road could lead to an entire store district full of stores, so it would not be sufficient to get to any particular store.\n6. 'Cross road,' which is the only remaining option, is a reasonable choice because it is a familiar activity humans normally do to get to more specific places, such as the store.\nAnswer: C: Cross Road.\n\nInput: Why do I like to exercise? Choices: 1) A: I make my muscles burn. 2) B: I get rid of extra calories. 3) C: I love the feeling after exercise. 4) D: I'm trying to improve my physical self. 5) E: I like getting compliments.\nRationales: This question is asking us to select the option that best describes why the speaker likes to exercise.\n1: A: It is not true that burning muscles is the main reason people exercise. Yes, weight and cardio exercises can raise your heart rate, inducing muscle burn, but studies have failed to prove that high heart rate during exercise is the cause of muscle burn. To put it simply, an elevated heart rate does not necessarily mean muscle burn.\n2: B: Calorie expenditure occurs not because of exercise, but as a result of it. Calories are actually used as fuel for the body, meaning that they are used to keep the heart beating and perform other critical muscular and organ functions. Although exercise may cause your body to burn more calories, it is not the reason people exercise.\n3: C: A feeling of healthy physicality post-exercise is a very common reason people enjoy exercising. The feeling of a strong and toned body is a powerful, positive reinforcement encouraging people to exercise. This is the main reason mentioned in the audio.\n4 : D: The speaker states that he is trying to improve his physical self. This is in line with the reasoning given to motivate why the speaker enjoys exercising.\n5: E: This cannot be the correct answer because exercise is not done with the hope of receiving compliments from others.\nAnswer: E.", "answer": "B: hotel"}

Choices: .A: put it down on hard ground B: move it one inch at a time C: carry it in back D: roll it E: leave it\nRationales: Consider the question carefully and look at the options.\n1. Option A: put it down on the ground. This could work as the last option, when all else fails. However, there are other options which can be accomplished.\n2. Option B: move it one at a time. This would be inefficient, because moving one thing at a time would be very slow.\n3. Option C: carry it in the back. This would be impeded by space constraints. Backs do not typically have sufficient space to carry large trunks.\n4. Option D: roll it, would be impeded by weight. The trunk might be too heavy and rolling it would be quite impossible.\n5. Option E: leave it is irrelevant and could be eliminated as all options that could be carried cannot be left unaccompanied.\n6. One other option could be carried if a person were able to lift it and keep it overhead, which could be the case for a large trunk.\n7.

Choices:  -  not possible\nRationales: The question is asking about the perspective of being a passenger in a vehicle. \n1. It is unclear if any option is included because the options provided are \"the front\" and \"the back\". \n2. The question does not ask where one gets their perspective, but instead refers to a perspective when they are a passenger in a car. If any passenger is in any place in the car i.e. front or back, this does not change their perspective.\n3.

Choices:  KS: understanding of the language KF: grammar KE: practice KK: time management KO: confidence\nRationales: First of all we understand that the student requires help from the teacher due to the context of the situation which is a question on this subject. \nThen we understand that the question is asking what the teacher would give in response to this situation by which we understand we need to give a specific response. This excludes \"confidence\" as confidence is something that cannot be given it can only be something that is found already.\nThe question excludes \"ke\" options are given for practice and understanding this being given from the student not the teacher.\nThe question exludes time management as this is the students responsibility to manage properly and is not something given from the teacher.\nThe teacher would however provide \"practice\" that would show the teacher is helping the student with the language or grammar in this context \"practice\" is more likely as the question is asking what they teacher would help the student with by which we realise we must be specific about the help given by the teacher\n\nAnswer: KP: Practice", "answer": "D: pass sentence"}

Choices: \tA: footwear B: umbrella C: rainfall D: clouds E: air\nRationales: The question asks which location is not needed if you're walking through the air, as in the atmosphere that we breathe. \n\nWe can eliminate answers using logical reasoning and common sense:\n\nFootwear: Footwear, or shoes, is a type of covering (shoe) for our feet. They are useful on solid ground but not necessary for walking through air as you do not need to touch or walk on surfaces that can be found in the air (i.e. clouds, rain, etc.).\n\nUmbrella: An umbrella is designed to shield us from rain by providing protection from precipitation, so it is not necessary for us to protect ourselves from rain if we are walking through air. Therefore, an umbrella is not needed when walking through the air.\n[Detailed Solution](https://codesignal.com/questions/3987872/walking-through-the-air)\n\nRainfall: Rain cannot occur unless there is a sufficient amount of moisture in the air, so rain is not needed if you do not encounter precipitation. This is also implied by the question: we are asking about walking through the air (air = no rain) rather than specifically referring to rain.\n\nClouds: Clouds are naturally part", "answer": "E: hospital"}

Crossing the road is an indication that the human wants to leave the area they are at and travel to the store that is visible. \n7.

After identifying what the question is requesting, we can eliminate some options by logical deduction. \nFor example, option A: be organized is not a plausible candidate because the job is not limited to one member of the band. Additionally, it does not provide a clear description of the task necessary to help the band become a successful and professional music group.\nLikewise, Option B: get an audience cannot be the answer as this does not appear to be directly related to the task at hand, as it refers to attracting people to attend the band\u2019s concerts.\nOption C: know how to do a concert would be a perfectly acceptable answer if there were a concert to perform at, and if all band members were present and all were performing, which would not be possible if someone is not there.\nOption D: discipline is an essential part of being a professional musician; however, it does not seem to be directly linked to the task at hand where one is needed to act as a music teacher for unskilled band members, suggesting the required member must know how to conduct a concert. \nBecause conducting involves leading and guiding a group of skilled musicians, Option E: Leader, seems the most appropriate answer: a knowledge of how to lead a competent and established band.\nAnswer: E.

B: red light\n3. C: man 4. D: turn 5. E: walk\nRationales:\n1. The first option given is '1: a signal.' This is technically not correct. The term \"stop sign\" can be used to describe a red octagonal sign with \"STOP\" printed on it. A signal is a visual cue that precedes another event, such as a green light that signals to go.\n2. The next option is '2: red light.' This is a closer match to the context; however, it also requires the woman to have her hazard lights on, which is unlikely in this case.\n3. Considering the context, option '3: man' may be correct as the answer because it implies the woman is waiting for a man to either turn or walk across her path. This is possible if she is waiting to allow a vehicle or pedestrian to cross her path, indicating a potential hazard.\n4. Option '4: turn' can be eliminated because the woman is indicated to have been waiting at the stop sign for other people to cross her path, not for her own turn.\n5. The remaining option is '5: walk.' This option could also be correct as a woman might be seen at a stop sign but would eventually continue walking if she intends to go wherever the stop sign is located.\n6.

'Cross the road' only applies if a human is walking to the store. This option cannot be confirmed as a definite course of action as it may not happen.\n6. 'Get on a bus' implies waiting for the bus and requires traveling on the vehicle for longer distances which isn't directly applicable to what a human do if they're trying to get to the store which they already see in plain view.\n7.

Choices:  a. water b. grass c. dirt d. earth e. planet\nRationales: The question is about what earth, water, and grass have in common with dirt.  \n1. Water (a) refers to the liquid form of water. It is not relevant to the question.\n2. Grass (c) is not included in the options provided.\n3. Dirt (d) is neither earth nor grass.\n4. In order to understand the connection between earth and grass as well as the other two options, consider the context of the question.  \nIt is asking us to find what earth & grass have in common with water.  \nFrom our earlier considerations, we know that earth and grass are not common items with water. For a connection to exist, it must be among these three.\n5. Earth (e) is not connected to water, so we need to choose again.\n6. We are left with grass and water. But they cannot be connected if the choice involves all three.\n7. We, therefore, have to choose an option that has a connection only between water and grass, which leaves only option B: grass.\n\nAnswer: B: grass\n\nInput: In which of these will you find a person that is happy in life?

A: anxious B: disappointed C: embarrassed D: excited E: humiliated\nRationales: The question is asking about how the man would feel if his father came to town. There are multiple options provided and each one should be discussed in order to figure out which is the most fitting.\nAnxious: An anxiety is a distressing emotion aroused by impending danger, evil, pain, etc., whether the threat is real or imagined, and whether the threat is to oneself or to others. Because the father is not dangerous or an enemy who is coming to hurt the son, we can eliminate option A, anxious.\nDisappointed: If the father was not coming for a positive visit, this option would be more appropriate, as it implies that his son might become disappointed because of this negative visit. Considering that the father is coming to visit for a positive occasion, this option cannot be selected.\nEmbarrassed: This option does not describe someone\u2019s feelings towards their father\u2019s visit and it is unclear why they would be embarrassed by the visit, therefore, this option cannot be chosen.\nExcited: This option best fits the requirement of \u2018positive\u2019 emotions by describing a joyful reaction a person may have upon seeing a loved one visiting. Because it fits perfectly for the task, this option is the best choice.\nHumiliated: This option does not make sense because a father coming to town for a visit would never make anyone humiliated. As such, this option cannot be the best choice, as it does not describe what the man should feel.\nAnswer: E. excited\n\nInput: What is the next word of this sequence?

It's typically used in sentences to refer to a specific object.\n4. \"To express feelings\" does not make sense. It cannot refer to a concept or action, but only to a human emotion.\n5. The last and only option left from the rest to be a suitable answer is \"To refer\". This would be the correct answer to the question.\nAnswer: D2: to refer\n\nInput: Where at the office would the employee place the letter?

But there were two doors that I could have walked through. The first door was where? Choices: A: entrance B: kitchen C: hallway D: stairway E: bathroom\nRationales: Let's take a moment to think about the question and the possible answers. In the context of finding a kitchen, the bathroom is obviously not the most likely destination.\nIn the context of finding a room in a house, the stairs or hallway may seem like logical candidates but think about it \u2013 why would you take the stairs just to come down again to get to the kitchen?\n\nSo, if we eliminate options A, C, D, and E, that leaves just the answer B: kitchen.

My road is ________ my road. Choices: A: long B: near C: in the middle D: a block E: two blocks\nRationales: Option A (long) and E (two blocks) both seem plausible, but the only correct answer is C (in the middle).\n\nIn any case, what is the road we actually get on to find our house? It can\u2019t be \u201clong\u201d or \u201ca block\u201d from the house; it has to either be \u201cin the middle\u201d or \u201cnear\u201d the house.\n\nIf the road leads to the house, then the road is \u201cin the middle\u201d of the house; if the road does not lead to the house, then it is \u201cnear\u201d the house, because there is no logical alternative.

{"text": "critically' can be eliminated because they are not likely to think critically while crossing the road just to get to the store.\n5. There is little benefit to them in 'crossing road' because they can already see the store from wherever they are if 'they do not want to make any wrong moves' because that move means they have to move to get to the store and it is only beneficial if they are too far away from the store.\n6. 'Cross road' is therefore the only remaining option, as it describes the action of walking to a different location to reach the store.\n7. So, 'cross road' is the answer.\nAnswer: A Cross road\n\nInput: At what point in a process are we not required to do it again? Choices:  a. before all steps, b. after all steps, c. after one step, d. at any point, e. when we are finished\nRationales: The first step is to identify which step is being repeated. Then, we can eliminate any of the other answers that are not likely to happen more than once.\n\nStep 1:\nWe are not required to do it \"after all steps\" because we will do it again after each step, so we can eliminate that answer choice.\n\nStep 2:\nWe are not doing it \"before all steps\" because we would already have done the \"first step\" before reaching the \"all steps,\" so we can eliminate that choice as well.\n\nStep 3:\nThe answer to the question is not \"after one step\" or \"when we are finished\" because in each case, there remains additional steps to be done, so the entire process is not finished until all steps have been completed multiple times.\n\nStep 4:\nWe can eliminate the answer \"at any point\" because if we are required to do something at any point after a step has been done, that means doing it would not be one of the steps.\n\nStep 5:\nSo, this leaves us with one answer choice: \"before all steps,\" so the answer is a. before all steps.\n\nAnswer: b. before all steps\n\nInput: What could I not see in a forest?

{"text": "critically' is also irrelevant because the question isn't asking why the human would want to get to the store, but rather, how they would get there.\n5. Similarly, 'cross road' is not an appropriate choice here because the human is already on the road leading to the store. \n6. Therefore, the correct choice here is'see around.'

Choices: \tA: eating B: going to bed C: waiting D: calling for help E: staying up\nRationales: First, the question asks what is often done after a person has worked for a whole day. \nAs there are several tasks related to going to bed, choosing the correct answer will require logical reasoning and some knowledge of typical daily routines. \nThe answer is A: eating. People need food to maintain their energy levels and stay awake after a long day\u2019s work. \nThis is why eating is often the next task done after a person completes their work for a whole day.\nThe first three options do not make sense as they do not relate directly to working, but rather, what is often done in the evening.\nThe word \u201cnext\u201d in the question does not make sense as what\u2019s described in the answer choices can also be done earlier or later in the day as well as on a regular basis.\nFor example, a person may have worked a whole day in the afternoon but then still stay up and call for help later in the night.\nThese factors indicate that the correct answer choice needs to be one that is related directly to working, not to a list of regular evening activities. \nThe first four answer choices describe general evening activities, but the remaining choice, B: going to bed directly refers to going to bed before the evening ends and can be excluded as an option.\nAnswer: A \u2013 eating\n\nInput: What can a woman do who is searching for her missing cat?

The mountainous areas (option A) require a lot of driving back and forth which is an inefficient way of moving materials.\n\n2. The desert (option D) doesn't offer any benefit to ease transportation.\n\n3. Snow (option C) is notorious for being difficult to navigate but not efficient for moving objects either.\n\n4. The lakes (option E) are also inefficient and do not offer any advantage.\n\n5. That leaves option 'farms' (option B). Farmers often use large trucks to move their products more efficiently.\n\nAnswer: B: farms\n\n\nInput: An area that is covered by lots of dirt and rocks which you might see in a desert what kind of place?

E: grassy hills\nRationales: Since a desert is typically covered in lots of dirt and rock, it follows that a desert would probably be a good place to find dirt and rock.\n\n1. Option 'a lake' (option A) does not make much sense in this context because lakes are typically not covered in dirt and rock. Although lakes can sometimes have dirt and rock near their banks, a desert is quite different from a lake and would not usually have dirt and rock in abundance.\n\n2.

{"text": "critically' fits the description of what the human would do to get to the store, as it requires thoughtful analysis and planning to travel to the store.\n5. The phrase \"drunk of coffee\" is a typo, it\u2019s supposed to be \"drink of coffee,\" so it\u2019s not an option. This can be easily detected as a spelling error.\n6. It's unlikely a human would be using the store as a metaphor for thinking critically when trying to get to it. Therefore, we can eliminate the option \"think critically\"\n7. Finally, the phrase \"dream of dreams\" doesn't make sense and could not be considered an action or pathway towards getting to the store. So, we can dismiss it as irrelevant.\n8. Therefore the only reasonable answer is C: \"drink coffee.\" It's reasonable to assume that if a human is trying to get to the store and they can already see it, they would likely drink coffee as a form of physical stimulation to get themselves up and going to the store.\nAnswer: C: drink coffee\n\nInput: How does the plumbing in a house provide comfort? Choices: \u21be A: heat it heats up \u21be B: cools it down C: puts it back down a level D: keeps it cool E: keeps it wet\nRationales: The first word in the question is 'how'. It indicates that we are asking specifically how.\nLet's look at option A 'Heat It' to determine how it provides comfort.\nFirst, let's consider \u21be option A: heat it heating up as this describes the process of increasing heat, which is a form of energy. \nIt's unlikely that an increase in heat provides comfort, so this is unlikely to be the answer. Option B cools it down also has this same issue as the increased coolness does not necessarily provide a sense of comfort. \nOption D keeps it cool may also be considered because many people enjoy a cool environment. However, this option also suffers the same issue as a decrease in temperature could provide a sense of comfort, but the reduced level of coolness may not provide the same level of comfort.\nOption C puts it back down a Level may provide the correct answer as it provides a sense of equilibrium.

'Cross road' involves crossing a road, which may or may not be necessary depending on the location of the store. \n6. Finally, 'walk' is the most relevant option to the task because it refers to just a one-step action for getting to the store.

Choices:  (blank)  A: store B: street C: same place D: different place E: same time F: different time\nRationales: The question asks how a person could get the same items as another person, so we can eliminate options that aren't appropriate. If A: same place or B: same time were chosen as answers, then the question would be asking 'How can a person get something in the same place/time that someone else has?'.\nLet's consider options C: different place and D: different time.\nOption C: 'different place' doesn't match the context of the store, so this can be eliminated as an option for getting the same items as another individual.\nOption D: 'different time' also does not match the context of the same time, so this too can be eliminated as it doesn't align with the question.\nThis leaves us with a more narrowed down list of options - A: same place, B: same time, E: same time, and F: different time.\nLooking at the two options that provide an answer - B: same time and F: different time - we'll first consider the contextual fit. The options are: same time or different time. The question asks how a certain person can obtain the exact same items as another person.\nWhen we imagine the person getting the same items as their friends - such as their friends going to the store at the same time as they do, or choosing the same products - we see that we need the'same time' option. \nHence, the logical answer is B: same time.\n\nInput: A bear, a lizard, and a mouse are", "answer": "B: bamboo grove"}

Choices:  a: pots and pans B: sugar C: salt D: pepper E: nails\nRationales: First, take a broader step back to look at the question \u2013 what is the world lacking that would cause us to want to use coffee to replace it? Coffee is something that would be of general benefit in any quantity, so if we knew what it was the world could not use coffee to fill the void. In most cases, coffee can supplement another substance rather than supplanting a shortage, so the answer has to be something else. It must be something that the world cannot afford to go without, be it in quantity or entirely. \n1.\tConsidering the coffee cannot replace something in demand, it is safe to cross out the word POTS. 2.\tThe next reasonable thing cannot be coffee. It is not possible that coffee replaces the supply of it. 3.\tWhen it comes to \u201creplacing the world\u2019s supply of coffee with something else...\u201d, one can imagine the following five options: sugar, salt, toothpaste, nails, and pans. Since sugar is something the world cannot live without, it is clear that it is highly unlikely that you would like to replace the world\u2019s supply with sugar. 4.\tThe next question that arises is why a replacement has to be something that the world can not do without.

C: got on his bike 4. D: went to the store 5. E: was in a different location\nRationales: The scenario given of a man on the run getting to where he was hiding is ambiguous due to several factors. However, some things can be inferred. For example, the man being on the run indicates that he is evading capture. This suggests that the man may be hiding in a safe place and that getting to this location was a challenge. The mention of a \"where\" indicates the man was likely on foot or using some form of transportation to get to his hiding place.

Additionally, the answer \"getting on his bike\" does not adhere to the stated context given that the man on the run was hiding.

'Cross road' makes sense. The store is visible; the human wants to get to it, and a crossroad would be the most direct route to reach it.\n6. This eliminates 'See around' and 'Drink coffee.'\n7. 'Dream dreams' and 'Think critically.'\n8. Therefore, 'Cross road' is the correct answer.\nAnswer: B. Cross road.\n\nInput: In what situation is the person taking a break from their daily work. Choices:  A. on-break B. at-work C. during- break D. on-lunch E. during-lunch\nRationales: First, let\u2019s break down the question. We know it\u2019s asking us to identify a word that correctly associates the person with a situation. In order to do this effectively, we need to consider the context of the question and eliminate options that could potentially fit the bill. \n\n1. The person is taking a break from their \u201cdaily work\u201d so we can eliminate \u201cC\u201d as it does not describe a break of that nature.\n2. Option \u201cA\u201d is incorrect because \u201cbreak\u201d is being used as a noun, not a verb. \n3. \u201cOn-break\u201d is the incorrect option because the person is on a break already.\n4. \u201cDuring-lunch\u201d is incorrect because lunch should be used as an adjective, which is not the context of the question.\n\nEliminate the incorrect options\n5. \u201cAt-work\u201d is not a suitable option as it is the opposite of the question since the person is taking a break.\n6. \u201cDuring-break\u201d makes sense as it describes exactly what the person is doing\u2014taking a break in the middle of their daily routine.\n7. Therefore, we can conclude that \u201cDuring-break\u201d.\nAnswer: During-break.\n\nInput: The student took the _____.

{"text": "critically' is a possible answer, but the choice between two possible answers allows us to eliminate it.\n5. 'Cross road' is possible, but would require going outside the store to cross the road and it would not seem practical.\n6. 'Cross road', 'think critically' and 'drink coffee' are all possible answers. In order to make the question more clear, we can eliminate some options.\n7. 'See around' does not allow any other options to be discarded because it does not directly answer the question. So this makes'see around' an appropriate next choice to remove.\n8. Now that option'see around' is eliminated, 'Think critically, cross road and drink coffee' are the remaining options.\n9. 'Cross road and drink coffee' does not have much relevance to the question but 'Think critically and cross road' is a viable answer. So the correct answer is A. 'Cross road'.\nAnswer: A: cross road \n\nInput: What does a doctor need from a patient to diagnose an ailment? Choices: 1 A: patience B: prescription C: knowledge D: a diagnosis E: medicine\nRationales: The question is asking a doctor is asking for a diagnosis.\nPatience is not something a doctor needs in order to diagnose an ailer.\nA prescription is a medical document that directs and authorises the medication and medications.\nKnowledge is something a patient can provide to a doctor to assist in diagnosing.\nA diagnoses is the identification of a condition or disease.

{"text": "critically' might help someone to get to the store, but it is not necessary for arriving at the store and should be ruled out.\n5. There are multiple ways for a human to get from point A to point B. One option is to 'Cross a road.' In this context, it would make sense to cross the road in order to get to the store. \n6. Therefore, the answer must be 'Cross the road', so answer B is the best fit.\nAnswer: B. Cross the road.\n\nInput: What are humans who are working on getting a degree called? Choices:  (1) (2) A: students B: adults C: babies D: seniors E: freshman\nRationales: (1) To answer this question, we must consider what the given terms \"humans,\" \"working,\" and \"degree\" mean and how they can be used together to determine a single answer.\n\"Humans\" are living creatures with free will and the capacity to think, act, feel, and learn. This means that humans can be students, adults, babies, seniors, and freshmen at any given time. By definition, this allows any of these terms to fit the question.\n\"Working\" could refer to a person actively engaging in any activity, whether academic or otherwise. Thus, humans can be called students when they're actively engaging in an educational pursuit and in other settings as well.  \n \"Degree\" may refer to a higher educational achievement such as a Bachelor's, Master's, or Doctorate, which could be considered a type of degree in the broader scheme of academic achievements.   (2) Let's look at the question again: \"What are humans who are working... on getting a degree called?\" It's unlikely that \"babies\" or \"seniors\" actively work or study for an educational degree, so these are automatically unsuitable answer options.    It's possible that \"adults\" are working or studying for an educational degree but it is also likely that many adults are attending high school or junior high school or even university while being adults simultaneously. There is no indication in the given question that this type of education would be excluded from the answer options, so it is not suited. \"Freshman\" is", "answer": "D: mouth"}
{"text": "critically' is the correct answer, meaning using logic and reasoning to find a solution. The question is asking what the human would do so a more strategic decision like thinking is appropriate.\n5. The remaining option is 'cross the road' which is a simple way to get to the store but is not always possible. \n6. Therefore, crossing the road does not always ensure a successful reach to one's destination compared to other options, therefore the correct answer is 'think critically.'\nAnswer: C: dream dreams\n\nInput: Who made us and where? Choices: A: God B: The Lord C: The Sun D: The Moon E: The universe\nRationales: *1.This is a logical question in which the answer is either logical OR based on belief. An answer which is illogical is thus invalid.\n*2. Option B (The Lord): This is an option that's completely based on belief and therefore is invalid and does not belong in the options \n*3. In this particular question, the answer is one that cannot be directly observed and would necessarily be a matter of belief. As such, the answer would have to be God *4. The answer to this question is B, God, because this is based on belief and the other options are not.\nAnswer: B, God\n\nInput: A person gets up in the morning and they're eager, so they take a shower, this can also be described as what? Choices: A. Wet B. Running\nC. Warm D. Dry E. Wasted\nRationales:1. This is where you find information, like the context of a question so that you can answer or comprehend the question.\n2. The question is asking someone to describe what the person does in the morning after waking up, as in a series of events.\n3. As per the context, the person takes a shower, and they do this because they are eager and need the shower to clean themselves.\n4. So, the answer to this question is \"Eager.\"\n5. The correct answer among the provided options is \"Eager\" *Note that \"Eager\" is an adjective form for the noun \"Eagerness\".  \nAnswer: A. Eager", "answer": "A: special"}
{"text": "critically' and 'cross road' are opposites in the actions of getting to the store, as one suggests thinking about moving and the other, moving forward. It would be illogical to do both at the same time.\n5. 'Cross road' is the only option that accurately describes an action of moving forward towards the desired destination. So, option A: 'Cross road' correctly indicates what the person would be doing if they wanted to get to the store.\n6. Therefore, the answer to this question is A: cross road.\nAnswer: A; cross road\n\n### Instructions:\nWhat did the little girl ask for the punch, the little girl wanted punch for what was it?

The little girl asked for punch for her parents, classmates, teacher, dog and her friends. \n\nStep 3: The answer to this question is D) her teacher because it is the only choice that gives a reason for the little girl to want punch.\n\nStep 4: After consideration, we see that none of the other options are plausible.\nSo the answer to this question correctly answers D: her teacher.\n\n### Summation\n\nIn the above two problems, we can see the pattern to write the response in a step wise manner.\n\nIf it does not satisfy the question and hence the answer also don't align, then that is a cue to remove the option.", "answer": "E: errors"}

If we divide a big number by a large number, we'll get zero.\n\nInput: What did the man tell the judge about the man's friend? Choice E: The man lied to the judge.\nChoice B: The man didn't say anything about the friend.\nChoice C: The friend said he had no idea why the man didn't go to jail.\nChoice D: The friend said the man deserved to go to jail. \nRationales:\n\nWhen we look at the given options (and eliminate the one that is obviously wrong), we know from the start that A and B are wrong because the man told the judge his friend didn't go to (a) jail or (b) a court. Therefore, we know the only answer that makes sense is C or D.\n\nSo, the man told the judge \"The guy didn't know anything about my friend.\"\n\nWhich makes sense.

{"text": "critically' seems logical, but we need a response that is more direct and action-oriented.\n5. 'Crossing the road' is the most reasonable choice. It indicates a direct action that a human would take when wishing to get to a store they can see.\nAnswer: C: cross road\n\nInput: A person knows when it is when it comes. Choices:  A. when it is done. B. when it is done with. C. when it is finished. D. when it is finishing. E. when it was done.\nRationales: The question is asking if a person knows when it is done, and can be answered using only the options that they provide. It's important to distinguish between when it is done, when it is finishing, and other related phrases, as they require slightly different responses.\nStep 1: Let's start by eliminating options that do not fit the context presented. For example, \"When it is done\" does not fit the context. By this point, the person already knows that it's done, so they can't possibly be waiting for the opportunity to complete it. It might provide an alternative response for the same question asked in a slightly different context, where the person is not sure when it is finished yet. But for our purposes, it does not fit the context being asked about.\nStep 2. We can eliminate other options based on the provided knowledge. For example, the phrase \"when it is finishing\" is incorrect, as you do not finish something once it is done. It is more accurately expressed as \"When it is about to finish\" or \"When it is ending\". This also doesn't fit the context of the question, as the question mentions the person already knowing that it is done, which suggests they know the ending is in sight or at their door. Therefore, option D: When it is finishing\" cannot be the answer.\nStep 3. To identify which option does fit the context of the statement, we look for phrases that indicate knowing when it is complete. Option C: When it is finished, clearly indicates the person knows when it is complete because they are also known as \"finished tasks\" or \"Finished Projects.\" This indicates that it isn't a state of completion, but rather, a process that is now completed. Therefore, option C: \"When it's finished,\" is the correct answer.\nAnswer", "answer": "C: hock"}

Looking at the remaining options, 'cross road' and 'walk' are both possible actions to get to the store but we need to prioritize which action would be taken first. \n6.

Mice may eat some types of grains, but this is not their primary diet and it is not what they would typically refer to as eating.\nOption B: grasses. Grasses are too coarse for mice to eat. They may nibble on blades of grass and it may be a source of water, but they will not consider it real food.\nOption C: carrots. Carrots are not part of a mouse's regular diet.\nOption D: apples.

It wouldn't make sense to see the sky in blue, purple, or red since they are all colors in the sky, but it would make sense to see the \"sky\" in a white square or yellow square.\nIt would likely be the case that one of the options is a square of white, and the other is a square of yellow, unless the \"sky\" is just a cloud, in which case it would be either blue or purple, as clouds can take on those colors.\nConsidering this reasoning, the answer is (B).\nAnswer: B.

However, to use a dictionary, one would first have to know what the word is. Therefore, there is a need to consult the dictionary only if one does not know the meaning of a word to begin with.  5: Since a dictionary gives word meanings, when you need to know how to spell a word, you would also use it.  3: When learning a second language, a dictionary would be helpful; however, learning a second language does not necessarily require a dictionary. 2.

Choices:  Ask around B: Look around C: Cross road D: Think critically E: Dreams\nRationales: This question asks us to identify what needs to be done to make it to the given store. To do this, we can eliminate other options. \n1. \"Ask around\" is often used to get information, but it doesn't help us reach the store. 2. \"Cross road\" would require us to go to another part of the area, where we may or may not be able to see the store, so this is a bad option. 3. \"Dream dreams\" is not a relevant part of getting to the store, so we can eliminate it. 4. 'Think Critically' might be helpful but it doesn't directly make it to the store, so again, we can eliminate it.\n5.

E: taking off\nRationales: The question is asking for what happens at the end of both a rocket and a book.\n\nThe three things that happen at the end of a space rocket are: landing, falling apart, and taking off. A rocket can land because it's a form of transportation, and it's also a vehicle that has a propulsion system which is used to move it forward towards its destination \u2013 like a car or airplane.\n\nA book, on the other hand, is an object that is used as a medium for communication and knowledge distribution.

'Cross Road' and 'Cross Road' refer to 'Traffic signal/Crossroad' so 'Cross Road' is not the correct answer.\n7. 'See around' and 'Cross road' can be eliminated as we have already determined that seeing around is irrelevant.\n8. Therefore the correct choice is 'Drink Coffee'.

Choices:  I: by car II: by taxi III: by ship IV: by plane V: by airplane VI: by car\nRationales: The word 'do' implies that there are multiple ways/method for the baker to get to the grocer store.\n1. 'Baker' in the context suggests that the baker's job is baking.\n2. 'Getting to' the store implies that they can have many different means of doing so.\n3. The options provided are 'by car', 'by taxi', 'by ship', 'by plane', 'by airplane', and 'by car'.\n4. The first option is always ruled out as it's not viable or practical for the baker to be driving his car to the grocery shop.\n5. The second option 'by taxi' is also invalid, because a taxi ride to the grocery is not the most realistic option as they are expensive and not viable to buy while getting to the grocery.\n6. The fourth option can only be ruled out, as it's not the way to get to the grocers.\n7.

Choices:  a: cat with no hat b: cat without hat c: a cat without no hat d: a hat with no cat e: a hat without cat\nRationales: A. A cat with a hat is not the opposite of a cat without a hat because a cat with a hat and a cat without a hat simply describe two different options. \nB. A cat without a hat is also not the opposite of a hat without a cat because again, the description of a cat without a cat is simply stating one possibility; it does not reflect the opposite of a hat with or without a cat. \nC. A cat without a no hat cannot be the opposite because that is simply a reference to a situation in which a no-hat cat is present - there is nothing that can be the opposite of that because it doesn't reflect the idea of what someone might do who is looking for the opposite of a cat. \nD. A hat with no cat similarly doesn't relate to the idea of the opposite because when a man is looking for the opposite, he's not expecting to see a no-cat hat; he's looking for a cat instead, so this options does not relate and cannot be the opposite. \nE.

E: it lacks modern amenities\nRationales: The answer can be derived from understanding what the phrases mean, eliminating those that are false, and looking for the word that correctly completes the sentence.\n\nE- Lacks modern amenities: If we consider modern amenities to be common amenities that are needed, then the apartment does not lack modern amenities because they're common amenities.\n\nB- Looks beautiful: If we consider beautiful to mean good looking, then an apartment from the 1920's will not look beautiful because they weren't known for having beauty in that era. They made use of minimalism, and simple, small, humble homes with little to no decorations.\n\nD- Has hardwood floors: The most likely amenity to be included in a 1926 apartment is a hardwood floor. We know this because it is mentioned as a common amenity that most apartments have.\n\n1- Has modern amenities: 1920 apartment have modern amenities because they now have common amenities that everyone has.

Choices:  B: other dog C: cats D: birds E: other birds \nRationales: The correct answer is D: birds.\nLet's look at the options one by one. 'Other dog' can be eliminated because there was already a dog present in the scene, and the dog's panting would inevitably frighten the other dog away, not towards it. Similarly, the 'cat' can be eliminated as 'cat' is not an animal group, as they are only a kind of animal. Thus, 'other cat' is not a possible option. 'Other bird' can be eliminated for the same reason as 'other dog'. 'Other birds' can be eliminated too for the same reason as the 'other' options and also because a bird's barking and panting would not be heard.\nFrom this, we can arrive at the only remaining answer \u2013 'bird'.\n\nInput: What makes people think that they are better than others?

A mentally disadvantaged person can just as easily possess a high IQ as a normal one, but their superiority would not be justifiable in this context.\nSimilarly, there is no direct correlation between one being superior and having a high ego.\nOne having a high position or education may not deem themselves superior to others just because they are in a higher position, nor does having higher position or education make the person superior.\nThinking about these options, we can consider that they have more indirect relevance than direct.

Choices: 1: A: library B: book store C: book shop D: a store for books E: a book about someone who lived in a time where there was no technology\nRationales: The question is asking where a person can find a book that has the following story elements: a woman who lived in times when there was no technology and had a fox as a pet.\n1. The phrase \"had a fox as a\" implies it's a real pet. It makes no sense to keep a mythical or unrealistic pet animal as it's not possible to do so. \n2. Also, the phrase \"who lived in times when there is no\" implies not now but in the past. \n3. Therefore, the book is not about someone living in the contemporary world with no technology, but about a woman from the past living in another time when technology was not available.\n4. Therefore, \"book about someone who lived in the time\" can be ruled out as an acceptable option.\n5. Books are written and sold to promote and gain attention. So the phrase \"a store for books\" can also be eliminated.\n6. So, the remaining options are the library and book store.\n7. The books are usually found in libraries with the exception of new books that are available in book stores.\n8. So, the book would be found in a library, not a book store. \n9.

{"text": "critically' does not provide instructions but only suggests a potential strategy for navigating to the desired store. Hence it is not a valid answer.\n5. 'Cross road' does not align to the logic of the question when a different action is being described to reach the desired store.\n6. The correct answer is A: to 'cross road'.\nAnswer: A: cross road\n\n### Solution:\nBelow is the answer that appropriately completes each of the instructions.\n\n### Solution 1: \nThe question is asking for a source of plumbling that would be useless to someone who is thirsty.  One place where you may find plumbing that would be useless to you if you were thirsty is an oil refinery, but you will not find plumbing of any kind in an oil refinary. The other choices: wall, shower, water fountain, and own home all have useful plumbing and therefore cannot be the response to the question.\n\n##Input:A: oil refineries \n##CorrectChoice:A: oil refeneries\n\n##Solution 2:\nThe question is asking you to determine where a person is when work begins. You can discern what options are not plausible because they have already been ruled out. You can discern that not only is a pencil not a location and cannot be the response, but that backpacks, school, the office and write sentences on paper could all be work places, and in the sequence are not the answer. The person is not tired, so the option of accomplishing is only plausible. Therefore, the answer must be D: accomplishing. \n\n##Input:C: accomplishing\n##CorrectChoiceC: accomplishing\n\n##Solution/Rationale 3:\nWhen the question asks you to identify the item that Billy might expect to hear (i.e., a response) from John, it is important that you identify the most likely response John would have to Billy\u2019s calling out to him. In this word problem, it is implied that John and Billy know each other, which implies that they may have done so before and have a familiarity with one another. When making decisions based on familiarity, it is important to consider any history between the actors and the context of the interaction.

Choices:  C: B C: B D: B E: B F: B J: A\nRationales: The question is asking \"who\" is the most influential among many other possible candidates. We can narrow the options based on these factors to eliminate the less likely candidates from our pool. B can be eliminated since it is used to indicate that.\n\nOption D: B is the most influential since it is the closest to the speaker's idea. It is not necessary to provide the letter A as B is all that is needed.\n\nOption E: B would need an article or qualifier to indicate that it is the most influential. Only B is the correct response as is the most influential answer.\n\nAnswer: C: B\n\nInput: Which of these things are essential in making a sandwich? Choices: B: Paper D: Mayonaisse E: Bread F: Cheese G: Pickles\nRationales: In the context of making a sandwich, 'Paper' would be unnecessary. Hence, B: Paper cannot be the correct answer. Since sandwiches are made from bread (F), which is an essential ingredient, Bread can be eliminated (F). \nSimilarly, Mayo and cheese are also essential ingredients. Hence, Bread and Mayonnaise can also be eliminated (E and D). \nThus, the correct answer would be C, in which case the answer is C: Bread, Mayonnaise, Paper, and Pickles.\n\nAnswer: D: Mayonaisser\n\nInput: Which is essential for any type of work? Choices: C: Efficiency D: Knowledge E: Skill F: Education G: Expertise\nRationales: All the choices given here would be essential for the work, apart from C: efficiency as this does not work with the given context.\n\nBoth C and E indicate the ability of doing some tasks, G indicates a possession of knowledge that can be used, whereas D indicates the comprehension of", "answer": "A: suicide"}

Eliminate options A, B and C because they do not express negative reactions to the person. \n2. Option D is not grammatical. \n3. To find the answer, eliminate options D and E because they are positive reactions to the person, not negative.\n\n### Solution:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\nAnswer: The answer is E: a ringing noise.\n\n### Explanation\nStep 1-2: The question requires a single explanation, for the given question.\nStep 3-4: The first option is a doorbell going off, which is clearly a positive reaction for a speaker, and if a speaker doesn't use annoying for another person, then surely ringing a doorbell is positive.\nStep 5-6: For the second option, we eliminate all the options other than the one which sounds negative: \nB: a fly buzzing because it is not annoying in this context and only indicates noise.\nStep 7-8: For the third option, a drill going on, we eliminate both options except a negative one: \nB: ringing sound \nStep 9-10: For the remaining options, answer and explanation, we see that they are positive for the speaker, indicating that he isn't enjoying the sound: \nE: a ringing noise  and E: a ringing sound", "answer": "A: person"}
{"text": "critically' (Option E) is not about getting to the store because it's a process that involves other steps. \n5. This leaves only options B: Cross road and D: Go to store.\n6. A human crosses the road to get from one place to another, so if one is at a clear view of the store, it means that they are walking in the direction of the store.\n7. So, the answer would be D: Go to store, as people usually cross the road if they are near a store that they want to enter.\nAnswer: D.

E: a secretary (6). F: an admin who prefers tea\nRationales: (1) The scenario in the office involves the boss who's busy and thus does not take coffee breaks.\n(2) A person is not a gender-defined pronoun, so we can't assume that it's a female person.\n(3) \"Everyone\" would mean everyone likes taking coffee breaks in the office, except the boss who is working.\n(4) A student means \"a student at a university or school\" which is not necessarily a person in the office context.\n(5) A secretary is a worker who typically works in an office and is not defined by gender. \n(6) An admin would be an office manager or someone who works behind an office desk, which is an important role in the office, but not a person who works in the office and would be described as an \"everyone\".\n(7) \"Tea\" is a type of drink and not an office-appropriate coffee-break alternative.\n(8) Therefore, the answer should be (3) \"Everyone\".\n\nInput: A man had many tools on the back of his truck what did he give these tools to.

I asked her, 'What did you get me?' she answered... Choices: 1: 'A new house' 2: 'You were looking too tired' 3: 'a new car' 4: 'A new ring' 5: 'Those cute earrings' 6: 'My favorite movie' 7: 'To stay the night'\nRationales: This question requires the person to identify which one is not a possible gift since the person could not believe their eyes. One of them does not make sense, which is option 4: 'A New Ring'.\nWhen thinking through your answer, consider which sentence does not match the context of a person being given a gift and not being able to believe their eyes.\nThe options 1: 'A New house', doesn't make much sense as it does not relate to the context of being given a gift. Nor does 2: 'You looked too tired', or 3: 'A New Car'. \n\nThe sentence that does not quite relate is 4: 'A brand-new ring'. It seems odd for someone to be given a brand-new ring since that is a type of jewelry you purchase yourself.\nFor option 5: 'These cute earrings', this option does fit the context as you might gift someone a pair of earr", "answer": "D: lap"}
{"text": "critically' could work depending on the store, but it's more likely the person would simply decide to go there.\n5. That leaves two options: 'cross road' and 'go to store.' 'Crossing a road' does not fit as it implies that the store is somewhere across the road, which is something the question is not asking about as it is clearly visible.\n6. So, the answer \"Go to store\" is the most likely answer.\nAnswer: D\n\nInput: If some animals are in the house, where don't the animals likely live? Choices: \tA: side B: attic C: basement D: garage E: lawnmower shed\nRationales: Since the house is clearly uninhabited by humans, it's unlikely animals are living there, so 'garage' is not applicable. 'Side' doesn't make sense as it'd be unlikely for animals to live on the outside of the house. 'Basement' is not relevant to the question - a basement is part of a house. 'Shed' doesn't make any sense in the question. 'Attic' is potentially relevant since it's likely that animals are living in the attic. Finally, it's unlikely that animals are found in the attic of a populated house as attics are generally used as storage rooms by humans. However, given that this house is clearly uninhibited by humans, it could have an attic that is inhabited by animals. Also, the context of the question is a house that looks like it's not been inhabited by humans due to it having a number of animals inside it. Given that the house hasn't been inhabited by humans, it would probably also have an attic as humans usually prefer not to build attics into their homes.\nAnswer: C: basement\n\nInput: Where can you find a large tree that is not a part of the wild woods?

We have to cross out all the wrong combinations as we already established that in every case both options are wrong.\n2. Let's start with 1.15 AM PM.\n3. 1.15 PM means that the people need to reach the bus at 1:15PM which is the wrong time.\n4. The time of the bus is 1.35PM  and not 1:35PM as stated in the 2.1AM, which again is the wrong time. \n5. Therefore, the answer must be 1.16 PM.\nAnswer: 1.13 PM\n\nInput: John the fisherman found some shrimp in the ocean, he did not think he saw anything unusual about the shrimp. Why?

As you can see, there's no reason for the question. The question is asking why John did not think he had found anything unusual about the shrunp. And we know he did find the shrimp in the middle of his trip because of the choices given in the question. The answer choice A is the only one which makes sense and therefore is the answer.\nAnswer: A\n\n### Democratized response:\nJohn found some shrimp.\nNow all we", "answer": "B: applaud"}

Choices: A: class B: party C: bed D: bus E: car\nRationales: The question is asking about the scenario when the woman lost her phone and her phone fell to the floor. Let's review the options to find the answer to this question as the answer is straightforward.\n6. Looking at each option carefully, the woman's cellphone is stolen when she went to a party or fell to the floor in a class, but the phone was stolen while she was in bed, was in a bus, or was in a car, which are all reasonable possibilities. \n6. Considering these eliminations, it's apparent that the answer is C: bed. The woman's cellphone was stolen from her bedroom. \n7. The best answer is therefore C: bed.\nAnswer: C: bed\nInput: What could a person be looking at from a boat? Choices: A. beach B. water C. road D. land E. sky\nRationales: We first recognize that the question is asking about what a person could be looking at from a floating boat.\n2. Considering all of the options, a person could be looking down on a beach from a boat, they could be driving a car on roads, or they could be looking at land. A sky or water does not apply to the scenario.\n3. So, the best option is D.land. \n4. This answer represents what a person could be seeing from a boat and the best choice from the five mentioned.\nAnswer: D. land\nInput: It would be better if I could have a day with no noise.

Choices: :A: looking at a paint splatter B: spending money C: choosing the color D: moving paint can E: holding the brush F: starting to paint\nRationales: As this is a riddle, the answer is not the letter at the end of the paragraph, but somewhere more central. \n1. Consider the word 'being' in the first line.\n2. Options A and F do not require 'doing anything', as they use adverbs.\n3. Option E does not match the word 'using' in the first line, as it refers to an object and not an action.\n4. Options B, C and D are adverbs, which cannot be the answer.\n5. Therefore, we are left with two options: Option B:'spending money' or Option C: 'choosing the color'.

{"text": "critically' is also irrelevant.\n\nThus we are remaining with 'crossing roads' and'seeing around'. The question is asking, what would a human do to get to a specific store that is within their line of sight.\nSince the store is within the line of sight, we don't have to look around in any sense. As for 'getting to the store', we obviously cannot cross a road since 'crossing a road' as an instruction is meaningless, so our only option to get 'to the store' is to see around it, which means to 'peer through' it.\n\nThe most likely scenario of a human wanting to reach a store within his view would be to cross the road he is on and look for the store to his left or right, the only options that make sense in the context.\n\nThe question only provides the two options, 'crossing the road' and'seeing an area'. It does not provide how the person can cross the road because that is irrelevant to the option'seeing an area' since they will simply see around and look for another road across to the store.\n\nHence, the answer to the question is B: cross it.  \n\nAnswer: B: cross it\n\nInput: Which of these is a place to play video games? Choices:  L: living room M: game store W: online D: school E: none of these\nRationales: The given options are, L-living room, M-game store, W-world, and D-school but there is nothing out all the given choices that could be considered a place to play video game except, M-game store.\nGameshops are places where people go to purchase and play video games. These are also places where people go to play games such as chess and cards with other players. Online platforms can also be used to play video games with your friends. Though, to play online for an online game, you need to have money to pay for it.\nYou need a device such as a computer or a console and internet connectivity to play video games. \n\nTherefore, we can eliminate the remaining options as places to play the video games.

'Cross road' is probably the only option that could make sense as it suggests a process of movement to reach the store. \n6. Therefore, the answer can be narrowed down to between 'cross road' and 'cross road'. \n7. Considering that there is no context in which a person would cross a road to get to a store directly visible to them, the answer must be that they need to cross the road to get to the store.\nAnswer: A. cross road\n\nInput: What are 3 ways to improve yourself? Choices: \tA: eat well B: socialize C: play sports D: read E: learn a new language\nRationales: There are 4 options to select from: 'Eat well', 'Socialize', 'Play sports' and 'Read'. It is not the correct answer to choose multiple. Let's start with the question: What are 3?\n1. The only answer that makes sense to fill in the blanks is `A: eat well B + C or E + D`. `C`, `D`, `E` and `F`, are all different ways to improve ourselves.\n2. The answer should be a single option since we're given 3 choices. If we look at the sentence, we can see that we're choosing 3 ways to improve ourselves. However, if we choose `A + B` or `A + C`, it wouldn't mean that we should choose all three.\n3. `A + C` is a correct option, but in the context of improving oneself, it must fit in the space.

In order to determine the correct answer to this question, it's essential to eliminate logical options that don't fit the context and that are not specific to the craft. \nIn the case of this particular question, the term \"master\" typically refers to a highly accomplished or expert in a specific craft or skill. Thus, the answer could refer to a craftsperson who has reached an elevated level of skill or proficiency in their area. \nOption A: Apprentice. An apprentice typically refers to a beginner or novice in a craft, implying a level of inexperience that is not consistent with the master-craftsperson mentioned in the question.\nOption B: Specialist. A specialist typically refers to someone who has specialized expertise or knowledge in a specific field or area and may be distinguished by their training or certifications. However, this option doesn't refer to a craftspersosn and can be eliminated. \nOption C: Journeyman.

Also, we can eliminate 'think critically' as being the answer because we're talking about how to approach/get to the store, not just a store. \n6. 'Cross road' is an option, but not necessarily the one the question is looking for.\n7. The context of the question is to get to the store which is right in front of the human.\n8.

After looking at a door, the man starts his journey and starts to see through and beyond the door. So the place that is directly behind the door where the journey begins, is the correct answer\n2. The man is looking at the door of a bus or on the left side of the bus when he see the door from the outside. So doorway is correct.\n3. As the man is looking at a plane door, the correct answer is airplane.\n4. The man is looking from outside the subway so the only door at the subway to enter is from the inside and not from the side.

Where did they go? Choices:  O: the car\nRationales: In the question, it is important to read between the lines and think about the whole context of what is going on, as most answers are simply a 'what' question. To answer \"O: The car\", you need to consider what is going on in the previous context.\nFor example: The boy went fishing with his fishing rod. However, if you read the question it says he went 'fishing' with his sister, and the previous question stated that it is 'Early July'. What does that imply? If it is early July it would be logical to assume that they are already at a lake or river.\nIn this example, the boy went fishing with a fishing rod, which implies that it is in general or some form of fishing.\n\nThus, the car itself could not have gone fishing, as 'fishing' is not an activity that the car could do. Therefore, the correct option is: O: The lake\nAnswer: O: The lake.\n\n### Reflection:\n### Check your progress, and select the corresponding reason code that best reflects the accuracy of your work.

{"text": "critically' implies a specific line of logical reasoning rather than simple direction to a location, so it too can be eliminated. \n5. The remaining options are either 'Cross road' or 'Go'. \n6. The option 'Go' is in the form of a verb and therefore inappropriate for this question.\n7. So, we can confidently conclude, since the object of the question is'store', that the correct answer is 'Cross road'.\nAnswer: C: cross road\n\nInput: When something can only keep you from something you're after, or not move you to something you wish for, the description means what? Choices: A: distract B: deterrent C: discouragement D: obstacle E: motivation\nRationales: This question requires us to decipher the meaning of a set of descriptors.\n1. The first descriptor is that the object can only keep you from or not move you to. \n2. If the object can only keep or not move, it indicates that you are trying to progress or to reach your desired outcome.\n3. In that case, the second descriptor is that it is a deterrent. \n4. If the object is a deterrent, it must be an obstacle. \n5. Hence, according to the first and second descriptors, the object is an obstacle. However, if the object could also \"move you to something\", this conflicts with the first descriptor.\n6. Therefore, the correct response is that the object is a dilemma.\nAnswer: C: dilemma\n\nInput: To give in to an invitation, even one you don't want to attend, can be a form of? Choices: A. obligation B. disappointment C. cowardice D. kindness E: commitment\nRationales: In the provided prompt, \"invitation\" refers to an invite to a particular social setting. \n1. For the invitation to be accepted, you must give in.\n2. This is why \"to give in\" could be described as \"form\" \"of\" \"obligation\".\n3. Even if you don't want the invite, the answer is still \"yes\", so it can't be described as \"disappointment\".\n4. \"Coward", "answer": "C: american city"}
{"text": "critically' and 'cross road' involve a mental and physical process, respectively. But 'cross road' is not necessarily necessary for getting to the store, so consider eliminating it. \n5.

Choices:  C: suburbia D: urban  E: neighborhood F: city\nRationales:\n1. So, you've decided you want an apartment and you're ready to start apartment hunting, but you don't know where to start.\n2. Look at the options provided by the question, and think about where you might want to rent an apartment and where you might start looking.\n3. The options C: suburbia, D: urban, and E: neighborhood are all potential places to look for an apartment.\n4. But there is one location that makes more sense to look in, and that is the place that is logical and fits with the question asked.\n5. \"Urban\" is a place where you typically live in an apartment, so it can be eliminated as it doesn't make sense to look for an \"apartment\" in an already \"urban\" area.\n6. Looking at the remaining locations, they don't really make sense to look for rental apartments in, either. \"Suburbia\" refers to an area at the edge of a city with homes, not apartments.\n7. As for \"neighborhood,\" that could be a place where you already live and look for an apartment, but it's not where you would go to find an apartment without knowing where you want to live at all.\n8. So, the answer must be \"city\" as it makes logical sense in this context.\nAnswer: A city\n\nInput: The police have a suspect in custody and they are investigating the crime.

{"text": "critically' means to think critically about the store and its surroundings, which is not relevant either to the process of getting there. \n5. From this reasoning, we can eliminate three options.\n6. 'Cross roads' is a valid option as this would take the person closer to the store by crossing the street to access it, so we need to eliminate two options. We have a correct answer remaining.\n7. The'see around' option was the first incorrect option eliminated, so we know that it is not the correct answer.\n8. That leaves the remaining answer 'cross the roads' as the correct choice.\nAnswer: A'cross the road'(A'=Across the road)\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice questions. \n1. In which of these situations could your parents find a stray cat? Choices:  a. home b. backyard c. kitchen d. bathroom e. living room\nRationales: First, it helps to understand the key information in the question: the main focus is on \"your parents\". This implies that the cat is either someone else's cat, or a stray. Further, the question mentions \"home\", \"backyard\", \"kitchen\", \"bathroom\", and \"living room\". These words represent different areas of a house. \nOption A: \"home\" = It is most likely that a stray cat would be found at home. \nOption B: \"backyard\" = Possibly, but it could still be from somewhere else.\nOption C: \"kitchen\" = If the cat were found in your parents' kitchen, it would be more likely that they would be returning from work. As a result, this option is not likely. \nOption D: \"bathroom\" = The bathroom is not a likely place for a cat to be found. \nOption E: \"living room\" = It's unlikely that a stray cat will be found in the living room.\n1. So, the correct answer is D: bathroom.\nAnother Option: 1. A: home 2. B: bathroom 3. C: living room 4. D: backyard 5. E: kitchen\n\n2.

Choices:  B: library C: bookstore D: book E: grocery store\nRationales:  1. The question is seeking a location for the book \"Ettiquete\" in the context of an individual wanting to find a book related to good manners and social graces.\n2. A bookstore is a viable location for the book since they specialize in books, while a grocery store may not necessarily have the book \"Ettiqute\" in stock.\n3. A library would not be the most likely place to find a book on etiquette as libraries are typically intended for borrowing books, not buying them.\n\nA bookstore would be the most likely location to purchase the book \"Ettitiqute\", making \"B\" the correct choice.\n\nAnswer: B: book store\n\nInput: A person at a party tells people a story, what do they expect? Choices:  An end A Boredom C Conversation D Dramatization E Interest\nRationales:   1. The sentence asks what people expect when a person at a party tells everyone a story.\n2. There are many different types of stories people could tell, for example: sad stories, scary stories, short stories, long stories, factual stories, fictional stories, etc.\n3. Considering those types of stories, the options \"Dramatization\" and \"Interest\" are the most apparent options, as people often expect either of those things when a person tells a story. \n4. \"Boredom\" and \"Conversation\" are not realistic options for what people expect when someone tells stories. \n5. Therefore the correct options are Dramatization and Interest.\n\nAnswer: Dramatization and interest\n\nInput: The author of the book The Stand wrote many other books as well.

Choices: 1. A: Differences of height 2. B: Differences of hair 3. C: Differences of accent 4. D: Difference in skin color 5. E: Differences in personality\nRationales:\n1. The question asks about obvious differences between two people who have the same name but who work in a large group.\n2. We can immediately eliminate any options that do not relate to workplace settings:\n2.1. Accents can be easily learned by people working in a group, so the accent will not be an obvious difference. D: Difference of accent is not the correct answer.\n2.2. The other differences mentioned in the question, such as height and skin color, are not exclusive to one person or group, so do not always indicate a particular person. C: Difference of accents and D: Difference in their own skin color do not give enough difference.\n2.3. Some physical differences such as hair can be common between people. We can easily eliminate E: Difference in personality because we do not know the person's face.\n2.4. Height and hair color can also be common. F: Difference in physical appearance is eliminated.\n3. The name itself gives us a unique indicator, B: Difference in hair or C: Difference in accent, can be narrowed down, as not all people have the same name and not everyone can have that name.\n3. Differences in physical appearance are also obvious. We can choose from A: Difference in height or D: Difference in colors.\n4. Some differences of physical appearance, as mentioned above, can be common. But people have their own personality and personality is also a major factor and can also be a defining fact. E: Difference of", "answer": "A: communicating with others"}

Choices: A: a hospital B: a bar C: the library D: city hall E: a school\nRationales: First, identify the context and determine what the mall is in relation to the rest of the sentence. \nIt's common for a mall to be located in a downtown area. In this case, the mall is a part of the downtown area, so 'Downtown' doesn't directly answer this question's request. \nAfter we establish that it is in a downtown setting, look at each option given. \nThe first option is \"A hospital\" which is not near a mall.\nTherefore, the answer to the question is E: a school.\nAnswer: E : a school\n\nInput: Many times, the question has a phrase of 'which?' followed by a list of items and then a noun ending with 'is it?' \nRationales: To answer this type of question we have to look at options given and identify which item matches the noun given. \nThe word \"is\" is often used before a question. So we can easily spot the question word when finding which option will be correct. \n\nInput: If somebody goes to the bookstore on the weekend and gets a specific textbook, they purchased which item? Choices:  B: a pencil C. a calculator D E a textbook F: something else\nRationales: After considering all the given options, we can conclude that our target item is (their) bookstore, which they could potentially choose (to) purchase a certain textbook from.\nNow, looking at each possible option, we see the following. \nOption A - 'pencil' - doesn't match the target item because it doesn't match \"somebody went to the bookstore.\" Option B - 'calculator' - can match the context if we consider the phrase \"get a specific textbook.\" So, we eliminate Option A and", "answer": "E: wasted time"}
{"text": "critically' could possibly give the right result, but it's much more difficult to 'think' your way to something and to do something like 'cross the road' is not thought dependent.

Therefore, we'll rule this option out as it's not likely to achieve the desired result.\n5. Considering these eliminations, what remains is \"Cross road.\" The action of 'Crossing the road' refers to the ability to walk or run to get to the store without any critical thinking or advanced planning required from thinking 'about' or 'to' the store.

Choices: \nA: a ball B: a concert C: a parade D: a festival E: a wedding\nRationales: In the context of a ball, the group of people described in the phrase 'was going to the ball' would be traveling to attend the festivities. \nOptions A, D, E, are incorrect because they describe the ball as the destination itself, not simply a part of the journey. \nOption B is incorrect because the group of people are traveling for the ball, not for a concert, unless a concert were to be held at the ball. \nOption C is incorrect because a parade is not simply a part of a journey but an actual event that one would attend. \nTherefore, the best answer is E: a wedding.\nAnswer: E the wedding\n\nInput: Who was the man talking to in the woods?

Hidden refers to the physical nature of the event, that nothing will be visible from the outside. Option C. Unknown does not apply here because we know the event is happening. Option D. Conspiratorial means that the meeting or event is a plan to accomplish something, such as to overthrow or attack an enemy. Option E.

Choices:  A B: finish project C: start work D: after work E: during work\nRationales: Look at each letter of the answer. \n1. \"After work\" suggests that work should be completed before any celebration can occur. Hence, \"when work is complete,\" A is incorrect.\n2. \"Starting work\" means that work should already be underway, indicating that the celebration should not happen \"after work\" or \"during work,\" as both of those imply an existing process of work.\n3. \"Finishing work\" refers to completing the task after work begins, rather than starting the work itself.

Choices:  A. tall B. short C. big D. thin E. short-skinned\nRationales: In this question, \"not long enough\" or \"too thin\" is the clue. So let's check each of the options to make it sure which one works here.\n1. \"too thin\" doesn't really fit the context, the answer should be \"too thin (not long enough).\"\n2. \"tall\" and \"not long enough\" are contradicting, so we know", "answer": "D: contentment"}

Choices:  a: lack of time B: want to treat more patients early c: want to charge lower fees D: fear of getting caught E: do not need to take breaks\nRationales: Option A: lack of time doesn't make sense as doctors may take breaks to rest and/or have a lunch break.\nOption B: want to treat patients early doesn't make sense because this is not a good reason to not have a break as it's more beneficial to rest and eat a meal before starting work.\nOption C: charge lower fees isn't the correct answer as this isn't the main reason why some doctors don't take breaks.\nOption C is a real scenario as not all doctors take breaks, but this doesn't mean they aren't tired or need a break.\nOption D: fear of getting beings doesn't make sense either because not all doctors take their breaks. \nOption E: not being tired is the correct answer because some doctors don' t take breaks because they don't feel they need any.\nAnswer: E; not being tired", "answer": "D: death"}

Choices:  B: back of house C: suburban D: house door E: yard\nRationales: Consider the options: Back of house (option B), Suburban (option C), House door (option D), and Yard (option E). The clue is that \"to meet\" means to interact with another. A dog cannot enter a house through a door, so the correct answer is back of house.\nAnswer: B back of house \n\nInput: When do you find a rocket traveling at the speed of light? Choices:  C: fastest B: slowest D: zero E: at rest\nRationales: The question is clearly asking about speed.\n4. The word 'rocket' would usually describe something that travels faster than the speed of light, i.e. at a velocity greater than C, so the option B is wrong.\n5. The only option that makes sense when the rocket travels at the speed of light is it has a velocity of zero, denoted by the option E.\n6. 'At rest' or 'zero velocity' is not what the question is asking.\n7. The correct answer is the E, which is a rocket traveling 'at rest'.\nAnswer: E: zero velocity\n\nInput: I know you are looking for the right answer. But a wrong answer is also very important to you.

{"text": "critically' may actually cause the person to miss the store if they are focusing on other things.\n5. 'Cross road' is out of consideration because it is not appropriate to cross a road to go to the store.\n6. 'Crossing the road' may mean taking other necessary steps to reach the store.\n7. From the above conclusion, we can conclude that the intended meaning of the question is to get the store 'while still seeing it' which is impossible. \n8. So the correct answer is D: dream dreams.\nAnswer: D_ dreams\n\nInput: What does a fisherman take care of first? Choices: \tA: his net B: his nets \tC: his hook D: his boats\nRationales:\t1. A fisherman, as referred to in the question, is someone who catches and sells fish.\n\t2. A fisherman can have a variety of tools or instruments to help with this.\n\t3. One such tool is a net which would be used to contain or catch the fish.\n\t4. A fisherman cannot have a net without first taking care of it in some way.\n\t5.

Choices: 2nd floor, deck, roof, attic, 1st floor 3rd floor\nRationales: The question asks which part of a house needs the most light. The options provided all have either doors that let access to the light or have large open windows that let plenty of light in on their own. Because of these features, each of these options could be considered areas of a room that needs sufficient lighting, but the correct answer is the 2nd floor, which is the floor above the first floor. This is because rooms that are in the roof or attic, even though they're above the first floor, can be considered separate rooms with their own lighting needs. So, the 2nd floor needs enough light to brightly illuminate the rooms above and below it.\nAnswer: 2nd floor\n\nInput: Where can you find things that are made of or constructed by gold?

{"text": "critically' does not require 'drinking coffee'. Thinking critically is the only logical answer that makes sense in this context, as it allows the person to consider various options for getting to the store, such as walking, driving, or taking public transport.\n5. Therefore, the answer to the question is B: see around. It requires them to think critically about how they will travel to the store, thereby seeing around the nearby roads and public transport options.\nAnswer: B': see around\n\nInput: How can an employee be expected to act if he or she wants to keep their job? Choices: 1. A: do what you want B: comply C: be polite D: be obedient E: be assertive F: do what you're told\nRationales: First of all, we need to understand what the question is asking. They are seeking to know how an employee should behave in order to keep their job, with the assumption being that if they behave accordingly, they will maintain their job status.\n2. The question makes it clear that the employee's actions are required to keep them employed, so they are required to act in a manner that keeps them in their job.\n3. Looking over the options given, we can determine what is reasonable based on the context provided and the fact that keeping one's job relies on appropriate behavior.\n4. Since option (A) is doing what the person wants in an employee situation (in which obedience is not an option) it is most definitely not what would be expected of an employee.\n5. Although being polite and obeying can be expected in an employee-employer relationship, in the context of keeping one's job this does not mean that being assertive or doing what you're told will be deemed sufficient by an employer.\n6. Therefore, the choices that are reasonable options based on context in this instance are D: be obedience and F: Do what you're told.\n7. This answer allows for obedience to the employee's superior and adhering to the rules that are put into place for them in order to do the job they are required to, which means that they keep their job.\n8. So, the answer to the above question is D: be obediance. It refers to the employee's need to be compliant and listen to any instructions issued to them.", "answer": "A: netherlands"}
{"text": "critically' could be the correct answer, but we can eliminate that option because we don't have any information that the human is a critical thinker. \n5.

The choice A: school building is correct as an answer. The school building is a place where he or she may get the homework assignments.\nChoices:  A: school building B: on the street C: at lunch time D: in the car E: library F: at home G: during breaks H: in the classroom\nRationales: Let's start off by looking at the options. First, we can eliminate some answers that don't make sense. For example, \"in the classroom\" (Option G) is clearly false because the question is asking about homework assignments after the conclusion of class, so this doesn't make sense. The same goes for \"school building\" (Option A). This option would be correct for a response to the question: \"where does he or she get homework during the day?\" We can also eliminate \"during breaks\" (Option H) because the question doesn't specify what kind of breaks we're talking about.\n\nSecond, we can narrow down the options further by looking at the context of the question. Consider \"on the street\" (Option B). While it's possible that a student could be given homework assignments on the street, it's unlikely. The question suggests getting homework at night and this option does not make sense because homework is often assigned at the end of the day, not in the middle of the night.\n\nSimilarly, \"in the car\" (Option F) doesn't fit the context either. While it's true that a student could get homework done in a car, this is typically not feasible after regular classes have ended for the day. \"At home\" (Option E) could be correct, but it would be better to specify the room of their home, and it doesn't immediately fit the given context either.\n\nLooking at the time of day and what a student would have in mind when getting homework assignments suggests some of", "answer": "E: splats"}

Choices:  S: rabbit B: turtle C: raccoon D: dog E: squirrel\nRationales: This question is about the possible objects that someone might see when playing fetch. The options provided are S: rabbit, B: turtle, C: raccoon, D: dog, and E: squirrel. \nStep 1: The first option, S (A rabbit) is an animal that could potentially be seen playing fetch with another person.\nStep 3. The second option B (A turtle) is too large an animal to play fetch, as its size could cause safety concerns and discomfort for the person playing fetch.\nStep 4: The third option C (A raccoon) is also too large to play fetch and would likely pose a potential danger to both the person and the object being thrown.\nStep 5: The fourth option D (A dog) is the correct answer because it is a common animal that people play fetch with and could realistically be seen in that specific context. Therefore, the answer choice would be D (dog).\nStep 6. The fifth option E (A squirrel) could potentially be seen in the context of playing fetch, but it is also a smaller animal that may not necessarily be as well-trained as a dog, causing more of a risk.\nStep 7. Therefore, the true choice is the answer option D: dog for the correct choice.\nAnswer: D : dog\n\nInput: Which would you see if you went to a zoo? Choices:  C: zoo animals D: other animals E: no animals F: wild animals\nRationales: In this question, we're asked which animals we would expect to see at a zoo if we were to visit. This would depend on the type of zoo we were going to, but in most cases, we would expect to see either A: zoo animals or B: other animals.\nStep 1: Looking at option C: zoo animals, we can eliminate it already as all the other answer choices have \"animals", "answer": "B: rejection"}

Choices:  C: go up to them and ask about it D: ignore them and laugh E: think of more options F: compliment them\nRationales: Steps 1-3: The question asks us what we should do when we see a person dressed differently from us, it does not indicate that we should ask further questions related to the difference or the person's appearance \nStep 4-6: There are three options that are good things to do (go up, ask, compliment) and three that probably are not good things (ignore, laugh, think of more options). \nStep 7: It's good to avoid going up to a person you don't know to ask them about what they're wearing. It is probably not a good idea to ignore them and think of more options when it comes to clothing. \nStep 8-9: Laughing at a person's appearance is not a good idea. \nStep 10: When it comes to clothing, it is always appropriate to compliment a person on what they are wearing.\nStep 11: Therefore, the correct answer to this multiple choice question is 'C: go up to them to ask about it.'\nAnswer: C: go up to him to ask about it\n\nInput: What does it mean to wager?

Option A: To feed animals - trees produce fruit and seeds and some animals will feed on these and this is their diet. It's not the only thing they eat and this is a minority.\n7. Option B: To feed people - yes, there are many trees that produce fruits used as human food, but these are only one minority source of food. There are so many other sources eaten by people too.\n8. Option C: Neither - although some non-animals eat trees, they do not make up the majority food source for animals since most animals are preyed on by other animals.\n9. Option D: To protect animals from preditors - not all animals are prey to other animals in the food chain and trees don't need to protect animals.\n10.

Choices:  Engineer A: employer B: manager C: co-workers D: labor union E: employee\nRationales: To understand the context, the question is referring to the phrase \"When an engineer does something to solving a problem.\" Here, the actions of solving a problem involve the engineer doing something to address it. \nWe can eliminate options by considering how likely each solution would be to solve the given situation.\n1. Option A: employer. The employer provides supervision and support, but is outside of the problem-solving process and their primary focus is on providing the necessary tools for the job. This could be considered helpful, but would not be considered the direct cause of solving the problem.\n2. Option B: manager. The manager oversees employees in a workplace setting and may assist with problem-solving, but again is outside of the direct actions taken by the engineer. In this case, any actions by the manager would be more of an overview/assistance rather than direct involvement in solving the problem.\n3. Option C: co-worker. A co-worker could potentially be involved in the problem-solving efforts of an engineer by sharing knowledge, ideas, and other resources. However, it is unlikely that a co-worker would be solely responsible for solving the problem.\n4. Option D: labor union. Labor unions are organizations that represent workers and aim to improve their rights, wages, and", "answer": "B: birth"}

Some people do not like seafood even if they like fish. 3. Option B: saltwater. Some people who prefer fried fish may do not like the taste of fresh saltwater fish and eating fresh saltwater fish is not an option. 4. Option A: vegetables. Some people like fished but do not like vegetables. 5. Option B: fish. Some people hate fish or do not like them. 6. Option D: sushi. Sushi is made only with fish so no one that does not like fish would eat the whole meal. 7. Of the remaining options, only option E is correct. If you do not like sushi, you have no other option to order in a restaurant because sushi is the only option related to fish.\n8. Therefore the correct answer is E: sushi.\nAnswer: E.

Snakes won't be running around or away from turtles, as they are very different animals with different behaviors. \nStep 3: Option b can be eliminated because snakes can either be faster than or equal to, or slower than turtles. \nStep 2 : Option a can also be eliminated because it isn't clear whether snakes can outrun turtles, or vice versa.\nStep 5: Finally, we come to option c as it represents the only valid comparison: \"a snake is faster than a turtles\". \nAnswer: A snake is faster than turtles.\n\nInput: If you want the best in quality products, where would you go?

This question asks for how a person could be different from a 'thing' that is just sitting there, without movement.\n2. 'Sitting' and'resting' cannot be an option for the person in the question because the 'thing' would be just sitting and therefore the person is different from'sitting' or'resting.'\n3. The person would have to be able to move, so 'be able to stand' or \u2018can walk\u2019 cannot be the correct response either.\n4.

Choices:  T: the sky B: its teeth C: its prey D: nothing E: itself F: the horizon\nRationales: Let's look first at what is not visible to a lion while lying down: \n- \"Nothing\" can be eliminated because that implies the lion cannot see anything and the question asks us to find the answer that the lion can see.\n- \"Its prey\" cannot be chosen because the prey is the thing being hunted. So, the lion would likely not be looking at itself unless it catches its prey within its own paws.\n- \"The horizon\" also cannot be chosen because the horizon is the border between the earth and sky, implying that it's visible at the ground level not when the lion is on its belly.\nNow, let's look at what the lion can see:\n- \"The sky\": the lion can see the sky if it is laying upright near open air or an open door, or if it is on a hill from where it can see above itself or far horizontally.\n- \"I am myself because I was thinking how to get to work\": This is a confusing sentence because if someone is thinking about reaching work they would likely be thinking about nothing else\n\n- \"The moon\": If the lion is looking up at the sky due to its upright position it could potentially see the moon if the night is clear.\n\n- \"My eyes\": If the lion turns their head upwards while laying on their belly then they can see their own eyes, not the sky.\n\n- \"I", "answer": "E: happen anywhere"}

Choices:  a) God and the Devil b) Man and Woman c) Night and Day d) Death and Life e) Nature and Civilization\nRationales: a) It's well known that Tolkien's primary focus was on the relationship between good and evil.\nb) J.R.R Tolkien didn't focus on relationships between men and women in his writings.\nc) J.R. R. Tolkien didn' t focus on day and night in his writing.\nd) Death is a topic J.R.R is exploring in 'The Lord of the Rings', but Tolkien's not really focusing on exploring 'Death and Life,' so D isn't correct.\ne) This is a common theme in Tolkien's works where he describes the battle between good and evil, but this isn't the correct answer.\nb) We can immediately eliminate A, C and D, as J.R.R doesn't explore these relationships in the book.\ne) 'Nature and Civilization' may be seen in the Lord of the rings, but this is not explicitly stated in the question, so it's not the correct answer.\nc) The author also explores man and his connection to nature in 'The Hobbitt', so C is also not correct.\na) Since the book 'The War of the Two Worlds was written in 1920, Tolkien did indeed explore the relationship between good and Evil, so this is the correct answer.\nAnswer: B.: Good and Evil\n\nInput: If you are being attacked by pirates, what could a sailor be asked to steer clear of?

Choices: 0 A: 2 B: 9 C: 4 D: 8 E: 30\nRationales:\n1. The question is comparing three numbers and asking us to match the word closest to the number 3. \n2. If we subtract the numbers the closest difference is between B and D. D is bigger than B so it is not the correct answer. \n3. If we add the numbers the closest difference again is between B and D with D larger than B. The same conclusion can be drawn for the second closest number, A and C. Because D is closer to B, A is the closest to 3. 4. So the answer is A: 9.\nAnswer: A. 0 - 9 = -9, 9 - 8 = -1, 30 - 4 = 26, - 27 = 2.

Choices: 1: because roofs don't leak 2: it's raining 3: you are standing on a leak 4: the roof doesn't want to rain upon you 5: you are standing upon the roof\nRationales:\nThe question here is asking us if we understand why the water is falling down on us if we are standing under an object like a roof which should not be leaking. To understand the answer we will need to ask: Why is the roof leaking?\n\nLet's answer some questions about what roofs and leaks are so we really understand the context.\n\nQ> What is a roof? A> Something humans put on top of a building\n\nQ> Where do we find a roof? A> On a building\n\nQ. What is a leak? A> Water through a hole in something\n\nWhenever we see water, we know something is leaking. When I go to the dentist, they always say: \u201cDid you see any leaks? Is there a leak in the roof?\u201d, and of course when I look at the floor my answer would be: \u201cNo leaks Sir.\u201d \n\nBut now, consider the roof as an object. A roof is a thing that is made of material - like brick or steel or whatever it is made out of, and a roof is just like a house: It has a top and a bottom and it has an inside and an outside which are two different pieces and that's why we can see leaks. \n\nAnother thing that we notice about roofs is that we never see them actually leaking. It's an empty space and we just look at it from afar. But the moment we get closer, we will definitely see the water. \n\nSo what should we do? Should we ask a question of the roof?\nQ> Do you leak?", "answer": "C: playroom"}

Choices: 1: by train 2: walk 3: by car 4: bicycle 5: by horse 6: foot\nRationale: First, we need to determine the meaning of the word \"transporting.\" If a person has things that they want to transport from one location to another, they\u2019re likely trying to do so quickly and conveniently.\n7. So, we consider the context and decide whether the question is asking for something that can be used in place of transporting by car. \n8. The options provided are train, walk, horse, bike, and foot (Option 2, Option 4, Option 5, Option 6 and Option 1 respectively).\n9. If it were to mean in place of cars, horses, feet, and bikes are out since they\u2019re more of alternatives for transportation than the question suggests.\n10. The options mentioned above leave \"train\" and \"airplane.\" So we could select it as a possibility; however, this option doesn't necessarily make as much sense as the other options available.\n11.

It's what gives them revenue (money) which would keep them in business and provide jobs for them. If any of this is missing (money/customers) then the company will suffer. The second word is protect.

If anything, it's likely meant to be worse or at least not as good. \nFor this reason, we can eliminate answer B as well as answer D since both of these are saying something positive about the president. \nAnswer A is also unlikely since the question doesn't specify which president, although it is more likely among previous presidents than the most recent one. \nThis leaves 2 viable options: D and E, D expressing concern about a terrible handling of the economy and E being an upbeat compliment to the president's job. \nUsing logic, answer E cannot be the correct answer because that would give a contradiction to answer C, which is negative. \nTherefore, the most realistically acceptable answer is E, as people are saying that the handling of the economy has not been as predicted and that it could be better. \nAnswer: E: not as good as predicted\n\nInput: What does the phrase \"put on the back burner\" mean?

{"text": "critically' implies more mental effort than would be required to simply cross a road.\n5. Looking at the remaining options, we can eliminate 'cross road' as, although it is the most obvious response, there is no evidence to indicate that the human wants to get there. Additionally,'see around' is already eliminated, leaving 'walk' as the most viable option.\n6. Therefore, the answer to the question is C: walk.\nAnswer: C: walk\n\nInput: A man walked along the sidewalk in the center of town where? Choices: A: sidewalk B: city hall C: main street D: roadway E: bus stop\nRationales: The man is walking along a sidewalk in the middle of town. \nHe is walking on the sidewalk, which implies the man is within town and in the middle of town suggests where he is walking. \nRuling out all other options, it is safe to assume the man is walking in the town center's main street since a sidewalk in the town's center would be the nearest option on either side. \nThis is the best answer.\nAnswer: Option E: The man is walking on a sidewalk within town in the town center' s main street.\n\nInput: The dog that sat by the door where? Choices:A: front yard B: back yard C: in the dog house D: on the porch E: in the street\nRationales:The dog is not on the porch, but in the street. \nLooking at all the options, the answer is E the street. Choice E only has the dog in the street, which is not acceptable, while choice A is the dog's backyard, which is not applicable as the dog is not inside. Similarly, A, B, C are all excluded. Choice D is the dog's porch. This is not acceptable because the dog can only be on the porch, and the porch is not in the street. Choice A is the dog' house, because the dog does not sit in a house. The dog is inside the house.\nAnswer: Option D is incorrect because the dog is sitting in the street.\nRationales: Choice B, C, D are excluded as they cannot accommodate the dog sitting in the street. The dog in not in a position to sit or lie on the por", "answer": "E: rain forest"}
{"text": "critically' implies a thought process, and there's not much to consider as all that's required is to 'go' to the store, which is already obvious to the person who sees it.\n5. 'Cross the road' is the logical choice as it's the obvious action that the person can do to get to the store.\n6. As 'crossing the road' is the answer, we must identify a key aspect to help us determine if the option is correct.\n7. Let us look at the given scenario, a person walks past a store, sees it, and intends to get there.\n8. Hence, 'crossing roads' is logical and the correct answer.\nAnswer: B. cross road\n\nInput: What kind of noise did the dog make towards the person who is playing? Choices:  X: none Y: whine Z: bark A: growl B: pant C: wolf D: whistle\nRationales:  1. The question is, \"What kind of noise did the man's dog make toward the person playing with it?\" We first need to identify the correct scenario of who is playing with the dog and what the sound is being described toward.\n2. It is evident that a person is playing with the dog as the context is written as \"man\".\n3. \"None\" does not make sense in the context given above given that there is a man playing with him, so we can safely eliminate that as an option.\n4. \"Bark\" does not make sense since we know that the man is playing with him, and \"growl\" does not make sense either since we know the dog is barking.\n5. \"Pant\" doesn't make sense either since dogs do not pant unless they are excited or need to cool themselves off, not when they are playing with someone. \n6. Therefore, we can assume that the answer is \"Barking,\" and we need to identify a key fact that distinguishes it as the right answer.\n7. Looking at all the given options it's evident that the right answer is \"B,\" which clearly states that the dog is bark.\n8.\"Bark\" is the correct answer and the right choice for the question. \nAnswer: B: bark\n\nInput: In what kind of building will the store be in?

{"text": "critically' is another irrelevant piece of information, since it does not relate to how they are going to achieve their objective - getting to the store. \n5. 'Cross road' is another choice which can be eliminated as it would not achieve the desired objective.\n6. 'Cross' could also be mistaken for mean 'walk across' but there is no mention of 'walk to' or anything of that kind. It's safe to eliminate 'cross' due to this ambiguity.\n7. Therefore, among the remaining options, only'see around', or 'across' would work.\n8. 'See around' is a phrase which is commonly used to describe a person physically moving their gaze to look in the desired direction to see a certain object. It fits well with this context.\n9. This leaves us with three options:'see' or 'cross road' and the correct answer is D: see around.\nAnswer: D; See around\n\nInput: The boy was at a pool party, he is now swimming what stroke? Choices:  F: strokes B: front C: back D: lap E: crawl\nRationales: The question is asking what stroke the boy is now swimming. \n\n1. It is important to clarify the context of the pool party. 2. To do so, we identify which stroke the boy was performing when he started swimming. 3. This is because it is unlikely that he would simply decide to change to another stroke in the middle of a stroke. \n4. Also, we eliminate options that would have caused the boy to change strokes.  5. Therefore, the question is asking what stroke is the boy now swimming.  6. Looking at the options, the boy started at a backstroke. 7. As such, the only applicable answer choice for the question is B: back.\n\nInput: What do you call a human who is a member of a club that involves swimming and competing against others?

A: read books B: visit websites C: read newspapers D: listen to friends E: observe F: look at signs\nRationales: The questions asks how to find the most reliable source.\nStep 1: The answer can not be A: read books. The book may not be up to date or have accurate information.\nStep 2-4: The answer is not B: visit websites. It may not be the most up to date information.\nStep 5-7: The answer is not C: read newspapers. The newspaper may not reflect the most recent information.\nStep 8-10 The answer is not D: listen to friends. The friend may not be the most reliable source. The information might be inaccurate or not the most up to date.\nStep 11. The answer is not E: observe or F: look at signs. Both of these may be inaccurate since they are easily manipulatable or are simply what someone else says.\nStep 12.

{"text": "critically' is an option to consider, as thinking critically may help a person navigate their way to the store. However, the question specifically mentions that the store is already visible and does not require critical thinking.\n5. 'Cross road' is an appropriate response because crossing a road would be the most efficient and straightforward solution to getting to the store. \n6. However, the question also implies that the store is currently visible and doesn't require a person to cross a road to reach it.\n7. Therefore, we can eliminate both options A and C and be left with B: cross road.\nAnswer: B : Cross Road\n\nInput: An orange or apple is made by what? Choices: A: the company B: farmer C: tree D: factory E: seed\nRationales: Here, we are looking for the source of these fruits. The correct answer will be the word that indicates how the fruits get made, which is C: \"tree.\" \"Company\" is wrong because a company doesn't make fruits. \"Farmer\" is also not correct as it may produce fruits but does not make it. \"Factory\" is also incorrect as it too could produce fruits but does nothing to actually make them exist. \n\"Seed\" may be confused as an answer but is incorrect since it is a constituent of a fruit, and not a process by which it is made; similarly, the seed in this case cannot make an orange or apple appear.\nInput: How would a robot react if its battery is run down? Choices: A : it would not respond B: it would crash C: it would shut down D: it would shut off E: it would need a boost\nRationales: In the scenario, a robot with a run-down battery would likely experience an inability to perform its task(s) or function(s), which could be described as a \"crash,\" \"shutdown,\" or a \"shut-off.\" However, it's unlikely that a robots would react to a battery being run down or require a \"boost\" to maintain its function. \nInput: Which is most frequently used as an indicator of an organization's management philosophy?

Choices:  a: a cup b: a bucket c: a squeaky water pump d: a garden hose e: a pitcher\nRationales:\n1. The question asks about the essentials needed for using water as the source of water. \n2. Let us eliminate each of the given options one by one. \n3. 'A cuppa' is an informal phrase used to refer to a cup or glass of water. \n4. 'A bucket' is an essential part of water collection. However, it is not the only part of the 'bucket system'.\n5. In the bucket system for collecting water, 6 essential parts are required and they are bucket, a spigot, tap, water hose, a catchment pond, and the pumping system. \n6. 'A squeaky water' pump refers to the pumping system necessary to push the water stored in the catchment pond to the tap. However, this is not a requirement of the bucket system.\n7. 'A garden hose' is not essential to provide water using a bucket system as it is used to distribute water around a home or garden.\n8. 'A pitcher' is a glass typically used to pour water out from a container. However, this is also not needed to provide water from the bucket system for a specific use such as watering the garden.\n9. In short, there are other essential parts required for the bucket system that need to be present as described in the answer option 'The bucket system'. \n10. Therefore, the answer to the questions will be B: a bucket, a bucket pump, a catchment ponds, a tap, and a garden hose.\nAnswer: B. Bucket, bucket pump, catchment ponds, tap, and garden hose.\n\nInput: The boy said that what is true?

{"text": "critically' is a good skill but not related to the problem.\n5. Therefore, the correct choice is A: cross road.\nAnswer: A, B\n\nInput: What did the man have for dinner? Choices:  E: salad A: mashed potatoes C: ham B: pasta D: fruit\nRationales: The problem: What did the man for dinner, and what is man? Man is a noun and can be used as the subject (E.g: The man ate). A noun always has a gender, so the man would either be 'it' or 'he'. If 'it' is used, is there a problem with the dish chosen? The last part states that it is a salad, not \"a\", and as a salad is always a dish (E.g. 'The man ate the salad'), this would fit better with 'it', so 'The man ate it' is a correct response (E.g. It is always more correct to use 'it' for noun-related sentences). Another note: A pronoun is a substitute for a noun and is either used as a subject, object, or complement. \nA pronoun has many possible ways to substitute (E.g. The man and him is a verb). The pronoun is chosen by the writer according to the context of the sentence (E.g. A subject pronoun is used for the subject of the sentence). The pronoun substitutes for the noun. \nSince the writer chose man to be the subject, then 'it' is the correct pronoun for a noun (as man does not have a gender). This is the logical conclusion that the person chose the first choice option (E.g. E) to be the correct answer for the question and that it is correct to choose option E (man does not refer to any specific gender hence his it would be correct). Considering this reason, the correct answer is E.\nAnswer: E\n\nInput: A plane went over the plane. You had a seat that faced backwards at what time?

{"text": "critically' may mean 'use critical thinking' which is a specific mental or cognitive process and would most probably not result in going to the store.\n5. 'Crossing the road' would cause a risk of encountering traffic and thus putting one's existence at risk.\n6. Logically, if someone would like to get to a store, they should take the path of least resistance and go directly across the road to that store instead of thinking critically or drinking coffee.\n7. However, it is possible that there may be multiple stores in the area and the querent would need to decide which to visit according to their preferences. Thus, the answer is B - crossing the road and there's no need for them to think critically in doing so.\nAnswer: B\n\nInput: To find the correct street light, where should the person go to get the correct information to navigate home? Choices:  D: google maps E: a street sign A: next door neighbor B: the address on the sign  F: the address of a mall\nRationales: The question is asking for the most likely place to find the correct street light in a street sign using the information that the person has to navigate home.\nThe context implies that the person has to make use of the information provided in the street sign to find their way home or locate the street light.\nTherefore, they need to go to a place where they can find the street sign to navigate home.\nFurthermore, since they are trying to find their way home, it is possible that the street sign may not have the correct street light or address.\nConsidering this, it is unlikely that the individual would have to rely on the \"A: next door neighbor.\"\nThis option is unlikely to be the correct way to navigate home, as it is unlikely that the neighbor would have information about each and every street light on the block. \nSimilarly, it is unlikely that they would be able to use the \"B: the address on the street sign.\"\nThis option has a limited scope to navigate home since it only provides information about the address and not other specifics such as the street light that the person may be looking for.\nSo, these options can be eliminated. \nIn terms of \"C: googling the street light,\" this option is unlikely to be effective for finding specific information for navigating home.\nIn conclusion, the", "answer": "A: injuries"}

Choices: A: my cat birdwatching B: an owl C: a hawk D: a pigeon E: a sparrow\nRationales: We are to answer the question \u201cWhat was my car\u2019s beeping?\u201d by considering what action prompted the beeps. The options include going to the window and seeing an owl, a hawk, a pigeon, a sparrow, or a cat birdwatching. The context suggests that the beep was from my car. If I had seen something other than a cat birdwatching, it would not be beeping, making it a better answer than birdwatching cat. \n\nAnswer: B: a hawk \n\nInput: If I were to call you today, where would you be? Choices: 1: watching television 2: working 3: relaxing in a chair with a book 4: texting someone else 5: on my way to the store 6: at the gym 7: playing cards\nRationales: There are several logical ways to complete the task.

There are several reasons why someone might be at a given place, or not there, at any given time and day.\n\nConsider the context again: If I were to Call You Today.

Choices:  E-cigarettes/flavored tobacco that a sick human might smoke\nRationales: The question is asking what the doctor gave the sick lizard that humans might take in its place as a sickness remedy.\n1. First, we eliminate the options that are specific to humans and would not likely be options for a sick lizard.\n2. E-Cigarettes/Flavored Tobacco, would not likely be an option.\n3. Alcohol is a substance many humans drink and the lizard may consume alcohol as part of its normal diets.\n4. Cholesterol pills would not likely be included in the lizard's diet.\n5. Ibuprofen is an option but it wouldn't necessarily be the same for a sick lizard since it may not have a human medication in its diet. \n6. Finally, cough syrup would also not an appropriate choice as it's unlikely that a lizard would have it in its diet.\n7. This, combined with the lack of tobacco or alcohol, would leave us with a single option for human medicine that could be given to the lizard. \n8.

Looking at the given options we can identify that they each involve either developing the player's skills or their experience in practicing them or working with other team members to reach a common goal of playing well on the field.\n1. Option I: Improving Skill. This is a logical answer as it relates to improving the player's ability and skill level.\n2. Option II: Teamwork. This is another logical answer as it's about the player working with other teammates to improve collectively. \n3. Option IV: Practice Time. This is a logical option as well, referring to the time spent on practicing their skills rather than their improvement or experience in it.\n4. Option V: Practice with teammates.

This may describe the speaker but doesn't necessarily capture the mindset.\n2. Option B: skeptical. This is a good interpretation of \"doubtful\".\n3. Option C: suspicious. The word \"suspicious\" has a connotation of mistrust, but this may not be what the question is asking.\n4. Option D: dismissive.

All the trails are located in what can be described as wilderness, which is a place that might be a little scary to someone who isn't used to it.\n2. None of the choices here would be considered particularly scary.\n3. None of the trails mentioned would include a restaurant. \n4. A woodpile would be likely to be associated with a danger to a hiker, as it could crush one should they accidentally walk into it.\n5. Therefore, the answer must be B: stream bed.\nAnswer: B : Stream Bed\n\nInput: The grizzly bear found that the best way to catch a salmon was by swimming into what? Choices: A: stream bed B: river bank C: river D: lake E: ocean\nRationalese: \n1. The grizzly bears must swim into the body of water from which he is attempting to catch salmon.\n2. The best places for the bear to catch salmon would depend on their abundance in that area, so we can consider the natural environment. \n3. The answer must be a natural environment so we can eliminate B: river bank and C: river because they aren't natural bodies or places of water.\n4.

Here, we know that the given statement is a wish to have a doll and that the doll will be dressed like a real child, but what is the criteria that it must satisfy for the wish to be realistic. Since the question is for the part of the statement that says \"I wish I had\", the options don't need to describe the entire statement, but rather the part where it says \"I wish I\", for that, we have the following options; 1. \"It's sad and creepy\" (A): \"Sad and Creepy\" is an emotion, so it doesn't make sense for an emotion to be used to judge the realism of a part of a statement where only words are used. 2. \"It's realistic and unrealistic\"?(B): This could apply to any part of a statement and is not specific to the specific part of the statement in question here, so it cannot be used to tell if the part of the statement is realistic. 3. \"This sounds like a plan\" (C): This can also be applied to any part of a sentence (except when it is a whole sentence), which means that it can be used to decide if a specific part of the sentence is realistic. 4. \"It's practical and wise\" (D): This could also be said of any part of the sentence, and the meaning remains the same as what is described by the option \"This could be a plan\" (C). 5. \"This will work out OK\" (E) : this can only be said of one part of", "answer": "D: wall"}

Therefore, the best options are those that refer to moving the human's physical body as a way for them to reach the store. \n6. The options available are:\n- 'Cross road' involves walking and using traffic crossings and can be eliminated as we are referring to a human action that does not involve vehicles.\n- 'Cross street' is a similar action involving the same form of movement, and is therefore also eliminated.\n7-The remaining option'move' would obviously be the preferred option and is not eliminated. 8. The best answer in all cases is B: move.\nAnswer: B Move\n\nInput: What do human hands and eyes have in common? Choices: \n A: one eye per human B: one brain C: two eyes D: two hands E: one nose\nRationales: We want to determine what human hands and eyes have that is common.\n1. The options given are human hands and eyes.\n2. In terms of similarities, the two options share one of the same key element: one eye and one brain.\n3. However, the other two options are not correct as they share different features than the human hand and eye. \n4. Therefore, option A 'one eye per human' is the correct choice.\nAnswer: A One eye per human\n\nInput: Which of these is not a food group? Choices:  F: grains B: vegetables C: fruits D: milk G: meat\nRationales: The provided options consist of food groups. However, the correct option is not actually part of a food group.\n1. Options A to D are all food groups based on the Dietary Reference Intakes document which is a common reference for dietary standards.\n2. However, option F 'grains' is neither.\n3. Option F refers to a complex carbohydrate food that can be a significant source of vitamins, minerals, and fiber. While it is certainly an essential food in a healthy diet, it is not a food group and is therefore the correct answer.\nAnswer: F Grains\n\nInput: Anything that humans and other mammals cannot do is _______? Choices:  B: mamm", "answer": "C: fast"}
{"text": "critically' does not necessarily mean that critically thinking will lead to getting to the store, which further eliminates this option. \n5. 'Cross road' is eliminated as it does not serve the purpose of getting to the store, because the store can be directly reached by any person with a short walk through a road.\n6. Therefore, looking at the remaining options that fit the context provided, 'A: cross road' and 'B: see around' are both irrelevant because the person does not need to cross the road or see around to get to the store.\n7. So, the answer will be B: see around.\nAnswer: B see around\n\nInput: The dog had long fur which of the options below is not a type of long hair? Choices: 1. A: Cousin 2. B: Sibling 3. C: Parent 4.

Choices A: breakfast B: work C: break D: lunch E: afternoon\nRationales: When the clock strikers, it is typically used to denote the moment when something is scheduled to happen, usually an event or time period, such as a break, lunch, or work period. \n1. Choice A: Breakfast is incorrect because breakfast is not scheduled to happen at any particular time. It can happen anytime of the day.\n2. Choice B: Work is incorrect because we usually don't schedule our work around the time that the clock strikes each hour.\n3. Choice C: Lunch is incorrect because there's no reason to schedule our lunch around the hour of the clock striking.\n4.

She hasn't put a map on D. She didn't pack snacks E. The hikes too long\nRationales: Let's analyze choice A. First, we confirm that the question is asking that the woman is ready for a hike and didn't bring enough (water), that there is a problem. \nNow, let's identify whether water is necessary for a hike. There are two key points to consider for this question:\n1. It implies that water is necessary for the hike. 2. It implies that if the woman had enough water, there wouldn't be a problem. \nBased on these points alone, Choice A: She's wearing to many layers is ruled out.

{"text": "critically' is a possibility but does not logically fit for this question since 'thinking critically' would only be relevant if there were obstacles or complications preventing the person from getting to the store. \n5.

'Crossing the road' is also not likely to be the best option if they don't see where the store is located. \n8. 'Going to the store' is the most logical answer because it is the single most reasonable action one might do. This is simply the obvious action to take in order to proceed towards the store. \n9.

{"text": "critically' is the correct answer because humans use their critical thinking when assessing their surroundings and how to get to the location of their interest.\n5. 'Cross road' is the answer because humans commonly cross the road to get somewhere.\n6.

Choices: A: walk to another building B: open the door C: close the windows D: go into the garden E: go inside\nRationales: The first point is to identify the options provided. There shouldn't be any options that are obvious choices.\n2. One of the options has a phrase 'to another building' and 'building' is mentioned in the previous question, it is possible that 'building' can only refer to an abandoned building that has been around for years and can be dangerous.\n3. The phrase 'close the window' doesn't seem to be an option as people won't close the windows, but rather open them as rain is coming inside, especially during a hot climate.\n4. The phrase 'will do what' shouldn't be used as a question because as we know, when 'do' is used, it shouldn't be the main verb which needs to be conjugated. \n5. From these eliminations, the options that are left are A, B, C, E. The phrases in these options are 'walk to another building', 'open the door', 'close the windows' and 'go inside'.\n6. There is a big difference between the phrases 'walk to another building' and 'go inside' and the other options.\n7. Therefore, there is only one option left and the correct answer is E: go inside because as we know, it's raining and even though the inside is dry and comfortable, it may be raining outside. \nAnswer: E: go inside\n\nInput: What time would it be at 4 p.m?

Choices:  A : list B : need to find common interests C: you should find an excuse to not meet so often D: to make the meeting unnecessary E : to find excuses \n \nRationales:1. As the sentence is present in the form of a question, we understand that the speaker has asked, and we have to choose an appropriate choice to answer the question. 2. Here the word \u2018productive response means a positive and healthy response. 3. In contrast, the speaker has given a negative reply, i.e. \u2018neegative adjectives\u2019.

Choices: 1: A: cow 2: B: bull 3: C: pig 4: D: rooster 5: E: sheep\nRationales: There is only one option that fits since, when given the context of a farm, farmers would certainly keep a farm full of different animals for various purposes. Therefore, Option A : cow is the natural choice.\n\nInput: Which word is an anagram for a word that begins with c and ends with o? Choices:  C: cow  A: bocce  D: coe  B: coco  E: taco\nRationales: Here, the clue that helps the person to find the answer lies in the words that make up another word: coe. The answer will either have to be coe before or after another word, and it's quite easy to find out after the question: which is the answer bocce.\n\nInput: I had to ask around and get my bearings because I was a little lost. Choices:  A : bearings  C: around D: a little  B: I was lost  E: ask\nRationales: This question is about the statement: I had to ask and get my bearings. Ask and bearings are both verbs, so they don't fit as a logical answer to the statement. The words around and little are adjectives, so they could be used to modify the phrase. The only choice which would make absolute logical sense to the sentence is E : ask.\n\nInput: The bird watched the squirrel's antics.

This could be due to the fact that the'store' and 'crossing the road' could be related to a problem or 'thought', which requires 'critical thinking' - this was an option I chose.\n5.

{"text": "critically' can be eliminated because they have already determined that it is a store they can see and would therefore be in a state of thought already.\n5. Similarly, 'cross roads' is irrelevant as well because they do not need to navigate their way there as they can simply walk directly from where they are now.\n6. Thus, the only relevant option is'see around'. \n7. However, the question is phrased as if the action is already complete - 'He or she can see it'. Therefore, we must deduce that it refers to a possibility, not the actual course of action.\n8. There are an infinite number of possibilities on how to get to the visible store, so'see around' can only be used if it's not the actual first task.\n9. We also know that it is not a first task because the answer is 'Can see it'. If it were a first task, we would know it as 'is seeing it'.\n10. Then, it becomes evident that it is a middle action that is taking place.\n11. Thus, the only logical way to interpret the answer is'seeing it means to look'.\n12.

A: don't ask them 2. B: keep asking 3. C: don't say why you need an answer 4. D: ask for other questions 5. E: ask a question that can't be answered\nRationales: Explanation:\n1. This question is not correct. There is always a need to ask a question and get answers. There is no way to avoid it. By saying \"don\"t ask questions\", you are not making any logical sense.\n2. This question must also be ruled out. Asking is not the only option to get responses, there are other methods to get responses like requesting for a favor or requesting for other questions. This makes this question invalid.\n3. This question should be the next one to get eliminated. By saying \"do not say why you need it\", you are saying that the person may not have a need for the response. But this is not applicable for everyone. Someone may need it for something very important. Therefore, by saying this, you are denying help to many people in the world.\n4. This question also does not make sense. By saying \"ask other questions\", you are making it seem like you are asking them for a favor. Which can come out to be offensive. You can't ask people to seek favors from you to ask questions to understand them and provide their help. So this question also needs to be removed from the given options.\n5. This question is incorrect as it makes no logical sense. By saying \"you can never ask this question that can't give any response\".

D: All the dogs in this park, all the dogs all over the world. E: All the dogs in that park ran towards the beach, and all the dogs that have ever lived.\nRationales: The singular verb is the verb in the first sentence \"All the dogs in the park run towards the beach\". The same rule will apply to each of the sentences.\nNow, if any of the sentence was to be singular it must start with a singular verb. In the second sentence the verb \"ran\" is singular so the sentence is singular while in the third sentence, \"bones\" is plural and thus the sentence with it is plural.

Choices:  [A]: Use a blow dryer to dry them [B]: Use a cotton-tipped swab [C]: Using an ear cleaner made of soap and water [D]: Make sure you use an ear cleaning solution from the vet [E]: Use a soft, damp towel to clean the animal's ears\nRationales: We are given five options (A-E) that could be used to clean a dog's ears but, we only want to answer the question, \"What do we have to do?\" \n1. Therefore, the answer will be something that is simple (only 1 ingredient) and doesn't require complicated methods or tools (A, B, C).\n2. Option A: Use a blow dryer. That clearly goes beyond what the dog would naturally do if the animal is simply trying to clean its own ears. \n3. Option B: Use a cotton-tip swab. Like the blow dryer, this is a tool and is therefore not something a dog would clean their ear with. \n4. Option C: Using an ear cleaner made up of a mixture of soap and water. This may not be the safest method and so while it may remove something from the dog, it may have unintended consequences that could be dangerous - a dangerous effect might be the dog becoming wary or stressed out from the feeling of \"being cleaned\". \n5. Option D: Make sure you use an cleaning solution from the dog's vet.", "answer": "E: copulate"}

Choices:  (1)  A: to have a change of scenery (2)  B: for exercise (3)  C: to talk to a neighbor (4)  D: to visit friends (5)  E: for the fun (6) F: to stop eating ice cream\nRationales: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) A: to have a chance of scenery: The phrase \"keeping\" refers to maintaining a relationship, such as keeping up with someone's cat or child. An individual may have a change of scenary for a variety of reasons unrelated to the act of keeping up with another person or animal.\nB: for exercise: The phrase \"keep\" in \"keeping up with\" generally refers to maintaining a connection or relationship. It's unlikely the person is exercising as a way to show the family they are active with their cat.\nC: to talk to a nearby: \"keeping\" does not necessarily imply maintaining regular communication with the individual or animal, so this does not align with \"keeping up with.\"\nD: to visit friends: \"keeping\" relates to maintaining a relationship with someone, not just visiting them casually.\nE: only for fun: This doesn't make sense as it'd be odd for a cat-owner to want to go out with their cat on a leash for fun.\nF: to stop eating pets: \"Keeping up\" implies regular contact with the animal, not simply stopping one-time.\nSo, the only option that fits the criteria is B: for exercise.\nAnswer: B) For exercise\n\nInput: How might someone make a decision when they're not sure how good it is or it's not good?

That leaves option \"C\": seeing around, which refers to the act of trying to visually locate a store.\n6. A person may use logical reasoning or pay close attention to details about their surroundings to find the desired storefront. \n7. So, to get to a store in sight, a person sees around. \n8.

{"text": "critically' does not always lead a human to a location and is too vague to be a valid response.\n5. So, we can eliminate these options. \n6. 'Cross road' can be eliminated because it doesn't ensure the human's eventual arrival at the location they want to reach. While they might be on the 'correct' path, they might be going in the wrong direction or get stranded along the way. \n7. 'Crossing road' would only be a good idea if there was an obvious way to get to the desired target location - if the road crossed directly, or the store was near the end of a road, or the shortest route involved driving across the road on a one-way bridge for example. Only such situations would guarantee the human arriving at the desired location. \n8. So, the choice which could be considered the best solution to the question would be 'Crossing road'. \n9. The answer is: C: Crossing road\n\nInput: Which of the following best describes a shark's dorsal fin? Choices: 1: long and triangular 2: horizontal\nRationales: Long and triangular: One would most likely recognize a shark fin as long and triangular. \nHorizontal: The dorsal fin of a shark is generally horizontal and located at the top of the shark. It provides balance and stabilization for the shark as it swims.\n\nInput: Choose from the list of answers given, which of the following is NOT the definition of a monster?

C: salmon 4. D: banana 5. E: ice cream Conclusion: The answer is B.\nRationales: The options are as follows:\nOption 1: A. 'Mushroom soup' is incorrect because it is not related to the context of the question at all.\nOption 2: B. 'Steak' is correct because steak is one of the options given, and it is the food that the man eats after walking his dog.\nOption 3: C. 'Salmon' is incorrect because salmon is not among the options given.\nOption 4: D. 'Banana' is incorrect because banana is not among the options.\nOption 5: E. 'Ice cream' is incorrect because ice cream is not among the options and it is not relevant to the context of the conversation. \nAnswer: Option 2: B\n\nInput: It happened, the woman realized, when she did what? Choices: A: forgot to put food out for the cat B: ate a whole bowl of cookies C: read a book D: walked the dog E: took out the recycling\nRationales: We've read an earlier question that uses many of the same words. Our job, then, is to apply the same approach of thinking and analyzing. \n1. In the previous question, we were asked, \"What food does the man eat?\" \n2. In this question, there is the option 'the cat'.\n3. After eliminating that, we are left with 'the banana' as part of the question. As we know, bananas contain a high level of potassium which is good for blood pressure. \n4. This is relevant to the context of \"What happens when the woman doesn't feed the cat?\"\n5. We reason that the cat's blood pressure goes even higher when they don't feed it \n6. Therefore, the answer must be the option at", "answer": "A: new hampshire"}

Choices:  A; alone B; content C; happy D; sad E; pleased\nRationales:  1. We can eliminate choices that do not fit by determining whether the statement makes sense. If a statement does not make logical sense it can be eliminated as a choice.\n2. In this case, Lisa was already sad before her friends arrived. Thus she could not be still sad or still more sad after her friends have left.\n3. \"Alone\" does not fit. If Lisa was alone then her sadness would not have improved. \"Content\" does not fit. Although it is possible to feel content and sad at the same time, it seems unlikely that the loss of her friends affected Lisa's level of content enough to make her any more sad. \"Happy\" does fit as she was happy before her friends arrived, so she may be even happier after they leave. \"Sad\" does not work either for the same reasons. It's not logical that a person could become more sad when they were already sad.\n4. \"Pleased\" does not fit. Pleased is more suitable when describing a situation but it's not a feeling like sadness or joy that is described by the word'still' in the statement's context.\n5. Therefore, it's logical that 'Happy' is the answer.\nAnswer: H: happy\n\nInput: I am afraid of heights; I can fly. What did I learn about when I was climbing?

{"text": "critically' is also not a suitable process as the context implies that the individual is likely to be moving in a direct, linear fashion towards the store due to their being able to see it.\n5. So, we are left with options 'cross road' and 'walk'. \n6. From the question, it is apparent that the person wants to get from point A to point B as quickly and efficiently as possible. 'Walk' is a suitable option as it is the fastest and most direct way to travel.\n7. 'Cross road' does not fit the requirement as there is likely only one road, in which case the person would simply walk to the store, rather than to waste time 'crossing a road' that is no longer necessary.\n8. Therefore the answer is 'walk'.\nAnswer: A: walk\n\nInput: Why are the eyes the window to the soul? Choices: 1. A: Eyes are the sensory organ which captures information from the outside world. 2. B: Eyes allow humans to directly see what is happening. 3. C: Because they are able to convey emotions and thoughts. 4. D: They can sense both light and movement, which can be interpreted as'soul' by some cultures.\nRationales: The phrasing 'the window to the soul' implies that the eyes are capable of seeing or conveying what goes on in a person's spiritual or emotional state. \nWe are asked to explain why they do so. \nAs in the options given: \nOption 1: Eyes are an important sensory organ through which they can collect information and data. \nOption 2: Eyes allow us to directly see what's happening and gather all the information available. \nOption 3: Because they can convey what\u2019s going on in the emotional or spiritual state of the person. \nOur eyes are not the only organ that we use to sense ourselves and the world around us. \nOptions 2-4 are true, but the answer needs to be specifically why do they show the window to the soul of a person. \nSo, we are left with option A- the eyes are the most powerful sense organ which allows us to collect information that is being observed by us.\nAnswer: A) Eyes are the most powerful sense organs.\n\nAnswer: Why do people make", "answer": "D: zoological gardens"}
{"text": "critically' could be applicable, but it's a broader process, not specific to reaching the store in sight.\n5.

Choices: A: training will be done soon B: training has been finished C: dog learns how to bark D: dog will finish barking E: trainers tell dog to stop barking\nRationales: This question has two main aspects: interpreting the use of the phrase \"not going to\" and understanding why the author refers to training. \n1. The phrase \"not going to bark again...\" may be confusing for some as it appears to suggest that the dog will continue to bark.\n2. However, when this is combined with the phrase \"until he has finished training\" this would indicate that the dog will resume barking after it has finished training. \n3. This reasoning can be clarified by noting that \"barking\" in this context is being used as a verb for the process of \"making a sound,\" as in \"barking\" or \"howling,\" rather than as a noun for the sound itself, as in \"bark.\"\n4. This can be illustrated as follows: \"The dog howls until he has finished training\" - meaning that the dog will howl until it has completed its training. \n5. Because \"finished training\" is in reference to the process of the dog learning to stop making noise and to be calm, it's not uncommon for this context to say the dog will \"go on barking.\" \n6. This can be illustrated by the following example sentence: \"My neighbor barks loudly until he has finished training.\" This sentence makes sense and implies that the dog will continue barking until it has finished its \"training\" (learning not to bark/be noisy).\n7. Thus, the sentence \"The dog was not going to bar again... until he has finished training,\" in the context of the dog learning not to bark, makes sense and indicates that the dog will be b", "answer": "A: new experiences"}
{"text": "critically' implies a level of analytical thinking and evaluative judgment that is not required in order to simply reach the store, which we have already determined the human can already see.\n5. From the three remaining options, \"cross the road\" is more plausible and would be the choice as the human in question would simply need to cross the road to reach the store. \n6. Therefore, the answer to the question is \"A: cross the road,\" indicating that the human would cross the road to reach and enter the store.\nAnswer: A:\"Cross the road,\" which refers to the human passing from one side of the road to the other in order to reach the store directly visible in their field of vision.\n\nInput: The girl told her grandfather to take the long drive. What did he make of the offer? Choices: \nA: acceptance B: rejection C: happiness D: excitement E: confusion F: relief\nRationales:\n1. The question asks us to determine the grandfather's reaction to the girl's request. \n2. Looking at all the given options, \"rejection\" (Option C) seems to be the most feasible choice based on the statement that the girl told her grandfather take the long drive. \n3. The only alternative is \"acceptance\" (Option A), but this would only be the case if the grandfather was in agreement with the long drive suggestion rather than being confused by it. \n4. Thus, the answer is C: \"rejection.\"\n5. The answer is further supported when considering the context, which mentions the grandfather's long drive request to \"get away\" from people. \n6. A \"long drive\" implies a road trip, which implies a trip made for a lengthy amount of time rather than a short one, thus \"get away from people\" does not make much sense if they're only going on a short drive.\n7. There isn't really a need to take a long drive for a short distance, and that's what the context of this question is about. \n8. Therefore, Grandfather's request of a long drive refers to his desire to get away from people and his reaction is a rejection of the girl's long drive suggestion.\n9. \"Getting away from people\" implies that there's a reason to take a long drive rather than a short", "answer": "C: hockey game"}

Choices A, B, C, D, E: friends family holiday\nRationales: the question is asking us to choose a word that fits what the speaker is talking about. \nit isn't stated that the vacation was for fun or was alone. It could simply be a trip without any companion. A: friends : friends is out as there is no context or information that the speaker is referring to friends at all. B: family: the speaker is talking about going on a vacation (not family vacation) by himself. C: holiday: it's an ambiguous word and it could be defined as \"a period spent away from work or school, especially one spent traveling\" and it does not necessarily mean that speaker is talking about a trip for fun. however, the trip is for fun because the speaker is talking about how he is \"excited for his friends and family holiday.\" It is clear from context that \"holiday\" does not fit the context of the text which is the basis of our task in this exam. D: friends and family holiday: this does not mean that the vacation is going on its own; it can only mean that the speaker is excited for friends and family holidays.

Choices:  * 1. a bus 2. a bike 3. a car 4. a truck 5. a train\nRationales: * The question is asking which of the five options would 'hit' the boy, in this case, meaning cause the boy to experience a collision or impact of some kind. \n* The options are * A: B: C: D: E: 1 * a bus * a bike * a car * a truck * a train \n* Looking at the context, it doesn't make sense for the answer to be a \"bicycle\" or a \"bus\" because the question explicitly mentions that the boy is walking to the bus stop. Walking at a bus stop implies that the boy is not actively driving or riding a bicycle/bus, and thus wouldn't be the cause of a collision/impact.\n* It also doesn't make sense that the boy's walking to the bus stop in order to'see' a bicycle/car/truck/train because this seems to suggest that the boy would need to wait, rather than walk to the bus stop. \n* So, based on the above elimination of possible answer options, the only reasonable answer is E: * 2.a train.\n* Trains are a common form of public transport, and could potentially hit a walking person at a bus stop.\n* Moreover, trains often come in a long, continuous series (or 'line') which also fits the context as \"the boy walked...\" could possibly refer to a walking pace. \n* Therefore, the answer is E, meaning that the train could hit the boy as he walks to the bus stop.\nAnswer: E : 2.a train\n\nInput: Which of these words is an acronym?

Choices: A: sandwich B: milkshake C: order D: soup E: french fry\nRationales: The \"how-to\" question always needs to check that the question really refers to \"how to,\" not to make that item, as in order or serve it, as in prepare. \n1. The answer cannot be \"order\" (Option D) because making food refers to preparation.\n2. The answer cannot be either \"prepare\" (Option B) or \"serve\" (Option C) because it refers to making a specific item which is the soup, not the process of soup preparation or serving.\n3. We can eliminate the other three options by considering what a fast food restaurant employee might do.\n4. \"Sandwich\" (Option B) is an item that fast food employees may prepare and serve to customers, but it does not refer to a specific process or method of creating a sandwich. On the other hand, \"milkshake\" (Option C), \"order\" (Option E), or \"french fries\" (Option E) would be examples of specific food items that a fast food worker would be expected to prepare or know how to serve to customers. \n5.

We eliminate all the actions mentioned in the options, including 'eating vegetables,' as this refers to what a human should do in order to have a healthy body, but we are only considering the actions taken once a disease is present and has damaged the human.\n3.

The word \"quickly\" (Option F) is defined as moving or done in a short, quick, or hasty manner.\n2. Therefore, we cannot choose this option because it cannot be said when someone is in a hurry unless they are moving quickly. \n3. The word \"quick\" (Option C) is defined as moving fast, done soon, or done fast; this is a better fit and could reasonably be said of someone who is in a hurry.\n\n4. \"Slow\" (Option A) cannot apply to this context as a person in a hurry would not be moving slowly. \n5. \"Fast\" (Option D) can be said of someone who was slow initially, and then quickly picked up the pace. \n6.

Choices:  B: airport C: grocery store D: hotel E: train station F: movie theater\nRationales: It asks for a place where one can find a place to rest during the day before nighttime, and we can infer this would be a place for resting at night or after dark.\nOption B: airport. Airports cannot be classified as a place to rest during daylight hours, as there are typically many people milling about or rushing through to catch flights.\nOption C: grocery stores. Grocery stores are places where people shop primarily during the day, rather than resting.\nOption D: Hotel. Hotels are often used for resting during the day, but not necessarily at night specifically.\nOption E: Train station. Train stations may be a place to rest, but it is not specifically after dark and may vary by location.\nOption F: Movie theaters. Even during the day, movie theaters are places where people pay to watch a film, not rest, and would not classify them as a suitable place for someone to rest during the daytime before night.\nTherefore, the answer is option A, as this is the only one that seems to fall into the criteria of a place to rest during a day, and the day becoming night.\nAnswer: A, grocery store\n\n### Conclusion:\nWrite a sentence that appropriately completes each request.\n\n## Instructions:Create a list of 5 tasks from the information we provided below.

Now there are four options remaining, \u2018A\u2019, \u2018D\u2019, \u2018E\u2019 and \u2018F\u2019;\n5. \u2018E\u2019 says that it was raining heavily, and \u2018D\u2019 says that it was happening the day before, so \u2018E\u2019 and \u2018D\u2019 are eliminated. \n6. So the answer is \u2018F\u2019 - \u2018it warmed up the week before the cold snap.\nAnswer: F: it warmed up a week before\n\nInput: A cow jumped over a fence, why would it do that? Choices: A: it wanted to get to a different pasture B: it was chasing the other cows C: if it is an old cow, then it could have fallen from the fence D: if it is a young steer/ bull then it could not jump any fence E: because it likes a different grass\nRationales: Answer: C: it was chasing other cows \nIf the cow jumps over a fence there is someone or something chasing it, otherwise there would not be a need to jump over a fence. \nAnswer: A: it wanted a different pasture \nTo want a different pasture an animal would not need to jump over a boundary, they would just go to another area.\nAnswer: B. It wanted a change from the same grass. \nThe cow will only jump a fence if it is new and there is something attractive it is chasing. \nAnswer: D.", "answer": "C: chicken"}

Choices: A: agreeing to disagree B: making decisions together C: agreeing D: deciding E: disagreeing\nRationales: The question is asking about what a group can or cannot do when they're working together.\nOption A: agreeing to differ is a possibility, but it would not be very efficient if team members were arguing the same point or in different directions.\nOption B: making decisions is a possible outcome, but this option is broad and may not be accurate for the scenario since teams don't always make decisions together.\nOption C: agreeing implies team members understand each other and reach an agreement on common ground. If it's not happening, then the team will never agree together which eliminates this option, making it less likely to be the answer.\nOption D and E: disagreeing is the opposite of agreeing, so this is not the scenario described by the question.\nSince all the other options are not suitable to be team goals when working together, the answer is C: agreeing.\nAnswer: C: agreeing\n\n### Demos", "answer": "A: factory"}

Choices:  B: contract A: pact D: lawyers B: witnesses E: notaries\nRationales: This question is about a term of agreement, the contractual framework which defines the legal obligations of the respective parties and their respective legal rights and responsibilities under the terms of the agreement.\nThe contract can be thought of as a kind of agreement, for example, contractually a certain service that has already been provided by the company to its customers.\nContract terms: \"A contract is a formal agreement between two or more parties that is intended to be legally binding and enforceable by law.\"\n\"A contract is generally understood to be legally binding, although it can be cancelled at any time under certain conditions.\"\nContract Law, an essential guide to rights, remedies, and processes, (Jeremy A.

A store can be referred to as \"out of stock\", \"not having enough stock\", or \"being sold out\".\n1. The choice A: Restocked is incorrect because it is not an expression of being out of stock and not having any products left. \n2. Choice B: \"out of stock\" means there's no stock left and refers to the store currently not having any stock. 3. Choice C: \"stock", "answer": "C: drugstore"}

Option D: drink coffee is irrelevant because the question is asking for actions to follow in order to get to the store. Drinking coffee won't serve that purpose. \n8. The remaining options, C and E, are both about seeing around but the context in which they are applied is different.\n9. Both options require the ability to see and comprehend objects in the immediate surroundings but are not specifically referring to the visibility of a store or seeing a store.\n10.

Choices:  a. a bakery b. a convenience store c. a mall d. a home e. a restaurant\nRationales: When someone talks about buying goods at a convenience store or pastries at a restaurant, there's a context implying these types of places are places where people visit specifically to buy something and don't stay in the store for a long time.\nA bakery is different as it\u2019s more like a workplace, where bakers create products such as bread and cakes rather than shop for their raw ingredients.\nHence, convenience stores or restaurants cannot be the answer.\na. a bakery is a type of place where it's possible to buy flour to create bread and pastries, so option A is eliminated.\nb. a mall would provide a similar shopping experience to an actual bakery, with a wide selection of items including various types of food and drinks. Also, malls tend to operate like places people visit to do other things like socializing, so it doesn't seem aligned with the context of buying ingredients in bulk (option B can also be eliminated for the same reason).\nc. A restaurant is a place where diners are typically served food prepared in the restaurant but would not be an ideal place to buy raw materials. Therefore, this option can also be eliminated.\nd.

Otherwise, this information is likely already known and doesn't need to be considered repeatedly. \nOption D: Signposts on the Road-These are generally used to provide directions and information about the road ahead, so they don't require a deep level of understanding to interpret. \nOption E: The Speed Limit- It should already be clear that the person should not exceed the speed limit if they don't want to risk getting a ticket.

Choices: A: high quality B: free C: repairs D: cheap E: fuel efficiency\nRationales: Firstly, let's analyse the phrase \"free car\". Does something that costs nothing mean it is of high quality, or is of high value?\nNot even the most diehard capitalist would argue that a free car is a great investment. Something that costs nothing cannot be of high value. \nSecondly, consider the choice \"high quality\". Does \"high quality\" mean that the investment is cheap? A high quality car would usually be expensive, not inexpensive/inexpensive. \nThirdly, the choice \u201ccheap\u201d is not a value but a price, as it says \"at a cheap price\". There would be no reason to specify that a car is cheap if it is also a great investment. \nFourthly, does \"free car\" cause us to ask about fuel efficiency? We can immediately discard this answer as being completely irrelevant to a question about high value or expense of a car. \nFinally, we are considering a great investment, not a car of little value. Repairing a car is a waste of money, not creating a great investment.\nTherefore, we know that the car is an excellent investment that costs something, so it would certainly not be free or cheap, so the options \"high quality\" and \"high cost\" need to be eliminated, leaving us with only the choice E: fuel efficiency. \nIn fact, we can narrow this choice further because the car is an excellent or great investment, it would not be less economical (a choice that would indicate less economy) therefore, \"economic\" can be eliminated leaving us with the choice E: fuel-efficient which is what is expected when we consider that a car is of great value.\nAnswer: E : fuel efficient\n\nInput: Why would a person be", "answer": "C: shop"}

If it's nearby, then crossing the road would be very easy.\n6. The phrase 'he or she' is problematic because many questions and answers of this format do not specify such a binary. \n7. This can be resolved by removing this phrase and treating the question as only referring to a single person.\n8. So, it makes sense that the answer we came up with is B: cross road.\nAnswer: B : cross road\n\nInput: After reading a biography, which of these words can be found in a dictionary? Choices:  B: biography A: dictionaries B: people C: authors D: histories\nRationales: The word \"biography\" is a noun meaning a detailed account of a person's life, written or oral.\nBiographies typically include details of an individual's life, including their education, family, career, etc. \nThe word \"biography\" may be found in a dictionary under the definitions listed below:\n\n* The authoritative record or report on the life of an individual, written by someone other than the person involved.\n* An account or record of the life and career of a particular person.\n* A full description of all aspects of a person's professional career.\n* The written history of an individual person.\n\nDictionaries typically list definitions and information related to the English language. They do not contain any personal or public information about a person. Therefore, \"biography\" is unlikely to be found in a dictionary as it contains references to people and may contain some sensitive personal or private data.\n\nThe word \"biographies\" can be found in a list of authors and may be found in a list detailing the biographies themselves, but it does", "answer": "E: walking out of"}

Choices:  B: go shopping C: write to manufacturers D: get rid of old stuff E: try to earn more money\nRationales: Input Question to get right answer : a:b:c:d:e\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\nInput: A store manager might try to get rid of a big problem without telling customers about it. He might do what? Choices: a: close to customers b: ask for money c: apologize d: hide the problem e: put a sign nearby\nRationales: Process:\nStep 1: The question asks us to guess what a store manager would do when faced with a big problem he wants to keep from his customers.\nStep 2:: Looking at the options given we could eliminate some possibilities. A close to customers (option a) does not make any sense as a store manager cannot go to customers, and the options is probably referring to a store. Additionally, if there\u2019s a big problem that customers have to be made aware of, the idea of apologising (option c) does not seem like it fits the question\u2019s context.\nStep 3:: Apologising (option c) is something that a manager would do with customers if there had already been a problem but in this scenario, the manager is trying to avoid causing problems. So the question is focussing on potential actions and not reactions. This eliminates apologizing as a possibility.\nStep 4: The remaining options are Hide the problem (option d), Asking for money (option b), putting a sign nearby (option e) and put a sign nearby (option A). \nStep 5:: Hiding the problem (option D) does not make sense as the problem is still there and needs to be addressed if it\u2019s important enough. Asking for money (Option B) is not the best answer because the store manager would probably not want to face his customers and would need to be proactive in trying to avoid a solution that involves money.

So, the correct answer is C: cross road.\nAnswer: C: cross road\n\nInput: Why did we go outside? Choices:  (1) A: to sit in the sun B: because I wanted to (2) C: to have some fresh air D: I wanted (3) E: to workout\nRationales: (1) The first option (A: to sit in the SUN) is not a logical answer because the sun isn't an inside/outside option, and the option wording says nothing about sitting on the ground.\n(2) The second option (B: because I wanted to) might be an acceptable answer if it referred to a reason for the other options.\n(3) The options for why we went outside (to sit in the sun, go to the park, workout) all fit the context and use similar language (to outside, it's outside because of...), so it's reasonable to choose either as a valid alternative.\n(4) The question isn't asking why each of us went outside, so the last option (answer E: workout) is not relevant.\n(5) Therefore, the correct answer to the question is B: because I wanted To have some fresh air. \nAnswer: B: because I wanted - To have some fresh air", "answer": "E: printer"}

Other parts of a city? Choices: 1. A: stores 2. A: roads 3. A: streets 4. A: wind breaks 5. B: stores 6. B: roads 7. B: streets  Money can buy B: wind breaks\nRationales: We begin with the options provided and try to eliminate all the wrong ones. \n1. Option A: Roads do not have breezes. So we can immediately eliminate this option as an answer.\n2. Option A: Breezes are often found in nature, not stores, so this can be eliminated. \n3. Option A: The same considerations as above hold true for streets.\n4. Option A: If people want to find a breeze, they are not typically looking for wind breaks; these are structures that block the movement of wind.\n5. Option B: Money can purchase breezes; therefore, it can also purchase wind breaks, which means that this option is not the answer.\n6. Option B: Similarly, money cannot be used to purchase stores, roads, or streets, which eliminates these options.\n7. Option B: So, based on the answer options we have, the correct answer is Option A: wind breaks.\nAnswer: A  : wind breaks\n\nInput: In an office, what is a place to store a document that would be a secret?

Choices:  M: hammer B: chisel T: pliers C: knife D: wrench E: fork\nRationales: The question is asking what the correct tools are to use when one is being careful and wants to avoid getting injured.\nWe can eliminate the incorrect answer by considering the fact that Jack's being careless.\nOption M: hammer (Incorrect) A hammer can do serious damage.\nOption B: chisel (Incorrect) While some chisels do not have a sharp edge, they are still made of metal which can cause injury. They can also be used as a blunt or pointed tool and even cut the skin.\nOption T: pliers (Incorrect) The plier is a multi-purpose tool that has multiple sharp edges and points. So it cannot be said that it is not a sharp or pointed tool causing injury to somebody.\nOption C: knife (Correct) A knife is a sharp object made for cutting or slicing, and is the most reliable choice in any situation when someone is being careful and wishes to avoid getting hurt. There are many types of knives that are harmless and safe to use.\nThe Correct Answer is C: knife, because knives are commonly used for cutting and slicing, and there are many ways you can use the knife safely without getting injured such as chopping vegetables without cutting the skin, removing labels, cleaning etc.\nKnives will never cause serious injury unlike the other tools like pliers hammer etc.\nAnswer: C: knife\n\nInput: What is necessary for a person to accomplish certain things without the use of tools or machinery?

While he was digging a whole, his spade cut the root of what? Choices: A: grass B: bush C: plant D: tree E: snowman\nRationales: First we understand the question in terms and ask ourselves what type of root a snowman would have. We then recognize that a tree is the only choice that fits.\nThen we eliminate options that would not be cut down by a spade. For example, while grass grows beneath a snowman, it could not be cut down by the spade. Likewise a plant has no root that can be severed by a spade.\n\nAnswer: D: tree\n\nInput: It was so early in the morning that it didn't seem like the correct time for the man to leave.

{"text": "critically' is an action that requires the mind, not the body, to carry out, so it cannot be the answer as the question specifically mentions the body.\n5. 'Cross the road' is a viable answer choice because crossing the road physically takes a human body to get to the other side of the road and thus into the store, which they can physically see from where they are at present. \n6. Crossing the road can involve walking or driving a car.\n7. Therefore, 'crossing the road' is the answer and the correct one as it describes the action that a human would take to get to the store.\nAnswer: E : cross road\n\nInput: There is a town where there is a lot to do, they have a zoo and an aquarium, what would be the next logical thing to do? Choices: 1: See who else is there 2: Explore 3: Eat 4: Go to another state 5: See the ocean, Choices: 37: 1,2,3,4,5\nRationales: Answer:  Choice 37 \"See the ocean\": The options given are all valid choices and none can be ruled out. \"Go to another state\" would seem impossible as that would negate the rest of the options. \"Other states\" are outside what we know of this town. Eating and exploring would take too long. What we know about this town is that it has much to do: a zoo and aquarium. So what would be the logical next thing to do? Go to another state means there is nothing else to do but see the ocean. The answer must involve the choices that come after that.

{"text": "critically' refers to a certain kind of thought process, not actually something people would physically do to get somewhere.\n5. 'Cross road' refers to crossing the intersection with traffic. It's not the most logical action to take in order to get to the store because the store is within sight and there's no reason to do a risky crossing of roads instead just going to the store.\n6. Therefore, the answer would be A: cross road.\nAnswer: A; cross road (Crossing the intersection requires physical movement to get to a store.)\n\nInput: When someone has completed all of his or her homework, I ask what to do now? Choices: \tA: sit down B: watch TV C: go to bed; sleep D: take off shoes E: take out the garbage\nRationales: Let's look closely to understand the implication of this question. The phrase at the end which states \"I ask what to do now\" informs us that doing homework is in fact a completed task, and that it would be followed by other tasks, such as those stated in options B-E. Since it is completed, it suggests that some time has elapsed between its completion and the follow-up tasks, and indicates the completion of homework to not be an immediate action and completion of homework to be a part of a bigger overall process that takes a longer amount of time. \nLooking at the options, option A is clearly incorrect since homework is the only activity that the phrase \"I ask what to\" suggests. Option B involves watching TV, and could potentially be done immediately after homework is completed. Option C involves going to bed, and while this might be something people do after completing homework, the suggestion of doing this implies that this is a habitual behavior as homework is a habitual and repetitive activity in most cases, and would in theory be an action done at the end of something like homework. This would fit the given information and eliminate Option B. Option D involves removing one's shoes, which is possibly an action that might be done right after homework is completed, but the words \"now\" and \"I ask\" at the end would suggest it's not an immediate occurrence. Option E includes \"taking out the garbage\", but doesn't suggest it to be something people do after finishing homework.\nIn the end, option B is elimin", "answer": "D: shelf"}

Choices:  B: pedals C: chain link D: cog wheel E: back wheel\nRationales: Consider the diagram of a bicycle where it becomes immediately evident that the front wheel, cog wheel, and chain link are all parts of the bicycle.\nNote that the options A, B, and C are all correct terms relating to mechanical components of bicycles. Consequently, no further reasoning is needed to eliminate these incorrect choices.\n7. It is necessary to consider the diagram below which clearly specifies the relevant structure as follows: pedals, front wheel, cog wheels and chain links. Above the diagram of the part of the bicycle, it has written 'parts including', which is a clue that we should only choose the options that are parts of the bicycles.\n8. The front wheel is clearly a part of a bicycles, so it is most plausible for the front wheel to be a part of the bicycles and eliminate option E: back wheel.\n9. Option C: chain-link is also a part of the bicyle and not excluded. However, the diagram given provides no evidence as to where the 'chain-lock' connects on the bicycle thus the 'chain-lock can either be a part of the back wheel, pedals, front wheel or cog-wheel.\n10. Option D: cog wheel, is included as part of the bicycling which can be seen in the diagram as the 'drive chain' part of the diagram is a rotating chain and a cog wheel is part of a chain and is thus included as a part of option D and should be accepted as the correct answer.\nAnswer: C\n\nInput: What is this a photo taken of?

Choices:  a: an alligator B: a snake C: a dolphin D: a tiger E: a bear\nRationales: There are two options that would allow you to see a dog, and only one option that would allow you to view a person. Option A: An alligator. An alligator is able to see a dog; however, it would not be able to see a person since they aren't as close in proximity to it.\nOption D: A tiger. A tiger would be able to see a dog since they are closer in proximity. It may also be able to see a human, although it would depend on how close they are to each other. However, a tiger is very unlikely to be able to see a dolphin.\nOption B: A snake. Since a person is likely to be far closer to the snake, the person would be able to see it. However, the snake's vision would not be any better than its ability to see a dog.\nOption C: A dolphin. As a dolphin's vision is sharp and it is more closely associated with water, it would have a more advanced view of the world in comparison to a dog's.\nOption E: A bear. Unlike a snake and dog, who see more like human beings but are still rather far away, a bear would be able to see clearly as it is closer and shares a more similar habitat with humans.\nDolphins are more likely to see you than tigers because they are closer. Tigers are more likely than snakes to see you, because you are more likely to see a tiger as opposed to a snake, when both are equally far away.\nAnswer: Option D: A tiger\n\nInput: Where would a person look for toys if he or she is looking for a toy and have not found", "answer": "C: snoring"}

The choice C: No A:No could be eliminated because calling in most cases is done when there is a concern to avoid accidents. Also, it can be dangerous to get into the other road before an emergency vehicle can reach the other site because that can create another danger. Additionally, some roads and streets have cameras installed to record and monitor the movement of vehicles. So if the driver is responsible and has the right sense, he will stop to avoid the accident if it is an emergency.\n3. The brake light could simply mean that the driver is responsible and he might stop. But if the light is an issue in the car, then probably the car isn't operational and it needs to be towed. In that case, the brakes aren't working and the driver would already have stopped.\n4. It is also best for the safety of everyone in the car to stop if you have lost control or are facing an emergency of any kind for safety purposes. So in the end, the choice C makes the most sense because it's about the safety and security of all involved. Choice A makes the least sense because if an emergency is happening, the driver should stop and not wait for anyone to call the authorities.\nAnswer: C: No\n\nInput: A man is not good with sports.

Choices: A: lying on the floor B: sitting out of place C: getting dirty D: unpacked E: not being made use of\nRationales: The word \"then\" indicates the toy has not yet been used. 1. We can quickly eliminate the option \"getting dirty\" (Option C) as a toy already present in a home isn't dirty, so the toy in the question clearly would not be getting dirty if it's not in use. 2. We can also quickly eliminate the word \"made use of\" (Option E) as a noun phrase. 3. \"Unpacked\" (Option D) makes little sense as a noun phrase in this context and doesn't fit with the word \"if\" in the sentence. 4. The remaining options, \"lying on the floor\" (Option B) and \"sitting out of place\" (Option A), fit well with inactivity and can be removed. The answer is A: lying on the Floor. Answer: A: Lying on the floor.\n\nInput: Who does the person in the picture with a hat? Choices: 1.

Next, we determine how the image shows the connection. In this case, the person is wearing a hat which indicates someone with whom they have some sort of connection or relationship. Looking at the remaining answers - A through D (the woman, children, and parents) - we can determine that the person in the photo is wearing the hat, indicating that they are most likely the same person as whoever is wearing the hat.

Choices: \t A: music B: candlelight C: meditation D: scary movie E: deep breathing\nRationales:\t 1. The question asked us to choose a possible way to help a person relax. \n2. It's safe to eliminate options A: music, C: meditation, and E: deep breathing which are not ways one might relax.\n3. Option D: scary movie is also incorrect because a scary movie can actually be quite stressful for a person.\n4. Option A: music includes various types which can be distracting and cause a person to relax if they like it, but it also includes songs with words, so it's not the best option.\n5. Option B: candlelight. This is often used as a way to relax, but if this isn't appealing to the individual - it's not so helpful!\n6. Option D scary movies can be beneficial and if they are a favorite, they could help, but this would depend on the person. \n7.

Therefore, the answer could be D: cross road.\nAnswer: D : cross road\n\nInput: In what sense might you say someone has a nose? Choices:  a: nose c: brain d: smell e: sense\nRationales: The first step is to define the word 'nose'. A nose is the projecting or prominently raised point on the muzzle of many mammals and, especially, of man. When we hear this word, we do have an image in our mind. It should be noted that when we hear or read 'nose', we are immediately trying to picture the word. We are trying to think of anything or anyone that can resemble 'nose'. We are trying to define the word. \nNow that we have understood the meaning of 'nose', let us look at the sentence. When we are trying to picture a nose, it will always be accompanied with the word'smell'. A nose is responsible for sensing and conveying information about odors or smells. Therefore, in a literal sense we can say that someone has a 'nose' when we are referring to the smell or sense of smell. One should note that the word has a different meaning depending on the sentence and its context. The word 'nose' can also mean a projection in some cases. \nConsider the given options: \na: nose \u2013 cannot be used in this sense as it connotes 'nose' is a projection (point) \nc: brain \u2013 cannot be used in the context of the sentence. A 'nose' cannot be a brain. \nd: smell \u2013 the answer is'smell'\ne: sense \u2013 the sentence is asking you about a particular sensation called smell and not the sense of smell.\nAnswer: Option A should be A: nose\n\nInput: A man is in a dark room in the midst of a storm.

{"text": "critically' or 'critical thinking' is the action of evaluating information rationally and logically, not walking to a store in sight.\n5. We can rule out any options that are not appropriate means to getting to a store one sees or is otherwise in one's sight. \n6. Now we can eliminate the remaining options with logical reasoning.\n7. Looking at option A: cross road, crossing a road is not necessary if you can see the store where you want to be. It would be illogical to cross a road and the store is already in sight, so this option is eliminated. \n8. Looking at option B: see around, the action of'seeing around' is more relevant to the world of cybersecurity rather than moving to a nearby store.\n9. Looking at option C: drink coffee, coffee is not directly related to walking to a store in our sight and is thus not an appropriate answer.\n10. Therefore, the correct options are D: think critically and E: critically thinking. This leaves us with two options: think critically and critically thinking.\n11. Critical thinking is the activity of evaluating information rationale, so we can determine that \"critically thinking\" is the correct choice.\n12. Both options can be considered appropriate ways to get to a store or other location. However, the \"critically thinking\" answer is specific and can mean the actions of pondering to figure out what direction to take to reach a store. \"Thinking critically\" applies to a broader set of actions.\nAnswer: D-E: think critically and critics thinking", "answer": "E: laundry room"}
{"text": "critically' can work as an answer, but it's too vague and nonspecific to be of much use in this example, implying a process of thinking not related to the action of getting to the store, which is our focus.\n5.

B: escape 3. s: use a fake urination 4. D: use a mirror to cheat 5. E: walk out\nAnswer:\nRationales:\n\n1. The question asks how it would be possible for the student to cheat on a test in a locked room. Therefore, we should look for ways other than using a key to cheat on the exam.\n2. 'Escape' - the question isn't about escaping the room, so this cannot be chosen as the answer.\n3. 'Fake urination' - this is an irrelevant answer that doesn't directly allow the student to cheat.\n4. 'Use a mirror to cheat' - this can be eliminated due to the fact that mirrors are reflective and therefore do not allow for cheating.\n5. 'Walk out' eliminates as it is not possible to walk out of a locked room.\n6. 'Use a duplicate key' eliminates the answer because it is not possible for the student to know another key to unlock the door unless the teacher or other parties involved in setting up the exam give them the key. So, this is not a possibility.\n7. The answer is 1: use a duplicate key. 'Use a duplicate' implies that there is another key available and the student can get it from another person.\nAnswer:\n\n* A: use a duplicate\n\nInput: Which of these best describes a lunch box?

{"text": "critically' makes little sense since a person wouldn't need to think critically to get to a store. \n5. 'Cross road' does not match the premise. It can be eliminated because the answer is supposed to be a human action or behavior rather than an inanimate object or an action that a human cannot perform.\n6.

Choices:  F: he is smart G: he can see all his fingers H: he can read music  I: they are his\nRationales:  1. The question asks why John knows that piano is a musical instrument. That is, we need to determine, given the context, what John\u2019s basis is for knowing this.\n2. The choices given seem a little odd as possible answers to the question. For example, \"He is smart\" (Option F) doesn\u2019t answer the question, but just describes John\u2019s capability in other areas.\n3. \"He can see all his fingers\" (Option H) doesn\u2019t make sense in the context provided as pianos are a musical instrument played with the fingers of the hands. \n4. \"He can read music\" (Option I) isn\u2019t in the premise, so also it can be eliminated as a possibility for the right answer.\n5. \"Fingers\" (Option H) could be considered if it provided more information about the fingers but it does not. \n6. Therefore, we can eliminate the remaining options leaving only \"G: he can see all my fingers\" (Option G) as the right answer. It states that John uses his eyes to see that it\u2019s a musical instrument while the original context shows that a piano is an instrument played using the fingers.\nAnswer: F: he is smart\n\nInput: The fish swim in the lake, they are animals in the water Choices:  I: a lake is a body of water  J: fish are amphibious  K: fish are reptiles  L: fish are aquatic  M: they are vertebrates\nRationales: Answer: O:", "answer": "B: frustration"}

Choices: \nA: swimming pool B: fish pond C: lake D: fountain E: ocean\nRationales: First, we can ask ourselves what makes sense as the object in the question has a clear context. \nSecond, it's logical to assume that such an object can only exist either above or below a bridge.  \nThe object cannot be above a bridge because if it's above a bridge, then it's a plane and therefore not \"in\" either a fountain or a lake. \nIf the object is below a bridge, it is likely more suited to be a pond or a lake which fits the question's context. \nSince only bridges and fountains are mentioned in the question and can reasonably fit this specific context, the most logical choice is A: swimming pool \nAnswer: A\n\nInput: On where is a bakery located? Choices: \t A: supermarket B: building C: store D: mall\nRationales:\t1. On where is a baker located?\tBy asking \"where is a baker located\" the answer must be a place where it can be located.\n2. Supermarket, building, and store all fit the contextual question since bakeries can be located in all these places and they aren't the specific object in question.\n3. \"Mall\" cannot be a plausible choice considering it's not an appropriate or likely place to locate a bakery.\n4. Since only three choices are available from the above, \"D: mall\" would be the most logical choice because in modern times malls tend to house shops other than bakeries, for example, clothing stores, jewelers, etc.\n5.

{"text": "critically' is a phrase related to decision-making and reasoning, but a store is not exactly complex to get to. It may not be that simple of a 'critical' decision, but it is a short distance that would not require a lot of thought. Therefore, option D can be eliminated. \n5. To \"look up information\" would make this task more complicated than it needs to be and would definitely be a more 'critical' step. \n6. 'Drive car' and 'walk' are options that are likely needed to get to the store and are relevant to the question.\n7. However, taking either of these would be unnecessary since the store is visible to you and is not out of reach. \n8. Taking a bus could also be an option; however, since the store is so close, it would make no difference in terms of getting there if you took a bus or not.\n9. Therefore the answer is B: cross road. It is the only option which makes sense because the store is directly in view, or on the 'other side' of whatever road one would cross.\nAnswer: B. cross road\n\nInput: Why is the pizza topping baking important?

The reference to 'walk a dog' in the question implies a person, presumably the human in question, and not an animal. Therefore this option can also be eliminated. \n6. So, the only remaining options are A, B, or C.\n7. A, B: While \"See around\" and \"Cross the Road\" are both acceptable definitions of 'getting to a store that is in the line of sight,' \"See around\" is more specific and accurate as it involves changing one's position to view the store in question.\n8. So, the correct answer is B: See around.\nAnswer: B. See around\n\nInput: What is a person's best choice if a place has not a single thing to do there and it's been a rainy day? Choices: 1. A: wait 2. B: go to another place 3. C: watch the waterfall 4. D: go to a sports game 5. E: go to the movies\nRationales: Let's start by determining what the question is asking. The question is asking about a situation where there is nothing to do. This means there are no options. \n1. We eliminate it since there is no best choice with no choices to choose.\n2. Next, we decide which option does not fit the given situation. \n2-A: \"go to another place\" doesn't make sense because in this situation, the person is already at the other place. So, it's not a suitable option.\n3-A: \"watch the waterfall\" doesn't make any sense in this context, as it does not fit the given scenario of having nothing to do, and having only one choice.\n3-B: \"go to a sports game\" doesn't fit either, as there's nothing to suggest that the weather has anything to do with it. The focus should be on the lack of things to do, not something that has nothing to do with the weather.\n3-C: \"go to the movies\" is also not a suitable option, as it does not make sense in a situation where there is no choice available.\n4-D: This option fits the context of the rainy day", "answer": "A: eat grass"}
{"text": "critically' is not a direction.\n5. Only option A: Cross road is related to getting to the store by walking across the road. \n6. So, the answer would be A: cross road.\nAnswer: A : Cross road\n\nInput: What's the opposite of a panda? Choices:  None, because it doesn't have an opposite.  A: elephant B: monkey C: dog D: rabbit E: cat\nRationales: None: There is no opposite for a panda; a panda is just a panda. The word 'opposite' is being used as a metaphor to convey the absence of an opposite; this is misleading and not used in any form of communication or reasoning.\n1. As the option 'None' is correct, we can discard the remaining options.\n2. Option A: Elephant is a mammal but is not an opposite to a panda.\n3. Option B: Monkey is a mammal and is not opposite to a panda because a panda is a specific kind of mammal.\n4. Option C: Dog is a mammal, but it cannot be considered opposite to a panda as it is not a mammal from the same animal kingdom, and is not even a mammal from a similar animal kingdom.\n5. Option D: Rabbit is not opposite to a Panda as it is a rodent and not a mammal.\n6. Option E: Cat is not opposite to a  Panda as it is also a mammal. (There are many other reasons why cat can't be opposite to a panda)\n7. So, in conclusion, 'None' is the correct answer because there is no opposite to a Panda\nAnswer: None\n\nInput: How did the man get to a specific town without a car? Choices:  He did not need a car; the town was close to his home.  A: Walk B: Bike C: Taxi D: Motorcycle E: Train\nRationales 1. The man could reach the town without a car if: the town is near his home and the man is capable of walking there.\n2. The question doesn' mean that the town is not close to the man's home.   There could be other factors like the man walking to his", "answer": "E: read book"}
{"text": "critically' is a somewhat plausible response since this does involve thinking but it doesn't directly result in the action of getting to the store, so its removal from the possible choices.\n5. So,'see around' and 'cross the road' or 'cross road' can be eliminated. They both refer to the same action of getting to the targeted store.\n6. 'Cross the road' can potentially mean something else in other circumstances but it is best interpreted in this sentence where the action of crossing a road to get to the store is the actual answer.\n7. Therefore, given the answers are \"sick around\" and \"cross the road\", the correct answer is B: see around.\nAnswer: B = See around\n\nInput: Where could a man find a cupcake? Choices:  B: store A: backyard C: restaurant D: kitchen E: sidewalk\nRationales:\n1. The question is a very general one about identifying locations where a man can find a cupcake.\n2. Looking at the answer choices given, the most logical place where he can find a cupcakey is at a store. \n3. Therefore, answer A is best since he could easily find a cupcake at a store rather than out and about in his backyard, at a restaurant, or in his kitchen.\n4. Additionally, looking at answers B: store and C: restaurant, the former refers to a specific type of store (for example, a grocery store can sell cupcakes), while the latter is ambiguous and difficult to answer.\n5. The remaining choices don't provide a specific location for finding a cupcake. \n6. Therefore, we get the answer A: store based on the logic deduced from the remaining choices.\nAnswer: A = Store\n\nInput: Why not to eat from your food cart? Choices:  C: It's unhealthy and uncomfortable to eat from a food cart  B: Food carts are expensive C: The food in carts may be rancid or rotten  D: Food carts are overpopulated E: To eat from a food cart is too messy for people\nRationales: The answer given is D, however, the question is not: \"why should you not eat from your food cart?\" but instead is: \"why not to", "answer": "E: office building"}
{"text": "critically' is an action and cannot be used as a verbal response to a question.\n5. This leaves 'crossing road,' which is a feasible and logical response. A human being would cross the road to get to a store if it were visible to them.\n6. Therefore, the answer to the question is A: cross road.\nAnswer: A. Cross road\n\nInput: Tiffany's father, George called a family meeting. His reasons why are A: he wanted to share good news with his family. B: he wanted to make plans to celebrate after a successful year. C: the new year and how to make a resolution. D: there was new information that had come to light. E: he was leaving on business to go elsewhere.\nRationales: Based on the statements provided, we know that George called a meeting to share information with his family. Now we need to determine the reason why he called the meeting.\nStep 1: Considering the statements provided, we can eliminate some of the options as they fail to meet the requirements for the information shared.\nStep 2. First, let's look at option D: \"There was new information that had came to light.\" While it's true that George might need to share new information with his family, that doesn't necessarily mean he called a family meeting to do so. \nStep 3: The next elimination is option E: \"He was leaving on business for another place.\" While George might want to share information before departing, he may choose another method or could be addressing the family meeting in the airport or during his trip rather than calling a family meeting specifically to share the information.\nStep 4: Next, let's examine option C: \"The New Year and how to make a New Year's resolution.\" While George may want to talk to his family about the New Year, calling a family meeting specifically for that purpose seems unlikely. \nStep 7: Now, let's look carefully at option A: \"He wanted to share good news.\" This seems to be the most likely reason George called a family meeting and can be retained as the answer. \nStep 8: Since the answer is \"A: he wanted to share Good News with his family,\" none of the other options can be correct.  \n\nAnswer: A: he wanted to Share Good News with his family\n\nInput: To what are", "answer": "C: get tired"}
{"text": "critically' is also not a necessary step in getting to the store as it doesn't directly help solve the problem.\n5. We have only two options left: cross road and'see around'. Since both roads and shops exist near each other, it is clear that the two go hand-in-hand, and the person will probably have to cross the road to get to the shop.\n6. The correct answer is therefore A: cross road.\nAnswer: A. cross road\n\nInput: Do I think it is wise to take part in an activity that you are not sure about? Choices A: absolutely not B: if others are C: maybe D: definitely E: yes please\nRationales: * 1. I would consider each of the options given, as well as the question, to get a sense of the context.\n* 2. I would consider the wording of the question 'Do you think', so it is possible that this is not about me personally.\n* 3. I would assess the options from A to E and consider their relation to the previous point before coming to a more informed answer.\n* 4. Considering that the wording 'it would be wise' is followed by 'if the activity is something you are not sure about', it is quite clear that the options, A to E, all pertain to that situation.\n* 5. If a person does not know about an activity, they most likely do not know if it is wise to take place in, so options A to D should be eliminated as they are incorrect.\n* 6. Therefore, all that remains is option E: Yes please. Answer: E: Yes please\n\nInput: Is there a place where you can find your friends when you are lost? Choices A: apartment B: library C: airport D: park E: mall\nRationales: The question asks for a place where you can go to meet your friends when you are \"lost.\" This means that you should go to a place where someone is likely to be in order to get help. The remaining answer choices all indicate places where people are likely to be, but are not places to help you find your friends. \nA: apartment: Apartments are not usually a communal space where people gather, so this cannot be a suitable option.\nB: library: Many different people frequent libraries, but they are not going", "answer": "C: honest"}
{"text": "critically' may be a potential solution, but the question doesn't specify that thinking critically is a must, 5. so the answer may be no.\n6. The only two remaining options are 'cross the road', which could potentially be the solution, and 'use a car', which would be more time-consuming than just crossing the road.\n7. 'Using a car' doesn't make sense, as it seems counterintuitive to arrive at the store after crossing the road. So the answer must be A: cross road.\nAnswer: A cross road\n\nInput: For many years, the man has not gone shopping because what? Choices: A: He likes online shopping  B: His friend told him it's easy C: He forgot  D: He thinks the outlet is for senior citizens E: It is out of the way\nRationales: The question asks for the reason why The man has not gone sho\npping for years.\n1. \"He likes online shopping\" (Option A) is an incorrect answer, as going shopping (to a physical store) is not the same as shopping online, so this statement does not solve the problem of why he has not gone shopping. It would simply be a reason to go online, if he were to suddenly start going shopping, but does not necessarily answer the question.\n2. \"His friend told him it'\ns easy.\" (Option B) could potentially be a solution to the problem of not going shopping, but it's just a suggestion from a friend, not something the man has actively worked on.\n3. \"Hes forgotten\" (Option C) does not make sense. Going shopping requires an active decision to go, whereas it's possible to forget to go. Therefore, while a person may forget to go, it doesn't mean that they aren't going, which is the question being asked.\n4. \"he thinks the outlet is not for senior citizens\" (Option D) makes sense at first, as shopping usually seems targeted to younger people, but it's unclear in this case whether the outlet is designed for senior citizens or just isn't commonly visited by them.\n5. \"It is out of the way.\" (Option E) is a logical explanation, as going out of one's way likely requires extra effort, thus leading this", "answer": "A: holding"}
{"text": "critically' is a phrase that can be understood as a person analyzing and coming up with a logical solution to a problem which would make them appear to 'think critically' while looking for the store.\n5. This action fits the context of the question and as such 'think critically 'can be chosen as the best response.\nAnswer: B : see around\n\nInput: What happened to the bird after it flew into the glass in the kitchen? Choices: 1: It dropped on the floor.\n2: The bird got a shock from the collision.\n3: It became paralyzed.\n4: There was no way for it to get out\n5: It sustained fatal damage.\n\nRationales:  1. The question asks about the outcome of a bird that flew into a glass surface in a kitchen. 2. It's possible that the bird suffered minor injuries and was able to fly away or may have even perished. 3. The bird could have collided with the glass due to either the force of gravity or another sudden action, such as sneezing or coughing, that caused the bird to change direction before making contact with the glass. However, such an event would not make the bird paralyzed. 4. If the bird became paralyzed after hitting the glass, it would likely not be able to fly away or escape and therefore not \"get out.\" 5. If the bird sustained fatal damage to the extent that it \"got out\" or was able to fly away, that would no longer be it but rather its carcass.\n\nAnswer: 3: It became paralyzes\n\nInput: The fisherman looked at the fish and what? Choices: a: saw it b: admired c: ignored d: stared at e: stared at\nRationales: In the given scenario, the fisherman is looking at the fish and deciding whether to keep it or throw it back. So a question about what they are doing would be: What is the fisherman doing while looking at the fish?\nSince we know the fisherman is looking, it is important to ask what he is doing while he does so.\nA person, when looking for something they want, will often be admiring it or thinking about what it means to the person. (Such a person usually doesn't intend to buy", "answer": "D: city centre"}
{"text": "critically' is another irrelevant answer choice that offers no information about the process of getting to a store.\n5. Finally, 'cross road' can only be done \"to\" get to the store, rather than \"if\" it needs to be done.\n6. So the only valid answer choice left is'see around', as we might need to do it 'around' the obstructions blocking the view of the store.\nAnswer: B- See Around\n\nInput: What does one do after reading many different articles on a computer?

{"text": "critically' is not necessary because of the clarity of the question.\n5. It could also be implied that the human would 'cross the road', so 'cross road' is not relevant.\n6. Therefore the only thing that remains is'see around'. This means that the answer is E: see around.\nAnswer: E see around\n\nInput: Tiffany and Kanye West got married in 2014, they spent a lifetime looking for each other, where did they go? Choices:  B: Paris, France C: Chicago, USA D: Los Angeles, USA E: Rome, Italy\nRationales:\n1. The question asks us to find the answer based on the fact that Tiffany and K.West spent a lifetime looking for one another. \n2. By this definition, \"k.West's lifetime\" has to extend back to the early 90s, a time when neither of these artists were well-known or famous.\n3. Thus, this lifetime has to be K.West's earlier years, and by this logic we cannot assume that they went to Paris. \n4. We can easily eliminate \"paris\" as the answer since Paris is not a country that exists back then.\n5. Also, we can reasonably assume that the search spanned several parts of the globe and not just one country, so \"chicago\" can be eliminated too.\n6. Considering the above elimination, \"chicago\" is not an option.\n7. \"k.West' is a US-born rapper, so it's possible that the search went to places that he knows well.\n8. \"Los Angeles\" is located in the US and K.West is well-known to Los Angeles.\n9. So, the answer has to be either option D or option E.\n10. Option E says that they went to Rome, but it's not specific about when the search was happening. This puts Rome in a different lifetime, which would be a lifetime after the lifetime during which they spent looking for one another, which is inaccurate.\n11. Option D is the best answer because it provides a time-specific reference of 1996-1998, which is the time when K.West was looking. The lifetime described in the question doesn't have to span decades,", "answer": "E: toy store"}
{"text": "critically' suggests deeper thoughts and analysis, which may not be required in this scenario, as getting to the store may be as simple as walking in the direction that the store is in.\n5.

{"text": "critically' does not specify that the store being sought after is directly seen, so it is outside the scope of the question.\n5.

A: outside the library B: in the parking lot C: on the street D: with a bike E: on their bookshelf\nRationales: The question asks for the place where someone might go to get into a library. The options given include 1: Outside the library, 2: On the street, 3: With a bike, 4: In the parking lot and 5: On their bookshelf.

Choices:  What: A: don't know their name B: what if... C: be considerate D: what in the world E: what exactly\nRationales: Let's start by examining the options for 'what'.\n1. \"Don't know their name\" doesn't make sense as a person would not give a gift to a neighbor unless they knew their name.\n\n2. \"What if\" isn't a logical choice because a person wouldn't give a gift to a neighbour unless they knew their name, so this doesn't answer the question.\n\n3. \"Be considerate\" is not a relevant option as this is stating what a person should generally do when giving gifts and not specifically what they would do if they didn't know their neighbour's name.\n\n4. \"What in the world\" is a vague option that doesn't indicate how the person will act in this situation.\n\nTherefore, the remaining answer option is \"What exactly\".

{"text": "critically' - although thinking about all possible modes of approach may be necessary, it should be noted that thinking critically about the matter is not as likely as physically taking action to get to the store.\n5. 'Cross road' - a human is likely to cross a road if they are at a crossing in their path. However, the store should already be seen by then. Additionally, a human is more likely to turn around or make a U-turn rather than cross the road to get back in the direction of the store.\n6. Therefore, the answer must be A: cross road.

The footprints were the next thing? Choices:  H: seen B: known C: detected D: heard E: felt\nRationales: Considering the question's context, we can narrow down the options by eliminating plausible ones.\n2. A bear is not something that is well-known or heard, as there is no significant sound made by this animal.\n3. A bear is easily identifiable because it is large and black, but its footprints on the damp ground do not convey that information.\n5. Similarly, a bear is not known for detecting things.\n7. There is an absence of any sense that corresponds with the feeling of an environment.\n8. So 'heard' and 'felt' can be eliminated. \n9. 'D. heard' is irrelevant information according to the passage. It isn't useful to consider since there is more specific information in the passage, which is what is sought.\n10. 'H. seen' doesn't make sense as the bear's footprints were identifiable previously. \n11. The 'C. detected' option is less likely, since the next thing mentioned in the passage is footprints. It implies that the footprints had not already been seen on the ground when the bear's footsteps were heard during a storm. \n12. Therefore, the answer has to be 'B. known,' as it is the most appropriate answer based on context", "answer": "C: hedgerow"}

{"text": "critically' does not necessarily need to be carried out when a person is approaching a store.\n5. Option 'Cross road' is the most logical choice as it has the closest connection to this statement and the intended action, 'Getting to the store'.\n6. Also, crossing a road can be done unconsciously if the person is in a hurry. \n7. There's a high chance that the human can see a road across the store and they cross it to reach the store. \n8. And from a logistic perspective, only the act of crossing a road makes sense when the store is clearly visible. \n9. Hence, the answer is B,Cross road.\nAnswer: B,Cross road\n\nInput: I saw a ghost in my bedroom. How would I react if I saw a ghost and it was real? Choices:  a: get scared b: get excited c: get sleepy d: give up e: don't care\nRationales: \"I saw a ghost in the bedroom, but it was not real.\"\n1. The first statement here conveys that the person had seen a ghost, but it is not real.\n2. This means, if they had actually seen a real ghost, then they would be reacting accordingly, rather than \"getting sleepy\".\n3. If they had seen a real ghost then naturally, they may be scared or excited.\n4. Hence, the answer will be 'a' or 'b'.\n5. Both options give the same reaction of getting scared or excited, so the person will not react differently if they have actually seen a ghost. \n6. Although both the options convey a reaction to a real ghost that is scary, the wording difference makes it slightly unclear as to whether they would react \"to the ghost\" or \"from the ghost\".\n7. But if you consider 'to the ghost', then option 'a' seems more correct.\n8. Since the person will not act differently, we can rule out other options as well.\n9. So, the answer will be a.\n\nAnswer: a\n\nInput: What does Sparky have in common with Mushu? Choices: 1: They have a lot 2: Both Chinese 3: Neither a pet 4: Both are", "answer": "A: sail boats"}
{"text": "critically' is also irrelevant, as it does not pertain to the process of reaching the store.\n5. So, it is likely they would just 'cross the road'.\n6.

Choices: A: denim B: black C: a jacket D: a shirt E: purple\nRationales: The woman in the question is not in possession of a shirt, so she cannot be wearing a shirt. It is also impossible for her to be wearing a jacket, and purple is not a clothing color.\n7. However, there is a possibility that she could be wearing denim or black. \n8. Therefore, either denim or black should be her option.\n9. But it is impossible for her to wearing denim, and it is also impossible for her\nto be wearing black.\n10. This leaves that there is only a possibility that the woman in the pink\ntop was wearing only a shirt.\n11. It is also impossible that she is wearing black, and it is also\nimpossible that she is wearing denim.\n12. Therefore, the answer must be the\nonly possibility - she was wearing a shirt and pink top.\nAnswer: A, B: she was wearing a black top and a shirt.\n\n### Conclusion:\nA task is a set of instructions given to a person which they have to complete in some way. \nA task response must complete the task by providing the specified information that the task asks for.\nThe person giving the task must know how much information to provide, so it's important to read the whole task carefully to find the necessary information.\nIf the task is unclear or doesn't make sense, it's best to get help from someone, ask for clarification, or wait for a better explanation.\nAn instruction describes how to do something, and a demonstration provides an example of how to do it.", "answer": "E: eyes opening"}
{"text": "critically' and 'cross road' are possibilities, but may be misunderstood by some people as requiring more than is needed to get to a store.\n5. 'cross road' refers to a road with a lot of traffic and it can be quite difficult for some people to cross it safely.\n6. 'Think critiically' seems slightly inaccurate and has been replaced with'see around' for more simplicity.\n7. Therefore,'see around' is the correct answer.\nAnswer: B see around.\n\nInput: I went out for a walk earlier in the day today where might someone go for a walk early in the day? Choices: 1. A: evening 2. B: evening 3. C: morning 4. D: winter 5. E: rain\nRationales: Looking at the provided options; we need to find the correct time of the day that one can go for a walk. This is usually done in the morning or afternoon and so our options need to take this into account. Further, we need to find the type of weather conditions that are best suited for going for a walk. This means we should have options that are not too hot or wet since these are not ideal times or weather to go for a walk. \n\n* Option A. The correct answer is'morning'. The phrase \u2018earlier in the day\u2019 implies that we are going out for a walk before it becomes evening. This would be anytime between the early morning to mid-to-late morning so the answer is B.\n* Option C. The correct answer is \u2018morning\u2019 again because any time after mid-to-late afternoon through to early evening would be an evening. This means that we will need to select the earliest option for morning which is option A. \n* Option D. The correct option is none of the given choices because the phrase \u2018early in the day\u2019 does not mean winter. \u2018Winter\u2019 is a broad categorization that could include different months such as January and February whereas the phrase \u2018early\u2019 only implies certain days of the year such as November, December, January, and February respectively.\n* Option E. The correct answer is none of the given options because the phrase \u2018earlier in\u2019 or \u2018early\u2019 does not indicate bad weather. The weather could be fine for someone to go for a walk and so any of the given choices should be eliminated.", "answer": "C: bite"}
{"text": "critically' is used in many contexts including academic learning and business, which would not be applicable. \n5. Looking at the available options, the store in sight would be near or at that location and we can infer that the human would traverse the area to be at the front door.\n6. This can be expressed as option A: cross the road.\n7. Therefore, Option A: cross the road is the correct answer.\nAnswer: A. Cross the road.\n\nInput: What was he wearing? Choices:  (he wore) clothes A: pink shirt B: tie C: tie dye D: socks E: all of the above\nRationales: \"What was he wearing?\" suggests that he was still wearing something and we would be looking for something that was covering his body and would make it possible for him to move freely. Therefore, he cannot be wearing clothes that restrict movement, like a tight dress, and would need to be wearing items such as trousers or shorts.\nNow, all of the other options are incorrect as they're too specific to be correct.\nOption A: Pink shirt is too specific for this question which would suggest it was the only piece of clothing he wore.\nOption B: Tie makes no sense as a piece of clothing that he may wear outside of work, so not appropriate for this question.\nOption C: Tie dye is too specific as it involves the use of dye to obtain a tie-dyed effect and not a pre-existing tie item, which would also not be something he could wear outside of work clothing.\nOption D: Socks is too specific to be correct and not suitable for the question. \nOption E: All of the above is unnecessary information as it does not narrow down what was he wearing to one specific item that he could wear outside of his work clothing. \nTherefore, the only correct option is option E: He wore all of the above.\nThe answer is E: He wore all the above.\n\nInput: The dog bit me when I tried to pet it.

{"text": "critically' is an abstract process which could take any number of paths to lead one to the store.\n5. 'Cross road' would also cause a path which could lead a person to the store. \n6. So, the answer can be narrowed down to either A: cross road, or B: see around. \n7. However, it's more logical to assume that a human would actually proceed to the store instead of'seeing around,' so the answer is A: cross road.\nAnswer: A : cross road\n\n### Multiple choice questions", "answer": "D: own home"}
{"text": "critically' or 'think logically' means applying rational thinking skills to reach a conclusion or make practical decisions, so this doesn't make sense in the context of wanting to get somewhere. \n5.

Therefore, the correct option is B: \"see around.\"\nAnswer: B: \"see around\"\n\nInput: What is the most common form of currency which isn't a coin? Choices:  Money A: credit cards B: paper C: check D: currency notes E: checks\nRationales: Money A: credit card: This would not be called money, as it is a bankcard or means of payment.\nMoney B: paper: This would not be considered money, as it is not a type of currency and is not usually accepted outside of particular shops and venues.\nMoney C: check: This would be money, but the answer is not checking, which is a form of currency used to carry out financial transactions.\nInput: I cannot find the exact words in the book that I want, where would I go to see a librarian?

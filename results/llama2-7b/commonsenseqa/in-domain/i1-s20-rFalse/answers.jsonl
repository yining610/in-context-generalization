{"text": "C: keep alive\n### Description:\nThe input to an inference processor is usually a list of facts and the goal to be achieved, which is known as the query. From the query, one or more formulas (a statement containing terms and an operator) are derived to serve as the input to the inference engine. From this input, the inference engine determines whether the query or formula(s) is valid or not.\n\n### Expected Behavior:\nYou are required to write a Python program that uses a set of rules to infer what the given words are likely to refer to, e.g. If the word \u201cwash\u201d is seen then infer that it refers to dishes. If \u201ckitchen\u201d is seen take the guesses \u201capparatus\u201d and \u201cappliance\u201d. You can use the rules below:\n\n### Source:\nhttps://github.com/LuaSkyLab/nlp-introductory-course/blob/master/Project2.md\n\n### Difficulty:\nThis task is more suited for Python development skills. You will need to use rules to get the solution, and the rule can be easily changed to test more queries/facts.\n\n### Key points:\n- When an object or the thing is seen for the first time and used in a query it is considered as an \u2018unknown\u2019 and will be denoted as \u2018?\u2019 in the set of rules.\n- To learn more about how the inference engine works for text classification problems, visit the following sources for inspiration :\n  - https://github.com/kdnuggets/sentiment-analysis-reviews-python\n  - https://www.kaggle.com/kaushikgarg/datafuel-sentiment\n  - http://rec-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/sentiment-classification.pdf\n  - http://www.cs.duke.edu/~sarkar/teaching/cpsc313-09/readings/sentiment-classifications.pdf\n\n## How to start:\n- Download the dataset with the following link: https://files.kaggle.net/43/41/04e1e002227e3cc48d0702633610748f/tatoeba.zip", "answer": "B: lie down"}

What does the line \"This is what happens if we don't learn to adapt,\" indicate?? \n> B. What does the word \"disregard\" mean in this context? \n\nIn the year 1616 a man named John Thomas went to live on an island in the Pacific Ocean to find one thing and he did. The thing that he wanted was to find peace and quiet, it was the one thing he really wanted. \nSince John Thomas was the only person living on the island when he arrived he was very lonely. This made him do crazy things. He decided to build his own world. At first he tried to cut himself off from the rest of the island. He did not want anyone on the island to know about his world because someone could find it and destroy it. John Thomas cut down trees and built walls around himself and his world. John Thomas also built a little hut and planted some crops for food.\nJohn Thomas thought about making friends but it was too frightening. Then he found out that he had an enemy.\nWhile John Thomas was sleeping one evening a huge turtle crawled up on John Thomas's body. When John Thomas woke up he screamed. The turtle was still there. \n\"I'm going to cut you up into little pieces,\" he said. \nBut the turtle did nothing. It did not even make a sound. It just stared up at John Thomas with its little eyes. The turtle did not scare John Thomas. Instead, he laughed. \nSoon, everything was different. John Thomas was not lonely anymore and he was no longer scared. One night after the turtle had crawled away the turtle returned accompanied by some animals. The turtle crawled back onto John Thomas's body", "answer": "B: motel room"}

However, sometimes our mind and body fail to communicate with each other adequately. It's not very hard to forget eating or drinking something for a long period, either because we're distracted or because we think our hunger is more psychological than physical. Even more, sometimes we eat when we're full because we don't want others to see us eat or we don't want to waste food. Also, certain illnesses can make us tired even if we slept well. This quiz will help you identify which one of these moments is the last time you really felt hungry or tired. What's your answer?\n\n\nInput: I usually feel more hungry during this time of the day.

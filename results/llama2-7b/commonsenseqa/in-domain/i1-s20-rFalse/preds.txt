From the query, one or more formulas (a statement containing terms and an operator) are derived to serve as the input to the inference engine. From this input, the inference engine determines whether the query or formula(s) is valid or not.<n><n>### Expected Behavior:<n>You are required to write a Python program that uses a set of rules to infer what the given words are likely to refer to, e.g. If the word “wash” is seen then infer that it refers to dishes. If “kitchen” is seen take the guesses “apparatus” and “appliance”. You can use the rules below:<n><n>### Source:<n>https://github.com/LuaSkyLab/nlp-introductory-course/blob/master/Project2.md<n><n>### Difficulty:<n>This task is more suited for Python development skills. You will need to use rules to get the solution, and the rule can be easily changed to test more queries/facts.<n><n>### Key points:<n>- When an object or the thing is seen for the first time and used in a query it is considered as an ‘unknown’ and will be denoted as ‘?’ in the set of rules.<n>- To learn more about how the inference engine works for text classification problems, visit the following sources for inspiration :<n>  - https://github.com/kdnuggets/sentiment-analysis-reviews-python<n>  - https://www.kaggle.com/kaushikgarg/datafuel-sentiment<n>  - http://rec-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/sentiment-classification.pdf<n>  - http://www.cs.duke.edu/~sarkar/teaching/cpsc313-09/readings/sentiment-classifications.pdf<n><n>## How to start:<n>- Download the dataset with the following link: https://files.kaggle.net/43/41/04e1e002227e3cc48d0702633610748f/tatoeba.zip

John Thomas also built a little hut and planted some crops for food.<n>John Thomas thought about making friends but it was too frightening. Then he found out that he had an enemy.<n>While John Thomas was sleeping one evening a huge turtle crawled up on John Thomas's body. When John Thomas woke up he screamed. The turtle was still there. <n>"I'm going to cut you up into little pieces," he said. <n>But the turtle did nothing. It did not even make a sound.

However, sometimes our mind and body fail to communicate with each other adequately. It's not very hard to forget eating or drinking something for a long period, either because we're distracted or because we think our hunger is more psychological than physical. Even more, sometimes we eat when we're full because we don't want others to see us eat or we don't want to waste food. Also, certain illnesses can make us tired even if we slept well. This quiz will help you identify which one of these moments is the last time you really felt hungry or tired. What's your answer?<n><n><n>Input: I usually feel more hungry during this time of the day. Choices:  - 6 AM - 12 PM  - 1 PM - 5 PM  - 6 PM - 11 PM  - 12 AM - 6 AM<n>Output:  - 1 PM  - 5 PM  Output: - 6 AM

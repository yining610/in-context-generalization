They were also, of course, uninterested in science because that was a product of the humanist ideas of the Renaissance and Reformation. In the Middle Ages, they had to be interested in science in order to do any of the following: <n><n>- 1.  Create<n>- 2.  Find cures<n>- 3.  Discover new lands<n>- 4.  Improve medicine, agriculture, and farming<n>- 5.  Enforce sanitation and public health<n><n>All these things were important, but in a world where most people still wrote at a fifth-or sixth-grade level or better, written science was of little value. Scientific study and experiment, then, were a luxury available to the few who were literate. The great majority of people had to rely on myth and tradition for understanding how the world worked. <n><n>### Demostration<n>German scientist Michael Faraday was best known for his studies of electrochemistry and magnetic fields. However, he is also notable for how he lived his life. That is, he lived with his brother, his mother, and three maidservants. He and his older brother were born out of wedlock to a poor English mother and French father. Their father became a famous scientist when he married Faraday’s mother; however, the family lived in poverty. The brothers had jobs early on, and Michael eventually found employment in a laboratory setting. As an adult, Michael supported his mother, his brother, and three maid servants.  <n><n>### Demosration<n><n><n>### Instructions<n>In the 1600s, Johannes Kepler made a number of studies on astronomy. He proposed that all of the planets traveled in elliptical circles rather than concentric circles. Prior to his explanation of planetary motion, the accepted explanation of planetary motion was that the planets traveleled in circular orbits. Kepler also wrote a book that explained the nature of light. Today, his works in astronomy would be considered mundane and not noteworthy. However, in 1618, his work was a significant discovery because the Catholic church was persecuting and killing

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>### Input:A blowfish lives free. He lives on his own. Where does he live? Choices:  A: fish market B: pet shop C: great outdoors D: river E: little mermaid<n><n>### Response:		The blowfish is an animal with bone, and not a fish. He doesn’t live in a fish market, because a fish market doesn’t sell animals with bones, only fish. A pet shop doesn’t sell animals that are free-living, but that usually live alone. A blowfish is an aquatic animal, and a river is a body of water, so blowfish aren’t found in the river. The little mermaid isn’t real, and a mermaid is a mythical being, so a blowfish doesn’t live near her. The great outdoors has the connotation of being free, which is the opposite of a blowfish.<n>

Choices:  A: bathe B: bite C: die of cancer D: obesity E: copulate<n><n>### Response:		John is studying the animals of the rainforest. The animal he is observing is the tapir. The tapir is a large (155-220 pounds) omnivorous (it feeds on things other animals eat like plants and animals, but also sometimes likes to eat human garbage) mammal known for rolling downhill. Tapirs do something called chewing the cud. That is, they rechew part of their food. Most of the things they eat are things they have to chew, like acacia trees and grasses. Tapirs usually roll down the hill onto their back. This is called back rolling. Then they roll back up the hill onto their four feet. Tapirs have 2 to 4 calves every 2-3 years. Tapirs will only stay in their parent’s enclosure if they are not feeling sick. They can stay with their mother for up to two years. When the tapir is ready to reproduce they are about 6 years old (give or take a year or two).<n><n>### Notes:<n>* You cannot copy and paste information from documents/sources.<n>* Include relevant headers and subheaders to breakdown your work.<n><n>### Output:

A: their outer shapes<n>2. B: their inside compositions<n>3. C: their sizes<n>4. D: their numbers of chromosomes<n>5. E: the colors that appear under a microscope<n>Anwer:D<n><n>### Response<n><n>While it is possible to distinguish white blood cells from red blood cells when viewing them through a microscope, the best way to make the differentiation is by using laboratory tests as the body and lifestyle conditions determine the quantity and nature of the two types of blood cells in every person. White cells are present in large numbers among the circulatory plasma in the body, as they have a number of vital roles in fighting infection. Red cells, on the other hand, are a significant part, but not the only, part of the body’s circulatory plasma. They are responsible for ferrying oxygen from the lungs to different parts of the body. White blood cells and red blood cells are each made of plasma, which is a mix of water and protein. Red blood cells are smaller, round, and don’t have any intercellular organelles. That is to say, there are no nuclear membranes that bind together their chromosomes. On the other hand, when you examine white blood cells they are flat ovals with multiple nuclei and many small vacuoles that have nucleolus

Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>### Input:Why might someone want to be buying beer? Choices:  A: get arrested B: problems C: sober D: intoxication E: pleasure<n><n>### Response:		<n>The answer for the following would probably be A: get arrested or D: intoxication. I don't think that a wash dish or a implement machine would be used for the word "intoxication". The word "intoxication" means the state of being or feeling drunk or lightheaded as a result of using a drug or alcohol. If you said a wash dish was for intoxication I think someone might answer it is a dish that would be used to serve a lightheaded person because it is not a wash dish.<n>In conclusion the answer for the question would most likely be B appear.<n><n>### Discussion:I don't understand how this question is relevant?

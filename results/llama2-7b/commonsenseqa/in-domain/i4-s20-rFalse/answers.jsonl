{"text": "B: dinning room\n\nInput:The house required some repair, where will most likely happen? Choices: \tA: laundry room B: living room C: basement D: bedroom E : back yard\nOutput: A: laundry room -> Laundry is in the house too\n\n### Explanation:\n\nA box cannot be placed underground. All of the answers are in the house. It takes a few sentences to determine which room. \nAn implement can be found in the kitchen, where laundry is usually found. \nThe car requires petrol/gasoline, which is found in a car. If there is a gas station, there must be cars near by, or the gas station isn't necessary. \nA dinning room usually is found in a house. In apartment/apartments, there is usually a kitchen and bedroom, but no dinning room (unless it is a dining suite, which would work). \nI am not quite sure about the castle/palace/monarchy example, but I think the main takeaway is that all of the answers are in a house, so laundry would have to be in the house. \nIt doesn't sound like a room used for meetings is in a palace or castle.\n\n*Note: When in doubt, think about what you would say to a child. Is what you are saying about something you find in your house? Are all of the possibilities the same? Try to find the one way to explain the words and use the answer that makes the least amount of assumptions.", "answer": "C: throne room"}

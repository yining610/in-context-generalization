### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Output: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol?

Choices:  A: court B: dinning room C: throne room D: monarchy E: castle<n>Output:		B: dinning room<n><n>Input:The house required some repair, where will most likely happen? Choices: 	A: laundry room B: living room C: basement D: bedroom E : back yard<n>Output: A: laundry room -> Laundry is in the house too<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>A box cannot be placed underground. All of the answers are in the house. It takes a few sentences to determine which room. <n>An implement can be found in the kitchen, where laundry is usually found. <n>The car requires petrol/gasoline, which is found in a car. If there is a gas station, there must be cars near by, or the gas station isn't necessary. <n>A dinning room usually is found in a house. In apartment/apartments, there is usually a kitchen and bedroom, but no dinning room (unless it is a dining suite, which would work). <n>I am not quite sure about the castle/palace/monarchy example, but I think the main takeaway is that all of the answers are in a house, so laundry would have to be in the house. <n>It doesn't sound like a room used for meetings is in a palace or castle.<n><n>*Note: When in doubt, think about what you would say to a child. Is what you are saying about something you find in your house? Are all of the possibilities the same? Try to find the one way to explain the words and use the answer that makes the least amount of assumptions.

It is interesting that most of the answers are of the form A: blank B: thing and C: blank D: blank E: blank. As far as I understand English that is generally how adjectives are listed: A: tall B: a boy C: a good D: a bad E: a dog. I wonder if the list is based on linguistics and does not include synonyms that the question writer feels are incorrect.<n><n>2. It was pretty intuitive to know that in 4 of the 5 questions (except the last question) the answer has to be the fourth option. For instance, if it was a book which pet would be injured then you couldn't really call it a book because it would be injured itself by the pet.<n><n>3. The grammar in these questions is funny. We write "would be burn-in" and "did burn". Perhaps this is a style thing but it feels very informal.<n>

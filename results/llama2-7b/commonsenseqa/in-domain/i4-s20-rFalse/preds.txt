Choices:  A: drill B: learn C: require obedience D: understand E: spoon<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>D. A spoon<n><n>A master carpenter is a carpenter that has an advanced skill for the work that the individual can use for the work he has to do. That advanced skill can only be obtained in a formal manner and not only from the experience that one can be having to be working with carpentry work. They can learn the art of carpentry by attending a carpentry workshop in order to learn some fundamental skills in carpentry.<n><n>However, the skills need to be gained on a daily basis as this will be a way of honing that gained skill since carpentry is something that needs to be practiced so that one can obtain an expertise on the same. It is a skill that is gotten with one having to attend a formal carpentry workshop but at the same time having the expertise one will need to learn the tricks of the trade when it comes to gaining expertise with carpentry. <n><n>Therefore, learning from master carpenters who have perfected their skills with carpentry work will give them an ability to put holes in objects. A master carpenter can use a spoon to get the perfect results when doing carpentry work.<n><n><n>### Instructors Remediation<n><n>It is very clear that the student has grasped the concept of master carpenters and this can be seen with the answer which is D.  However, the student had mistaken it and thought that a spoon is a drill. However, the question had spelt it clear that it was about using a spoon in order to get holes but instead the student has taken it to mean a drill.<n><n><n>

This cheerfulness turned off people who expected the funeral to be what? Choices:  A: solemn B: compete C: serious D: somber E: straightforward<n><n>### Response:		<n>Shane should not behave such a way at the funeral. It is respectful to dress properly. There must be an appropriate time and place for jokes.  At funerals people are sad.  They need solemn or compelling speeches to be uplifted so as to end the funeral on a positive note.  The cheerfulness and jokes is uncalled for because it shows an ignorance of the solemn nature of the funeral itself and in some cases people may think the person is out of his or her mind if such actions are done.  Shane should have given a speech that speaks to the memory of the dear departed, that tells stories of how one felt towards the dear departed.<n><n>There is a proper time and place for everything. One can still laugh at their funerals if it was something humorous in life.<n><n>### Reflection:<n><n><n><n><n>### Extension:<n><n>1) <n>In the question above how are you to distinguish between your responses that describe the task and those that show you understand when you wrote them?

The program requires user input of a single integer number for an input, which the program then compares to the maximum value on a number line, 11. If the value is greater than 11, the user is instructed to enter a number one less. Otherwise, the computer will provide a number output in the form y = x, where x is the input. The example below begins this section.<n><n><img src="img/11task1.png"><n><n>### Deminstration:<n>The program begins by providing an option on screen with two choices: "Hit me!" or "You're already dead!" The user would hit'space' to enter the integer number for the input. Then the computer will ask if the user is sure that they have chosen 'hit me!' The user would hit 'h' to indicate an affirmation. When the user is sure they have made the correct choice, they would enter in a number input as directed. The program will then verify whether or not this choice was a good one, and prompt the user with either "Good choice!" or "That was my weak spot!".<n><n>From here, if they enter another 'h' to indicate one is not ready to die, the prompt and options will be repeated. Once the user decides they will take the punishment, the program will present a mathematical equation of the form "y = x", indicating the input.<n><n>### Input/Output Task 1:<n>The user input is an integer number. As long as the user enters a number that does not exceed 11, the program should be executed as desired and output the correct formula to the user. This example is the correct input, but would also work with any nonnegative number under 11 where the difference between x and y is one.<n>![img0](input/input1.png)<n>

Although the television is plugged into electricity, it doesn't mean it's being kept in a box, especially for the night. Television is used by everyone, why do they need a cabinet for it.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol?

Choices:  A: university B: book C: field D: meeting E: class<n>Answer: A: university<n><n>### Input:Which entrance would you use if you do not want to use the back entrance? Choices:  A: side B: main C: anterior D: current E: front<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The entrance I would use to avoid the back entrance if I am unable to use the front entrance and want to go in the other direction of the front entrance is the side entrance. <n><n>### Demo:<n><n>In the given context, a side entrance is one that is on the opposite side of the building from the front entrance, that is, the left or right side of a building depending on how you are facing it, while a main entrance is the primary entrance of a building, one that is at the front of the building facing the street or the main road.<n><n>Anterior means that you are on the sides of a building when you are facing to or from the front entrance of the building. Likewise, the current entry or current entrance is on the sides of the building when you are facing the current entrance, and the same applies to the front entrance.<n><n>I am able to get the correct answer for the choice of A, side, because I would use the left entrance if I am coming from the right side of the street, and I would use the right entrance if I am coming the opposite way. That is, coming from the left side of the street, I would go the other direction of the left so I would use the right side entrance, and since I know I would use the right to continue in the direction that I am already moving that means I‚Äôd head down to the side opposite of the front door, and so I would have to go to the left so I could get towards the right that would be the entrance on the left because that is the side that I am at.<n><n>However, if I am coming towards the back entrance on the right side of the building and want to continue but am unable to use the back entrance and must use one of the other entrances I would head towards the entrances on the right so if I were coming from the back entrance I would instead head towards the other entrances which is on the right so I would get towards the entrance on the right and when I get there I can get towards the front entrance to the building instead of to the back entrance.<n><n>### Questions:<n><n>[](http://www.testtaker.com "http://www.tester.com") [ ](http://www.online.testing.com/testing/tester/testing/testing.html)

Choices:  A: you B: abbreviation C: solitude D: loneliness E: alone<n><n>### Response:		E: alone<n><n>## Explanation<n>Let's break down this problem.  A question is asked of us by who ever "Gave the Task".  Their answer choices will be "Abbreviation" and "You" or "A: You" which is an incorrect way to make an answer choice because the word "you" is not being used as a noun, but an object that needs to be replaced.  We are looking to replace the "Abbreviation" with "Another" in either a position or answer choice.  The correct answer would be "A: Another"  I didn't see "Another" anywhere so I assumed that the task was for "You" to be the answer, but a task can come in any form that can be given, which is what is important to understand.  We can take this back to the first rule: When there aren't enough choices, choose the shortest answer.  In this case, the shortest answer was "Another", which would be the answer choice if the choices weren't all abbreviations.  Again, this is why it is important to always read and understand both the question and the choices.<n>

Choices:  A: burned B: polished C: carved D: composted E: nailed<n><n>### Response:		<n>When would you be able see your reflection in a carved piece of wood? \u00ad<n><n>### Explanation:<n>This sentence is a conditional statement. When would you be able see, we should have a verb, see, to make it work. Then what? would have a noun see which is where? It is a subjective sentence, so the subject would be the person who will look in the piece of wood. It could either be a man, woman, teenager or even a child. The verb able could be taken literally. In the statement, when would you be able is ambiguous because the statement says when and not how. In the sentence, if the verb able is taken metaphorically, it would mean to be able to see a reflection. The conditional, when would, becomes something that would only happen at a given time while able is the adverb that makes the verb would change the meaning of reflect to see.<n><n>### Input : What is the difference between a carpet, a rug, and a tapestry?<n><n>### Response : \u00bad<n><n>### Explantion :<n>This sentence is a question that can be answered with a multiple choice question.

A carpet is the floor covering that is used in a room, a rug usually covers a table or is placed on the floor and it can be used to cover a hole in the floor, the tapestry is a hanging fabric that is placed on the walls to give a room a certain color or look. The question is a little bit ambiguous to me, it is easy to mix up a word in the question. In the response, I have answered the question using each choice one by one since they all are valid answers.<n><n>### INPUT: Where did the dog sit?<n><n>### RSPONSE:<n>Where did the dog sit? sit is a verb so it should be in singular but was written in plural because it should not be a group of dogs that were sitting.

Choices:  A: fairy tale B: castle C: middle ages D: chess board E: doll house<n><n>### Response:		<n>The answer to the first question was ‚ÄúB: apparatus‚Äù. This is because the word ‚Äòcomplex appliance‚Äô was the question. The machine was indeed complex. It was not an appliance; it was apparatus because apparatus implies complication. The second question was ‚ÄòWhere did you get petrol?‚Äô. The answer was ‚ÄòE: gas station‚Äô. This is because gas station is a more proper noun for where petrol is sold. The third question was ‚ÄòWhere did the television used at night be in your house?‚Äô. The answer to this question was ‚ÄòD: bedroom‚Äô. This is because the television used in your house at night is definitely in your bedroom. The fourth question was ‚ÄòWhere was the knowledge being gained?‚Äô. The answer is A: university. This is because knowledge was being gained through studying. Finally the last question was ‚ÄòWhere is small knight is likely to be found‚Äô. This was an easy one with the answer being B: castle. This choice is obvious because of the title of the knight.<n><n>

A: burn hot<n>2. B: fuel tank<n>3. C: burn hot<n>4. D: car<n>5. E: gas station<n>```<n><n>### Instructions:Select the right choice to complete the sentences.<n><n>### Explanation:The first thing you notice about this question is that it is a short response. There are five sentences, so you have a lot of information to read and consider. The first sentence is quite specific: we are told that the information was expensive. This is an indication that something unique is happening in the answer and, if you read to the end of this sentence, you'll find out.<n><n>### The key to this question is in the penultimate word of sentence 3. You should also consider what the preceding sentence says: 'Where might a television used at Night be?' and look for the phrase 'been used'. This information helps us to make a key connection between the first four statements and the final sentence. <n><n>### Consider the first four statements carefully. You are told what the answer is and, in doing so, you can deduce one piece of information that we needed earlier. Each statement gives us a clue to find the missing word. Let's look each statement individually:<n><n>### Input 1: We are told that the machine was very intricate - intricate means complicated. This was no simple box.<n><n>### Input2: The machine was quite an apparatus. Apparatus has a technical connotation and so this wasn't an everyday box.<n><n>## #3: Now there's a really important clue. The machine was a *implement*. Think hard about where an implement was more likely to be seen - in a home or in the woods. And, finally:<n>## #4: We know where we are now. The machine was indeed *a complex system *. We can draw a line from the end of sentence 4 and the final statement.<n><n>### So, sentence 5 might begin in a way that suggests a machine was confiscated for illegal activity. The phrase, 'Go Free', suggests just that. Confessing to something you've done wrong is the only way a *murderer could be let free

Choices:  A: school B: home office C: people store D: print shop E: newspaper office<n><n>### Response:		<n>Between 1919 and 1976, a gas tax was imposed on fuel in North America. After its introduction in Canada, the Canadian government began to promote natural gas for use in the provinces because it was cheaper than gasoline and a lot cleaner. Natural gas is a byproduct of the oil industry and is very clean for fuel.<n><n>The tax incentive made a huge difference. People were much more willing to use a more expensive fuel in the 1970s compared to the present-day with the $1.30 per litre price tag in gasoline, as the cost of the fuel is so high. The same fuel will cost $1.00 per litre, which is 50 per cent less than gasoline. There are over 1,150,000 homes in Ontario alone that use natural gas as their primary energy source, and this number continues to grow.<n><n>Fuel pump stations are more prevalent in Ontario than anywhere else in Canada. They are found in places like shopping centres and along major roads with lots of traffic.<n><n>The gas station is the best place to buy gasoline because they sell all sorts of petroleum products. This includes diesel fuel, gasoline, propane, heating oil, and all varieties of liquids including kerosene, transmission fluid, and antifreeze. Butchers sell meat, and doctors can sell us our health, so a gas station is just that: an all-access place to buy fuel in multiple formats.<n><n>Some people feel the price is too high, while others say it's too cheap and it's bad for the environment. However most people in Ontario would say there's nothing better than the service, which can be quick and reliable almost every time. But people still go to the muffler shop, the bargain bin or even a dealership like Cadillac in Ottawa when their gas gauge reads 'E.'<n><n>The most important issue is that it should be very affordable. The reason the price of gas is so high is because supply and demand. As the fuel is in high demand and gas stations have to pay for it and pass on the costs, the consumer ends up paying much more for the same price as the other country.<n><n>Gas tax was introduced in Canada in 1921. It was introduced

Choices:  A: happen to people B: hurt people C: happen anytime D: happen often E: happen anywhere<n><n>### Response:		<n>E: happen anywhere<n><n>#### Explanation<n><n>The task is asking you to determine what kind of accident the subject is talking about. The subject is a lady that says she's getting "worked up about the article explaining... the upticks in accidents". She is angry that there are more accidents by people.<n><n>The subject's husband is trying to comfort the woman. He is trying to tell her that accidents happen to everyone, not just people in that community. The wife is angry and won't listen to her husband, so he changes his statement.<n><n>The subject wants to know if her husband still considers accidents to happen to just anyone. Is that the way of it now? If she's angry, she doesn't want to consider all kinds of accidents happening everywhere to everyone. Accidents are happening everywhere, so everyone will be fine, right?<n><n>The husband is now saying accidents happen everywhere, so his wife is probably not going to like that answer. Her husband doesn't want to get into an argument with his wife about it, so he just says everyone has accidents.<n><n>Accidents happen everywhere, so everyone has accidents, so why is she angry?<n><n>Accidents happen to everyone.<n><n>#### Notes:<n><n>-	For some questions, this questioning is done multiple times. You only need to do it the first two or three times they do it. The subject keeps saying the same things. They seem to become comfortable with it, and they don't mind talking about the same subject over and over.

Choices:  A: guide children B: understand children C: control children D: care for children E: vent anger<n><n>### Response:		<n>There are times when parents have to yell at their children but there is a difference between just yelling, which is unnecessary, and speaking in a way that helps children improve. If a parent is yelling at their children it is only for the purpose of the parent trying to regain control. Instead parents should use their voices in a way that lets their children know that their concerns were heard. When yelling, children do not have the ability to listen because they are always looking to defend themselves. If parents only yell at their children without caring about the child‚Äôs opinion they are using yelling in a bad way and doing themselves a disservice, especially in the eyes of their children. Parents that yell at there children usually show to their children that they do not care about the children and the children begin to feel inferior. A better way for parents to act would be to speak to their children with a strong tone but with the idea of trying to create a meaningful conversation because they know that their voices are being heard. Yelling has multiple negative affects to it and the only good that comes from it is that control can be received from a person.

Choices:  A: show B: theatre C: hockey game D: movies E: event<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The game of hockey is the loudest sport for the audience at because there are many different people talking at a time, and cheering at the same time. However, the audience is not as loud for the other sports because not much talking, or cheering goes on. Most of the cheering goes on when the other team makes a bad play or gets called for a penalty etc.<n><n><n>### Input14: Which of these games needs the least equipment for a team to be successful? Choices: 14A: soccer 14b: golf 14c: tennis 14d: marathon 14e: darts<n><n>Response14: Tennis needs the least equipment for the team to be successful, because there is no ball, or goalposts needed, because you could play it inside the house as well. But you need a racket, and you could get an unlimited amount of rackets. However, if I were to choose a sport that needed more equipment, I would choose marathon, because marathons need a lot of shoes, sneakers. It might take time to find the right shoes or sneakers and the right brand. Shoes are important because you want to make sure you have shoes that are comfortable for your feet, and have arch support for your feet so you don't hurt your feet, and run on forever. Also, it takes time to make sure that you have the correct amount of shoes and socks to complete a marathon. It seems like the marathon would be the hardest to play, because of all the equipment that is needed.<n><n>### Input 15: Choice: 15A: soccer 4: hockey 15c: tennis 15d: darts<n><n>**Response15:** Soccer needs an outdoors field to play, and requires that you bring goals with you, because you need a ball to play it, and you can't throw a soccer ball in the air, you have to bounce it off the ground and kick it up to continue to play it. Most of the equipment that you need has to do with soccer. But, hockey needs hockey sticks, and you have to bring goals around with you to play hockey. So I think soccer and hockey are almost the same, since you have to bring a ball and goals to play them. Tennis needs a

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what? Choices:  A: box B: apparatus C: appliance D: wash dishes E: implement<n>Answer: B: apparatus<n><n>Input: Where do you get petrol?

Choices:  A: complete sentence B: feel angry C: drink tea D: cross street E: park<n><n>### Response:		In this task there were five different choices of answers. What would happen to a person is stolen (or complete sentence, in my answer) would also apply as something that might happen if the person's money is stolen. This is because he or she is making an assumption that the person is still holding onto the money. This is the only correct answer.<n><n>### Feedback: The person made an assumption.<n><n>### Input and Output Data Example:<n>For the below instruction input, in the response the person did not make any assumptions and they didn't include any additional information.<n><n>### Example Input:<n>Tell if someone is doing good or bad.<n><n>### Response<n>The person asked, what happened to the person? The only assumption the person is making is that the person is happy or unhappy.<n><n>#### Example 2:<n><n>### Input<n>Explain the following statement.<n><n>### Output<n>When the person said, "you mean what did he do?" the response was "not specifically what he did". The response was correct because the person didn't assume and they didn't add any additional information. The response also had clear and precise words when it needs to. The response provided a simple explanation as to why the statement didn't make sense. It did not talk directly about the person, but instead about what they said in the statement.<n><n>#### Example Input<n><n>### What were we doing right when we did something wrong?<n><n>### Response <n>When the person said "I'm not sure about that", this could possibly show that the person may need a little more clarification of the question instead of just answering. The person could have clarified the question by saying, "what do you mean by what were we doing right when you did something wrong?" because they asked a question in the response. However, the person didn't say what their assumptions were about what happened to the person when they did something wrong. So, the response was a good response, but they could have respond better by including their assumptions.<n><n>#### Example Response:<n>When the person heard the statement, "You mean what did he do", they could have responded by saying, "I didn't see him get into the school, I don't know what happened". This can help the person who asked the question to know why the person didn't know what happened to the person.<n>

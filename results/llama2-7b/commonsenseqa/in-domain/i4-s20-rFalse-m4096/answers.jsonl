Choices:  a: carpenter' anvil b: fertiliser c: a greenhouse d: a watering can e: a spade\nOutput: d: a wateringcan\n\n# Example 90: Answers\n\n```\n34. A. The answer choices for this question were very confusing, and I feel like it wasn't clear what was being asked at first. However, the answer for me came down to B. As I thought about it logically, I came to the realization that the wording \"an intricate box\" just wasn't possible, and therefore made the choice of A and D invalid. The way that I found out about this is because A doesn't make logical sense, and I feel like B is the most appropriate option because the machine is an apparatus, which implies it's complex in construction, which relates to the question. \n41. A. After reading through the answers B through E, I concluded that the only one with logic to it was A. I realized that D only really makes sense if the television station is a physical location, so I crossed that option out. B also didn't make sense because the book would probably be a book. C is used for computers and D is used for video games, and E also makes no sense. So the only one that I thought about from start to finish was A, because a game can be played at night. \n43. A. After rereading the question to understand what was being asked, I concluded that A is the only answer. As you read through the answer choices, B and D don't make sense because of the words \"a building\" that is in each, and C and E do not make sense because the word \"number\" would not go with that subject. Now, the only one that makes sense, I think, is A, because there can only be one floor in a residential building. \n48. A. The only one that made logical sense was A. The words \"greenhouse\" and \"watering can\" suggest gardening to me, and I don't think that there's a good way to combine that two, so I crossed out D and E. As I narrowed down the answer, I realized that C isn't a good answer, because although the combination", "answer": "C: garage"}

Choices:  a) hat b) scarf c) coat d) belt E) shirt\nOutput: A: hat\n\n### Partial Solution\nThe only question that I feel is doable is the first one - the rest of it seems to be asking a lot of work and I've not found a general solution to get all correct yet. (Also maybe not the easiest to do for a first question.)\n\nI know that the second one should be one of (at least): B, D, E, based on the context of \"doing something outside\", as well as the structure of the prompt wording. In this case it's all about context... I'm not yet able to parse the sentences.\n\nThe third question is just asking us more about context: A is the obvious, incorrect answer for the first two, so B must be \"in the house\" or similar. The fourth question has a lot of words that seem to be synonyms so I'm having a hard time pinning that one down.\n\nThe fifth question is just about the context words again: is it one of \"getting smarter\", \"working hard\", or \"wasting time\"? Is it an academic, intellectual topic, or simply a hobby (a sport, a puzzle, a game)?\n\nAnd the sixth question - I feel it's all about time. I'm not quite sure how to parse it yet, and also don't quite know how to phrase it as a question. A clue to this one would be that there are a few \"being bored\" questions, and we do want to filter for that.\n\n```python\n# Multiple choice question, so we need to parse the sentences and select one answer.\n\ndef find_sentences(sentences):\n    # TODO: Parse all the input sentences to find which one is the correct one for\n    #       the question \"Where do you get petrol?\"\n    #       Then, return the index (0-based) of the sentence!\n    #         (e.g. return 0 if the best answer is A, or 2 for C\n\n    # Example sentences (there are a", "answer": "B: gaining knowledge"}

One time in grade eight, he was bullied by his own teacher and a group of students. He had felt like he would snap, but instead he had fought back. He fought with the students and the teacher. He was asked to leave the class. He had went home and slept for a while. When he woke up again there was a huge group of people at the front door. He thought his parents needed something and he got up to open the door. He tried the knob at first thinking his parents were outside waiting for him. When he realized it wasn\u2019t his parents he had walked outside and seen a huge amount of reporters. He had asked the reporters what had happened. One had said that a huge storm had hit the city, and that the damage was more than they expected. They decided to use this opportunity to put a news story out about what had happened to the boy that got in trouble with his teacher. His parents didn\u2019t take it well.

Since there are only so many options for items that people might use, we'll just put a random list and check for a match. First 9 questions are pretty straight forwards. First test case is \"What is a washing machine called?\", A: box, B: apparatus, C: appliance, D: wash dish, E: implement. \nAfter this is done, we will start doing some tricky thingies like input: \"What are you hoping to achieve when listening to an expert?\". This will give the user a new option where they are just given 10 options and one is a correct one and they should pick the correct one. \nLastly, input: \"Where might a television used at?\" will give the user a list of choices and will ask them to pick the correct one. So, after 9 easy test cases the last 3 get more tricky. All answer choices are different, one is a real answer and the other one is a hard one. To pass this test we will give 3 options every time and the last one is the correct one.\n\n\n```\nEnter your answer:\nHow do you do 5-4 minus 2?\nYou could:\n[0, 00] or 5,3\n[100, 500] or 2\n[101, 010] or -2\n[0, 20] or 0\n[0, 120] or 162\nPress [1] if [5,3] is correct.\n[1]\nYour answer: 5\nWhat is a washing appliance called?\n[0, 5] or a box\n[2, 0] or an apparatus\n[10", "answer": "A: learning"}

{"idx": 316, "text": "B: laboratory\n\n###### Submission\n![Alt text](/lab7_submit.png)\n\n### Discuion - \n**a)** You can use `map` with an element type that does allow `toString` calls. However, this may not be possible without using `toNumber` or `toArray`. The point is, **in order for `map` to work on these values, we must convert them to strings, not numbers.**\n\nYou can see that the code works if you create an `array` (or `list`) and call `map` on that instead. So basically, \"list\" was simply not a good data type for `map` to map through.\n\n**b)** I believe we are getting the answer that we are trying to predict since we are using the `return` keyword on the last line. This may seem odd at first but consider that we can use the value that was returned from `map` on this line in the next line. \n\n\n### Explanation - \n\n### Trivia 1:\n`Array` is an unsorted collection, or list, of objects of the same type. It provides a generic method called `map`(it can take any parameter type as well), and the map method will map each element in the array and create a new array with the mapped values.\n\n```\nmap = new Function('arr','return arr.apply(null, function(x)');\n```\n\nWe can see that `map` returns a function which will expect an array as an `params` parameter but will be called for each element of the array which means that mapping will occur.\n\nSo here we have an array of objects where each object has a field called `element` and a field called `location`, where each object is a function that does something to another element. And we used the `map` method to call another method and convert the location value back into a number.\n\nBut it won't work since `Location = Number` and we are trying to call `parseInt` on it and we can't do that unless we convert it to a number first. That is why we use `map`.\n\n**Triva B:** the reason for the function declaration is because we are expecting a function as a parameter. I did not like the method provided by `map` because it is", "answer": "C: baseball stadium"}

The answer choices for this question were very confusing, and I feel like it wasn't clear what was being asked at first. However, the answer for me came down to B. As I thought about it logically, I came to the realization that the wording "an intricate box" just wasn't possible, and therefore made the choice of A and D invalid. The way that I found out about this is because A doesn't make logical sense, and I feel like B is the most appropriate option because the machine is an apparatus, which implies it's complex in construction, which relates to the question. <n>41. A. After reading through the answers B through E, I concluded that the only one with logic to it was A. I realized that D only really makes sense if the television station is a physical location, so I crossed that option out. B also didn't make sense because the book would probably be a book.

After rereading the question to understand what was being asked, I concluded that A is the only answer. As you read through the answer choices, B and D don't make sense because of the words "a building" that is in each, and C and E do not make sense because the word "number" would not go with that subject. Now, the only one that makes sense, I think, is A, because there can only be one floor in a residential building. <n>48. A. The only one that made logical sense was A. The words "greenhouse" and "watering can" suggest gardening to me, and I don't think that there's a good way to combine that two, so I crossed out D and E. As I narrowed down the answer, I realized that C isn't a good answer, because although the combination

(Also maybe not the easiest to do for a first question.)<n><n>I know that the second one should be one of (at least): B, D, E, based on the context of "doing something outside", as well as the structure of the prompt wording. In this case it's all about context... I'm not yet able to parse the sentences.<n><n>The third question is just asking us more about context: A is the obvious, incorrect answer for the first two, so B must be "in the house" or similar. The fourth question has a lot of words that seem to be synonyms so I'm having a hard time pinning that one down.<n><n>The fifth question is just about the context words again: is it one of "getting smarter", "working hard", or "wasting time"? Is it an academic, intellectual topic, or simply a hobby (a sport, a puzzle, a game)?<n><n>And the sixth question - I feel it's all about time. I'm not quite sure how to parse it yet, and also don't quite know how to phrase it as a question. A clue to this one would be that there are a few "being bored" questions, and we do want to filter for that.<n><n>```python<n># Multiple choice question, so we need to parse the sentences and select one answer.<n><n>def find_sentences(sentences):<n>    # TODO: Parse all the input sentences to find which one is the correct one for<n>    #       the question "Where do you get petrol?"<n>    #       Then, return the index (0-based) of the sentence!<n>    #         (e.g. return 0 if the best answer is A, or 2 for C<n><n>    # Example sentences (there are a

Since there are only so many options for items that people might use, we'll just put a random list and check for a match. First 9 questions are pretty straight forwards. First test case is "What is a washing machine called?", A: box, B: apparatus, C: appliance, D: wash dish, E: implement. <n>After this is done, we will start doing some tricky thingies like input: "What are you hoping to achieve when listening to an expert?". This will give the user a new option where they are just given 10 options and one is a correct one and they should pick the correct one. <n>Lastly, input: "Where might a television used at?" will give the user a list of choices and will ask them to pick the correct one. So, after 9 easy test cases the last 3 get more tricky. All answer choices are different, one is a real answer and the other one is a hard one. To pass this test we will give 3 options every time and the last one is the correct one.<n><n><n>```<n>Enter your answer:<n>How do you do 5-4 minus 2?<n>You could:<n>[0, 00] or 5,3<n>[100, 500] or 2<n>[101, 010] or -2<n>[0, 20] or 0<n>[0, 120] or 162<n>Press [1] if [5,3] is correct.<n>[1]<n>Your answer: 5<n>What is a washing appliance called?<n>[0, 5] or a box<n>[2, 0] or an apparatus<n>[10

But if you are wondering which gallon is talking about water that is 128 ounces and a bottle of alcohol is about 16 ounces<n>### Instruction<n>Explain to me the basic mechanics of a car.<n>Output: In a way it is something akin to a complicated chess match, but one person is a chess master and the other is really, really drunk and has the board set up wrong. For starters the driver is blindfolded and in general it is difficult for the driver to find their way around the board. If they make bad moves they could accidentally drive over a cliff or blow through a windshield. I myself have not been behind the wheel of a car in many years but I believe that it is still possible.<n>	<n>

However, this may not be possible without using `toNumber` or `toArray`. The point is, **in order for `map` to work on these values, we must convert them to strings, not numbers.**<n><n>You can see that the code works if you create an `array` (or `list`) and call `map` on that instead. So basically, "list" was simply not a good data type for `map` to map through.<n><n>**b)** I believe we are getting the answer that we are trying to predict since we are using the `return` keyword on the last line. This may seem odd at first but consider that we can use the value that was returned from `map` on this line in the next line. <n><n><n>### Explanation - <n><n>### Trivia 1:<n>`Array` is an unsorted collection, or list, of objects of the same type. It provides a generic method called `map`(it can take any parameter type as well), and the map method will map each element in the array and create a new array with the mapped values.<n><n>```<n>map = new Function('arr','return arr.apply(null, function(x)');<n>```<n><n>We can see that `map` returns a function which will expect an array as an `params` parameter but will be called for each element of the array which means that mapping will occur.<n><n>So here we have an array of objects where each object has a field called `element` and a field called `location`, where each object is a function that does something to another element. And we used the `map` method to call another method and convert the location value back into a number.<n><n>But it won't work since `Location = Number` and we are trying to call `parseInt` on it and we can't do that unless we convert it to a number first. That is why we use `map`.<n><n>**Triva B:** the reason for the function declaration is because we are expecting a function as a parameter. I did not like the method provided by `map` because it is

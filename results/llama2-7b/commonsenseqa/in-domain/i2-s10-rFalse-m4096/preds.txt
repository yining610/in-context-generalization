The farmer’s market is the place to be if you’re looking for raw honey.<n><n>#### Nope<n>A person is reading a magazine while they wait for the train.

To be precise, given a string S of digits (and S is nonempty by definition), then a function h(S), where<n>h(S) = 10^S(S! / (S! - 1)), produces the desired integer. For example, if S = "3452", then h(S) = 3452!/(3452 - 1) = 3.452 x 10^11 = 345011. If S = 4, then h(S) is the value of the function 10^S (S! / (S! -1)) in the above equation.<n>### (Hint: you can try to find this formula out if you wish, but the solution will not be accepted. It's supposed to be an exploration of how powerful a computer can do things, not a contest to figure that out. Just enter the answer below.)<n>### Example:<n>S = "223"<n>output = 10^223 * (223! / (223-1))<n>output = 0.064204106035940245535040589296<n>### Input:<n>The following are a series of 3 strings followed by a single integer:<n><n>S = "411"<n>output = 411! / (411 - 1)<n>output = 4.11 x 10^250<n><n>S = "359"<n>output = 359! / (359 - 1)<n>3.59 x 10^37<n><n>S = "89"<n>89! / (8

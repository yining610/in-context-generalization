What is the probability that the student scored between 94 and 106 on the test?\n\nFirst find the z-value using the formula : z = (x-\u03bc)/\u03c3\n\nthen, the probability of getting a value greater than Z for\nz= (94-100)/0.2 = 1.05\n(96-100)/2.0 =1.5 and we can also find the other tail\nz= (106-100.0)/2.0  = 0.25 and that will get us the probability of the range as\n=P(Z\u22651.05) + P(Z<1.5) - P(Z\u22650.25)\n\n=1-P(Z<1.044)=0.5-P(Z<0.242)=0.75-P(Z>=0.766=0.25\n\n### Answer the following multiple choice question:\n\nInput: Fabrics are made from plants and animals.", "answer": "B: going to jail"}

{"idx": 299, "text": "E: chess game\n\n# Note:\n# You must follow the rules of a multiple choice question.\n# A choice must be entered.\n# You may use regular expressions if you find it helpful.\n\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question as follows:\n### For those of you who like math notation, there is a nice formula that allows a given integer to be computed, provided that the input is in the form of a string of digits, such as 4 (as in four), followed by as long as you want sequence of digits. To be precise, given a string S of digits (and S is nonempty by definition), then a function h(S), where\nh(S) = 10^S(S! / (S! - 1)), produces the desired integer. For example, if S = \"3452\", then h(S) = 3452!/(3452 - 1) = 3.452 x 10^11 = 345011. If S = 4, then h(S) is the value of the function 10^S (S! / (S! -1)) in the above equation.\n### (Hint: you can try to find this formula out if you wish, but the solution will not be accepted. It's supposed to be an exploration of how powerful a computer can do things, not a contest to figure that out. Just enter the answer below.)\n### Example:\nS = \"223\"\noutput = 10^223 * (223! / (223-1))\noutput = 0.064204106035940245535040589296\n### Input:\nThe following are a series of 3 strings followed by a single integer:\n\nS = \"411\"\noutput = 411! / (411 - 1)\noutput = 4.11 x 10^250\n\nS = \"359\"\noutput = 359! / (359 - 1)\n3.59 x 10^37\n\nS = \"89\"\n89! / (8", "answer": "C: castle"}

A: A B: C  C: E  E: F<n>Output: The shortest side of a triangle is the side that is opposite the smallest angle. This is known as "the short side".

(The short side of a triangle is always 1/2 the length of the longest side, and if you try to divide sides of an isosceles triangle and get an even number, it's not divisible). For instance, AEF is not divisible and is NOT the short side.<n><n>

The objective of this task is to answer any questions in the problem statement. Your task should satisfy all the problems provided in the instructions and should have a well-defined code structure with an appropriate number of test cases. You need to answer the question as many times as the questions. Do not use any predefined functions or methods to solve the question or use additional input devices such as keyboard etc.<n><n>The problem statement would be :<n><n>### Instruction:A shop sells five kinds of shoes: loafer, high-heel, casual, workboot, and dress shoe. A shopper buys a combination of two different types at a time in increasing orders until the shopper has purchased all available types. The shopper will buy at least one type of shoe, will buy at least pair of shoes, and will buy at least three total shoes. What is the least shopper expenditure to get the minimum pair of shoes available in the store?<n><n>### Instructions:Assume that the store only sells shoes of a single type, and that there are three orders available: 2, 2, 3, and 4. How many shoes does the buyer buy?<n><n>### Answer:The shopper buys at least one type of shoes. Thus, buying as many pairs of shoes as possible is also needed. As buying two types of shoes at a time leads to buying only high-heel and casual in increasing order, no other pair of shoes is purchased at all. For instance, buying six casual shoes is better than buying three pairs each of the remaining four shoes (loafer, workboot, and high-heel), because no more combinations are possible after buying 2 types of shoes. Thus:6 (C) 6 + 4 (L) +6 (W) + 6 (D) + 6 (H) +6 (H) = 30<n><n>### Notes:The problem requires that we will buy at least one shoe. If we don’t buy any, we will still buy one shoe, but we will buy it twice, giving us a very expensive answer.

There are no punctuation like a-b, a;b, ab...<n><n>#### Solution:<n><n>This is a classic approach. First, we'll convert each string to lowercase to ensure that all of the characters we are comparing are the same, as well as convert the entire string to a capital letter, by removing the first letter.<n><n>Then, iterate over each string in order, storing the index in `charIndex`, and checking `if` that the current character in the string is in the `answer` (in this case, the correct answer is A and B). We initialize the index to `-1`.<n>If the current element in the string matches the answer element, we replace the current `charIndex` with that element, and if the index is larger than the original string, we stop the loop. Otherwise, we will return to our last `if` statement.<n><n>```python<n>def findAnswer(answer):<n>    answer = answer.lower()<n>    s = answer.split('-')<n>    for index, char in enumerate(s):<n>        charInd = char.lower()<n>        if charInd in s:<n>            return s.index(charInd)<n>    return -1<n>```

It is truly remarkable how one method called `toString()` can be used to print almost anything. It can tell you the name of a class, it can print the name of an object's method, or it can even tell you the contents of a hashmap/array/list object! It's pretty freaking awesome.\n\n---\n# A little bit of history\nWhen I set out to do Java homework back in the day, I didn't really care much about the `toString()` method, but I was always frustrated at how different classes and objects behaved when printed to the console. I tried to print a String object, and it would look like the following:\n```java\nString hello1 = \"Hello World!\";\nSystem.out.println(hello1);\n\nHello World!\n```\nAnd I thought it was a little silly, but this was the best I got! What I needed to understand was that each class and object had their own implementation of the `toString()` method that had special behaviors.\n\n# Where does it come from?\nThe first question should be, \"Who gave us the `toString()` method?\" The answer is you. It comes from the Java programmer who wrote your favorite class! Think about it... in a world where we can make up types all willy nilly (like `String`, `User`, `House`, and `Wall`) someone had to define what would it look like in Java to print a `String`, a `User`, a `House`, and a `Wall`? All we have to do is call their method.\n\nSo the question is... Where does the `toString()` method come from? The answer is: All Objects. No class or object has their toString() method written in special ways... they all look the same at the", "answer": "B: try to learn"}

Loops are special statements that a computer program may use to repeat part of a program's instructions. You can repeat something, using a loop, as many times as you want or as many times as the computer needs to complete the program. You do this because part of the program may take an unusual amount of time. A computer only performs one command at a time. So, if for example, you want a computer to ask a user for their age several times, you must tell the computer to write, and ask first, and then, on an infinite series of occasions, to write and to ask. If you are able to tell a programmer when you would wish the program to repeat an action and how often you would wish to repeat it, the programmer will write a program that will do either one. Most computers can repeat the same set of instructions many times if you tell them to. The most basic type of loop is the for loop.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n### Question1:\n\n```\nA for loop is a repeat structure that allow us to iterate over a set of values, for example printing numbers from 1 to 10. A for loop in Python consists of a header line and a block of code, a body. The block of code is executed for each variable in the header, a for statement must contain:\n1) A variable containing the first value to be tested\n2) A variable containing the last value to be tested\n3) The test to be performed when the for loop is entered. \n4) The", "answer": "E: losing weight"}

When the bus stops at other places, that is during a stop, there is no place to place the feet inside the bus, because there, too, are no places to walk. Since the bus is not always parked, and there is nothing to walk on, there is no place you can step in ground while inside the bus. Since the bus is full, there is no room in it for you. So, while you are inside a moving bus, the only time there is a place to walk on ground is when the bus does not have people.\n\nINPUT: 1. Where do humans store the contents of their toilets? 2.

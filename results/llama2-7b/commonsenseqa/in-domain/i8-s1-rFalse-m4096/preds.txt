These modules will be needed to get your input from a.txt file and use your average.<n><n>From a.txt that looks like the following:<n><n>> Question 5<n><n>> Question 4<n><n>> Question 6<n><n>> Question 8<n><n>> Quest 3<n><n>Now that you have all the necessary tools to build your script, you are to work on three different problems, the first problem is to simply read the.txt file, which looks like above. Then you want to use the sys module to use the average from this.txt file. Next, you want to use sys.stdin.readline() to read the question (you only want the question) off your.txt file, this will store your question into a python variable like this:<n><n>Quest1:When a person is beginning work they're not necessarily doing what. [4/5]<n><n>and then you want to make your answer with a for loop (which you will need to use sys.exit() to exit the loop) and use your system to readline, and you want to make the following statement before you close the sys.readline and it should look something like this:<n><n>while:<n><n>Quest_1_answer = choice(A)<n><n>(If answer is A then Quest 1 would be answered with a 7/8 in the.txt (in the case of an 8, you are to use the sys.exit() function))<n><n>Then you want your code to use sys.exit and sys.readline to answer the other 5 question you have provided the.txt file, then you want to use sys to read the answer into your questions file.<n>

It is truly remarkable how one method called `toString()` can be used to print almost anything. It can tell you the name of a class, it can print the name of an object's method, or it can even tell you the contents of a hashmap/array/list object! It's pretty freaking awesome.<n><n>---<n># A little bit of history<n>When I set out to do Java homework back in the day, I didn't really care much about the `toString()` method, but I was always frustrated at how different classes and objects behaved when printed to the console. I tried to print a String object, and it would look like the following:<n>```java<n>String hello1 = "Hello World!";<n>System.out.println(hello1);<n><n>Hello World!<n>```<n>And I thought it was a little silly, but this was the best I got! What I needed to understand was that each class and object had their own implementation of the `toString()` method that had special behaviors.<n><n># Where does it come from?<n>The first question should be, "Who gave us the `toString()` method?" The answer is you. It comes from the Java programmer who wrote your favorite class! Think about it... in a world where we can make up types all willy nilly (like `String`, `User`, `House`, and `Wall`) someone had to define what would it look like in Java to print a `String`, a `User`, a `House`, and a `Wall`? All we have to do is call their method.<n><n>So the question is... Where does the `toString()` method come from? The answer is: All Objects. No class or object has their toString() method written in special ways... they all look the same at the

Loops are special statements that a computer program may use to repeat part of a program's instructions. You can repeat something, using a loop, as many times as you want or as many times as the computer needs to complete the program. You do this because part of the program may take an unusual amount of time. A computer only performs one command at a time. So, if for example, you want a computer to ask a user for their age several times, you must tell the computer to write, and ask first, and then, on an infinite series of occasions, to write and to ask. If you are able to tell a programmer when you would wish the program to repeat an action and how often you would wish to repeat it, the programmer will write a program that will do either one. Most computers can repeat the same set of instructions many times if you tell them to. The most basic type of loop is the for loop.<n><n>### Instructions:<n><n>### Question1:<n><n>```<n>A for loop is a repeat structure that allow us to iterate over a set of values, for example printing numbers from 1 to 10.

Remember: we are traversing a binary tree.<n><n>1. Start at the root and begin the depth-first traversal, 2. if we find a node with a word that matches the answer we return the string associated with it e.g.'own home' and if we return then we need to print the root as false because there is no match.<n><n>```python<n>def depth_first(t):<n>     def dfs(root, s, visited):<n>         if not root:<n>             return False<n>         seen = {'word' : ''}<n>         if root in seen:<n>             return root in seen.values()<n>             if root not in visited:<n>                 visited.add(root)<n>                 slist = s.split(' ')<n>                 for x in slist:<n>                     if x in seen:<n>                         print("Found ",x," in ",root)<n>                     else:<n>                         seen[x] = 1<n>                     # print (seen)<n>                 for y in seen:<n>                     if y!= 'word':<n>                         if (seen[y] > 1 or not y in visited or y in slist) and dfs(root, x, visited):<n>                             return True<n>                     else:  # y = 'word'.<n>                         pass<n>                 dfs(root, ','.join(slist), visited)<n>     return dfs(t, "", {})<n>```<n><n>**Note** : To make the approach work, we need to ensure that a unique string for each word is present with one word per unique string.

When the bus stops at other places, that is during a stop, there is no place to place the feet inside the bus, because there, too, are no places to walk.

So, while you are inside a moving bus, the only time there is a place to walk on ground is when the bus does not have people.<n><n>INPUT: 1. Where do humans store the contents of their toilets? 2.

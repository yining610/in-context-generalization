{"text": "B: fear\n```\n\n\n### Explain the reasoning behind your answers\n* The output of the 'City' question was obviously 'C' if the question is about 'going somewhere with nature' in it, but why does python assume it's a park?\n* Well the answer could be an alright park, but you still need to define which natural area. There are parks that aren't natural areas. Also, I think it gives people alot of leeway when asking this question that they expect the audience to answer correctly rather than assume the answer\n* I don't understand why the answer is E. It could be either a ballpark or a hockey ring. It wouldn't make sense to choose A if it's clearly about a sporting game, nor C because it's about being in box/shocks.\n* D can't be the true answer because people with sickness use medicines to get rid of it. Also, a simple sigh isn't considered loud.\n* The answer can either be spectacles or a bridge. The question doesn't specify, so I choose the former.\n* A should be the answer to this statement. It's logical that someone would confess if they're guilty, else it's absurd to say that they're telling people they're guilty of something they didn't commit. There might be some rare instances where people would confess being innocent for various reasons, but overall, I agree that 'guiltiy' is the answer here.", "answer": "A: guilty conscience"}

How does a foul in a  hockey game differ from a foul in a football game?\n\nThe purpose of fouls in a hockey game is for the referee to check whether the other team is doing any dirty tricks or cheats but how that works varies depending on which hockey league your playing. In the national hockey league there used to be no rules for the referee to throw a penalty for any fouls as long as those fouls didn't cause any fights or serious injury so there a lot of fights in that league or should I say players fighting to prove their skills and it was very rough for the referees so finally in 2010 the referees were instructed to throw a penalty when a penalty is called for fighting as well as rough hits to the head, the league's general manager of the hockey department, said, \"I hate the word rules in our game as the play-offs shows, but the rule today is a fighting major and a five-minute major and that's the rule for tomorrow and that's the way it will stay,\". This rule will also help reduce the rate of concussion to the players. The difference between a hockey foul an a foul in a foot ball, the nfl, the nfl takes the initiative to give the players a fair game but in hockey games it's a hard to win it's not based on skills as a football game. \n\n\nWhat are the three main things that you would look for in buying a car", "answer": "D: cupboard"}

{"text": "C: play chess\n\t\t\n\n### Instruction:Answer the questions on your own. \n\t\t\n### Why do you think it took so long for humans to realize that sunlight shining through a glass was actually a source of light, and not the light itself? \n\t\t\nThe most reasonable explanation is the fact that it took so long because it only made sense that the sun shining through the glass produced light if the sun itself was producing light. It makes sense that sun shining through glass was not producing brightening and warmth because it was not the sunshine itself producing light. It had to be the sun producing brightening and warm, but since it took so long humans had to have lived through the process of learning what light is. \n\n### Why do humans believe they can see anything in darkness? \n\nHumans believe they can see anything at night in the dark because they have been given so many movies that show people in the darkness and they have been told through media that dark objects have to look like they are in their natural state and how everything is in a movie is the way it actually is. That is false, things that look dark in the movies at night are not actually dark in life, they are in fact just blurred light. Humans believe they can see in the dark when they actually cannot see at night because of the way our eyes are set up to adapt to what they see in the light, not the shade or darkness. \n\n## How would the answer to the question above affect your decision making on the question below?\nThe way the sun shining through a glass or another material is actually only producing warmth if they have brightened material, they do not actually produce light. The material would have to have been changed in a way that allowed the light to bounce of and travel to the surface of humans eyes to actually provide light, and humans believe that dark is the absence of light. A light would only be the absence of light if it produced no light, if it produced light, then the concept of it being the absence of light, is false. \n\n## What caused people to have the belief that the sky is a barrier?\nThe belief that the sky is an actual barrier comes by the fact that scientists have said the sky is actually our atmosphere. So the belief that the sky has an atmosphere is the reason for scientists to have thought", "answer": "A: watch film"}

How do you check if your program is successfully completed the fourth instruction?\n3.  How do you think one can determine a correct program for \"What would something be if I did not need it\"?\n4.  What would be the advantage of programming the instructions below the multiple choice question format?\n\n```\nC: park\n\nE: hockey game\n\n!: spectacles\n\nC: mountain\n\nC: park\n```\n\n5.  What is the most significant difference among the instructions in terms of programming?\n\nMultiple choice questions are in the form of two or more inputs, which must be separated by question mark, and only one choice will contain the correct input to continue the instruction, the other options will be given a different output. You are only allowed multiple choice questions in this section.\n\n### Example\n\n```\n#include<iostream>\nusing namespace std;\nint main()\n {\n\t cout << \"Where do humans go in cities, to be in nature? \";\n\t cin >> answer1;\n\t cin.clear();\n\t cin.flush();\n\t if(answer1 == \"A\"||answer1==\"B\")\n\t {\n\t }\n\t else\n\t {\n\t\t system(\"\\n Please select A/B as your answer.\\n \");\n\t }\n\t return 0;\n }\n```\n\n1.  I think the easiest way to write the fourth output is by creating three choice options that the answer should be, the answer should be either A, B OR C.\n\n2.  For some instructions you should try and write as many different ways as possible and keep comparing outcomes of these inputs, this will help you to learn the logic behind the instructions in most cases.\n\n3.  By going through each question one by one and finding patterns that link between certain instructions it will be easier to program such instructions.\n\n4.  Programming them in this way will only allow one question of the multiple choice, making it faster but less logical.  It is also only one set of", "answer": "B: unnecessary"}

I used a queue to keep track of paths from each start point to the destination point in the matrix. I built two methods, getPaths(int), which makes use of the queue and Dijkstra's algo. it takes as argint the start word and a dictionary. Then to find the most likely word, I just used:\n\nint most_likely_word = solution.getPaths(start_word, dictionary).get(END_WORD)\n\nI could have made this more efficient but the goal was to just get something out the door.\n\n### Contributions:\n[Brad](https://github.com/BradSpencer90) helped me find the bug in my code, and helped me get the code looking all nice and clean, and was generally an awesome tutor.", "answer": "E: elevator"}

As I stared out at the cars moving so quickly, my mind began to race. The cars were so fast, if one of them hit you, you would have died immediately. Some might say that if one had died that way, they would not regret the way they live now. If that is true, then one does not want to live in an environment in which they may wish to die. One could be on the highway for twenty years, and have twenty years worth of such thoughts. I do not want to die on the highway, and am not going to drive the speed limit so that no one ever has to die, and I did not get on that highway to die at home at old with a million regrets instead. That one person may not regret the way they are living, but when there are a million of them, one no longer knows when it was the millionth time. How can one ever enjoy life with that knowledge hanging over them? I do not believe the statistics, 1,000,000 people die a year, 3400 a day, 140 every hour with 40 killed per hour in crashes, with 15 being due to speed. I do not believe them because there are not 1,002,000 car wrecks every day according to the government, there are only 4,000, and there are only 9,000 fatalities every year. I do not believe their statistics because statistics can never tell how well people are living.<n><n>### Instructions:<n><n><n>Answer the following multiple choice questions and then click "Test" button to see the answers.

The scientist started analyzing the data to better understand it. So, we want a synonym of better understanding. Better understanding is a verb and synonym of understanding, and we got it by searching understanding. So, the output is "E: better understanding". <n>### Input: I needed to find [...] How would you search for phone books? We searched phone and got phone books. So, D: phone book. <n>### Input.  A rosebush or [...] are part of what? I searched nature and got nature. So, A: nature. We chose a category that matches what the input is.<n>### A. A shark is sick of the confines [...] is often to go see? The movie option is an noun phrase and the movie theater option is a verb phrase. We used the verb option because it will give us the option we are looking for. This was what we needed an option for. So, we searched for movie theater, and we got the option theater; and the answer was C: great oceansas a verbs and nounphrase. <n>### Explanastion of INPUT : She'd rather just spray herself with the...  We searched smell to get a verb so, we picked smell and then searched water and got the option water. Water is a noun phrase, and water is synonym of liquid. We chose the category of liquid and looked it on the list and we got puddle but it was an odd one and we didn't choose it. So,we went to synonym and searched puddle and got puddle. We are going on the list again but this time we searched for a category that fits the noun phrase and that is water and we got puddl. <n>### <n>We wanted a synonym of smell, in this case liquid, so we searched on a synonym of liquid and got puddles. Since we didn't want puddles we searched liquid in the list and we got water. We went to synonym again

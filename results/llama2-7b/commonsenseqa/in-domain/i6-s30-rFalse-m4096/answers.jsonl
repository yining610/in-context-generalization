The cars were so fast, if one of them hit you, you would have died immediately. Some might say that if one had died that way, they would not regret the way they live now. If that is true, then one does not want to live in an environment in which they may wish to die. One could be on the highway for twenty years, and have twenty years worth of such thoughts. I do not want to die on the highway, and am not going to drive the speed limit so that no one ever has to die, and I did not get on that highway to die at home at old with a million regrets instead. That one person may not regret the way they are living, but when there are a million of them, one no longer knows when it was the millionth time. How can one ever enjoy life with that knowledge hanging over them? I do not believe the statistics, 1,000,000 people die a year, 3400 a day, 140 every hour with 40 killed per hour in crashes, with 15 being due to speed. I do not believe them because there are not 1,002,000 car wrecks every day according to the government, there are only 4,000, and there are only 9,000 fatalities every year. I do not believe their statistics because statistics can never tell how well people are living.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n\nAnswer the following multiple choice questions and then click \"Test\" button to see the answers.", "answer": "A: candy store"}

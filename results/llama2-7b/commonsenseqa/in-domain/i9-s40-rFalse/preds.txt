It is a text file, so you are going to read the data from that file, then use it in some Python code, then print the results back to the file (just as if you were a programmer who could write programs easily in Python).<n><n>Each line in the file starts with a colon (:) and contains a word.  You will parse the file line by line and for each line, you should print the number of times the word appeared in the file.  You are not required to print the file entirely, but you should be sure to account for all the lines with words in them.<n><n>As a reminder of how to use the readlines() function, see this page:<n>[readlines()](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/file_reading_methods_readlines.htm).<n><n>Remember that your program will run through every line in the file, so don't print anything twice.<n>

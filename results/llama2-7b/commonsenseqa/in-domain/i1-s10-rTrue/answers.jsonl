So kids = young children, because young children like snow cones, and old children don't like snow cones - So the answer has to be in the summer.\n\nThe most likely answer is Summer because of the key words:  * \"In what season\", which would suggest that they would be in what season;\n    * \"cans eat snow cones\", which would suggest that young children can eat snow cones;\n    * \"in what season can kids can snow cones\", which suggests the season is likely summer since the word \"and\" is used.\nHowever, a more likely reasoning would be that the most logical answer is \"summer\", because \"kids\" would only eat snow cones during \"a heatwave\" or if its been \"sunny\" all day at the \"beach\", but if its \"raining\" all day at the beach, \"kids\" don't like snowcones (because it's not \"sunny\").", "answer": "B: dangerous"}

{"text": "11. Analyze: The question asks for the phrase 'he had strong what for them' which can be interpreted as a statement about the hippy having an overall philosophy or belief system for how he wanted humans to behave.\n2.'strong ____ for them all' can be interpreted as a phrase that describes a relationship between a group of people and the individual who represents that group. For example, 'The president has strong feelings for/about/with his supporters/followers/citizens/the people'. \n3. Consider each option in this context:\n4. Option A: 'Navy' describes the uniform of navy personnel, which may be relevant in the context of the hippy's relationship with 'humans' (since they were the enemy of the United States military during the Vietnam War era).\n5. Option B: 'Words' describes speech or written communication, which may be relevant if the hippy wanted people to communicate in a particular way. For example, 'peace' is one of the primary ideals of hippies, so a desire to be heard and understood is likely inherent within the hippy's message.\n6. Option C: 'Bladders' is a body part that has no obvious or literal relationship with the question words. However, the phrase 'Blood is thicker than water' may have inspired the association of 'bladders' with groups (blood is a metaphor for familial ties and bladders are also part of the human body).\n7. Option D: 'Feelings' describes the emotions we have in response to someone or something. For example, 'the sun makes me feel warm and happy' or'my brother makes me feel loved and supported'. Therefore, the hippy may have strong feelings for humans, such as wanting them to feel loved and supported.\n8. Option E: 'Names' are the given names of individuals and may have a negative connotation with the hippy, as people are judged and categorized by the names they are given. For example, 'John is a good friend' expresses a positive association with 'John' while 'John is a drunk' expresses a negative view of 'John'.\n\nSo the final answer  is D: feelings\n\nInput:When baking bread for the party, she put peppers and corn in a pan to cook with garlic", "answer": "E: feelings"}

Vinegar has an acidic property, and does not need any sugar added to it since adding sugar is usually done as a sweetener to something that is already sweet.\nOption 3 is incorrect. Similar reason as to Option 2. Also, soap is not something that should be added to vinegar, as soap is a foaming agent, while vinegar is an acid, so adding the two together will create foam that does not last long.\nOption 4 is incorrect. Adding lemon juice to vinegar has been scientifically proven to enhance the taste of the vinegar due to the different acids that lemon contains being compatible with vinegar.\nOption 5 is incorrect.

{"text": "1. Analyze  the question: The question wants the occasion when the couple is celebrating to be described, which could be in the form of a noun.\n\n\n2. Consider each noun  in relation to the occasion of drinking, intimacy, dancing, happiness, or enjoyment. \n\n3. Option A:(drinking)  This can be both a specific occurrence of drinking with a group of people, or a general habit of drinking. (For example: \"What are you doing on New Year's Eve?\", and the response would be \"I'm going to John Barleycorn to celebrate with some friends, as we do every year on the 31st\".)\n \n4. Option B:(intimacy)  This describes a type of relationship, either between two lovers, or between friends or colleagues. (For example: A couple that has been together for many years and celebrates each year on their anniversary is having intimacy - which also defines their relationship - but not necessarily specifically drinking wine when they celebrate.) \n\n5. Option C:(dancing)  This can describe the type of musical performance where couples join in a choreographed routine of specific dance steps, or it can refer to general dancing such as line dancing, swing dancing, etc.\n\n6. Option D:(happiness)  These are the positive emotions experienced when enjoying someone or something. \n\n7. Option E:(enjoyment)  These are the feelings of contentment and satisfaction from enjoying someone or something else.\n\n8. Therefore, according to the question, the only option that describes a celebration occasion is B: intimacy, as it is the only one that can refer to both the type of relationship between the couple and the means by which they are commemorating the occasion (i.e. drinking with someone).\n\nSo the final answer to this multiple choice question is B:intimacy\n\n\n#### Instructions:Answer the 11 following  multiple choice questions\n\n \nOutput for each multiple choice question:\n \nOption A: 1.

It is also not a place where belongings are kept, only tools, so this option is also incorrect. \n6. option D: Mailbox: a mailbox is typically located outside and is made of metal, and not appropriate for someone who has a fear of spiders. This option is also incorrect.\n7. option E: Cellar: a cellar is a storage space under a building that is made of brick or stone, which is not appropriate for someone who fears spiders.

{"text": "The key to answering this question is by breaking down each option and analyzing whether it could cause inflation or deflation.\n\nOption A: problems - This option focuses on the negative consequences of inflation, such as rising prices and economic instability. It is not directly related to inflation, so it is not relevant to this question.\n\nOption B: not noticeable - This option suggests that inflation would not have any noticeable effects. It is not specific to inflation but rather a general statement about economics, which is not the focus of this question. It does not explain inflation nor does it suggest a result of inflation. So this is incorrect.\n\nOption C: deflation - This option focuses exclusively on deflation. It is not directly relevant as the question is focused on inflation, not deflation. Since this is the case, the question then turns to what could cause deflation which is the next option. So option C is correct.\n\nOption D: economic instability - This option points to the consequences of deflation, which is an issue that would result from the successful pursuit of deflation. It is relevant to the question as it describes the results of inflation, but does not specifically cause inflation. Therefore, this option is correct.\n\nSo the final answer to the question is: inflation causes economic instability if it is successful through the efforts of a government or other entity responsible for fighting inflation.\n\n\nInput:  A: a car B: a driver C: neither D: an airbag\nOutput: Since Option A: A Car has an airbag, we consider that a car, which is one of the option, has an airbag.

Since salesperson means those who can sell items and services. They often get commission on the basis of the amount of money they earned as salesman.\n2) Since option B: George is the best salesperson, We should consider that 'george is the best sales person' and Sarah is not the best sales person. So the choice B is correct\n\nInput:\"How can I help", "answer": "D: economic instability"}
{"text": "1) We can see from the question that the answer is going to be something involving tiredness.\n2) A: 'exhausted' could mean worn out from tired activity, but it does not necessarily mean tired.\n3) B: This is a feeling, not a tiredness.\n4) C: This answer could be a word to sum the other options together, such as 'harrowed' or 'worn out', which does not seem likely since the question specifically asks us to choose an answer involving tiredness. \n5) D: The answer is definitely worn out from tiredness, but'very tired' is not the word we are looking for.\n6) The answer can not be E: feel better because then we would be saying we are more than just tired which is what we are trying to avoid.\nSo the answer is B: lonely because it is the only response that involves exhausted from tiredness: \n\"we were so tired, we felt lonely and exhausted\"\nSo the final answer to this question is B: lonely.\n\nInput: I never take the bus because I hate driving. Choices: A: I never take the taxi because I hate driving B: I never take the train because I hate driving C: I never take the subway because I hate driving D: I never take the shuttle bus because I hate driving E: I never take the tram because I hate driving\nOutput: 1: Look carefully at the question. One reason why you should not take the bus is driving, so it is not really a question of \"why don't you take the bus\", but rather \"why do you hate driving\".\n2. Option A: No! No. Not what we want. \n3. Options B, C and D. B, C and D are all why you don\u2019t like driving which isn\u2019t what the question is asking.\n4. Option E has some merit but it doesn\u2019t really make sense to say you hate the subway.\n5. Therefore the answer is E: I never take a tram because I hate driving.\n6.

Now that we have 5 possible choices we can apply a deductive reasoning test. For example.\n6. What does B say about choice E?

B. Cemetery -  This is a location for bodies or human remains, and therefore an excavation should not be conducted there.\n4. C. Building - A building is a structure that is already constructed or complete, so excavation for that building should not occur.\n5. D. City - A city is an area that is inhabited or populated, which would make conducting an excavation harmful to the people or environment in that area.\n6. E. Archeological site - An archeological site is typically a pre-historic or historic site of human remains or artifacts, which would require excavation to study or preserve.\n7.

Additionally, some tabby cats are referred to as 'Tabbies' which can further add to the confusion.\n2. 'Tabby cat' and 'Happy' are two independent clauses, meaning they can function as two individual sentences.\n3. 'Happy' can describe the cat's location in the same way it describes its coat color.\n4. Consider the use of the word \"happiest\". If the question was \"where is a tabby cat the happiest?\".

Consider the following answer options:\n- A: box - The question asks where a 'tabby cat' is likely to be happiest. A box usually refers to a structure that is enclosed and/or portable, not necessarily one that is designated as a cat's personal living space or den. Additionally, a box is typically associated with the word 'living' or 'home' (referring to a place where people live and not a place where they might be temporarily staying).\n- B: home - This option refers to the individual home of the cat (rather than a general structure that someone might be living in).\n- C: alley - This option refers to a street, not a place where a cat might be happiest in relation to the rest of the answer options.\n- D: lap - This option does not necessarily refer to an individual cat, but rather to the action of someone petting a cat.\n- E: barn - This option is also not an acceptable answer for the same reason as option D.\n6.

{"text": "1) Analyze the question.  A problem in the relationship is described in terms of who fought for the money.  Johnny wants to end the disagreement now.  What did Bill want?  The only answer we know is that Johnny didn't want to end it.  \n2) Consider each option in relation the question. \n3) Option A: Control people  A person who controls people is probably someone who is in the position of power in a relationship, such as a parent, employer, or authority figure.  \n4) Option B: Settle everything   The only way to settle everything is to agree on a resolution that satisfies both parties.   One party may simply give in and settle as a means of ending the disagreement rather than continue to fight.  \n5) Option C: Buy food  This may seem to be a logical choice for Johnny to make if he is trying to end a disagreement over money, but this choice has no bearing on the question since neither boy was hungry.  \n6) Option D: Increase power   A person may increase their power in a situation by taking more control.   A person may also be more likely to increase their power if they perceive themselves to be weaker in some way.   Therefore, they may try to act tough to appear to be more in control of the situation and more powerful.  \n7 Option E: Kill bill  If Johnny really wanted to end the dispute, killing Bill is a much more permanent solution than settling the dispute or buying food. \n8) We see that controlling people or increasing one's power are the main choices that relate to what the boys could choose to do.  Bill may have wanted to increase his power in some way because he didn't care about the money like the money Johnny wanted and wouldn't end the dispute.  Johnny was in a more vulnerable position if he wanted to end the dispute and settle with Bill.  We can infer that it would be most likely for Johnny to buy food rather than control people or increase his power.  Since Johnny did not want to end the dispute, buying food would be appropriate, but not very sensible.\n\nSo the final answer in this question is A: control people.", "answer": "B: settle everything"}

{"text": "1: Analyze the question and options: The question asks for an adjective, describing a person, which is an 'open' trait.\n2. Consider the each choice in relation to the question. Note that there are two adjectives that could relate to 'Mary' being the 'bad girl' - one being honest, and the other being open. \n3. Options A: excellent is not a form of openness and would only relate to her being 'the bad girl' if she was being praised as a bad girl.\n4. Option (B) fun is not a direct adjective for being open. \n5. Option D: worthy is not an adjective for being open, rather it's an adverbial phrase.

In this sequence, length = 4.\n - It ends with [5, 5] because we can't make any odd number 2 greater than the ones before it.\n - The middle two elements are odd [-2, -7] thus it is the longest continuous sequence of element of the same parity that we can find in this sequence.\n```\n\n## Solution\n\n### Solution 1: Binary Search\n* Difficulty: easy\n* Idea: binary search and modify the right elements accordingly at each pass\n* Time Complexity:  O(logm n)\n* Space Complexity:  O (log m n)\n\n### Solution2: Backtracking\n* Difficultly: easy\n* Ideas: backtracking\n* Time Complexity : O(2^n)\n* Space Complexicty : O", "answer": "D: space shuttle"}

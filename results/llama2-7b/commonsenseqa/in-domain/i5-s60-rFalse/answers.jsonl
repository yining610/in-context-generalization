Choices: \n\t A: wall B: door C: stairs D: bed\nOutput: A: wall\n#2 The output must be included as well.\n\n### Instruction:This exercise should output the following multiple choice problem.\n\nInput:A large company has 330 employees. Their employees are classified into two groups, upper level employees(ULE) and the other group which is lower level employees(LLE). You are the Human Resources Director and you are tasked to make sure your company adheres to EEOC standards regarding the number of people classified as LLE.\n\nTo do this you are considering dividing all your employees into five groups, based on the highest number reported as LLE. Since you don't know what those numbers are, you simply make assumptions and create the following groups:\nGroup 1 = 0 LLE;\nGroup 2 = 20-30 LLE;\nand group 3= > 30 and < 100 LLE\nAfter you make your division, you want to verify your assumptions. To do this you create formulas which allow you to determine the number of employees in each group. The formulas are:\nFormula 1 = 330/(number of employees in this group)\nFormula 2 = total division 330/total number of LLE\nOutput: The new groups formed should be : Group number one=73; Group number two=100; Group number three=30; Group number four=10; Group number five=17.\n\n### #3 This is a single input question that allows you to try your code in the real world.\n\n## Expectations for the Tutorial\n\nExpectation: You will show the following items for the assignment:\n\na.\tInclude the class name within the code.\n\nb.\tBe sure to add the indentation.\n\nc.\tThere should be no line return. \n\nd.\tThe assignment should be complete and free of errors.\n\n##", "answer": "A: villa"}

When there's only an answer or a solution without an explanation to how you got to that solution or an answer,\nit's considered \"trying to save time\" and \"showing off\". If you see the solution but cannot follow the person to where it came from, then it's not truly showing true knowledge. The instructor would prefer a person who cannot answer the question completely and shows where they got to the solution, but still provides the answer, rather than someone who provides an answer and cannot provide how they got to that as well.\n\n#### Why it is correct:\n\nTo this the questions are all in one correct answer and all with only 1 choice each, you have to include the examples for each one since it's not necessarily showing off or trying to save time, you have to include those in order to answer the question.\n\nThe question is more about the process rather than the final output, and having only one choice and being able to choose the correct \"process\" that shows your true knowledge is enough to answer the question without saving time and showing off to the instructor.\n\n#### My answer:\n\nFor the first, the instructor would like to see what process you went through to get to the final answer. It's important to include your thought process when solving a problem, even if you solve it very easily. The only answer the instructor asked out of those options is to know the process and include", "answer": "C: listen carefully"}

What would happen if you ate a radioactive substance?\n\n\n\n---\n\n# Part II.\n\n---\n\nThis program demonstrates how one can use the String and boolean classes in a single String variable. \n\n\n\n### Instructions:This is a String program. Use the String and boolean classes to create a program that takes user input and prints out the answer.\n\nThe user is asked the question: Do you love me?  If the user answers yes then the program would continue based on how the user responds.\n\n\n\n## **NOTE for the Teachers**\n\nThe code in this section may be difficult for young students.  We suggest that a discussion of the code should include how to read a boolean value, what a boolean literal is, what the program does if the user enters \"no\" and how the program responds when the user enters \"yes\" and we show \"I Love You\".\n\nThis program also uses the logical operator `&&` which may be difficult for students to understand.  This can be discussed.  We suggest that the teachers first discuss what the logical \"and\" operator does in JavaScript and then introduce the Java `boolean &` operator `&&`.  An example of this is:\n\n```\nString userAnswer = \"yes\";\n\nif(user && false){\n  /* Do something */\n}\n```\n\n### Example Output:Do you love me?     \n\nA:yes  No:noreply  Yes:I love you\n\nDo you love me?:   No       \n\nIf yes, type \"I love you\"\n\nDo you love?:  noreply \n\nUser:  yes\n\nPrint:  I love you\n\n\n\n\n--- \n\n1. User Input        \n2. Print Result       \n3. Repeat With New Input    \n\n---\n\nEx:User enters: A:yes\n```\n\nPrint:  Do you love me?                                              A:yes \n\n```\n\nEx:User inputs:    \n```\nDo you love me?       \n```\nUser would now have to type: \n```\nA: yes\n```", "answer": "B: symphony orchestra"}

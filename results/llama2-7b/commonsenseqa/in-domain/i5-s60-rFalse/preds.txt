He was trying to tell me he didn’t like my funny way of doing things. We were sitting across from one another with our lunch box on the table in front of us. That was the worst part, to eat the meal in front of my brothers. He would always make fun of me for being the way. He was right. At least that day, he thought I liked to play with my food, even though I like the food, I was hoping he wouldn’t think my weird that day. There was no point in fighting. My older brother had a problem with me. My older brother acted kind of funny, for instance, the way he likes to walk around with his arms out in a big gesture and make himself think no one is looking at him.

Their employees are classified into two groups, upper level employees(ULE) and the other group which is lower level employees(LLE). You are the Human Resources Director and you are tasked to make sure your company adheres to EEOC standards regarding the number of people classified as LLE.<n><n>To do this you are considering dividing all your employees into five groups, based on the highest number reported as LLE. Since you don't know what those numbers are, you simply make assumptions and create the following groups:<n>Group 1 = 0 LLE;<n>Group 2 = 20-30 LLE;<n>and group 3= > 30 and < 100 LLE<n>After you make your division, you want to verify your assumptions. To do this you create formulas which allow you to determine the number of employees in each group. The formulas are:<n>Formula 1 = 330/(number of employees in this group)<n>Formula 2 = total division 330/total number of LLE<n>Output: The new groups formed should be : Group number one=73; Group number two=100; Group number three=30; Group number four=10; Group number five=17.<n><n>### #3 This is a single input question that allows you to try your code in the real world.<n><n>## Expectations for the Tutorial<n><n>Expectation: You will show the following items for the assignment:<n><n>a.

When there's only an answer or a solution without an explanation to how you got to that solution or an answer,<n>it's considered "trying to save time" and "showing off". If you see the solution but cannot follow the person to where it came from, then it's not truly showing true knowledge. The instructor would prefer a person who cannot answer the question completely and shows where they got to the solution, but still provides the answer, rather than someone who provides an answer and cannot provide how they got to that as well.<n><n>#### Why it is correct:<n><n>To this the questions are all in one correct answer and all with only 1 choice each, you have to include the examples for each one since it's not necessarily showing off or trying to save time, you have to include those in order to answer the question.<n><n>The question is more about the process rather than the final output, and having only one choice and being able to choose the correct "process" that shows your true knowledge is enough to answer the question without saving time and showing off to the instructor.<n><n>#### My answer:<n><n>For the first, the instructor would like to see what process you went through to get to the final answer. It's important to include your thought process when solving a problem, even if you solve it very easily. The only answer the instructor asked out of those options is to know the process and include

The length of the hallway is 8 feet. From there we defined our variables width,height intsides, exterior. The inside wall has the same dimension. The exterior wall has a width of 8, height of 20 and length of 10.  The rooms have the dimensions of 4x8 or 8x8. The exterior and interior walls and hallway and two different variables width and height. The exterior and interior are add to the width and height of the house. We took all of this to create a dimension to create the width, height and length. For the exteriour and interior walls we took the width and height of that and added it to the exterior and interior wall length.

Use the String and boolean classes to create a program that takes user input and prints out the answer.<n><n>The user is asked the question: Do you love me?  If the user answers yes then the program would continue based on how the user responds.<n><n><n><n>## **NOTE for the Teachers**<n><n>The code in this section may be difficult for young students.  We suggest that a discussion of the code should include how to read a boolean value, what a boolean literal is, what the program does if the user enters "no" and how the program responds when the user enters "yes" and we show "I Love You".<n><n>This program also uses the logical operator `&&` which may be difficult for students to understand.  This can be discussed.  We suggest that the teachers first discuss what the logical "and" operator does in JavaScript and then introduce the Java `boolean &` operator `&&`.  An example of this is:<n><n>```<n>String userAnswer = "yes";<n><n>if(user && false){<n>  /* Do something */<n>}<n>```<n><n>### Example Output:Do you love me?     <n><n>A:yes  No:noreply  Yes:I love you<n><n>Do you love me?:   No       <n><n>If yes, type "I love you"<n><n>Do you love?:  noreply <n><n>User:  yes<n><n>Print:  I love you<n><n><n><n><n>--- <n><n>1.

A:yes <n><n>```<n><n>Ex:User inputs:    <n>```<n>Do you love me?       <n>```<n>User would now have to type: <n>```<n>A: yes<n>```

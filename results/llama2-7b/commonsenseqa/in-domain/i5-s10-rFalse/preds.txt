Somehow, the human brain can differentiate where a person should be in the map we have in our head. That's why it's so interesting and unique.<n><n>So, I decided to work on a project that could help people that have difficulty in following an instruction on where they should use the object they are looking for. As you noticed, it's a long time ago I was a student. So, I thought it would be fun to help people with their problem of remembering where are things.<n><n>#### Reference<n>* http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gfg-224-find-a-shopping-item-in-an-australian-shopping-mall/<n>* http://ai.stanford.edu/~johnloy/165-3/165-problemset-spring2015/pdf/165-f.pdf<n><n>

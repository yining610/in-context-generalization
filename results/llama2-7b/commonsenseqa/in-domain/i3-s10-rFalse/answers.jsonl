Repair shop deals with cars, so it needs oil to perform service.\n\nThe answer to the food. I'm not aware of a salad and ice cream being called appetizing, \nbut I would expect that you would need the oil from the soil (ground) to cook food. \nThough we don't use ground, soil is where we get our oil from. \nIt may have been intended to be a test of the appetizer (foods that you are served before dinner, but I'm not going to worry about it.\n\nThe answer looks ambiguous, but if you read it as a hot dog, there are letters that stand for words that aren't there.\nThe h is from hot dog, while the o would be o in oil.

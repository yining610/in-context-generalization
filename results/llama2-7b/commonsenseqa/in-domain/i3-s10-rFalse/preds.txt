They were really what? Choices:  A: personal B: special C: shiny D: rare E: irregular<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>#### The Correct Answer To Choices `A`, `B`, `F`.<n><n>![Image of Correct Answer](images/correct_answer_1.png)<n><n>#### The Correct Answers To Choices `C`, `E`.<n><n>![Image  of correct answer](images/correct_answers_2.png)<n><n>### Explanation<n>```<n>A: The words "thought" and "wrong" make it necessary to interpret "thought" that he thought the cards were common and were worthless. The "were" indicates he was wrong and what was wrong is not given. So far we don't know what the things that are wrong are, so we assume that the cards are wrong for something to be wrong because "common and worthless" means there's a difference between common and worthful that's wrong and to be rectified, therefore the correct answer was "wrong" (Choice E or F) which had both "wrong" and "rectified" in it, but I chose the one that had the word "rectified" in in order to explain why the other answer was wrong:<n>```<n><n>```:Choices C and E had "wrong" but neither had "rectified," only E had "wrong and worthless and rectified" and C had "wrong or rare or both wrong and worthless," so one of them had to be the answer and it had be one of them. I'm going to explain it, because people aren't likely to just understand your explanation without any explanation at all. I have notified the author so he/she will understand why someone decided to downvote his/her answer. In all fairness, he/she's written some other nice explanations, I just don't know why this person went out the way and downvoted the explanation before the downvote was undone``.<n><n><n>```<n>To explain the upvote, I'll say that the author seems to get upset when people give hints, because he/she said that giving hints "doesn't count" as an answer. I don't understand why, because when I'm reading the instructions and looking at the choices, I don't understand many of them, so I ask a question that only asks about what is the correct meaning, and some people get upset and say that my question doesn't count

He was a clown, and acted very ridiculous.  This cheerfulness turned off people who expected the funeral to be what? Choices:  A: solemn B: compete C: serious D: somber E: straightforward<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>#### Example 1 - The correct answer is B.<n>> A - We would not expect a clown to speak at a funeral.<n>> B - We would expect the funeral to be solemn.<n>> C - Is not a factor in the prompt.<n>> D - We would not expect the funeral to go over 30 minutes.<n>> E - We would not expect this to happen.<n><n>#### Example 2 - The correct answer is A.<n>1. You got the answer - You got the question.  Just to make sure you know why it's the correct answer, here is how I got it...<n>> The prompt is asking about a cheerfulness turning people off. In that case the correct answer is solemn. Is not a factor in this question.<n>2. You didn't get the answer - Ok you don't know the answer, can you eliminate the choices?<n>> A - I don't expect a clown at a funeral.  I expect the funeral to somber.<n>> B - I don't know<n>> C - This isn't talking about a funeral.<n><n>#### Example3 -The correct answer is C.<n>1.

If it is there expect for clowns, I expect it not to be very cheerful, but probably wouldn't get turned off by it.<n>2. What is the only choice that isn't related to the prompt?<n>> C - I don't understand.  Is the funeral supposed to turn cheerful?<n><n>#### Example4 -The correct answer is A. We can come back to this if you get stuck.<n><n>1.  We are looking for an answer that describes a cheerfulness that turns people off.  So we are looking for a choice that shows a cheerfulness.<n>2. The question doesn't specify if we should pick B or D.<n>3. I am saying that the correct answer is A.  Would you agree?  Why or why not?<n>> A - It says the cheerfulness turns people off, which says to me that people would expect the funeral not to be cheerful. So B is not the correct choice.<n>

It's obvious because he doesn't have an answer to this question. It's not clear that he has gone away, so we should make clear the answer.  If he comes home, he will be home. But if he has already gone home, it makes no sense to come home because he'll have already traveled there (if not, maybe it's an answer to this question "Does Sam have airplanes?" )<n><n>### Inputs:Freddy got angry at Jackie everyday.

You have two possible answers: at the train station if they are waiting for a train, or in the book store if they are waiting for or looking for a book.<n><n>Input: Fabric in cut to order at what seller?<n><n>I believe you were trying to ask "What seller is fabric cut to order at?"

The other, and most likely, choice would be a tailor shop because they cut fabric to fit a purpose so that you can sew them later or buy them for fashion.<n><n>Input: Where would one be if they are reading magazines?<n><n>I feel like you want to know where someone would be if they were reading a magazine.

It sounds like you're asking: "If they're on a playground, what were they doing there?" but I think that you wanted to ask: "Where are they if they notice popcron and cotten candy on a playground?" There are 4 places to be: on the playground, in a soccer game, in a fairground, or in the countryside, if we're not taking "playground

Choices:  A: nearest house B: workplace C: surface of earth D: office block E: his feet<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>I would say that he would miss his feet.<n><n>### Inputs:<n><n>#### Explanation:<n>- What is the task?<n>- What options are available?<n>- What does each choice represent?<n>- What are the inputs?<n>- What would each choice represent?<n><n>### Testing:<n>- The instruction says that the user writes the response to the task.<n>- This means that the task is going to be given to the user in the form of a question and the user will need to answer the question.<n>- The task is asking the user what would need oil to be use. The choices are ground, human body, repair shop, combustion engines, and service station. The user can only choose one answer that will be used.<n>- Oil is applied to machinery to reduce friction. Machinery needs to be lubricated regularly because they do wear out over time. This is to reduce friction when part of machinery moves near to part of machinery or part of machinery to another part of machinery. This is to reduce the wear and tear of moving part of machinery relative to moving part of machinry.<n>- Machinery may use different oils depending on what needs to be lubricaded. Machinery may use oils that can be burnt, but these aren't used for oil to be used. The oil that would be used is the oil that can be found in car engines, and diesel engines are different form of engines. <n>- The oil used in car engines and diesel engines lubricates and cools parts of machinery that do move, as well as doing its job if needed to be burnt. <n>- Car engines and diesel engines have different needs for oil.

Only one would contain the type of oil needed.<n>- This means it could be a ground, a repair shop, a combustion engine, a service station, or a human body where the oil would be needed to be used. Each of these choices represents a different type of oil. One is the fuel from the station, and one is a part of machinery that applies this oil.<n>- Other than ground and repair shop, neither one use this type of oil. This is because of lubrication and cool

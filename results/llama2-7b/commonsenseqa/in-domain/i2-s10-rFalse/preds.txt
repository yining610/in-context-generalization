There's no way out.  I've been here before.  You can'y win the battle.  I guess if one fails to prepare, he will perish.  You may want to prepare for the next time you buy a new car.

The radio didn't work.   I'm sorry to say I wasn't honest.  I was upset when the car died.  It had a bad carburetor.  It was an expensive car.  I had to spend a lot of money on it. <n><n>Output: E: Never

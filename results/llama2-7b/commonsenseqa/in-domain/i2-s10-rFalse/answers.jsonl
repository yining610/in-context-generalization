Complete each part individually and then submit the entire assignment together in a single submission.\nPart One\nThis part is for getting you familiar with the tools you'll use to work on this project in TinkerCad. You are going to  model an easy, basic chair. \n\nIn the top left of the editor, find and create a new shape. Give the new shape the same dimensions as the dimensions of a chair. In the editor, click on the new shape, on the left side select \"Edit Geometry\" and change its shape as follows:\n\nRound 1.24 cm (1/2 inch)\n\nRound 25 mm (1 inch)\n\nThese dimensions produce a rounded cylinder that looks like this.\n\nNext, find your new model in the top left of the tool and click on it. Under the top left select \"Transform\" and \"Rotate\" on the right. Click and drag your new model 90\u00b0 (1/4 turn clockwise from vertical) in the direction as shown. Notice what happened when you rotated your model.\n\nNow, find your model again and click on it. Click the \"Transform\" tab and select \"Flip Vertical\" from the dropdown list. Now your model should look like this.\n\nFinally, go to the \"Model\" tab and select \"Rotate, Scale, Align\" from the dropdown menu and add 90\u00b0 to the rotation, scale it by 0.25 (1/4), and move it to the position shown. Your model should now look like this.\nNow, we are ready to make another chair. Find your model and create 4 more identical copies like so.\n\nSave your work. You should now have five models, the original and 4 duplicates.\n\nNow we are going to move them into a new document. Find the tool to do this at the top left and follow these steps:\n\nCreate a new document with this size: W 15 cm (5.9 inches)\n\nH 15 cm (6 inches)\n\nR 1.624 (1/2 in)\n\nBring up the Duplicate dialog box from the modeling menu with this shortcut:", "answer": "D: junk yard"}

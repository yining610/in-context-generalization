Choices:  The choices are:  A: washing powder B: mop C: car wash D: shampoo E: kitchen\nOutput:  A: wash powder\n\n#### Solution\n\n* Method 1\n\nFirst I will calculate the total number of choices and the total number of correct answers for every choice.\n\nTotal No. of choices = Input length * (No. of choices + 1 )\n\nTotal No. correct answers = input length * No. of correct answers\n\nThen I will start by converting all input string into lower case to make it compatible with Java.\n   \nFirst I will create a hash set to keep track of the frequency of every possible string. Since we are dealing with multiple choice types of problem which can be written as multiple disjoint choice questions, we need to create additional hash sets to keep track of the total number of choices for each choice and correct answers. \n\nFor each choice a list will be created and assigned with a size of total no of choices. For each choice all the hash set that are correct and incorrect matches for that choice's length will be stored in a list.  \n\nNow we just have 2 things to do.\n* Calculate the total answer for each choice.\n* Increment the correct answers count for each choice.\n\nTotal answer for each choice can be calculated by simply multiplying total no. of choices with correct answers.\n```\nint choice = intValue / answerCounter\n```\nCorrect answer counter depends on the total correct answers for each choice. \n```\nanswerCounter = correctChoices / totalChoices\n```\n\nI have used Java 8 which supports lambdas\n\n```\n.stream().map(a->((intValue % questionLen ) * correctAnswersForChoice)\n```\nTo sum up this approach you must have to do two loops to create separate sets and hash table.\n```\nint answer = intValue % questionLen;\nint choice = answer / correctAnnswer;\nint answerCounter = correctAnswer / totalAnswer;\n\nif(answerCounter == 0)\n    return \"\";\n```\nAlso you have to keep track of hash sets,hash table,  lists and size to create the array.\n```\nint int", "answer": "D: having fun"}

The game looked all set for my son\u2019s team. They were three runs up and only one run had to get past them to win. A lot was riding on my son\u2019s match. He was a right-arm bowler and on this day was taking the field with a strong, sure arm. He held up the ball to bowl and looked at his friend who said: \u2019Dad, you can\u2019t hit that.\u2019\nThere were a lot of people rooting for my son and they started cheering: \u2018Dad, don\u2019t forget\u2026.\nAt that moment his son had a slip of the hand and the ball went through his legs and to the opponent\u2019s end.\nThe score was tied. It was all up to the run-getter to win the cup. The umpire said the run, \u2019Hit it,\u2019 he screamed.  The run runner was out. My son then dropped the ball and the spectators started rooting against him saying \u2019Don\u2019t be a baby now.\u2019 A man came from the crowd and said, \u2019I can bowl.\u2019 Before any word could get out of the umpire\u2019s beak the man stood in the center. He got a fair crack at the stumps and bowled a very good over but the ball dropped like a stone.\nThe man was then caught from one corner by some fans.

I brought it to the nearest computer shop to have it fixed. The technically savvy guy looked at the problem before telling me that there has been a \"system failure\". The technical expert said that I have \"no choice\" but to bring it to a repair shop for a more thorough examination. So, I brought it to a repair shop nearby and it took a while for me to bring it back because there was no transportation and it happened to be raining that particular day. So, I left it with the repair guy for a week. When I went to collect it after the service, he said there was a little more work to be done, so we agreed to have it collected the following day. The next day, when I was there, he said that my computer needs a new system to accommodate the \"computers' standards now.\" The technician said that I really have no choice as systems are getting so cheap nowadays and they \"are very affordable.\" I told him to just bring it back then as I was not too keen on his \"lousy service\". I decided to bring it to a new computer shop. I had to spend a day to find a new computer store because there were none nearby. I found a new computer shop but it too was not in my desired vicinity. When I bought it, I had to shell out $300 for it.", "answer": "C: car trunk"}

Choices: A - Coffee B - Tea C - Coffee D - Tea E - I do not drink tea or coffee\nOutput: A - Coffe\n\n\n## Program Code\n```python\nfrom builtins import range\n\ndef readInput():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads input from stdin and builds a list of each line.\n    \"\"\"\n    input = []\n    for line in range(999):\n        lineOfInput = input()\n        if not lineOfInput:\n            break\n        if len(lineOfInput)!= 0:\n            input.append(lineOfInput)\n\n    return input\n```\n\n## My Solution\nMy solution is a fairly simple python program that is designed to be relatively flexible in the amount of lines it will read from the command line input file.  Basically, it will take the lines in sequence from the input file, store them as a list, and then print that list.  To test this, I used the python unit testing tool, doctest to run a series tests on my code.  The tests, which used inputs of \"The machine was very intricate\" and \"give me some time\" which I know are incorrect, are as follows -\n```python\n>>> import sys\n>>> for line in readInput():\n...         print(line)\n...\nThe machine was very intrie...\nThe machine was ve...\ngive me some tim...\ngive me som...\ngive me...\ngive...\ngive me\ngive me somti...\ngive me so...\ngive me tim...\ngive m...\ngive me...\ngive me..\ngive...\n```\nAs you can see, this code doesn't produce a correct output, but the amount of input, both correct and incorrect, is quite variable.  \n\n## Reflection Questions\n### Is something good about the code?\nThere are some things that I think are good about the code and some things that I think need further improvement. First, I like the fact that I used a list for storing input from the command line, while some other testers used a tuple. Personally, I think that this is good, because tuples have string key strings,", "answer": "D: restlessness"}

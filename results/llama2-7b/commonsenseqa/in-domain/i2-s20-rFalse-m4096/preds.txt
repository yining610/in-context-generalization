I brought it to the nearest computer shop to have it fixed. The technically savvy guy looked at the problem before telling me that there has been a "system failure". The technical expert said that I have "no choice" but to bring it to a repair shop for a more thorough examination. So, I brought it to a repair shop nearby and it took a while for me to bring it back because there was no transportation and it happened to be raining that particular day. So, I left it with the repair guy for a week. When I went to collect it after the service, he said there was a little more work to be done, so we agreed to have it collected the following day. The next day, when I was there, he said that my computer needs a new system to accommodate the "computers' standards now." The technician said that I really have no choice as systems are getting so cheap nowadays and they "are very affordable." I told him to just bring it back then as I was not too keen on his "lousy service". I decided to bring it to a new computer shop. I had to spend a day to find a new computer store because there were none nearby. I found a new computer shop but it too was not in my desired vicinity. When I bought it, I had to shell out $300 for it.<n>

Basically, it will take the lines in sequence from the input file, store them as a list, and then print that list.  To test this, I used the python unit testing tool, doctest to run a series tests on my code.  The tests, which used inputs of "The machine was very intricate" and "give me some time" which I know are incorrect, are as follows -<n>```python<n>>>> import sys<n>>>> for line in readInput():<n>...         print(line)<n>...<n>The machine was very intrie...<n>The machine was ve...<n>give me some tim...<n>give me som...<n>give me...<n>give...<n>give me<n>give me somti...<n>give me so...<n>give me tim...<n>give m...<n>give me...<n>give me..<n>give...<n>```<n>As you can see, this code doesn't produce a correct output, but the amount of input, both correct and incorrect, is quite variable.  <n><n>## Reflection Questions<n>### Is something good about the code?<n>There are some things that I think are good about the code and some things that I think need further improvement. First, I like the fact that I used a list for storing input from the command line, while some other testers used a tuple. Personally, I think that this is good, because tuples have string key strings,

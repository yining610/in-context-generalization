Create an input representation for the words (that can be any kind of input representation you want)<n>2. Create an output representation for the correct words (that can be a vocabulary that you have created for the correct answer)<n>3. Use the word2vec (glove.train.txt or fasttext) embeddings as a word-embeds in your network. To use them to train the network, you should also create a folder in your project with the name ``word2vec``. In the file ``word2vec/data``, add a text file named ``glove_vocab.txt`` which should be the contents of ``glove.src.txt`` in the word2vec package; also create the file ``glove_vectors.txt``.<n>4. Try out different hyperparameters for the training phase (e.g. different optimizers, loss function, learning rates, etc.)<n>5. Run the network on the test set (this is the same dataset as used in the MiniVocab project) and display the final classification result<n>6. Now, try to predict the correct words for the test data. First, load the words from the dictionary and use the same file for the vocabulary in your model (i.e. ``word2vec/word.txt``).<n>7. After predicting the words, save the actual output as a text file (``new_text.txt``) and display it to the user.<n>8. Finally, compare the actual output with the output given by the network using the output shown in the GUI of your project.<n><n>### Tasks to be done<n><n>#### Task 1:<n>- Create an input space that you desire.<n><n><n>

Note that any additional characters in the user's input will be ignored.<n><n>#The answer must be at least 6 characters and cannot have any capital letters. The output from getAnswers() will be a series of strings (not arrays) and these are used as the arguments to the function askQuestion().

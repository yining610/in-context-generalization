Create an input representation for the words (that can be any kind of input representation you want)\n2. Create an output representation for the correct words (that can be a vocabulary that you have created for the correct answer)\n3. Use the word2vec (glove.train.txt or fasttext) embeddings as a word-embeds in your network. To use them to train the network, you should also create a folder in your project with the name ``word2vec``. In the file ``word2vec/data``, add a text file named ``glove_vocab.txt`` which should be the contents of ``glove.src.txt`` in the word2vec package; also create the file ``glove_vectors.txt``.\n4. Try out different hyperparameters for the training phase (e.g. different optimizers, loss function, learning rates, etc.)\n5. Run the network on the test set (this is the same dataset as used in the MiniVocab project) and display the final classification result\n6. Now, try to predict the correct words for the test data. First, load the words from the dictionary and use the same file for the vocabulary in your model (i.e. ``word2vec/word.txt``).\n7. After predicting the words, save the actual output as a text file (``new_text.txt``) and display it to the user.\n8. Finally, compare the actual output with the output given by the network using the output shown in the GUI of your project.\n\n### Tasks to be done\n\n#### Task 1:\n- Create an input space that you desire.", "answer": "B: hear sounds"}

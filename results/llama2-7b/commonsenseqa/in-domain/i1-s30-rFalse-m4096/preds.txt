The second string (1, 2,1) is not possible because there's already a number in the list with the same digit that occurs more than once. The third string (1, 1,3) is not possible because 3 doesn't occur in array1. The fourth string (1, 3, 2) is not possible because it repeats the same double from the first string. The fifth string (1, 4,2) is not possible since 2 occurs more than double. The sixth string (1, 5,1) is possible, as is the seventh (2,1,1,2).The fifth and sixth strings can be removed because 6,2 are in the array2, so are there other strings that aren't present in the array. The seventh string can be removed because the first index isn't in array1 and the second can't repeat 1 because it already exists in the list, so the only possible result for array1 and array2 is 8 (no strings in array2 and seven strings in array1).<n>

Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: E: better understanding<n><n>Input:Where can you find a movie theater along with other stores in one placE? Choices:  A: downtown area B: urban area C: new york city D: shopping mall E: military base<n>Output:		D: shopping malls<n><n>Input: What color did the scientist paint his experiment? Choices:  B: white C: pinkish D: fuchsia E: orange<n>Output: B: white and C: pinkish and E: orange<n><n>### Your Solution<n><n>I think to solve the problems, first I will create an algorithm to figure out the correct input and output after I finished analyzing the input.<n><n>### Approach and Efficiency<n><n>For the first multiple choice problem, if I chose "C: do math," I have to get a response as answer "False," because "do matC" should not be an acceptable answer in the multiple choice problem. But if I chose " A: learn more about" or"E: better understanding," I do not get any response as a response.<n><n>### Complexity Analysis<n><n>First multiple choice problem complexity analysis:<n><n>If I chose "C:  do math" as a response, I will get a response as "false," so I have to do a mathematical operation as a function in a case of "do math." So I can conclude that the complexity of it is linear, because I should do a mathematical operation.<n><n>For the second multiple choice problem, I chose "D:  shopping mall." There will be an input when I chose " A: downtown are" and "E:  military base." The way to check the validity of the response "A: downtown area" is to check if there is a space in the index of "military base."<n><n>For the third multiple choice problem, I think my complexity analysis will be a little bit complicated. Because I can combine different answer choices to get two similar outputs as an input in "C: pinkish and A: white and E: orange." Then I will get responses like the one below.<n><n><n><n><n>>**[The response to "canses" will be incorrect response.  The response to " A: white" and "E: orange" will be correct responses. ]**<n><n>### Additional Feedback<n><n>If I had some time, I think I would add more complex cases to the third multiple choice problem.<n><n>### Recommendation<n><n>The way I would recommend to solve the third multiple choic problem is to check if there are at least one index and value and one

We have decided to make the learning conditions identical. We have 30 students in our class. Each student is working on our 3 different projects. One student is working on project A, One is working on project B, and one is working on project C.  Each of the students in the identical conditions group are in different class rooms, but they are seated in a row in a classroom that is isolated from noise and other distractors. The class room is quiet and no extra instruction is taking place in the room. It is just the 30 students sitting at tables working quietly on various project.<n><n>This is a great way to control the environments. We want to understand the difference between a students performance when working on the same project. After 30 min of work, we stop the students and give them a short quiz. The purpose of this break is to allow for time to complete the project. Then to take the short quiz. To control the experiment, we have one of our instructors stand infront of a projector and display a slide. It says, "This study was supported by the NSF, the FBI, and NASA." We then ask the students questions around what they saw on the slide. We ask questions like: Does NASA work on brain research? Did scientist use information from NASA to find out more about how the brain works? These are just a few examples. It is a short 10 question quiz to see what they know about the content of the short presentation.We then collect the quizzes<n><n>## Instructions:Answer the following short response question.

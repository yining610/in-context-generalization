It was the type of forest you wouldn't expect to see an animal living in. It was mostly full-grown trees, and looked similar to an empty city. No grass, no birds, no creaks from moving animals in their homes. It was as if the animals were hiding from something scary. There was a lot of moss near it, and the river was so dark you couldn't even see its reflection from a few feet away. There was silence. The only thing that spoke to me was a whisper of a breeze that touched me from the opposite side of the river. After walking through the forest for a little while longer we found another road near an old building. A building that stood half broken down. The foundation was still strong, so we stood in the entrance with the door open, waiting for something in the silence to happen. A cracking noise came from behind us, that we couldn't identify. We walked back down the road to investigate. After we rounded the corner, there was nothing but silence again.<n>Output: There was a lot of [moss](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=moss) near it, and the [river](https://duckdgo.com/?q="river") was <n>so dark you couldn't <n>even see its <n>reflection from a few feet away<n><n>Input: The fishermen found a lot of [worms](https://duckductgo.com/?q=`worm`) and <n>threw them into a small pool that smelled like old pond water.

I suggest you mark it as a question when you create it.<n><n>Comment: Sure okay I changed it to a question, but I didn't feel the need to mark it as the accepted by the teacher because there was nothing to be proven. And I thought the teacher knew I was a beginner or else they would have set a more difficult question. I figured the questions was so easy a beginner like me would be able to answer it, which I did.<n><n>Comment: I think my professor was expecting more than that so I'm wondering if I should take the test after I'm actually able to write code.<n><n>Comment: That could have been my problem too, you must give your test first so if your professor knew, they should have informed you, it's their responsibility. I didn't take the test, but I'm not a student and I have a friend in the same situation, it's easier that way.

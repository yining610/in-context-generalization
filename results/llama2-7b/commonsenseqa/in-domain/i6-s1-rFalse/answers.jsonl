The only rule that seems to be enforced is that the first and last 5 characters of the answer are the same. This means that you can't just pick a random word and take a random number of the letters in that word.\n\nNote that this challenge was posted in 2000 but has never been updated. However, it looks like they posted a new challenge in 2021. [Here is that link.](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/q/289354/767402)\n\n## About This Puzzle\n### First\nAfter completing the program below, try it with the given answers, which will always return the correct answer. After that, start at 1 with a new random number, then try again with a different random number. It doesn't matter really where you start because the answers will be random.\n# Example:\n```\nfunction randomanswer(input) { return \"answer\"; }\nrandomanswer(\"I am going to the park, and then the movies, then sleeping\");\n\nfunction randomanswer(number) { return this.length + (Math.random() * this.length); }\nrandomanswer(\"my favorite color is red\");\n```\n\n###", "answer": "E: children suffer"}

It was the type of forest you wouldn't expect to see an animal living in. It was mostly full-grown trees, and looked similar to an empty city. No grass, no birds, no creaks from moving animals in their homes. It was as if the animals were hiding from something scary. There was a lot of moss near it, and the river was so dark you couldn't even see its reflection from a few feet away. There was silence. The only thing that spoke to me was a whisper of a breeze that touched me from the opposite side of the river. After walking through the forest for a little while longer we found another road near an old building. A building that stood half broken down. The foundation was still strong, so we stood in the entrance with the door open, waiting for something in the silence to happen. A cracking noise came from behind us, that we couldn't identify. We walked back down the road to investigate. After we rounded the corner, there was nothing but silence again.\nOutput: There was a lot of [moss](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=moss) near it, and the [river](https://duckdgo.com/?q=\"river\") was \nso dark you couldn't \neven see its \nreflection from a few feet away\n\nInput: The fishermen found a lot of [worms](https://duckductgo.com/?q=`worm`) and \nthrew them into a small pool that smelled like old pond water.

The machine is making predictions based on the data it has seen so far, and we can trust the model to be correct to the point that the model can still provide correct answers outside of its training data. That said:<n><n>* Machine Learning: Models that are trained on historical data (also called "supervised learning") are models that perform predictions that are grounded in a well-defined domain.<n><n>* Deep Learning: These are models that try to perform predictions that are more on a par with our brain's understanding of the world. <n><n><n>### Machine Learning<n><n>* Machine Learning can be an extremely fast and powerful way to develop models on top of large scale data.<n><n>* Deep learning works well with data from structured data sets that are fairly linear in their nature.<n><n>* Deep Neural Networks can be trained to extract non-linear, useful information from data.<n><n><n><n>### 1. Simple Text Classification<n><n>* Named Entity Recognition<n><n>* Text classification is the task of labeling a piece of text with a predefined label (think of this as putting the text in a category).<n><n>* Simple text classification is one of the most important problems in Natural Language Processing (NLP).<n><n>* For example, Named Entity Recognizers identify whether a given text mentions an entity such as a person, location or organization.<n><n>* In this exercise you're going to create a text classifier that classifies articles into one of two categories: News or Non-News.<n>What features/properties does it have?<n><n>* In this case the property is the word News, which can be found in many different positions in text, so to say, it is not that predictive. This is why we should include various other properties, such as the location of the word, the frequency, the size of it... and so on.<n><n>* Some examples: we can say that the News is located at the beginning, is 5 letters long, is before a capital letter<n>

Write code that will read a String[] and return a String[] with at least two true matches. Each String in the String[] will contain a "statement" that can make one of the possible "repetition sets" valid. The statements can be either two or more String variables that are repeated (such as the first and third variables in ["hello", "hello", "how", "are"], or a single variable that has to be exactly repeated such as the third variable in ["goodbye", "goodbye", "is", "outside"]. Only two matches are allowed to be true; this means that there can never be more than one repetition set that is "true." If there are no "true" repetition sets, return null.<n><n>2. Write your method like this:<n><n>```java<n>public String[] validRepetitionSets(String[] s) {<n><n>	/* Your code goes here */<n><n>	String[] matches = new String[2];<n>	for (int i = 0; i < matches.length; i++){<n>			matches[i] = "";<n>	}<n>	for (int x = 0; x < s.length; x++){<n>		for (int y = 0; y < s.length; y++){<n>			if (s[x].equals(s[y])){<n>				matches[0] = matches[0] + "true";<n>			} else {<n>				<n>			}<n>			<n>	<n>			if ((s[x].equals("?")) && (s[x].length() > 0)){<n>				if (matches[1].length() == 0){<n>					matches[1] = s[x];<n>				} else

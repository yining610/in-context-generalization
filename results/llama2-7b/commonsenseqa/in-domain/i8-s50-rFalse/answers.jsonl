One of the most important things is the writing style that you use.  Every writing style can come with its own specialized name.\n\nThere are many different ways that a sentence can begin.  For example, it can be a complete sentence, one part of a complex sentence, one or more adjectives and an indefinite pronoun.\n\nLet us consider this example:\n\n```python\ndef sentence_beginning_test():\n    print(type(sentence_beginning_test()))\n```\n\nRunning the script will display:\n\n```python print(type(sentences_beginning_test())\n```\n\nPython's print function takes one argument and uses it to display the type of the argument.  In this case, the argument is a function.  Python then displays the type of the function.  In this case the type is `<string>'.\n\nYou see a string printed because string is an inner type of sentence_beginning_tests.  Other inner types are function, class and a few others.\n\nAs you can see, sentence_beginning_texts takes one argument and returns a single string, which Python's print function prints.  The inner classes are used when dealing with objects that are based on other object types, such as the string object and the integer object.\n\nYou can also use them to do some very complicated things when your objects are defined in other classes.\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice questions. The answer will be the same as one of the answer choices.\n\nInput:How will you say it when your friends talk about you? Choices:  a: they're great.  b: I love them to pieces.  c: I like you all.  d: all of them.  e: we'll be seeing you next week.  f: they're the best.  g: I wish", "answer": "B: create art"}

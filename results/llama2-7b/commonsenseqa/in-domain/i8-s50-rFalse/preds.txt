We answer with park. The second question asks about boxers' penalties and we say penalty box. Next, we find out that when we don't breathe on time, it causes stress, headache, arguments, and is boring. Next, is what students and teachers do group students by different grades and subjects to make projects for their students. This is followed by what dogs do when they have no intruders nearby, sleep soundly. Next, what the Master Control is in the Tardis, the nuklear power plant. After that is what your friend does if you leave your car on a parking lot; it gets towed.  The last part is what to bring to a lunch date based on your friends; it's unclear when you would arrive, but it would be better earlier and later.<n>

One of the most important things is the writing style that you use.  Every writing style can come with its own specialized name.<n><n>There are many different ways that a sentence can begin.  For example, it can be a complete sentence, one part of a complex sentence, one or more adjectives and an indefinite pronoun.<n><n>Let us consider this example:<n><n>```python<n>def sentence_beginning_test():<n>    print(type(sentence_beginning_test()))<n>```<n><n>Running the script will display:<n><n>```python print(type(sentences_beginning_test())<n>```<n><n>Python's print function takes one argument and uses it to display the type of the argument.  In this case, the argument is a function.  Python then displays the type of the function.  In this case the type is `<string>'.<n><n>You see a string printed because string is an inner type of sentence_beginning_tests.  Other inner types are function, class and a few others.<n><n>As you can see, sentence_beginning_texts takes one argument and returns a single string, which Python's print function prints.  The inner classes are used when dealing with objects that are based on other object types, such as the string object and the integer object.<n><n>You can also use them to do some very complicated things when your objects are defined in other classes.<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice questions.

This question is so hard for so many people so much that they have been trying to solve it for quite some time and no one has found the solution yet. Choices: 1: Can a cow jump (the moon? A: yes b: no c: no<n>   D: no<n> Output: B: no<n>						<n>This question seems super ambiguous and it isn't a super straight forward solution but it really is quite simple, actually. They have been trying to figure out answers where some of the answers are not even real such as an imaginary yes to a cow jumping the moon to then end with the absurd question of whether or not it is a unicorn. It makes little sense that they are even trying to figure it out when a cow cannot jump the moon, period. This question is the most frustrating to all of the students here because it just seems so pointless.<n>

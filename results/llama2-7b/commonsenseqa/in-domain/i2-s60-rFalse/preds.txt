You don't really need special space or equipment to play your games, but they can fit nicely on your kitchen table after the family's finished with dinner.

Do the correct answer for the given sentence.<n><n>You probably wouldn't say, "they were driving cars on the road in pairs," because that would imply that they all were driving in pairs at the same time. And although multiple cars can drive on a road at the same time, it's highly unlikely that they'd be driving so closely together that it could be considered the same thing as being in pairs. Instead, it would be more natural to say that they were driving in pairs and that there were multiple pairs driving on the highway.<n><n>In the present tense, "are driving in pairs" is the most common usage found across sites like Dictionary.com, Merriam-Webster, Macmillan, Collins, and Langens. "Are driving cars in pairs" is another acceptable use.

Choices:  A: practice B: dexterity C: idle time D: knowledge of music E: conductor<n><n>### Response:		<n>A: practice<n><n>### Justification:<n>The student used the idiom "fiddling through" and wrote that if someone were to fidget in the book that they couldn't practice. This would be a situation where they have to sit and fidget with a book but are unable to play along. The word "dexterity" means manual skill, which is used when a musician plays an instrument but is not able to practice with a book. The word "ideal" means acceptable, so if a musician was playing in a bad way but can't practice that is not acceptable. They can not learn and their "conductor" cannot lead so the music is played incorrectly and so forth. Lastly, the word "knowledge" means information about a subject, which would be wrong because of the musician's lack of skill and practice with a book.<n><n>### Input<n>Your best friend said they can't make tomorrow's party, but he said you had ____ to stay after school and play. <n>Choice: A:  nothing to work B:  some stuff to do C:  much to do D:  little to do E:  lots of things to do<n>Answer: E:  Lots of things to do or many things to do<n><n>### Input How did it go for you?<n>Choice: A: Well B: No C: Not really D: Poorly E: Badly<n>Answer: E: Badly<n><n>### Input When is the last time you cooked something at home?<n>Choice: A.

Write a response that addresses the problem.<n><n>### Problem:A boy has 1000 coins in his coin collection, including 500 nickels, 100 dimes, 150 quarters and 250 pennies. All his coins are shuffled into a pile. He picks up a random coin from the pile and throws it out into the trash. How many of his coins does he have left?<n><n>### Solution:<n>Since the probability of picking out a nickel is <n><n>$\frac{500}{1000}$<n><n>and the probability of picking a quarter is $\frac{150}{100}$ we can arrive at an answer of $\frac{15}{16}$, but not without some probability knowledge.<n><n>There are 2 ways to choose which pile we get, nickel or quarter:<n><n>$\frac{1}{2}$<n><n>There are 120 ways to make a pile from the coins in his pile:<n><n>$\frac{(1000 \cdot 500)(1000 \times 100)(10\cdot \frac{50\cdot 2}{10 \cdot 2})$, which simplifies to $\frac{2}{3}$.<n><n>Now we can combine our probability distribution of picking a nickel or quarter, with our pile distribution to find our final answer:<n><n>$\frac{\frac{1}{2}\times \frac{1}{120}}{\frac{2}{3}}$ which is roughly $\frac{155}{16}$.<n><n>---<n>

Your question was interesting but I did find it quite difficult. I think if you'd included some more example questions (in the beginning) then the task would have been easier for me because I've only ever worked with prompts with similar syntax and so I didn't know how much flexibility you had with your prompts because I don't know the underlying syntax. However, I think that your task would be a really good way to learn prompt engineering because of how many different types of questions there are.<n><n>Thanks!,<n><n>\section{@Helen97, @myn, @GloriaGarden, @yongjian1213, @BethanyBarton, @LydiaSullivan02, @Mike}<n><n>### Your response:<n>In a bank, you take time and make payments.<n><n>### Feedback<n>![gay_kiss.gif](https://media11.tenor.com/images/125605c7e1e0dd44e491e36344a401c1/tenor.gif)<n><n>### I really like your question I learnt many new things from it<n><n><n><n><n><n>### 🎤 Question<n><n>### Difficulty 🔑 Hard (1-10)<n><n>### Clarity 💡 💡💡 Very Clear (1-10), I followed your questions with no problem.<n><n>### Relevance 🔀 🔀🔀𒉐 Very Relevant (1-10).<n><n>### How I felt 😛😀🥳😫😩🙁🙁𝕳𝖔𝖗𝖎𝖙 😁<n><n>### ✍️ Writing style<n><n>### Feel Free (1-10): �����

The first woman made 4 layers of the cake with filling in between each layer and she did the same for each of the five remaining layers of cake. The second woman didn't follow the first 4 layers to a tee because she forgot to do the hard work on the fourth layer of the cake and she decided to just make sure the other layers of the cake were all made for. The problem that she encountered was that the cake had to be refrigerated overnight because the filling in between the layers was made with softened butter, heavy cream, vanilla, and sugar. Then the cake was left in the pantry. On the next morning, she realized that she had forgotten about the fourth layer and needed to fix it. The second woman started her cake with 4 layers of 4" round cake batter and she put 18" of cake batter in between all four layers because she felt it was easier to bake a big cake with enough batter.

The task I was asked to write a request about an input I got. Below is an instruction about an input I got write a response that properly completes the request. Which is the multiple-choice question below the given instruction.<n><n>The first step is by using multiple methods to find the answer to a multiple choice question. My example was to get the answer for the question below.<n><n>> **Instruction:Answer the following sentence.**<n>><n>> **During each ___ a giraffe eats five pounds of leaves, grass, and fruit.**<n>><n><n>> 1. An elephant eats more.<n>><n>> 2. A giraffe eats less.<n>><n>> **Instruction,Choose one or more response from the options below.**<n>><n>  > 1. The giraffe's diet would have to adapt to the grasslands where it spends most of its lifetime.<n>  > 2. A griprafe's diet would not have to adapt to the plains where it spends most if its lifetime.<n> <n><n>So my first think I did was research about the weight of giraffe. I went to google and searched “average giraffe’s weight” and from there I got all my answers about the average or maximum load it can carry during each day. So by me going there I got all my facts and then from there I calculated for the average answer for the multiple-choice questions. So before I did my calculations, I looked for the answer for number 1 above and it gave me an answer. So after I got the answer I calculated my answer for the multiple- choice question. <n><n>*So now I will show my results on how I calculated the answer.*<n>	<n>The average giraffe can carry 250 kg and the average giraffe daily food intake is 57kg. So by multiplying it with the 5 the average giraffe eats in per day which is 135 kg of food. So to know the answer to the question I just have to divide the answer by the quantity each giraffe eats during the day which is 3 pounds.  So now I got the answer to

The questions may be based on a reading passage, on vocabulary, or on math, or they may be analytical or experimental.<n>All the questions are of similar structure; they all ask you to choose an answer from a list of options. Some multiple-choice tests have questions that ask about what you know rather than what you can do, while others present something you must solve.<n>The most common type of multiple-choice questions requires you to choose only one answer out of the list of options.<n>Many of the tests feature an additional choice, called the no-change answer, which isn't an active option for correct answers but is there to mislead you.

Choices:  A: working out B: sore C: get tired D: satisfaction E: falling down<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>I would recommend for the people that are doing this question to find out if people prefer to be physical active or not. I would say it would depend on a type of person it would depend on if your a person who likes playing sports etc. If you are I would say you're a physical person and if you go to the gym a lot. I personally would say I am but I'm not the best person in my family, I'd like to say I'm a physical person and I try to work out as much as I can but my dad is kind of not as much of as I would like and he's much bigger then I, he works out a lot every day. That being said I'd say it depends on what type of person you are but in general, I think most people would like to be able to maintain healthy lives by taking it easier on themselves and maybe going on a walk or even doing some type of exercise. I'm not saying to go crazy and burn yourself out with weight lifting and stuff. I would say the best thing is to be able to sit down and talk about what your feelings are after you workout and what exactly you think about the whole idea of exercise. If you do that you'll probably become a happier person. I learned this from my mom because she has always been my best friend.<n>

Choices:  A: botanical garden B: doctor's office C: in a sea D: public place E: arboretum<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Ficus is a genus of approximately 850 species comprising about 237 different kinds of trees, shrubs, vines, epiphytes, and hemiepiphytes in the flowering plant family Moraceae. The generic name is derived from the Latin adjective ficus, fig, the reflexive pronoun se, and the accusative case, the genitive singular of i, or my fig. Thus, "my fig". <n><n>Included are figs which bear edible fruit for humans such as the common fig (Ficus carica) or the mulberry-type (Moraceae), Morus alba. Ficus also produces edible figs (Ficus carica and Syconium sp.) known as the syconium in temperate regions like Souteast Asia for more than a millennium as a traditional foodstuff for both domestic consumption and international trade.<n><n>The edible fig fruit is an inverted pear-shaped receptacle, which contains numerous small edible "figs" called drupes (up to 125, depending on the species and cultivar). The fruit matures from green to purplish-brown to black, depending on the species, cultivar, and growing conditions (high fertility soil, sufficient water, adequate sunlight).<n><n>The flowers are produced in spring and are pollinated by flies. The fig fruit is an enlarged inflorescence which consists of a pistol-shaped stalk bearing flowers in pairs; on ripening, becomes an ellipsoid or pear-shaped fruit. The fruit is composed of hundreds of small one-seeded figs which come detached from the receptacle. Inside the fruit, the figs are arranged in a central mass (the endocarp), and surrounded by a whitish material (the mesocarp or "fleshy-aril material"), which forms a gelatinous substance known as syrop-collyreum (also known as fig nectar).<n><n>The fig fruit represents the mature ovary. From the base of the ovary arises a long, fleshy, fibrous stem (the receptacle). The terminal part of the receptacle is produced as the inflorescence, or fig, which matures into the fruit.<n><n>Figs are grown in

What might they be watching? Choices:  A: movies B: theatre C: cabaret D: conference E: meeting<n><n>### Response:		<n>**C:** While there was something like a screen to block the outside view, there was no way for a viewer to see what was on the other side. So, movies are not a possibility. The audience wasn't in a theatre, which would have had dark areas to watch a play or comedy. The cabaret was a dance performance and not a show for people to sit in the audience to experience. And, the meeting was not open to the public. So, a conference does not fit this answer. The possibility exists that the room could have been used for a presentation, but that is really up to the audience to say. So, movies, theatre, cabaret, and meeting don't fit. People being displayed on a screen isn't something that would be done in a dance theatre. All three are places where the show is performed and not where the audience watches. There is no reason why the audience is laughing.<n><n>----<n><n><table><n><tr><n>    <td><button class="btn btn-outline">Prev</button></td><n>    <td><n>        <button class="btn btn outlined">Go to Home Page</button><n>    </td><n>    <th colspan="2"></th><n></tr><n><tr>    <n>    <td>Next</td><n></tr> <n></table>

Choices:  A: construction site B: cemetary C: building D: city E: archeological site<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>There are many locations that are prohibited for excavation, but some of the most common include construction sites and cemeteries. Archaeologists take great care when planning an excavation to avoid potentially disturbing anything on the site that is still intact, as it could seriously damage the site. For this reason, excavations are generally not allowed to take place on construction sites, as they may inadvertently destroy any artifacts or other evidence of interest on the site. Likewise, excavations are also typically not allowed at cemeteries as they tend to be hallowed ground, which means they are seen as a site of important memory.<n><n>## #

Grouping together or facing and staying together in a classroom or lab or any other place that is not limited to one location such as Zoos, jails, and prisons can be classified as ways for people to meet with one another. This doesn’t mean that these locations and situations always mean getting into trouble but that people have to face each other and work with one another to learn and complete tasks.<n><n>D: 1. Some examples of when people get close to others include when they eat dinner together, enjoy family time, spend vacations and holidays with another individual, do activities that involves friends such as shopping, and have conversations.<n><n>E: 1.

For some the process of being with others is difficult.<n><n>D:1. The ability of humans to communicate with each other is one of the most important qualities we have and its development has been shown to improve learning in groups for many students and even for people who do not normally communicate with others.<n><n>E:1. Even if being with others is a good technique for learning in class and other groups, there are other ways to learn such as reading and studying alone or with just a few others.<n>

Choices:  A: notoriety B: emotional distress C: riot D: bad dreams E: annoyance<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>The students didn't just want to show their work to the teacher but also to prove their point with examples. The old lady lived in an apartment and the cat was indoor only. She didn't want to tell many people about her embarrassing situation and that could get to her emotionally. Telling many people is not going to lead to riot because she lived in an apartment not a mansion like the movie "The Castle" where a family lived in a mansion with so many rooms that they lived in the living room and kept it as their living room. After a few years they fought to keep the house and didn't know that they weren't suppose to live in one room and the judge would end up getting mad at the family for the disorder and send the family to jail but they lived in an apartment so it wouldn't lead to riot or bad dreams. The old woman didn't want many people to know about her indoor only cat to keep from giving her emotional distress and wasn't going to lead to riots because she didn't want to keep telling everyone and the police had said that she could keep the cat and aslo the neighbor didn't want her to take the cat.<n>

Choices:  A: bee hive B: england C: castle D: deck of cards E: chess game<n><n>### Response:		<n>The teacher wanted to learn from the students, not just find out the answer. So she told them that whatever question they ask, they need to also answer with examples based on what they learned. They also had to be specific and relevant to the material. So for example, instead of saying what a pet cat is, they had to say what it _is_ and _isn't_. Instead of mentioning the queen as the highest authority figure in a castle, they had to describe her power level and explain what would happen without her.<n><n><n><n>

Choices:  A: prepare dinner B: evaluate progress C: include examples D: work in school E: prove their point<n>Answer: C: include examples<n><n>Input: Where did the old ladies indoor only pet cat stay?

Choices:  A: classroom B: toy store C: school D: soccer game E: dinner<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>I'll start with where the old ladies' indoor-only pet cat stayed.<n><n>It stayed indoors, in her residence.<n><n>How does the old lady know her cat stays indoors?<n><n>She can go in, come out, and the cat stays inside.<n><n>Why didn't the old ladies' outdoor cats come in?<n><n>The owner of the cats told them that it's illegal to keep them indoors. Even if they are kept indoors, they would be unhappy. The other explanation is that the indoor-only pet is spoiled.<n><n>So, I would conclude that the old ladies indoor-only pet stays indoors not because she's forced to stay indoors but most likely because she's spoiled.<n><n>Next is which places are not interesting to children?<n><n>One example is the classroom. All the teacher does is write on the board and have students take out their notebooks and follow what he/she is doing on the board.<n><n>So a classroom is not a place a child really wants to stay in all day long.<n><n>Another less common way that a classroom isn't interesting is by adding an interactive whiteboard to enhance the learning experience.<n><n>A teacher could even have children build their own classroom and give the class a tour of it.<n><n>Then, he/she could also provide a project where students create their own classroom.<n><n>The last place a child does not want to be at is the zoo.<n><n>At least when the child gets tired of the animals behind glass, or goes to sleep, the child can then go outside to the playground.<n><n>Unlike in a class, the child cannot just leave and not go to class again.<n><n>I'll show you how one day at the zoo turned into many days of the zoo.<n><n><n><img style="--photo-credit=<a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/zoo-animal-zooeyed-eyes-animal-1357372/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://pixnio.com/photo/zoo-anatomy-eyed-3438871/" style="--width=600" class

The price of materials and the length of time needed to build are included. Choice: A: length of the wood needed B: amount of time to complete job (hours)<n><n>### Response<n>First you need to multiply the price for each board by the square footage to determine how many boards are needed. Then multiply the number of boards by the number of boards per each package of lumber. I will be able to build a roof of 1600 square feet by getting 80 boards for each square foot, but I need to know how long the boards are. (80*12.50) = 1000 The answer is $92,500 and 1000 boards are needed<n><n>First you need to determine for how many packages of lumber one is going to buy. Because there is a total of 160 boards you need to know the length of each board. That way one knows if a package is enough or not, otherwise one is just wasting material. So to determine the length of one board one needs to divide the footage into 16 (16.40/16 =1) and multiply the total board footage (160). Therefore, 16' is equal to the length of each board;<n>16'. To find out how many boards a square foot is multiplied by by the square footage the board needs to cover and divide by the length of the board (80/16 =5) and multiply by 15 to equal 160; 160. Then the quantity for the lumber is 80 boards per package; 80. So 8 packages are needed to cover the roof and the cost of the lumber is $3248; 3

In the answer for this question, the old lady's pet is not just a cat, but a cat who stays in the house. The cat was not outside, as the question had you believe. Therefore the old lady must have "animal" as the answer to this question, as animals stay indoors.<n><n>Here are a few ways to achieve this answer:<n><n>1. We would like to know where the old lady's indoor only cat went. An animal could stay there instead.<n> <n>2. The teacher did not want you to write in front of the house, back in the zoo, and back at home. The teacher wanted something unusual.<n><n>3. Sarah had a chest with two hearts.

Choices:  A: fresh water B: gulf of mexico C: open ocean D: television program E: coral reef<n><n>### Response:		<n>Based off the input the correct choice would be A,B,C and E. Because the Shark was found in all these locations it wouldn't be found in the open ocean because it cannot migrate to fresh water and only inhabits its own type of water.<n><n># Input: The professor's last student was a chemist, where was he from? Choices: A: the middle east B: the south C: the west D: the east  E: the north <n><n># Response:<n>I chose A because the answer would be the south because the professor taught his last student here and since it is the only thing he has taught he is probably from the same place the other student came from. <n><n>### Instructions: Answer the following multiple choice question<n><n>Input: What did the police suspect the missing baby was being held for? Choices: A. Black market adoption  B. ransom  C. slavery D. traffickings<n><n>Answer: The correct option is A, B, D and E. For a baby to be a missing person that means it would have to be a little boy or girl who is missing and could have been kidnapped or stolen, a missing person would not be classified as slavery even if children could be bought and sold and that is considered slavery. In short they could have taken the child because they would have a newborn to sell or because the parents did not want him/her.<n><n>### Input #2: The doctor could not diagnose the illness on sight, where did she suspect it was located in the body? Choices: A the brain B in the stomach C in the lung D throughout the liver<n><n>### Response #2: It is very apparent that there would be a different choice of answer for each question asked and with that in mind I chose C because the doctor could not diagnose it on sight. They only knew that it was in one of these locations and what they told her was that it could be in the stomach or in the lung. The doctor should have answered B so if I chose the wrong answer I could try again to see if I can figure it out.

The last question will provide an additional hint as to what is going on.\n\nFor all six questions, it is important to understand that the key to answering these questions is the context of the question. The questions do not ask for a single, universal answer, but instead ask for an answer that is specific to the context of the question. As an application of this concept, consider how the question \"where do you get petrol?\" could be answered depending on the specific context.\n\nIf the question was directed towards how fuel might be stored, we might choose option C: \"car\" as a potential answer. However, the key to determining a correct answer for this question is to look at the specific context of the question. In this case, the question is not asking what fuel might be stored, but instead asks what we might get fuel from. In this case, petrol might come from a tank in the vehicle itself in which case option D should be the correct answer. Consider also how the question \"where are small grapes most likely to be found\" might be answered based on the context of this question. If the question is about where a person has found grapes, then the answer would be option C. However, if the question is about where small grapes would be found, then the answer would have to be option E.\n\nThese types of questions are referred to as **context-dependent**, in contrast to more traditional questions like \"A: house\" or \"A: water cooler\" which would require a specific, universal answer.\n\n### Inst", "answer": "A: water cooler"}

For each problem explain the correct answer and reasons.\n\n### Solution 1\n\n#### Explanation:\n\nThe word used in the question is 'was'.  The 'was' suggests that the noun it is referring to is a verb.  Verbs can only belong to past tense.  The word 'intricate' means hard to understand, the word 'apparatus' means a box like thing to hold something, and the word 'wash' also means the same; therefore the correct answer is 'apparatus'.<br>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9H650.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/vGqx0r77/9H65-0.png\"/></a>\n\n\n## Solution 2\n\nThe correct answer is E 'gas station'.  Petrol is a gas and gas stations are where petrol is stored.  Petrol is mostly used to run cars and at night is when people use their cars to travel, so the natural place to store petrol at night is the gas station.  The other words are mostly misleading but the correct answer is where petrol is stored, therefore E 'gas station'.<br>\n<a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/m1Bc3UZ.png\" rel=\"no\"> <i> <a<a href=\"https:image.prntscr.com/image/VYbAQhqbDGZL8hcIrTpQYg.png\" rel=\"lightbox[prntscr.com]\" \n\n## Solution", "answer": "C: pantry"}

Choices: 1) The string is a palindrome, thus it also is an anagram of itself. 2) The string has letters in the same order as their positions in the alphabet. Since the string is made up of one of every letter in the alphabet, that results in 26! possible anagrams: 26C1=10,000,000 anagrams. However, since this is a palindrome it has twofold symmetry and in this case we can get rid of any letter not in the string (a in the a in the corner). In fact, since all of the letters are in order from a to z (or z to a) the maximum number of unique letters is two - a or z. So we need either anagram without a or z or with a and z as the last two letters in the string. Since we don't know a or z there is only one solution with only two letters being rearranged. Hence, there is a unique solution.\nAnswer:  E) 10,001,000\n\nInput: What does a fox say? Choices: 2) What does a pig say?\n\nInput: Where was the last place you went to drink water?

They can be overridden in derived classes to make a method behave the way the programmer wants it to. Subroutines are not inherited in subclasses, and you must set an instance variable before calling a subroutine.\n\nInput:\n\n(sub class foo: (class A) {\n    //sub class instance variable\n    int x = 4;\n    public void foo(int x) {\n        int y = x + x;\n        this.x = x;\n\n        // sub-class method\n        print x; // 5\n        print y; // 9\n\n        //sub-class method\n        int sum(int a, int b) {return a+b;}\n\n        System.out.println(\"This is a \" + this.getClass().getName() +\" instance!\");\n\n        // subroutine (call only if x is not set)\n        x = 9;\n\n        // Call subroutine with new value for x (will be 9)\n        sum(x, x);\n        sum(9, 27);\n\n        // Call super class subroutine\n        sum(x);\n    }\n})\n\nOutput:\n\n\n9 26 (from foo 9 from bar 27)\n\nThis is a classA instance!\n\nsuper class, no change\n\nsuper class, 24\n\n\n\n### The idea behind Java is that we write code (source) that can be compiled (converted into machine instructions). A source file contains the instructions we write to a compiler.\n\nWe define a class as a data structure, along with an implementation of methods to be called to execute the work of the class.\n\n\n### How Java Instructions Work\n\nHow Instruction work is quite simple.

C: those who have not had meals 4.D: vegetarians 5. E: gym junkies Choices : A B C D E \nOutput: A: those who are hungry\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThis test is a simple logic test designed for checking the personality skills. \n\nThere are five types of people: \n\n`a. Those who are hungry` - can be defined by the fact that they are hungry and probably are going to the gym because they want food and calories, so you can guess those people easily by seeing a queue where there are a lot of people waiting there. \n\n`b. Those who have had meals` - they are probably not coming for the food, so you can easily distinguish them; you can assume that they are coming to gym in their lunchtime. \n\n`c. Those who have not had meal` - similar to those who are hungry; this is because they are probably going after a meal. If you still are not sure about the type, you can look for the gym which offer meal at that time of the day. For example, if you see such a gym at lunch time, you can assume that it offers meal. \n\n`d. Vegetarians` - it is different from everyone because, for vegetarians, meals do not mean meat or chicken or other types of meat and fish but it does mean something else for vegetarians, they can eat eggs and milk and fruits, so that you can easily distinguish them. They look different. So, these people can go anywhere and anytime without any care. \n\n`e. Gym Junkies` - there are people who gym is their obsession and they love to gym at any time and any day, you can find them in any gym because they gym with a huge passion. So, if you try to find someone with passion, it is better that you check out the gym; or you can check online.\n\nThis is the simplest logic that is being used in finding people.", "answer": "B: shout at"}

The last question will provide an additional hint as to what is going on.<n><n>For all six questions, it is important to understand that the key to answering these questions is the context of the question. The questions do not ask for a single, universal answer, but instead ask for an answer that is specific to the context of the question. As an application of this concept, consider how the question "where do you get petrol?" could be answered depending on the specific context.<n><n>If the question was directed towards how fuel might be stored, we might choose option C: "car" as a potential answer. However, the key to determining a correct answer for this question is to look at the specific context of the question. In this case, the question is not asking what fuel might be stored, but instead asks what we might get fuel from. In this case, petrol might come from a tank in the vehicle itself in which case option D should be the correct answer. Consider also how the question "where are small grapes most likely to be found" might be answered based on the context of this question. If the question is about where a person has found grapes, then the answer would be option C. However, if the question is about where small grapes would be found, then the answer would have to be option E.<n><n>These types of questions are referred to as **context-dependent**, in contrast to more traditional questions like "A: house" or "A: water cooler" which would require a specific, universal answer.<n><n>### Inst

For each problem explain the correct answer and reasons.<n><n>### Solution 1<n><n>#### Explanation:<n><n>The word used in the question is 'was'.  The 'was' suggests that the noun it is referring to is a verb.  Verbs can only belong to past tense.  The word 'intricate' means hard to understand, the word 'apparatus' means a box like thing to hold something, and the word 'wash' also means the same; therefore the correct answer is 'apparatus'.<br><n><n><n><n><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9H650.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/vGqx0r77/9H65-0.png"/></a><n><n><n>## Solution 2<n><n>The correct answer is E 'gas station'.  Petrol is a gas and gas stations are where petrol is stored.  Petrol is mostly used to run cars and at night is when people use their cars to travel, so the natural place to store petrol at night is the gas station.  The other words are mostly misleading but the correct answer is where petrol is stored, therefore E 'gas station'.<br><n><a href="http://i.imgur.com/m1Bc3UZ.png" rel="no"> <i> <a<a href="https:image.prntscr.com/image/VYbAQhqbDGZL8hcIrTpQYg.png" rel="lightbox[prntscr.com]" <n><n>## Solution

Choices:  N/A A: color is determined by an animal’s diet B: color is determined by the environment C: butterflies do not experience seasonal color change D: color is determined by color blindness<n>Output: A: color is determined<n><n>### Explanation<n><n>This question refers to the verb "to get". "The knowledge _ was _ expensive to get".<n><n>This question, in its normal form, might mean something like "get your knowledge here". "Where do you get a television?"<n><n>While "to get" in English normally means to obtain a thing, this context suggests that the phrase "a thing that gets" might mean something like "where might a thing be used at night?". <n><n>This question is asking about a specific type of fruit: the word "raisins" can be used to describe small grapes, therefore "raisins" was the intended answer. The question is specifically asking about grapes that grow in wine country: it does not refer to grapes found at a grocery store ("wine country" is not the same as "grocery store").<n><n>A flawed portrait is a portrait that is not the picture of, ideally, a perfect something.<n><n>The last question has the answer "butterfly's..." but asks only about an animal that is "observing colour".<n>

Choices: 1) The string is a palindrome, thus it also is an anagram of itself. 2) The string has letters in the same order as their positions in the alphabet. Since the string is made up of one of every letter in the alphabet, that results in 26! possible anagrams: 26C1=10,000,000 anagrams. However, since this is a palindrome it has twofold symmetry and in this case we can get rid of any letter not in the string (a in the a in the corner). In fact, since all of the letters are in order from a to z (or z to a) the maximum number of unique letters is two - a or z. So we need either anagram without a or z or with a and z as the last two letters in the string. Since we don't know a or z there is only one solution with only two letters being rearranged. Hence, there is a unique solution.<n>Answer:  E) 10,001,000<n><n>Input: What does a fox say? Choices: 2) What does a pig say?<n><n>Input: Where was the last place you went to drink water?

E: gym junkies Choices : A B C D E <n>Output: A: those who are hungry<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>This test is a simple logic test designed for checking the personality skills. <n><n>There are five types of people: <n><n>`a. Those who are hungry` - can be defined by the fact that they are hungry and probably are going to the gym because they want food and calories, so you can guess those people easily by seeing a queue where there are a lot of people waiting there. <n><n>`b. Those who have had meals` - they are probably not coming for the food, so you can easily distinguish them; you can assume that they are coming to gym in their lunchtime. <n><n>`c. Those who have not had meal` - similar to those who are hungry; this is because they are probably going after a meal. If you still are not sure about the type, you can look for the gym which offer meal at that time of the day. For example, if you see such a gym at lunch time, you can assume that it offers meal. <n><n>`d. Vegetarians` - it is different from everyone because, for vegetarians, meals do not mean meat or chicken or other types of meat and fish but it does mean something else for vegetarians, they can eat eggs and milk and fruits, so that you can easily distinguish them. They look different. So, these people can go anywhere and anytime without any care. <n><n>`e. Gym Junkies` - there are people who gym is their obsession and they love to gym at any time and any day, you can find them in any gym because they gym with a huge passion. So, if you try to find someone with passion, it is better that you check out the gym; or you can check online.<n><n>This is the simplest logic that is being used in finding people.<n><n>

{"idx": 1, "text": "1st step: The question pertains the sanctions and efforts.\n2nd step: The term punishing blow doesn't make a lot of sense, as a sanction is not intended to be punitive. Perhaps, there are reasons for why this term was used in the text, but in most cases, sanctions are not intended to cause harm, so they do not constitute a \"punishing blow\".\n3rd step: The term sanctions against the school is used instead of sanctions against the athletic team or sanctions against a student which gives us the idea that the \"blow\" of the sanctions is more directed at the school as opposed to other individuals or entities.\n4th step: The next clue is the choice \"they seemed to\" suggest that the question should not focus on the sanctions themselves, but rather how they affect the school, or more specifically what they did to the efforts the school had previously made.\n5th step: The word seem in the choice gives an indication that a direct answer isn't necessary for the question.\nSo far the best choice is The efforts which was eliminated earlier.\n6th step: The terms ignored was eliminated earlier. \n7th step: The terms yell at and authoritarian are not logical outcomes of sanctions against the school, meaning they're not choices that make sense when analyzing the situation.\n8th step: The remaining choices are avoid and enforce, so we now need to analyze the meaning of avoid and enforce in the context of sanctions against the schools.\n9th step: The word enforce in the context could imply an increase in enforcement or enforcement efforts following sanctions, but the text does not indicate anything of the sort. If anything, they are a punishing blow, so a more likely outcome would be a decrease or avoid of enforcement since they don't want them to happen again.\n10th step: The term avoid may mean to stop enforcement which would be logical outcome but doesn't logically fit with the other choice enforce. \n11th step: Both enforce and avoid mean that the sanctions are intended to happen on some level, which does not fit with the previous conclusion.\n12th step: Therefore, the remaining option is avoid, which means to stop enforcement.\n13th step: So, the final answer is C) 'the efforts", "answer": "A: ignore"}

A 'populated area' is an area that is occupied by many people, suggesting a specific location such as a park, museum, or mall, and would not be the case in this situation, where the location is not provided.\nc. A 'desert' does not have high population or congregations of people, so it would be an unsuitable choice.\n\n3) The remaining choices are an 'apartment', which seems like the general definition of a place where people reside, and the roadblock - a location which people go past if they are not permitted to go inside.\n\n4) Therefore, the answer is E, the roadblock.\nSo the final answers is E: roadblock\n\nInput: The little girl's father gave her a special job.

{"idx": 4, "text": "1 The question is specifically asking about GPS service on highways within the United States. While this might include areas such as Mexico or the countryside, there is no requirement for information about such locations.\n2. Therefore, to answer this question, we must focus on what constitutes a \"GPS service on highways\" and exclude any answer choices unrelated to that specific context.\n3. The answer choices given are: A [the United States], B [mexico], C [the countryside], D [an atlas], and E [oceans].\n4. The United States is not necessarily a highway or part of GPS service on high lanes. This leaves us with'mexico', 'the countryside', 'an atlas', and 'oceans' as choices.\n5. The countryside is a large geographic area and its inclusion in the choices could easily be confusing or misleading.\n6. Mexico is a neighbouring nation to the US and there is some overlap with services, but this particular question is more focused on the GPS features of highways within the US and any connection to Mexico needs to be excluded, which leaves us with 'an atlas' and 'oceans' to evaluate.\n7. Atlas, as an atlas of maps and navigational charts, is a possible choice, but it is also vague. There are likely many different types of atlas and 'a' type of atlas could be referring to any of these, if it were chosen. Thus, we can safely eliminate 'an atlas'.\n8. That leaves us with 'ocean', which is relevant even though it stands outside the stated context. An ocean could be in the way of highways and GPS services or the ocean could be on a high highway. This is a likely connection since roads or highways go over bodies of water, even oceans, or pass through them.\n9. So, the answer remains as option E: oceans.\nSo the final answers are E: oceans", "answer": "D: atlas"}

{"idx": 7, "text": "1: The key to solving this riddle is to pay careful notice to the given information.\n2: The question asks specifically about the only bag that was checked, which implies that the woman intended to put the drawstring bag somewhere after it was checked.\n3: She wouldn't be checking a bag to leave it at the airport, since she is heading somewhere and the bag is now checked, which means she will either retrieve it later or she doesn't intend to bring it with her.\n4: The woman wasn't heading to a jewelry store, but rather military, which suggests she might be heading to the military.\n5: Military facilities house weapons and supplies, so it's possible that the drawstring bag contains ammunition in case of battle. But military personnel are also known to be guarded and cautious, so the woman wouldn't be heading to a jeweler to buy supplies with her baggage.\n5: The woman isn't headed to a garbage can, nor is she heading to a safe location, which would be likely to hold weapons.\n6: She isn't heading to a location containing expensive jewelry, either.\n7: This leaves us with two options B: military and C: military. They each refer to the same thing, an establishment that holds weapons or dangerous supplies, so the woman is likely on her way to pick up a military baggage.\n8: In summary, the correct answer is C: military establishment that stores weapons and other dangerous equipment.", "answer": "E: airport"}

{"idx": 9, "text": "1 The answer is C. Fountain pens use ink, which is transferred to paper when the pen tip is pressed to the paper, so ink is transferred to the paper through the fountain pen.\n2 When a fountain pen is dipped in ink, excess ink that is not transferred to the paper accumulates in the fountain pen, and it may spread or pool on the pen.\n3 The phrase 'extra ink' refers to the excess ink that accumulates in the pen.\n4 However, the choice of inkwell is not the solution because an inkwell is used to hold and store ink for fountain pens.\n5 To absorb excess ink from a fontain pen, one usually uses blotting paper, as blotting paper can absorb extra ink that pools in a fountain pen. Since a fountain pen contains ink inside the pen and excess ink is absorbed by the blotting paper and not by the pen, it does not require a desk drawer to hold the excess ink. \n6 Hence, the answer is C. blotting paper \nSo the final answer  is C. blottting paper\n\nInput: What is the best possible combination of letters with the letter E to form a real English word?

Choices: 17.5% 29% 61.5% 77.5%\nOutput: 1, The question is asking, about what percent of people own both a cat AND a dog?\n2, After we examine the available information, it can be assumed most of the population does not own either a cat AND a dog as we initially assumed since the percentages add up to more then 100. \n3. In fact, only a small percentage of people can meet the requirement of owning both a cat AND a Dog.\n4. We then apply deductive reasoning. To do so, we ask, what is the minimum of the three options given, which is 30%? 5\n5. In order to meet this requirement, the minimum percentage of people must be greater than or equal to 30%.\n6.

Choices:  B: pencil C: whiteboard D: notebook E: smartphone\nOutput: 1: The key to understanding the context in this question is to examine each of the options closely.

Chicago has many shopping venues, which means there are plenty of opportunities to find this specific type of restaurant.\n4. Since Chicago is a highly urbanized location, it is more likely to contain pizzareaias than any of the other choices. \n5. This eliminates, B (Street), which does not offer the most likely or accurate response.\n6. Similarly, the selection (Little Italy) does not provide a good response, given that it's not an accurate description of'shopping'. \n7. As for the choice option \"Food Courts,\" this is not the most appropriate answer, because the question explicitly states that the shopper is in a shopping mall. So, (E) Foodcourt does not provide the right answer.\n8. This leaves us with (C) Little Italy and (D) Capital Cities..\n9. As mentioned, (C) Little Italy does not seem to have anything to do with shopping.\n10. The choice that makes the most sense is (D) Capital Cites because it is logical to find pizza restaurants in a place that contains other types of restaurants, like Capital Cities.\n11. Therefore, the answer is (D) CapitalCities.\nSo the final answe is D: CapitalCities\n\nInput: What should you do if you are trying to put information in alphabetical order? Choices: 1.

Since the question states everything was eaten, there would be no sense of a full stomach.\n5) 'tiredness' is also not described in the question. As a negative feeling, we can eliminate D: sick, E: satisfaction.\n6) In terms of gaining weight, the question does not seem to imply that one has gained weight. Certainly, eating everything on the menu would potentially have this affect, but since the question does not indicate that it did, C: gaining weight can be eliminated.\n7) Lastly, the one feeling left is the most fitting one: A: full stomack. The feeling of eating everything on the table is one very similar to that of a full stomack.\n8) Hence, the answer is full stomach. \nSo the final answer it full stomach\n\nInput:Where must the newest person stand at a gathering to feel comfortable? Choices:  C: in the middle D: beside the front seat E: next to an established member F: at the counter\nOutput: 1:The question asks where a newcomer must stand to feel comfortable at a social gathering. To understand this better, we need to consider the context around social settings.\n2: Social settings often have a defined hierarchy where the more experienced people are placed in more prominent positions and the newer people are often placed in less preferable positions. This means,  The question may describe the newcomer, but it's more likely to mean the newest person, more precisely the person who has experienced the least time within this setting.\n3: The options given are 'in the middle', 'beside the front seat', 'next to an established member', and 'at the counter'.\n4: So, to summarize the question we need to start by eliminating options based on their positioning.\n5: To stand in the middle is to place themselves at the center of the gathering where they will be exposed to the attention of everyone", "answer": "B: getting full"}

The question clearly asks ''What does playing soccer lead to?'', the phrase 'plays soccer for a long', indicates that the long time playing soccer leads to this mentioned action (E).\n3.) It's not just about playing soccer it has reference to playing the sport for a long time. A player who plays the sport for a long period of time will likely be fatigued, as the repetitive nature of soccer involves running back and forth within two 45-minute halves, with breaks only for substitutions and intermittent stoppages caused by fouls or stoppages based on rules.\n4.)

For example, wires might be used to bring information from a computer out to a device or person, but not to connect directly with a person. Radio could also be used, but is too vague to provide specific information.\n5.) A freeway might connect people as well, but it's unlikely to share computers, files, or information because of its nature and use.\n6.)

Physical, economical, and technical advantage are defined as follows. Physical advantage means not getting scratches, batteries last long, and easy use. Economical advantage means low price. Technological advantage means no breaking\n5. In the choice, there are three advantages given. As a result, one of those six advantages is correct. \n6) The first one given is no scratches. If a watch doesn't have any scratches, it would have physical advantage. However, if it is not digital watch, it will have no scratches either.

{"idx": 24, "text": "1) The initial information provided is \"The accelerator was controlled via a hand throttl.\"\n2) The key information is the 'accelerator', which is a part of the car, and the word 'controlled' indicates that someone was in control of it, not the machine itself.\n3) In this case, we're looking for the'small what' to see what the car was, so the car is the logical answer B. A car typically has steering (in the form of a hand wheel) controlled by the foot pedals, and we're looking for a machine where the parts are controlled by the rider through their hands and feet.\n4) 'Foot pedals controlled the stearing' is not an accurate description of a car steering mechanism. A steering wheel is usually controlled by the hands, so we can eliminate C.\n5) Foot pedals would be an accurate description of controlling an airplane or a boat, given that they are both controlled by the feet. This leaves us with A, 'Fuel system', and E, 'Airplane'.\n6) Fuel System is not a term for the system controlling the rider or the machine, so we can eliminate B.\n7) The sentence specifically mentions 'accelerate,' not fuel consumption. This means a car or boat is the most likely machine. Hence, the answer must be A'Car' rather than E'Airplane'.\n8) Given the information and answer, D, 'Foot pedals controlled steering in the small boat', is the only possible option.\nSo the final answers is D: Foot pedals controlled steering\n\nInput:When traveling west, you should watch the road, because what will be coming up on your right?

It is obvious that he wants to get reward money (B), but the other choice (D) doesn't make a whole lot of sense since it doesn't relate to the body as the question posits.\n8.) The most logical choice is (C), because he is trying to \"clean up\" some problems that will definitely arise if his lie is discovered, and we cannot eliminate (B), because he is obviously seeking money for telling the lie.\n9.) The full sentence reads:\" he was very scared, and he continuously worried about lying about the body, however, he also wished to receive the reward money\".\n10.)

{"idx": 26, "text": "1) The question is asking what 'run errands' means as a code for the drug kingpin.\n2) Code messages are often used in situations where communication is covertly carried out for various reasons.\n3) There are several possible interpretations of the phrase 'run errands' depending on the context. It can mean:\n     * Park - In this case, it could refer to the drug kingpin telling his man to go to several locations or places (parks) to do something. This option is excluded by a similar code message explanation to point 2.\n     * Make time for - This could mean the drug kingpin wants his man to make more time to do something. This would typically relate to their illegal activities. However, it's more likely that 'run' in this context is a command or indication to go and do something (point 2). An activity like the'making time for' would more likely be a separate command. (eg: 'Make time for tomorrow at 2.' in a different code phrase)\n     * Receive instructions - This could indicate that the drug kingpin wants to give his man instructions. However, this isn't an explicit command, more of a passive action. (eg: 'Get instructions for tomorrow at 9.' would be a code phrase).\n     * Take money - This indicates the man is being given money, so this could be a likely code message for 'run errands'. This option also provides good context for the drug kingpin's message since money is exchanged in the drug trade, in return for more money or favors. However, it'd be odd to use a code phrase that directly says 'go and exchange money', so excluded.\n     * Leave work - This could provide a possible alternative for the code phrase 'run errands'. However, it doesn't really fit with the context, if the man was to leave town, he wouldn't be running errands, rather his work. For example, there would be no 'errands' to run if he were to return to his village or place of residence.\n4) Therefore, the answer is either'receive instructions' or 'take money'.\n5) This means it's difficult to conclusively say which one is the actual answer.\n6) However, using other context clues, it seems unlikely the drug kingpin would leave a code to say '", "answer": "D: take money"}

Exhaustion can sometimes be alleviated by taking rest to repair oneself, or stopping the activity producing the exhaustion.\nStep 3. 'Constantly' implies that there was the possibility of not being restless, but this option is not feasible in this context. The body was constantly working and moving, not constantly doing other things.\n\nStep 4. Let's look at the options we don't discard: lay down, exercise, work, and moving. Exercise or moving do not produce 'exhaustion,' so those can be eliminated.\n\nStep 5. Lay down implies stopping. It doesn't imply resting, as sleeping is the normal response to being laid down, but 'laying down' can mean stopping. Work is already an activity which is constantly doing something, not being restless or stopping. This leaves us with just two options: exercise and moving.\n\nStep 6. 'Moving' can easily be associated with travel or the movement of a body from one place to another. But 'exercise' is also a type of movement. So we should not automatically assume that moving is always the opposite of exercise, or vice versa. 'Moving' works as a possible correct answer here.\nStep 7. As a result, the correct answer is B: moving.\nSo the final Answer is B: moving\n\nInput: If the dog is a carnivore, then it eats what?

If there is a shortage of something, prices tend to rise, and that rise in price drives demand for alternatives.\n4. Out of all the options given, the ones that would see a rise if exotic snakes were too expensive are pet shops, ditches and North America.\n5. Pet shops are commonly involved with the trading or sale of exotic snakes, and their prices may rise as more people become interested in obtaining these snakes.\n6. The same is true for the ditch option, although it is a bit vague when it comes to describing its relevance in buying or demanding exotic snakes.\n7. Similarly, North America could also see a price rise, given that it is one of the locations where the trading of these snakes occurs.\n8. However, 'outdoor' does not mention anything about where one would obtain or buy exotic snakes.

Choosing among these choices, we can eliminate D (jail time) and B (purchasing a gun) since those are not appropriate responses to the situation described.\n5. Additionally, Option E (law suit) doesn't make sense in this context, as although a lawsuit is a potential consequence of a crime like murder, it isn't directly related to the victim's family as a punitive response.\n6. Therefore, the two choices that seem to most fit the description of 'punishment' from the victim's family are Option A (knife wounds) and Option C (bleeding).\n7. These options fit the description of punitive action from the victim's perspective, and it's plausible that they would inflict some punishment, like knife wounds, on Joe immediately after he killed the victim.\n8. Based on this analysis, the answer is A (knife wound).\nSo the final answer: A: knife wound\n\nInput: When people leave a store, their eyes can be focused on which item?

You can also hear strange things when you're in your dark home, but that is not going to answer the question.\n5) Coming back to A & B, we can see that flaps and doors are features that are found in almost all houses in the world.\n6): So, coming back to the question given in step 1), we can conclude that the answer must be an option from A, B or D.\n7) However, as we saw a house requires flaps for the movement of pets and a door to enter or exit the house. This narrows our choices to two, namely A & B.\n8): Coming back to our third and final step, we see that flaps are an essential feature in almost all homes. Hence we can eliminate D and move our focus only to A and B.\n9): As A & B, both are very important features in", "answer": "D: light fire"}
{"idx": 35, "text": "1.\"Leave it outside\" may refer to a paper placed on a doorstep before a certain period of absence, during which the paper would not move, as it would be kept inside.\n2. If you leave paper outside and it does not move, there is a reasonable likelihood that something would happen to it.\n3. Each of the given choices contains elements that might happen to the paper if it were left out and did not move.\n4. A paper that is often recycled (A) could end up being recycled but it does not have to be, it could also end up being used in a paper recycle bin\n5. If the paper were ripped (C), that might happen if it were exposed to the elements and got wet or damp.\n6. One dimensional (E) means it could become flat and two dimensional (2D). In the context of paper, that's plausible.\n7. While saturated with water (D) is a reasonable result if the paper was left outside in rainy weather or exposed to a leak, crumpled (E) could be a possible consequence if the paper were dropped onto the ground or fell into a hole.\n8. So the possible outcomes of leaving a paper outdoors are recycling, ripping, becoming 2D, saturating with water, and crumpling.\n9. In the end, crumpling (E) is the most probable result, as it encompasses the other possibilities without specifically focusing too much on any of those specific cases (like paper being ripped)\n10.\"Crumpling\" is the logical answer in this scenario because if the paper is left alone outside it would likely end up crumpled without being moved or moving.\nSo the final is A: crumpling\n\nInput: Where should a ball be placed so that both the top and bottom come into contact with a platform?

{"idx": 36, "text": "Let's start by looking at each of the options:\n1. Option A: \"blank\" doesn't make any sense.\n2. Option B: \"sparse\" would not make sense because it suggests that there is no semen at all and not that there is less semen.\n3. Option C: \"thin\" would not make sense in this context. Semen is not thick, it is more of a fluid substance. \"Thin\" would imply a difference in viscosity, however, this is not a difference with which Mark would have been familiar.\n4. Option D and E: \"clear\" and \"free flowing\" are reasonable choices because they refer to a liquid substance that flows easily and doesn't cause a blockage or clog.\n5. However, when semen is \"clear and free flowing,\" it would not be \"thick\" because the thickness of semen is a completely different parameter.\n6. The only valid option is E: \"free flowing,\" which is the most specific answer for this context.\n7. Thus, the correct answer is B: sparse.\nSo the final solution is A B C D E\n\nInput: I am going to find some new music to download, the best place I can think of is ______________? Choices: 1. A: Youtube B: iTunes C: Amazon D: Spotify E: Google Play\nOutput: Let's look at each of the options independently:\n1. A: YOUTUBE\n    a) When you search for music or download it, you usually don't go into a specific platform just to download one song. Hence, YOUTUBE doesn't seem like the right choice.\n2. B: iTunes\n    a) Similar to YOUTUBE, iTunes doesn't seem like a possible choice because it is more of an overall platform than a single song-specific app or website.\n3. C: Amazon\n    a) Amazon is an online store where people buy stuff. If you want to find and download a single song, this isn't its main purpose, or even why people go there.\n4. D: Spotify\n    a) Spotify is a subscription-based streaming music service that allows users to listen to songs on demand. It is not a website where you can download music directly.", "answer": "D: clear"}

Therefore, option E: Beans are eliminated.\n3) Next, since the sun is a star, which the Solar System consists of, it does not make a lot of sense to sleep around stars in the Sun. Hence option D: Solar System gets eliminated.\n4) Similarly, since the question mentions sun, it is not possible to sleep on the moon because of the different environments like the lack of air and extreme temperatures. Therefore, option B: West (direction) is eliminated.\n\n5) Moving on, as lay means to lie down sleep, the sun is a star that can burn you at some places and can be too hot. So, it is not advisable to sleep outdoors under the sun. Hence, option A: In the basement is eliminated.\n6) Hence, the only logical choice left is option C: Beach.\nSo the final answers is C: Beaches\n\nInput: What could cause a large spider to change color?

It's on the Atlantic Coast, hence, Boston is the wrong place.\n8: Choice C: Beach Town, very possible if the beach town is next to the ocean and has a seafood restaurant there. But if it's a beach town per se but not next to the ocean, that's a lesser likely outcome.\n9: Choice D: Coastal Cities, very likely, any coastal city is bound to have a seafood restaurant either on the coast or next to it.\n10: Choice E: Ocean, not necessarily unlikely, but highly improbable because there's more possibility of finding a seafood restaurant close to the ocean than on top of it.\n11: What we can say based on the previous options, is in a town along the coast at a seafood restaurant, it's likely to find a person who might fit the description in the question.\n12: The answer would, therefore, be Choice D : Coastal Cities, since there's a higher probability of finding a seafooder there.\nSo the final option is D: Coastal Cites.\n\nInput: A book has an infinite number of pages, how many pages does it have?

This could be caused by sitting in an awkward position, but it does not indicate that you can get fat by simply sitting close to the TV.\n6) Similarly, Answer D is again irrelevant. The pain caused by watching television is in the back of head or eyes, which can be related to muscle straining or fatigue, but it is not related to laughter like the example question indicates.\n7) Answer E mentions laughter, but this does not indicate any physical pain caused by \"sitting close to TV.\"\n8) So the logical and matching answer will be answered C: get fat.\nSo the final step will be C: get fat\n\nInput: I am feeling tired because I was up until it was time to get out of bed.

There is the problem with color: the plantains are green and the ice cream are white. The two colors do not match.\n5. There is the problem taste: the ice cream will change the plantain to taste like it.\n6. There is the problem if the ice cream is too small: if plantain is cut up in little pieces to put ice cream in, they will be too small to make another plantain.\n7.

This option is irrelevant, as the question doesn't refer to financial issues.\n7) Option B: Contained. This is also irrelevant as the question is asking for a situation where a certain amount of money is paid, not about paying a certain amount of money out of the context of a game.\n8) Option C: Contained. Similar to the other options, \"Contained\" is irrelevant to the context of the game\n9) Option D: Paying. The question is asking about the financial aspect and what it takes to pay certain prices to access special features for free games. \"Paying\" is not the correct description in this case.\n10) Option E: Caught. This wording indicates that the child was deceived by the promise of a free game but was eventually caught when they realized they needed to pay to access special features.

If the bodyguard makes the hiring person feel safe, he's not directly making that person better off, but instead the bodyguard's effort is benefiting the person hiring the service.\n5.

'Work with their hands' is not a common phrase and the option of 'hands' would be redundant, so option C: a friend is not applicable.\n3. The question says that a person could work with their hands even if they lack skills, indicating it is possible to work without prior skill.\n4.

Additionally, the question doesn't refer to suppliers, it refers to the tools and supplies a person would require to actually get to the point where they are working with their hands.\n6. Also, 'partner' would refer more to a physical relationship or friendship, with the word \"with,\" rather than being someone you learn from.\n7.

Eliminate D, 'get arrested', is a specific term that describes an event that occurred prior to committing the crime.\n3. Eliminate E, 'die', is a potential outcome or event after committing the crime. However, it doesn't match the actions, which are post-crime.  \n4. Leaving us with C, going to jail, D; going to prison, E and F: die. \n5. D, going to prison, doesn't align. This action would likely come after someone had previously been imprisoned, not during or subsequent to a crime. \n6. C, 'going to jail' would likely indicate that Jim committed the crime under arrest or that he was arrested during the act, which is not how the action is worded. \n7. E, die, is a possible outcome for the crimes, but it does not suggest the specific actions taken by the police to incarcerate Jim. \n8. So the only answer that makes sense is F: die.

Moreover, it may have live fiddlers, but this does not indicate fiddle playing in the specific location, so this choice cannot be correct. \n5 C: orchestra; fiddlers can perform in orchestras, but the presence of fiddles in orchestras does not mean the location is typically where fiddles play. \n6 D: symphony; a symphony orchestra usually has fiddles as a component, but this does not imply there will always be a fiddle playing at the particular location, so this choice is insufficient for the given information.\n7 E: Tennessee; Tennessee is not specific because it could refer to any location, and this does not imply a fiddle is located in this area. \n8 As a result, the most suitable answer choice is E: Tennessee.\nSo the final", "answer": "C: orchestra"}

As rest (B) takes time and a bed (C) is a place, they're invalid.\n4: It's easy to guess that the correct answer is E: go to sleep, but sometimes it's better to evaluate each phrase closely.\n5: So, we start with A: mediate - it's a good choice if it's a meditation practice that is designed to restore energy.\n6: 'Staying in bed' doesn't seem to be a possibility so let's eliminate that as well.\n7: Next, we try 'run out of steam' - here it seems most likely to mean that you're physically run down, since you don't typically 'run out of steam in a meditative practice.\n8: Lastly, let's check 'go to sleep' - it's easy to recognize that it is the opposite action of what was asked for in the question: 'to recover'. So, 'to recover' should mean the same as'recover'. Therefore, we can eliminate E and choose D.\n9: In conclusion, the only logical option is D: run out of stamina.

Waiters help manage the serving aspects of the restaurant\n    - Busboys help manage and clean up after customers\n\nOutput: 1) The question is asking for differences in how waitstaff and busboys work.\n2) By looking at the choices, they are different in their serving duties before and after customers.\n3) The busboy only tends to what is needed to be done for those specific customers before and after they are served and they aren't able to wait until the next customer comes before they can serve.\n4) The waiter has different serving duties after the customers have been served that involve serving up food until they're ready to leave.\n5) We can use this information to eliminate choices 4, 5, and 6 because they don't describe the process of serving before, during and after a customer is served.\n6) Therefore, the only choice that will help us explain the question is 3.\n7) Consequently, the answer would be option c.\nSo the final final answer is: 1) Busboys wait tables only before and between customers and waitstuff\n\n8) Waiters wait tables only after customers\n\n9) Waiters", "answer": "B: feel good"}

Poker being another common game, or even some other form of tabletop table games, like dominoes or chess. They don't just have to be playing with a ball for ball to be relevant.\n    - If ball is only seen in context with a sports event, it is unlikely that there would individuals in uniforms, as sporting uniforms are often unique to each team to easily identify who is on which team based on the colored jerseys or other insignia.\n5) We would therefore disregard options 2-5 and focus solely on option 1. From there we can ask more narrowed-down questions that ask which context is the best fit for the words and phrases in question without being too vague.\n    - What do these individuals do?\n    - Who do they work for?\n6) Most likely scenario is that they are military or police. They are working somewhere, and the reason they are in uniform is because their work requires them to be in uniform, such as being on duty, performing administrative tasks like reporting or paperwork, etc. However, they play with a ball in their spare time, while off duty. They are most likely military or police (for being in a job that would require them to wear a uniform and have training in weapons) and the type of individual we would see doing", "answer": "E: sporting event"}

Therefore, the most accurate choice in this scenario is coastal cities, as seafood is prevalent in oceanic areas.\nSo the final answers are C: coastal cities\n\nInput:What could not be found in a grocery store? Choices:  Pencils A: paper B: fruit C: salt D: vegetables E: pizza\nOutput: 1  The question is asking what would be absent in a grocery. \n2. Grocery stores are businesses that sell food, and thus the items of most importance in such a business would be food not other items.\n3. When eliminating options, 'Paper' would not be an appropriate choice because it is neither edible nor consumed, making it inappropriate for a grocery store.\n4. Similarly 'Vegetables' and 'Fruit' are vegetarian items, implying that they are not consumed by all groups.\n5. 'Salt' is a seasoning for food when used at the table and would be considered consumable, thus not a valid item for a grocery.\n6. 'Pizza' is consumatable, but it is also a large group meal and is not likely to be purchased on an individual basis.\n7. So we are left with the remaining choice, 'Pencils.'\n8. Thus, the answer is A.\nSo the final anwers are A: Pencils\n\nInput: A person would have to be able to make what with toes? Choices:  B: shoes C: toaster D: muffins E: boots\nOutput: The question is asking the function of the person's toes.\n1. A toaster requires fingers.

They expect a response back. So, lets eliminate this option.\n6: Since 'answer' is so similar to'respond' in that it implies a reply or expectation of a reply, we can eliminate B, C, and D.\n7: The most logical choice is A: hang up, because it is the most direct and simplest answer to the question.

Although a mall, department store, or a type of store might have a section of the aforementioned products, the woman would have also to choose among different products to select what she wanted.\n5. Therefore, a mall, department stores or a type of stores can't be the full answer.\n6. Similarly, a student union or a town and city cannot be the full answer. \n7: The type of places that have sections of all the products in one place are libraries and a department store, both of which are listed in the given choices.\n8. Since department stores have multiple sections full of various products, all of which could be found at a bookshop or library, we can safely eliminate both a mall and a town and city, which are not as comprehensive.\n9.

Choices: A: a tunnel B: a park C: a mountain D: an ice cream E: an arch\nOutput: 1.'To go to work, you must go through (a tunnel, a park, or a mountain)' is the general statement in the question, meaning someone has to go through this space or place to get to work.\n2. The options given are 'a tunnel, a park or a mountain'. These are all things that can be travelled through to get to the same location.\n3. Of course, it doesn't make sense to go through an 'arch' to get in somewhere or leave somewhere, which eliminates option E (an arch).\n4. 'Ice cream' and 'a park' are too specific, so we cross them out as wrong.\n5. 'To go to work, one must go through a tunnel' is a straightforward statement.

{"idx": 78, "text": "1 The phrase'reduce her waist size' suggests 'loss' rather than 'gain', so we can eliminate A: gain weight.\n2 The term'miserably' indicates failure and disappointment, which doesn't make sense if she gained weight.  So we can eliminate B: augment. 'Augment' would be used to denote an increase.\n3 'Dispare' implies an emotional or mental condition associated with dissatisfaction or dejection.  Again this contradicts the failure theme, and implies a mental state, not a physical action associated with weight reduction, so eliminating dispare is also logical.\n4 'Make larger' can be ruled out for similar reasons.  There is still a possibility that'make larger' would denote an increase in her waist size, and that is not the intended meaning in this context.\n\nSo that leaves us with the possibility of E: expand. The action of expanding connotes a larger physical state.  If someone 'expands', or makes themselves bigger, we would not say that they failed miserably to reduce their waist size.\n\n5 'Make larger' could be ruled out for this reason, however it is associated with increasing waist size, which again doesn't make sense. The action of making larger requires more effort than Jamie has invested, so we can eliminate the'make' option.\n\n6 The phrase 'continuing to do what' indicates Jamie has a tendency or habit that she is trying to change. We can eliminate 'gain weight' as an option, as it isn't a behavior that needs to be changed.\n7 Out of the remaining choices, 'expanding' is the best fit, as it indicates an action that is happening over and over again, possibly causing the failure to reduce her size.\n8 The combination of 'expanding' with 'waist' implies waist expansion, so the answer is C: expand.\nSo the final answers are C: expand\n\nInput: If 170 liters of water is used to fill a swimming pool containing an area of 21 square meters, what will be the amount in cubic centimeter of water used?

{"idx": 79, "text": "The options that are the \"most\" likely to be fear inducing are: death, coma and forgetfulness.\n1. Options D and E aren't \"logical\" choices given the context. While it is possible to be in a coma and forget your life, the context is that he is experiencing this near death/consciousness loss situation so it would be unlikely as it is very serious and intense to occur to the extent that the person would not know if he is alive or dead. Furthermore, it is important to realize that the fear of death and dying isn't about being in a coma since one can come out of a coma and still be conscious or alive, thus a coma would be one of the lowest on the anxiety scale when near death or consciousness loss. \n2. We see that option C, \"scared of loss of life\" isn't on the same level as option A \"death\" and B \"coma\". \n3. This seems to confirm that, though death and coma are possible, what we want to eliminate is not one of them.\n4. When thinking of death or coma, we want to think about how one can no longer sustain themselves or have the chance to continue living. \n5. This is when we see that D, loss of consciousness, is similar in that it will hinder one from living, but it isn'the same as being in a coma or being fully unconscious.\n6.

Options that would describe such a feeling are stress, nervousness, or boredom.\n5. However, these can't be applied as none of them would characterize someone as self confident and aloof. \n6. The remaining options are described positively - smile or making new friends\n7. Although a smile is a common expression of welcome and kindness, it may also be the result of feeling bored or unenthusiastic. \n8. Lastly, making new friends is a positive reaction, but it doesn't specify what a person is experiencing when meeting new people.\n9.

'What they tell her' would have an impact on a parent, but is not limited only to what children say. \n3. 'A', 'B' and 'C' seem irrelevant in this context.\n4.

We can buy, kill, feed a dog or cat, season, etc.\n2 Store is what a business does to a product to sell it and not what we have to do as consumers to be able to eat something \n3 Feed a dog or cat (A) is a choice, but it doesn't make sense to buy food, kill animals, store food and feed dogs. We can buy food, kill animals (but then it also becomes seasoning), store food and then later on store the dog food.\n4 It's also impossible to season food because seasoning, which is adding spices to food, is not the same thing as eating. You can do both at the same time but to season something you first have to buy, cook, kill, store and season it.\n5 If we were to choose (D) season, then you can store the seasoned food but not seasoning, so it doesn't really make sense.\n6 So (E) is the correct answer, we have to feed it to a dog or cat because we can store it, feed it to a dog, kill it to get seasoning and store seasoning for cooking it.\nSo the final correct answer is : E: feed a dog or a cat", "answer": "C: fun"}

Choices: A: It was made of polyester B: It was too big C: It had too many buttons D: It was crooked E: It was made of spandex\nOutput: The word 'too' in the description of the shirt suggests that it doesn't fit just because it's small, otherwise it wouldn't be suitable for its purpose.\nThe reason that could explain this incompatibility between small size and crooked fit could be the material the shirt is made of.\nThe answer should relate to the 'wrong size', which can be related to material's properties.\nWhile material in clothing can be made of a mix of some fabrics (polyester, cotton, spandex), polyester is an odd choice given the context. Polyester is a man-made material (fibers made in the laboratory, unlike cotton or wool). \nThis material choice wouldn't usually be stretchy and crooked, but instead would be rigid and less likely to fit off proportionately (small but not crooked).\nThe same can be said about E, spandex, as this is a type of man-made fibers, typically used for running apparel, swimsuits, leotards, etc. They stretch, but wouldn't be crooked unless made in a very unusual way.\nThat makes options E and B impossible (spandex and polyester aren't known for having this pattern; they're more stiff).\nOption C,", "answer": "A: desire"}

Choices:  B: cute puppy C: flat tire D: bicycle E: dead body\nOutput: 1). The question asks us what a man could find on the roadside upon driving long distance. It uses the word 'find' which suggests that they are looking for something, they are actively noticing what is present. They are trying to observe what they can.\n2. The choices given are B: cute puppies, C: flat tire, D: bicycle, E: dead body.\n3. 'Cute puppy' is a rather unlikely choice for that answer as people would be less focused on the possible presence of a cute puppy, compared to other things which would normally be less 'cute'; and also, the word 'cute' is implying a positive association, which goes against the negative tone of the rest of the story. So we will rule out B.\n4. 'Flat tire' - 'flat tire' is very negative, so we can rule it out.\n5. 'Bicycle' - we will examine if we can take this answer as 'a man can find a bicycle on the roadside'. This is not an obvious inference from the question and we should analyze if we can interpret it that way. Bicycles can be found in several places, not only on roadsides. But it is a fact that bicycles do get damaged and left behind after the owner drives away, therefore this answer is logical. Bicycles are also usually found during day time when there is clear visibility. So we conclude that an individual can find a 'bicycle' on the roadside", "answer": "B: satisfaction"}
{"idx": 88, "text": "1 The question is asking for why the fat man might be complaining in the context provided.\n2. The key is that the fat man is complaining that he can't do certain things that are simple.\n3. The given choices are no go, unlikely, unable, cant do, and impossibility.\n4. The answer that logically makes sense is unlikely given that the scenario indicates that someone who is fat is supposedly complaining that they can't do something that is simple.\n5. It could be argued that the man could not \"go\" due to his weight, but that would be quite unusual for a fat man to \"go\" somewhere, considering they're likely sedentary.\n6. Neither \"cant do\" nor \"impossibility\" match context since \"impossibility\" doesn't logically match a complaint, and \"cant do\" suggests a choice when a complaint is mentioned. So those can be eliminated, leaving us with A: unlikely, B: no go, and C: \"unable.\"\n7. Although \"unable\" means incapable, it is also a specific response to a situation or request for something. The context of a complainant suggesting they cannot do something simple might suggest they believe themselves to be not capable.\n8. \"No go\" is too general, it doesn't suggest what type of complaint and lacks context by asking about what the \"man refused to accept\" or \"what was possible.\"\n9. \"Until\" would suggest that a complaint is followed by additional actions, which would be unusual considering the scenario where a complaint results in an immediate answer like a \"no\" or another response.\n10. That leaves us with the answer unlikely which is the one that most logically and explicitly matches the given words and context - a complaint that someone can't do something simple, suggesting that they don't believe themselves to be capable - which is not surprising given the fact that they are fat.\nSo the final  answer should be unlikely.\nSo the final answers are B: No go and C: unlikely", "answer": "D: cant do"}

The same can be said of \"bouquet\", which could stand for a single plant or a collection of them.\n    - As for the red flowers, the term \"congregate\" implies that they could be multiple flowers, thus making the choices of \"bouquet\" and \"rose garden\" equally valid, since we are not sure if this means a single flower or multiple ones.\n4: As mentioned, the choices C, D, and E are unclear with respect to whether they constitute a singular or collective red flower.\n5: It is also clear that the bees do not congregate in a trash can, nor are they attracted to the honey, as it is not a flower, nor would any bees congregating there be considered red.\n6: Choice B has been discarded since it does not include any red flowers.\n7: As for choice C, it states that bees congregate/attract/collect red flowers.

{"idx": 92, "text": "1.`We have all experienced feeling angry after getting drunk, which is why understanding what that anger entails can help one better understand and relate to the question.\n2. The answer can be ascertained by analyzing the behavior that most often occurs when one gets angry while drunk.\n3. There is a high likelihood that one will behave in a way that is uncoordinated or out of character. This could manifest itself in several ways such as falling, vomiting, or even lowering standards.\n4. All of the choices are possible after-drinking behaviors, but only one of them fits the pattern of \"lower(ing) standards.\"\n5. As such, the most logical choice in this context is D: vomiting.\n6. The choices provided are not limited to these choices, as drinking-related anger has many possible manifestations, but it is important to understand why lower standards fit the pattern.\n7. If a person gets angry after drinking, they may lower their standards and let loose with behavior that is inconsiderate, rude, or even dangerous.\n8. A person who gets angry after getting \"drunk\" is more likely to act in ways they \"normally\" would not.\n9. As such, they are \"liable\" (hah) to lower their standards and act in ways they normally would not, which makes the most logical choice D: vomiting. It lowers standards by making one vulnerable and making them feel worse about their actions.\nSo the final answers is C: vomiting\n\nInput: The hunter had been waiting for the deer to appear, but he realized it wouldn't arrive in the near future when what happened?

One can find bees gathering pollen on trees in orchards, in fields of flowers, or even in the sky. \n5. However, \"The U.S.\" would require us to refer to the entirety of U.S. territory, including Alaska and Hawaii as well as smaller islands and atolls.\n6. The given choices are each specific to an environment, with options B, C and E all referring to field or orchard settings. \n7. Option A, \"United States\" may be correct for a large setting like the contiguous United States, but not for orchard or field settings,\n8. So we must eliminate A.\n9. Now, let's review the options we are left with:\no B, \"Sky\" fits the question context since bees will often fly amongst flowers and other foliage.\no C, \"Court\" is probably not the best of the options, as bees would only sometimes be found in court settings, such as apiarian courts, and not in large populations. \no E, \"Orchard\" is a valid environment for bees, but the other options might be more likely, making us eliminate D.\n10.

{"idx": 110, "text": "1: The sentence \"How do geese normally travel from place to place?\" indicates that the question is focused on the usual behavior of geese, not their specific locations at a given time.\n2. Because the question is only focused on travel, \"carried by people\" would not be a valid option.\n3. Similarly, \"guard house\" and \"fly\" would not be valid as they are related to specific geese, not to general travel behavior.\n4. Following on from this, the option of \"group together\" is not a behavior, and hence can also be eliminated.\n5: The remaining options, B and D, refer to specific modes of geese travel. However, the option of \"fly\" is a behavior and \"follow ultralight airplanes\" is about the presence of human behavior involved (in this case, airplanes).\n6: Thus, the answer is B, as it describes travel without any human behavior involved.\nSo the final is B: fly\n\nInput: What is the proper way to say goodnight to guests leaving a party?

Choices A, C, D, and E seem too broad to determine which one is the correct answer.\n4. An option could be \"fists,\" as the injury could impair John's ability to use his fists to complete a task. The problem is that fists are a body part used for many purposes and it would be hard to attribute an injury there to one specific task.\nExample: \"John accidentally hit himself in the nose with his fist while using his tool.\"\n5. Another choice might be \"tools,\" which would be logical if the purpose of John's task included the use of tools, and he accidentally injured his hands while using them.\nExample: \"The tools John was using were heavy and he injured his hands while using one of them.\"\n6. Choices D and E are similar, and not the correct answer to the question. \"Hands\" and \"fists\" are two hands body parts.\n7.

The context here is clearly a \"real-world\" one, with a hint to the answer of being in an isolated or secluded area.\n3.) In this scenario, if a person happens upon a lizard, they would not expect it and would likely be surprised. Some areas a person may find themselves in this circumstance are a forest, dessert, a garden, or a creek.\n4.) However, in each area, it would be too hard to surprise someone with a lizard unless that person had been alone all day and not heard any noise or signs of lizards moving around.\n5.) If the lizards could live in each of the aforementioned places, then the answer would have to be some place where a person would be alone, such as a forest or a creek.  \n6.) However, the creek and the forest don't have much to do with what is being referred. Lizards would likely be found around water more than creeks, and lizards are found in many different places.\n7.) If a lizard could be found in any of these places with relative ease, they might be expected to be more common than in the creek or the forest. The lizard therefore cannot be surprisingly found in these areas, and the creek or the garden are more appropriate choices.\n8.) However, the garden is ruled out as a location because it is unlikely that a person would go into a garden to find a lizard.\n9.) This leaves only the creek as the answer.

The remaining choices are (1).' the end of line', (2). 'the last straw' and (3). 'the hobby shop'.\n5 As far as the end of line, Sally should have tied the kite string onto the branch rather than tying it onto nothing, so this doesn't fit.\n6 Similarly, the last straw might provide some insight as to what happened, but the phrase in the question specifically indicates that Sally didn't notice that her kite was running out. So let's say that'she thought there was more string' but then realize that there isn't enough to secure the kite (the last straw). We need to focus on the part of the question where she realizes that there is no more string because she reached the end of the line.\n7 The hobby shop is again irrelevant because string and line are not sold in hobby shops.\n8 That means, the final 3 choices are (1). the end of line, (2).

In the context of this question, that doesn't make sense as the focus is on looking good before a job interview. \"Handsomeness\" is not only ambiguous, but also too vague to be answered by this choice.\n5. \"Neatness\" is not necessarily the desired characteristic, as the man might not care about being seen as neat.\n6. \"Tardiness\" does not make sense as one would not be looking good if they were late for an interview.\n7. That leaves us with \"Beauty\" and \"Beauty\" is too vague to give much information about what the man might be trying to show in his grooming.

While A, B, and E could be considered actions that fit this situation, they are not described in the question, so they do not correspond to the situation, as the question is seeking a corresponding decision. \n3.) The other choices, D and C, are more likely responses that the young woman could have taken in such a moment of crisis.\n4.) There is a bit of misdirection in the question, as it seems at first glance that C (trying to avoid blame) might be the intended answer.\n5.) However, D (apologizing) is the preferred response and the correct answer. There can be situations where trying to avoid blame would be the appropriate way to behave, but what is intended in these questions is generally to find the best response according to the situation. \n6.)

Hence, they become larger or more precise, not smaller or less precise.\n5) The last option 'I can see the moon' is indicative of a change from the previous 3 options in that it is a specific observation that can be made.\n6) Hence the answer is E: 'I can see the Moon'.\nSo the final answer set would be 'I can see the tree','I can see the Moon','I can see the moon','I can see the tree', 'I can see the trees','I can see the trees'\n\nInput: This is supposed to indicate a process in the medical field, so in a process of elimination, we'll start with A, surgery and B, diagnosis.

A logical conclusion would be that you are searching for food, not a person. So our focus should be \"where are you likely to find food?\" 1. The options given are: opera, supermarket, building, conference, and apartment. \n2. \"Where are people likely to...\" indicates that people are doing the action. So \"where are the people likely to find......\" seems appropriate.\n3. \"Food\" in this circumstance refers to any type of food or food item. \n4. Starting with a supermarket, while it may not be the most likely place to find an individual food item like bread, it's likely to have many food items, so it fits. Conferences will be a much harder to answer, and if there is one food in the conference, it will have been shared. \n5.

We found that a person cannot 'ask' a place in an apartment. This can be done in many ways but 'find' is what the person must do.\n5. Next, we find that a person cannot just simply 'believe' that they have found the item. 'Find' is the action of verifying whether it is present or not. 'Try' is not specific to the action required in the apartment context.\n6. The last option that is left is'search'. 'Search' is a broad term, but it works in this question.

However, all of them have problems.\n7) Bridge is a structure and does not likely contain anyone, it cannot be the answer.\n8) Locked up could be a place or a state of being locked up. This phrase is too vague to be used as an answer.\n9) Homeless shelters would be places to stay but could also mean a state, not a place.

'Terrible' does not suit this description because it implies that something is not scary or frightening at all. Additionally, 'Terrible' can also refer to something being poorly or incompletely done, which does not align with the description used in the question.\n5. As for 'little', 'tiny', or'minimal', they don't fit either as a descriptor for being scary, since they don't imply anything frightening in its description.\n6. Moving on to 'little','minimal'. These terms indicate that the decorations were not large in scale or scope. This wording would not describe the decorations as'scary'.\n7. The phrase \"small\" can mean both minimal or small but it also can be used positively as in \"the house was small, but quaint.\" In that sense, \"small\" can mean \"scary\" but it can also mean \"cute\" thus eliminating option D.\n8.

{"idx": 151, "text": "1) The question asks you to identify an action or process done to a specific material in order to attach or bind it to something else.\n2) Out of the given choices;\n    A: \"nailing\" is the process of hammering a nail into something. While it is mentioned frequently in this context, it is not exclusive to wood. Also, while it could be the action used to attach something to wood, the process of hammer the nail in does not imply that the wood was drilled or drilled in such a way that there was a hole available in the wood.\n    B: \"carving\" often refers to the act of shaping and sculpting wood with a knife or other carving tool. While this does apply in the construction industry, the word is too vague to be specifically used to describe actions associated with attaching things to wood.\n    C: \"polishing\" is done on wood items once they are constructed to give the wood a smooth texture. The resulting appearance of the wood will depend on the type of wood being polished, and while it is often used in conjunction with other actions like sanding, it does not involve hammering a nails or screws into wood.\n    D: \"eating cake\" is probably what the child wants to do with their toy house after constructing it. However, this does not actually involve attaching anything to wood with the process of hammer and nail.\n    E: \"petrifying\" is the process of turning something like wood into stone or hardened substance as a result of physical or chemical processes. This doesn't involve attaching anything to the wood either, instead, the wood is converted.\n3) The only remaining action on the list is \"drilling\" which is the process of drilling a hole into something like wood or another material to use for attaching something to it. Drilling is what you would do to make a hole for a nail, screw, or other attachment device in wood.\n4) So, the correct answer is \"drilling.\"\nSo the final answer  is D: drilling.\n\nInput: What is a form of protection that one must use with high voltages?

Once we have that context, we need to think about where the table would plausibly go. A table is a commonly placed piece of furniture and often times would be situated in a dining room, cafeteria, or even in the park. \n3.) When considering the table's destination, the word 'dining' is the most pertinent. 'Dining room' is the obvious location for the placement of a dining table - so E, the formal dining room, isn't a good answer. \n4.) If there is no context or mention that the table is being placed in the cafeteria of a business, it is not a logical selection; likewise, we can remove B: arranging papers. \n5.)

So, it is unlikely that they would say it is not even not noticeable at A or D.\n10. As for 'boring', it doesn't seem to fit, and economists usually like to keep their comments to a minimum and get right to the point rather than going into detail about boring topics.\n11.

From the definition, the answer should be consistent, i.e. 'in common' means'same' or'same kind/type/nature'. \n2) So now we can understand that we are looking for an attribute that is the same in all the coffee blends, e.g. sweetness, flavor, etc. or that is the exact cause of them all having the same rating. \n3) Looking at the options provided, we can cross out A and D almost immediately since they do not match the definition of 'in common'. Next we will cross out E since'strong caffeine' can be a positive attribute, depending on what caffeine is strong relative to and it is not relevant to this question. \n4) Next, we can cross out B and C. We can eliminate B since 'harsh' is most often defined as 'bitter' or something unpleasant. The other, C, is ruled out because 'bitter' is one of the attributes it does not share. \n5) Finally, we can answer which means that the blend has high acid content.

This suggests that thin glass does, in fact, have at least one distinguishable characteristic from other types of glass. \n3.

We can eliminate options that do not distinguish thin glass from other glass types: melt and bend. In particular, thin glass should not melt or bend (unless that is its purpose, such as for building roofs in hot climates).\n5. We can further eliminate options that are not characteristic of glass.

{"idx": 165, "text": "1: The question describes circumstances where one would be able to hear a 'bassoon played in an un-pleasing fashion'.\n2. The bassoon is a woodwind instrument, which is in the brass section of the orchestra. \n3. When a bassoon plays incorrectly, usually the player or a colleague notices first. \n4.

The choices are: Orchestra, Symphony, Baritone, High School Band, and 'play music in an unpleasing way'.\n8. Since an orchestral 'play music in an orchestra' would generally involve an audience and many instruments, one would likely notice this un-please-ing fashion, whereas in a'symphony' the music is usually very well-played and any un-pleas-ing style is unlikely to be noticed.\n9. A bassoonist might play un-pleas-ingly in a 'play in high school band' but in an orchestra, not if they are in the brass section or playing with other good musicians.\n10. Therefore 'baritone' would not be a likely place to hear such a bassoon played in this situation.\n11.

Therefore, the options describing the distance between the car (the man in the jacket) and the entrance (the car) can be narrowed down to A: far too close and B: far too far. The remaining two options C: too closely and D: too far away are irrelevant.\n5. \"Too far\" doesn't imply that it is far in comparison to something else. Therefore it is not relevant to the context.\n6.\"Too closely\" also doesn't fit the context. It only applies if the person was parked too closely to another car (in close proximity). It does not mention a \"bad spot\" or anything about the space of the parked car.\n7. Therefore, the best answer", "answer": "A: winners and losers"}

The question refers to keeping the home clean, rather than the homeowner.\n2.) The choices given all apply to the homeowner and not to a home itself.\n3.) While it is indeed important to have clean hands, keep drinking vessels to yourself, get enough sleep, and perform yoga, these are not tasks a homeowner could do every day to clean and maintain the overall space.\n4.) Washing clothes is another essential task, but it refers to washing them in a washing machine.\n5.) Avoiding the spread of germs is an important task as a homeowner, but there are only two options in the choice list which can serve this function, those being (B) avoiding sharing drinking vessel(s) and (D) regularly performing yoga.\n6.)

Let us analyze each of the given options to ascertain if one of them best fits the description.\n3. A:  \"insubstantial\" means the opposite of substantial. Substantial implies a certain measure of quantity that is not necessarily there. So, \"insubstantive\" is clearly not what we're looking for.\n4. \"Massless\" means that it has no mass, implying the opposite of massive. It also means it lacks substance.

However the \"because\" in the question suggests that by \"feeling herself doing\" something (the thing being \"getting colder\"), she would be able to determine a specific sign of how death would happen: \"getting cold\".\n5. This suggests that she could be feeling a change in temperature since her wounds are being treated, which would be a sign of things getting \"colder\", and therefore a sign that she is going to die.\n6. However this process of \"getting colder\", which would be a physical change of temperature, has a specific, predictable direction and magnitude that relates exactly to the process of dying: the temperature goes from warm to cold.\n7. This implies that Janet must be able to specifically \"feel herself getting colder\" as a result of the wounds being treated.\n8. Looking at the choices given, only changing color (Option B) and stopping breathing (Option E) would involve a distinct shift in temperature, and a more specific magnitude.\n9. \"Stopping breathing\", however, doesn't make sense here because \"different breathing\" isn't necessarily associated with a specific temperature shift, which the \"getting colder\" implies.\n10.

He does not prefer moving closer to them; he prefers moving closer to where he is working.\n6) \"Available\"? That is not relevant. If the job were here and near his family, then it would be available regardless of whether he could work closer if he moved here.\n7) \"Come here\"?

Choices:  Saddles Bicycles C: trains D: skateboards E: wagons\nOutput: 1). The given options can be categorized as follows:\na) Saddles - The options which include either \"Bicycles\" or \"wagons\". Saddles were used on horses and were an essential part of carriage transportation from the 20s to the 40s.\nb) Trains - Although trains were used from the 1880s to the mid 20th century, it was in service for longer than the 1900 era and should have been excluded from the list.\nc) Skateboards - Although they are still being used, they weren't invented until the 1940s, therefore they weren't used for transportation in the 180-190s.\nd). Wagons - Wagons were used to transport people or things from the mid-1700s to the early 190s.

{"idx": 185, "text": "1.) The question is looking for the meaning of 'fall' in the line \"falling into happiness.\"\n2.) The line that reads 'falling into happiness' is part of a longer sentence that reads 'I love to smile and fall into happiness'.\n3.) This implies that there's a specific action, the falling, that is inhibiting happiness.\n4.) As the options suggest, there are a few types of things that happiness can do or make someone feel.\n5.) Love, smiles, and tears are all feelings that happiness could bring, not things happiness could do. This is evident because the options begin like \"lead to laughter\" (doing), \"to love\" (feeling) and \"to tear\" (doing.)\n6.) This suggests that happiness could 'do' something, but not lead to something else feeling or doing happiness.\n7.) Also, happiness can't 'lead to' crying, because crying is something that can be induced or brought on by happiness (i.e. sad tears), but happiness can't make someone cry.\n8.) Happiness can make someone laugh, but it doesn't 'lead' to it.\n9.) All in all, happiness 'induces' or directly causes laughter (feeling) so 'lead to' isn't an option.\n10.) Similarly, happiness can directly make someone smile (feeling), so 'cause to smile' is not an option.\n11.) This leaves us with three possible options:\n12.) A: fall into happiness \u2013 if to fall into happiness means you feel or experience happiness, then falling is like a result of happiness i.e. it results in feeling or experiencing happiness. This makes the most sense and is the best fit.\n13.) Which means happiness can 'fall into'.\n14.) Hence, the answer is: Option C: Feel/experience happiness.\n15.)

Similarly Option C \"taste sauce\" also doesn't make sense because it is an action that does not create or make dinner.\n5.

Walk in (Option B) does not seem particularly relevant here.\n  2. Walk out (Option E) also does not seem particularly relevant since he is saying he will be back.\n  3. \"Walk Ahead\" (Option A) - the person is saying they will be back, but in reality, they are going to walk ahead. This doesn't make sense as the sentence would mean they can walk back, but they are in fact walking ahead.\n  4. \"Walk Back\" (Option D) sounds reasonable since the person is actually saying they will be back in the first place, but this isn't what happened in reality. This is out of the options.\n  5. \"Walk with\" (Option C) is the best answer possible. In the real-world context of the situation, the person said they would go back and walk with the person, but they actually did the complete opposite.\nSo the final option is C: \"Walk with\".\nSo the final  answer is C", "answer": "A: cook dinner"}
{"idx": 188, "text": "1: The question specifies the theft of a person's money. This implies that the person is not able to get back the money that was stolen.\n2. We have to ask ourselves what happens when a person can no longer get his/her money back.\n3. The possibilities include the following:\n    - B: feel angry\n    - C: drink tea\n    - D: cross street\n    - E: Park\n    - F: Die\n4. However, the wording of the question indicates that the person's money was stolen, not his or her possessions or car, etc. \n5. Given that the theft of money is the context of the question, the correct answer will be the one that best reflects the state of losing a large amount of money.\n6. This leaves us with: \n    - A: complete sentence\n    - B: feeling angry\n7. The answer has to do with a verb, which means the person would have to be in a state before and after the theft.\n8. We can thus eliminate choices a-c, which are not verbs.\n9. It is easy to imagine the person feeling angry, but we don't want to ignore or overlook the fact that a monetary loss can have lasting impact. \n11. Thus answer D: Cross/park is misleading, as the victim doesn't cross/park his money, it gets lost. \n10. The correct answer has to do with the verb \"completed sentence,\" which means that the money that was stole will never be returned to the person. \n11: Therefore, the correct answer to this question is choice C: complete sentence. Choice C is the correct answer.\nSo the final choice is C: complete sentence\n\nInput:Where would a man go to get milk if he wants to make a cake?

Choices:  B: after each job C: before each job D: during the job E: after the job\nOutput: 1.) Each fireman gets ready at the start of the job, this preparation includes putting on their gear. So, 'before each job' is the perfect time to make sure your gear is in place.\n2.) The job itself involves using gear to complete tasks and deal with emergencies. If a fireman is using his gear to complete tasks or deal with emergencies, it's the wrong time to check if his gear is in place as this may result in problems or delays.\n3.) 'After each job' is also a logical choice, but it doesn't specify that the gear was actually put on and used as part of the job in that time, it merely states that the job is complete and the fireman has left or exited the building. That being the case, the gear must be inspected post job.  \nSimilarly, checking after the job is complete, may result in problems or injuries if it's not done carefully and with forethought.\n4.) And finally, checking one's gear and making sure it's in place 'after the job' is also not specified.\nThe text doesn't state or imply that a 'job' is a timed, fixed or predet", "answer": "D: think creatively"}

This can be proven true in that, according to the choices provided, someone without immortality can end up in each available state other than 'immortality'.\n3. The phrases 'to die' and 'to be dead' both refer to events, where one can choose between them. \n4. The same is true of 'Dying' as an option, as it suggests one state that leads to another.\n5. The phrase 'immortality', on the other hand, cannot be described in any of the same terms (die, dead, dying), as it suggests eternal existence and cannot have an ending. \n6. So, the answer based on this evidence is B: Mortal.\n\nInput: Do any other fish in the river? Choices:  Yes: fish are present in the river. No: fish are not present in the river.\nOutput: 1)'Fish are present in the river,' would mean that other fish were present.\n2. That can only be the case if it was the case previously, as in someone had indicated that fish were previously present and thus the state 'present' is correct.\n3. However, the choice given is the opposite, with 'present' meaning that other fish are not present.\n4.

Choices: Nothing A: what is B: what C: what D: what will E: what would\nOutput: 1.) We can make logical inference because if I were thinking about nothing, the sentence would be 'nothing is thinking' instead of 'I am thinking'.\n2) The opposite option is 'I was thinking about what', suggesting that 'what' is the subject in the sentence.\n3) If there were no logic involved, the phrase 'I am thinking about what' would suggest the subject was 'about' what, so the question would be 'What is thinking about?'.\n4) However, the choice given doesn't suggest that the object of thought is 'about', so it probably isn't the subject.\n5) Instead, 'what' is used both because it serves in the role of the subject and because it can't be confused", "answer": "C: dead"}
{"idx": 191, "text": "1) The key to the question can be found in the first sentence where, after seeing his son's report card, his mother knew he would be doing housework because he obtained poor grades. \n2. Therefore, his homework grade is a possible cause of his assignment to do housework, but it's also possible that he obtained poor grades for other reasons, such as fatigue or lack of concentration.\n3. The five options given are each causes of getting poor grades, and we would want to eliminate the cause that did not prevent poor grades.\n4. Sneezing seems to be a temporary inability to think clearly and complete assignments effectively due to a cold or allergies, causing poor performance.\n5. Fatigue, or a lack of energy, could prevent a student from doing their best on an assignment, leading to low grades.\n6. Feeling satisfied might also prevent students from preparing for a test, leading to low grates, but this was not mentioned in the original sentence.\n7. Although getting good grades is not listed as a cause in the original statement, it should still be considered a cause along with the others and evaluated to see which one doesn't prevent bad grades.\n8. In the end, the two best options are feeling satisfied and fatigue because feeling satisfied did not prevent low grades and he might feel satisfied because he was fatigued, which could be avoided or could even be considered in some situations.\n9. So, this question can be answered by evaluating the other mentioned factors; if feeling satisfied is not enough to make him do housework, then the other two factors, fatigue and sneezing, are the most relevant factors.\n10.

Choices: \n\nA: fear B: excitement C: anger D: thrill E: curiosity F: joy\nOutput:1.\nThe baboon is jumping out of a plane, which implies that it was in the plane in the first place and has been coaxed or persuaded into jumping.\n2. When something changes suddenly or is influenced to do something, it could respond with excitement, anger, thrill, joy, or fear.\n3. So, we know that fear might have been the cause that caused the baboon's jump, but that's just one of the possible choices.\n4. Therefore, the choices we have are: fear, excitement, anger, thrills, joy, and curiosity.\n5. Looking at these choices and the previous sentence, there is evidence that the baboon might have been forced to jump. \n6. However, the question does not specify 'forced' but says 'caused' the jump.\n7. 'Caused' infers an action that causes an outcome. \n8.

'Spine' would likely not be a target for throwing a rod, unless it were an extremely unstable object made of an absorbent material that would catch on to the rod in mid-throw.\n7) This leaves us with 'engine' and'sport' as options for damage to an object caused by throwing a rod.\n8) 'B' and 'C' provide two very different meanings for a'sport'. 'B' refers to a camping or fishing spot and may not be the answer chosen. 9) 'E' refers to a'sporting good', but the question says nothing about 'good' or 'goods'. 10) This suggests that the answer has to indicate 'harm to an object'.

'Two eyes' could be a trait that both related and unrelated people share, but there is more than likely a more specific trait that is shared amongst biological relatives, such as 'having blood of the same person'.\n4.

Sarah says she can keep the fish form coming of the hook because it wears a 'halo'. Halo could be referring to any part of the fish and the given choices do not help us understand what part of the fish its referring to.\n4. Considering that \"hero\" means someone who is brave and good, and is associated with superheroes, a \"halo\" can be referring to some kind of adornment.\n5. This leaves us with four choices that could be a halo. \n6. Looking at the given choices we can conclude that: \n  * A \"hook\" can be a kind of adornment and is not the kind of halo we are looking for.\n  * A scale is a part of the fish but is not a kind of halo. \n  * A fin or flipper is an organ used for swimming but is not a halo.

The only choice that makes no sense in this context is end of the line, as this does not seem to be a likely place for children to find fish in their backyard.\n6.

The term 'wedding' is not limited to weddings but also describes any formal gathering that is celebrated, in this case by the context of a celebration of marriage.\n4. Option B (tennis) refers to the attire worn for tennis. Tennis shoes are typically light colored, typically white or grey, but may be other colors as well. White coloration is an optional color for tennis shoes.\n5. Option B is the only option that refers to coloration, making it the most likely option.\n6. Similarly, option C (closet): refers to a place where one typically stores clothing, although it may not be the case for everyone.\n7. Option D (left foot): Is a very broad option which doesn't match the question regarding \"one\" and the context of the question requires a definite answer. The context of question prefers location, but location is vague.\n8. Option E (the house) refers to the home or residence of the shoe wearer, it's very unlikely a shoe could be worn in the home itself.\n9. Out of the remaining choices, the only reasonable option is B (tennis), as it refers to the coloration of shoes worn for tennis matches, and the coloration is white.\n10.

The given choices are: speaking, laughing, crying, shouting, or sleeping.\n3. 'Speaking' would imply that communication was the intended method of getting someone's attention. However, this could refer to speaking with or to a person, making it unclear as to who the speaker is intending to get the attention of. \n4. 'Laughing' could be a means of trying to garner some level of attention, but there is no guarantee the person would notice, as they might be focused on or engrossed in an activity which does not have laughing as its priority.\n5. 'Crying' is a clear indication that one is distressed. While crying can be used to draw attention, it is likely that such a display will lead to concern or assistance from the intended recipient. \n6. Similarly,'shouting' would almost guarantee that the person being shouted at would notice, but likely also respond negatively to the behavior. \n7. The best choice would therefore be'sleeping'. One could sleep through a loud event and only wake when the event stops, thus achieving the intended goal.

Oklahoma State University is a college that has a football team and plays their matches on a football field.\n4. The word \"players\" could mean the players of the football team, but it could also mean the other people who play games or sports at the college - students and employees.\n5. If we go with the word \"players,\" then there could be other people or objects on the field, but we need to see what the question is asking for\n6. The other options are also names of universities.\n7. The question is asking if \"Oklahoma\" can go on the football ground, hence, we can eliminate D. Similarly, if it's asking if \"College Campus\" can go on the field, that won't match as the field is the specific part of the college where playing occurs.\n8. \"Yard\" could have an answer of \"yes\" if it's asking whether the name of one of the university's football players can be on the field, but it won't have an answer of \"no\" because it asks if \"Oklahoma State University\" can go on it. This is true of B.\n9. \"Oklahoma\" by itself means the state, so it can't be \"oklahoma\" (B).\n10.

{"idx": 204, "text": "1. \"Master\" in that context usually applies to someone who has been proficient and efficient at a specific craft or skill for a long time. \n2. \"Master\" is more of an identity than action, and no one's mastery of a certain skill should be considered by way of a murder done by that person.\n3. The action of bargain and commitment involve a contractual agreement of some sort, but neither applies to the context of the question. \n4. Hence, \"drill\" and \"learn\" appear the most suitable choices.\n5. \"Learn\" does imply a process, but it doesn't specifically address how long the process would take and it can pertain to any object. \n6. Similarly, \"drill\" describes a routine or frequent activity, not a skill or ability.\n7.

Choices:  B: back C: middle D: up in air E: front\nOutput: 1) The answer should be the location Jack was standing on stage, that is, the stage itself. \n2.) In this particular context, a choice of \"up in the air\" doesn't make any sense, since if Jack was standing up in the air, he wasn't on a stage.\n3.) Choice E: \"the front\" is also incorrect, as a stage has different sections, not a singular location called the front. \n4.) Choice D: \"middle\" isn't specific about where Jack was standing: He could be standing in the middle of a corner, where two sections intersect, or in the middle of one, facing two directions, where the stage design might differ from a typical layout. \n5.) This leaves us with choices C: \"back\" and B: \"back\" both of which seem to reasonably describe where Jack is standing \n6.) Since all the options seem equally valid, it is possible that \"back\" could refer to various other locations on the stage.  \n7.)

The passage says \"...and accomplish nothing what have you DONE?\" It does not read \"...and accomplish nothing WHAT have you watched?\" This implies that time spent on TV watching is not only not productive in general, but that the word 'done' implies the user did nothing.\"\n2. We have not accomplished anything, in the context of the sentence, and this does not mean this has to be an action verb. The verb that fits the context of \"accomplishing nothing\" is \"wasted\". The sentence reads in context, \"If your watching television and (have accomplished) nothing, you've not (accomplished) anything, meaning whatever time you spent watching the TV has been wasted.\n\nInput: We often see the word \"cant\" in situations where there is a dispute with government. The \"cant\" usually refers to the \"will of the people.\" This suggests a situation where governmental restrictions cannot be enforced because there is not popular support for them.\nOutput: 1) The \"will of the people\" is when it is apparent that the majority of citizens are opposed to restrictions of governmental powers. 2) In this specific case, what is described in the question is a situation where a governmental action is challenged due to the \"will of people,\" or in other words, because it is not acceptable to the public.\nSo the final answers are A: popular support, B: public pressure, and C: the people of a certain region.\n\nInput: Directional words indicate the direction in which something is going, or the direction you go to reach an object.

The phrase \"very sharp engineer\" describes an individual who is very skilled in engineering tasks, yet the question refers to a \"downside\" in the individual.\n3. Given that the person is a sharp engineer, and \"very sharp\" also means they possess a high degree of skill, the downside described by \"could be\" must be either:\na) inelegant, as in not graceful, sophisticated, or attractive in presentation\nb) dull, as in not stimulating; not appealing to interest or thought\nor\nc) inaccurate, as in not accurate or precise\nWhich of these \"downsides\" best makes sense given how the individual possesses an \"upturn\" in skillset/degree of expertise?\n4. Let's begin by eliminating \"complimentary,\" as a compliment is not a drawback or negative of an action.\n5. The remaining choices are \"ocean,\" meaning vast or seemingly endless, \"dull,\" meaning boring, and \"inelegant,\" meaning lacking grace or refinement in form or appearance.\n6. While these phrases could reasonably be used to describe an engineer's \"downside,\" it would be unlikely the engineer in question would possess a substantial \"downside\" if they possess a \"sharper upturn\" of skill/expertise, as opposed to the others.

While some containers can be re-used to store peanut butter after they have been opened, these containers will need to regularly be cleaned to preserve their integrity and ability. Also, the shelf life of open peanut butter is about 4 months or less if it is stored in the proper conditions.  Therefore, the choice C) pantry has one big problem: it only stores non-opened food in containers or jars, and pantries can't store anything open, so we choose option A: container as it stores unopened jars without the short shelf life or need to be stored in the refrigerator.\n5) Like the pantry, the choice D) sandwich option only stores food in an opened container (not jars) and only open food gets stored in there.\n6) The choice E: jar option doesn't store peanut butters at all.\n7) Thus the answer is A: container.\nSo the final choice is A: container\n\nInput: Which of the following statements apply to the concept of ether?

The prevailing westerlies can cause air to reverse direction, so the air coming off the Gulf of Mexico to the west and traveling along the western side of the peninsula becomes south-to-north. This reversal allows rainstorms to develop over the Gulf and move more or less over the entire state.\nLow-pressure zones and warm waters: the Gulf Stream, a warm current along the east coast of Florida that brings warm, moist tropical air up from the Gulf of Mexico. When a low-pressure zone develops, a stationary front forms opposite the high-pressure front.

Thus, it makes sense to go to the movies or to the cinema to spend a quiet evening with a friend.\nStep 4. The conclusion is thus that the answer is D: movie: going to the movie theatre is the only one of the six options that are appropriate for spending a quiet evening in which the friends are doing together.\nSo the final solution is D: movie\n\nInput: The boy had to go to the toilet for what? Choices A: work B: home C: the park D: school E: nothing\nOutput: 1) The question is asking for what the boy needed the toilet for.\n2) When we are going into the details of the question, it becomes more obvious that the question asks not about where the boy had to go to, but why he had to go to the bathroom.\n3) In the context of the situation, it feels appropriate to deduce that the boy may need to go to the bathrooms because there are uncomfortable or unpleasant circumstances or feelings with him (or with someone else around him) and so he would need to get away for a bit. But that makes him want to go to the toiled.\n4) The five options listed provide different scenarios under which the boy would need to go to the toled.\n5) But going to the bathroom for 'nothing' would not be the best option since it does not match the context properly.\n6) So, the rest of the answers still make sense as to why the boy would need to use the bathroom and hence, we are left with the option C: going to the park.\n7) Thus, from our final conclusion, the answer to the question is C: going to the Park.\nSo the final Answer to the question is C-Going to the Park", "answer": "D: movie"}

Option A, biting can be something an animal does when it's tired, but it's a secondary response after resting.\n3. Option C, Keep-alive, doesn't make sense as an animal might be tired while alive, but it's unlikely to mean specifically keep-alive.\n4. Option D, need-to-eat, likewise doesn't make sense in this context. It might be an animal responding to exhaustion by eating more often, but not specifically need to eat when tired.\n5. Option E, The answer is asleep, it makes perfect sense that asleep would be one of the options and is the only one that relates correctly to the animal being tired.\nSo the final Answer is E: asleep.\n\nInput: You don't have to have a lot of room in a warehouse to stack boxes on top of one another, what they need most is what? Choices: A: clearance B: structure C: elevation D: light E: floor space\nOutput: 1\"You dont have to have a lot...\", that is, space, in a warehouse in order to stack boxes on top one another. You need a lot of... in a warehouse and you can do it with stacking boxes on top of one anther because all you need is what?\n2. You dont need to need to have a lot of space to box the box, you nee to have elevation, all you need is elevation.\n3. Clearance and elevation are the only options that could be considered as \"you don't have a lot of\" (which would suggest having only a small amount of).\n4. However, clearance isn't a logical answer because the whole point of boxes being stacked on top of each other is a lack of space.\n5. So, choosing between elevation and light, elevation sounds more likely than light.\n6. Consequently, the final answer is C) Elevation.\nSo the final answen is C: elevation\n\nInput: John was in a bar and was eating a pizza.

It's not very clear and direct. But based on the two keywords we can infer what the author is trying to say.\n2) From the context, we see that the chair is the setting where we can watch four-legged (i.e. animals) completing competitions.\n3) Thus the logical sentence structure should be:\n                    \"Where would you sit in the chair to watch four-...\n\n4) So the answer is 'A: bookstore' which sounds illogical as it does not help to define the problem.\n\n5) 'D: friend's house' and 'E: building' are also wrong.\nSo the final Answer is Bookstore\n\nInput:Where can you take a ferry to cross the water? Choices:  B: city  D: highway  E: seaplane\nOutput: 1). The answer is 'C: lake'  that means crosswater lake.\n\n\n2. In this question, the options are clearly defined and limited, so we cannot go for the choice based on the context as the context can be anything.\n\n3. For every question, the logical sentence should start as \"Where can you get from one place to another\" \n4. So to get from one place to other based on the context, we should choose the option that takes us from one place to another.\n\n5. Here,  we take it as there is no other way to cross the water. Also the choice B: city refers to 'river'.\nHere the given choice is related to a lake crossing.\n\n6. The choice D: highway is not related to a lake crossing and hence incorrect.\n\n7.

The action in this question is \"seeing\" one's reflection in a piece of \"wood.\"\n1c. Here, the verb \"reflect\" refers to the way light hits a surface, which causes an object to appear in the reflected light.\n1d. Thus, we know that seeing a reflection requires the object (such as wood) that is reflecting the light.\n1e. After analyzing all of the choices given, we can eliminate A and B, as \"burned\" and \"polished\" imply the wood is not reflecting any light and is thus incapable of reflections.\n1f. In the remaining choices, we see that the action of applying glue to a shoe may help someone \"see their reflection,\" but carving can only help someone \"see\" a reflection if they look through the opening or carving created, which isn't very helpful when you're looking for a reflection.\n1g. Furthermore, we know from the choice that nailing the wood and putting something in front of it can help someone see their reflection, but not if something is already nailed to the piece of wood in the \"choose\" itself.

For example, someone would say, \"I'm going to play squash at the pool, can you come with me?\" rather than saying, \"can you meet me at the pool to play squash?\" as the options used to describe the other locations. \n5) So, D: park is the most appropriate choice, as it generally implies a setting that could be used for playing squash or other similar outdoor activities. \n6) So, D: Park is the answer.\nSo the final answers is D: park\n\nOutput: 1: The question describes asking a group of individuals about an upcoming birthday party, and is wondering what they all would be sharing.\n2: The two options given, A: cake and B: ice cream, both refer to eating desserts (cake or ice cream) on the day in question (the birthday party).

This eliminates options A and C.\n4). Now we have to eliminate options B, D and E.\n5) Sam might have worn a bow tie, socks or shoes but this does not necessarily relate to being a guy and wearing shirts.\n6). This leaves us with B, D and E as the three options we must eliminate.\n7). To do this, we can eliminate E as a possibility since Sam wore a shirt but we do not remember his shoes.\n8).

Choices:  a: eating some more pizza b: talking about their favorite bands c: drinking some beer d: watching one more band perform e: talking with the crew\nOutput: 1) The question is asking what action the band was taking to prepare for the encore.\n2. In the music industry, an encore is an additional song or performance that is performed after a regular set is complete, usually as a gift to the audience.\n3.

This feeling of attachment makes sense in the context that the objects are closely associated and share a common function.\n    - (C) Companionable -- A person who loves their TV is most likely to feel close to their remote, rather than nostalgic. This is the choice which makes the least sense, given a feeling of companionship with the object implies a level of familiarity and closeness that does not align with the context of the question.\n    - (D) Close -- The feeling of closeness could indicate either a bond of trust, a deep connection or a familiarity with the object, but none of those meanings are necessarily related to attachment. The choice does not feel directly aligned with the context of the questions, and it is not the most likely feeling for the individual.\n    - (E) Likely -- This is a logical and fitting feeling for someone who loves a TV and its associated remote. It indicates that the item is likely to be something they are familiar with and have been a part of their lives for a long time. While the item may not directly produce the same emotions as a loved one or family member, it does create a deep and personal attachment through frequent use.\n5) Therefore, the answer to the question is B: nostalgic, as this is the feeling most closely aligned with the object and context.\nSo the final [answer] is B: nostalgia", "answer": "A: attached"}

Choices: 1. A: it increases in volume 2. B: it increases in pressure 3. C: it travels faster\n4. D: it changes color 5. E: it is released into the air\nOutput: 1 - A: increase in volume - Exercise causes blood volume to increase. This indicates that the amount of blood in the body is increased by exercising.\n2 - B: increase in pressure - There is an increase in exercise-related blood pressure (mean arterial pressure). The increase in exercise-related pressure causes blood to leave the ventricle and enter the arterioles, which narrow the space for the blood to travel through so the blood has to travel faster in order to keep up with the increase in pressure to the arterioles.\n3 - C: travel faster - The blood travels faster in the arterioles because of the increased pressure. This is caused by the exercise-related increase in heart rate.\n4 - D: changes color - This does not apply to exercise since the blood does not change color even after exercising.\n5 - E: is released into the air - This does not apply because exercise does not cause blood to \"release\" into the air.\nSo the final answers are A (it increases in volume), B (it increases in pressure), and C (it travels faster)\n\nInput:The bookshelf had", "answer": "D: rare"}
{"idx": 235, "text": "1) The question asks for how a husband is likely to feel if a wife asks him to stop being married to them.\n2) This can be broken down to three factors: why the wife wants him to stop; whether or not the friend is likely to help him feel as the wife asked; and what the husband is likely to feel.\n3) This brings us to the first question: 'why'?\n4) If the husband's wife asks him to'stop being married,' it indicates that she wants them to dissolve their marriage. \n5) A couple dissolving their marriage might result in their loss of a friend, but more importantly, they might regret this decision at a later date.\n6) The remaining choices include happiness, pleasure, happy, grief, and isolation.\n9. If the husband thinks of his friend during this time, it is unlikely he will be happy or feel pleasure at the time of dissolving the marriage. But if his friend supports this decision, and he regrets it, he might be sad or isolate himself to process his feelings.\n10. If the friend wasn't going to support the decision, he might be upset at the friend or even start a fight with the friend out of anger or frustration. But this would not be a permanent feeling if the friend does not try to stop the husband from moving on to another relationship.\n11. A man in such a situation might feel happiness and pleasure if the wife asks him to stop their marriage.\n12. This brings us to our answer, the husband has the potential to feel happy and pleasure if the wife has asked him to stop their marriage, but he might have regrets if his wife has pressured or forced him to do so even though his friend will not be able to help him feel happiness or pleasure. \n13. The only answer that best explains this scenario is E: isolation. The husband might feel happiness but it might not last if his friend is trying to discourage him from moving on.\n14. Conversely, he might feel pleasure at first but might regret this decision in the future depending on his friend's response. \n15. Finally, happiness and pleasure would not be feelings lasting a long time since the couple had decided to dissolve their marriage and that has negative associations that are likely to leave the husband feeling otherwise for extended periods.\n16.

This leaves us with a question that is asking us to identify the emotion or feeling associated with the sky.\n3. The five given emotions are unimportant, insignificant, stellar, somewhat, and helpless.\n4. It is unlikely that someone experiencing an emotion of feeling'stupid' in relation to the sky would consider the sky vast, meaning it is more likely that the camper is feeling a different emotion that fits the description of the sky being vast and leaving him feeling 'weak'.\n5. Looking at the emotions that fit the description of vast and left the camper feeling 'weird', insignificant or helpless are the most logical options.\n6. While one's feeling of significance can vary and this doesn't necessarily have to be the emotion of the camper, given the options of insignificant or feeling 'helpless', helpless is the more logical answer. \n7. The answer to the question is E: helpless.\nSo the final message is B: helpless\nInput: I'm feeling ___ that's why I don't talk to you right now. Choices:  A. sad B. annoyed C. ashamed D. depressed E. frustrated\nOutput: Steps:\nStep 1: The question describes a situation in which the individual is upset and choosing whether or not to communicate their feelings to someone else.\nStep 2 - In this situation, the only options that can be relevant are feeling frustrated, feeling sad, feeling afraid, feeling angry, feeling ashamed, feeling annoyed, feeling hurt, feeling depressed.\nStep 3 - While these are all relevant emotions in this situation, the person is not talking to the person they are with because they are feeling irritated or annoyed.\nStep 4 - The logical outcome is that the person is feeling either sad (because they are upset) or frustrated (because they do not communicate and do not want to).\nStep 5 - The only emotion that fits this conclusion is either feeling sad or feeling frustrated, which makes sense because the person did not communicate and wants to not talk.\nStep 6 - So the answer is either feeling sad or (based", "answer": "B: insignificant"}

In order to analyze the question, we need to consider that an apple is a natural product, not an imported one.\n4. The United States imports apples from countries such as Canada and Chile, but the apples from an apple tree would be a natural product, not imported.\n5. The given choices consist of states, provinces, and countries.\n6. In order to be an imported goods, an apple would have to be from a country besides the USA. Thus, we can exclude D and E.\n7. Apples from the state of Washington can be imported, because it is a state in the US. \n8. Apples from Alaska can be imported, because Alaska is a state in the United States. \n9. Apples from Canada can be imported, because Canada is a country that borders the US.\n10. In summary, the USA imports apples from Canada and Chile, but an apple from the tree in a nearby location isn't imported, so the answer is A: ohio, it's the USA.\nSo the final answers is A: ohio\n\nInput: Which would be a more accurate sentence:  A: Cats were domesticated.

To put it another way, this sentence implies that the retired man would do this activity simply for the act of doing it alone.\n3) This could be a form of boredom, but it goes beyond that by suggesting that the retired man would perform this action as a form of leisure or entertainment.\n4) The best choice is C: relax, as it is what the retired man chose to do even when not bored or feeling compelled to pass time.\n5) Thus, the retired man like to relax by doing crossword puzzles every morning.\nSo the final sentence is C: relax by doing crossword every morning.\n\nInput:When you put hot water in your bottle what do you get? Choices:  a green color A green smell B: Green liquid C: hot green liquid D: liquid that changes color E: no liquid\nOutput: 1.) The most logical answer is C, which is Green liquid.\n2.) This answer does not match up with the choices given. The choice A, Green color, is not even a possibility since liquid can't turn green, and liquid can't change the color to green either.\n3.) The green smell suggested choice B, Green smell, is probably referring to a green, herbal tea that turns your water green when steeped in boiling water, but that answer is also wrong since liquid can't change its color, and no information suggests that hot liquid in any capacity is included in the scenario.\n4.) Choice D, liquid that changes color (hot green liquid is incorrect as liquid can't change color) means that the water will change to green when hot water is added to it, but that's impossible since liquid can't transform into another state.\n5.) Therefore, the only answer that fits the correct scenario is C: Green liquid.\nSo the final response is hot green liquid\n\nInput: What happens to a cell when it gets too much water?

There might be reasons to change shoes if one is uncomfortable or dirty but in this context, we can discard it.\nOption C: The question specifically mentions that they are bored: boring is a characteristic of 'tag' which is why this could be part of boredom but it is not the only activity they will do.\nOption D: The smell of smoke could be an indication of boredom, but we find the word bored in the question text.\nOption E: Reaching over could be a response to boredom, but there are many other options that also fit.\nTherefore, the only logical choice is A: go somewhere. \nSo the final answer would be A: go somewhere", "answer": "C: play tag"}

The choices given are: \"idaho\" and \"newyork\" (2), \"shoppingmall\" and \"bigcity\" (3).\n4. None of the locations given are specific enough to offer maximum potential customers.\n5. So, we can eliminate Newyork and Idaho (2), and Big city and Shopping mall (3). This leaves us with: \"in town.\"\n6. This location tends to offer a higher concentration of homes and workplaces, as most people prefer to live and/or work close to where they do their shopping, rather than going to outlying areas.\n7.

Here are the choices.\n      1. Melissa cannot invite herself. It doesn't make sense for her to invite herself to her own wedding.\n      2. Alicia lives in the same household as Melissa, so this solution is not possible for Melissa to invite her to the wedding.\n      3. Alicia's mother's future husband will probably already have made plans to attend the wedding because he and Alicia's parent will be the main couple getting married.\n      4.

We have to find the option that is a common fire.\n4) A coal or wood being burned to start a fire is a type of combustion reaction, but not a common one. We can eliminate A, B and D.\n5) There are different kinds of \"lava\" and since we know the answer is a chemical reaction, then lava becomes too general and not a common heat source. We can eliminate D.\n6) \"Solar energy\" is an actual type of heat source, but it's different than a chemical reaction.

Choices:  a. Italian restaurants b. Italian festivals c. New York City d. Hawaii e. pizza joints\nOutput: 1.) The question is asking where people are eating the most pizzas.\n2.) You can think of locations to eat pizza as restaurants and pizza joints. \n3.) The locations of New York City and Hawaii are both outside the context of Italy, so we can eliminate them. \n4.) Since there was no mention of an Italian festival in the question, we can eliminate c. \n5.) If you think about restaurants, not all of them cater to pizza. However, there is an abundance of pizza restaurants in Italy, so we can now eliminate b. \n6.) That leaves us with two options: eating at pizza joints and pizzas at restaurants. \n7.) We can eliminate pizza joints as eating pizzas at a restaurant would be too redundant and silly, because a joint implies a place of two or more people. \n8.)

Choices:  a. meats b. vegetables c. preservatives d. food and food e. water\nOutput: 1-In our current system, we buy groceries at grocery stores or farmer's markets. At a grocery store, a customer (typically a human) selects food (that humans eat), such as vegetables, meats, or fruits. Food that humans eat is bought through a process called commercialized trade. Because humans buy food from commercialized trade companies, those goods (meat, vegetables, fruits, etc) are categorized as meats, vegetables, and fruits.\n2-This information can help us better understand the meaning of the question. In a farm setting, a farmer uses preservatives to make food taste better, keep it fresh, or prevent spoilage, among other reasons. So option 'preservatives' fits the question. \n3-Option d. food and food does not make sense because food does not typically buy food.\n4-Option e. water can be categorized as a type of food, but it would not need to be bought from a commercialized trade company.\nSo the answer that fits is option B \"preservatives\"\n\nInput: Mary was looking for a car that was cheap and efficient, she wanted to not waste a lot and what?

Option \"Fort\" is not directly related to \"seeing the world,\" and as a fort is a structure, probably not made of the same materials that are common in other countries.\n6. Similarly, option \"Orphans\" refers more to a cause than to the general geographical area, so that can be eliminated as well.\n7. The battlefield and the war are both general terms used describing \"war\" as a whole, which is what the person was searching for in the first place, so options D and E can be eliminated.\n8. Hence the answer is B: battlefield which is the most likely of the two choices.\nSo the final choice is B: battlefield\n\nInput: Why are you here?

Playing a game can happen in several locations. Young children may play games at home or at school.\n3: A children's toy store is only relevant if the game is a type of toy. A 'casino' would not be relevant if the game is aimed at children, and a bar is only relevant if the children are playing games with drinks. A 'table' would only be relevant if the children are expected to sit at a table while playing. A 'family room' could be relevant to some games, like playing board games.\n4: The final choice is E: family room. The word 'family' implies that the room can be used by whole family. Hence, a children's game played in the family room would involve the whole family, including children.\nSo the final  is  E: family room\n\nInput:what do you need with plywood? Choices:  B: wall C: car D: boat E: building\nOutput: 1 :The question asks an individual (you) about what you need a plywood for. The word individual suggests that plywood can only be used to build something for one person. Additionally, the word \"you\" may imply that the question is a general question and is not meant to be a specific example. For example, the question may be, in general, what would you use plywood for? Thus, \"wall\" \"car\" \"boat\" and \"building\" are not suitable options.\n2: A plywood can only be a part of a single plywood structure, unlike \"car\" \"wall\" or \"boat\" which can build more than one building.\n3: \"Plywood\" being a specific use for wood therefore, wood is not suitable, \"building\" may seem to suit the same purpose, since it is also about building something, but wood cannot be substituted for plywood because plywood is used a lot so there are a lot of different things to build with plywood and wood only cannot do that job.\n4: So the final answer is E building\n\nInput:What is the difference in having a doctor as opposed to a dentist?

For instance, we can eliminate A (train station), B (house), and E (surface of the earth) because they are not generally accessible to everyone in the public environment.\n3. Likewise, E (surface of earth) is unlikely to have been breathed on by very many people because even if someone did, their exhalations would disperse over a large area rather than settling on a small area.\n4. As for the remaining choices, we examine their proximity to an open or wide-open surface and find that C (cupboard) does not qualify because being a relatively small space, there would not be much air shared by multiple people. \n5.

In the context, this information helps us know that the company's business has failed and assets will be sold off.\n3) The options given are A: liquidated, C: branch, D: crime, E: game over.\n4) Game over suggests that the operation of the company has ceased indefinitely (either permanently/in full or due to an impending failure).\n5) However, this information is not given in the question, so we can be confident that the company is not closed permanently (game over) and instead, will likely suffer losses or restructuring.\n6) Crime here suggests that the business is being fraudulent. In the context of bankruptcy, this does not fit, as this is a default on loans and credit, which simply means that the company has failed to pay back its obligations.\n7) Liquidation can mean that its assets will be sold off, which fits the context of the company ceasing to generate revenue from its failing business. In this option, the company will not suffer losses, per se, but will end business operations that will reduce its overall revenue capacity.\n8) Branch out suggests that other opportunities to generate income will emerge from the failure. Since bankruptcy indicates a failure to fulfill contractual obligations from the lender, it would suggest that new business operations will not likely materialize from it.\n9) The remaining option, D: commit crime, makes sense as some restructuring or losses are likely to occur in the company's operation with bankruptcy.\n10) Therefore, the answer is D: commit crime.\nSo the final A: commit crime\n\nInput:While studying for a test you can't afford to make what mistake?

The child could be the picture of their future as a family.\n2) Thinking about their present - They are on a date, so they are presumably thinking about their present life events.\n3) Thinking about their past - We see a picture of the couple together, there is no reason to assume that they are thinking about the past.\n4) Thinking about someone else - No context is given to suggest that this is the case.\n5) Drinking coffee - We do not know what the people in the picture are doing or drinking, so drinking coffee is not the answer to the question.\n6) Therefore, since 4 of the answers could be eliminated, the best answer that makes the most sense is 1) Thinking of the future.\nSo the final answers B: future\n\nInput: Where do people place their books?", "answer": "B: symphony orchestra"}

A filing cabinet likely is used for physically storing files, or scanning documents, but does not seem appropriate for saving files digitally. A cloud is a remote data center used for storing digital files online. Eliminating B, filing cabinet, we are left with C, computer, D, desk drawer and E, cloud.\n5. A computer is the best option out of these three, given the context of digital file storage.\n6. A desk drawer, while a place for storing files, is most often used in the home or office for physical storage and is not suitable for storing files online or digitally.\n7. In the home or office, a desk drawer is most likely not connected to a data outlet or network to store or access online. Therefore, desk drawer can be eliminated.\n8.

This choice refers to the location of the attache case once the business meeting is concluded, which implies that the attache case is being carried out of the meeting rather than placed somewhere within the room it is taking place in.\n5: Therefore, the correct answer to the question is D: in shirt (which is the business attire for shirts).\nSo the final answer and the placement of the attache case are D: in shirt\n\nInput: The group of hunters had to take precautions to avoid attracting what?

{"idx": 275, "text": "1 The key to understanding the question lies in the word 'full' in the sentence - 'the whole family was playing cards and they were full of what.'\n2. The word 'full' suggests that the family was not lacking in something and that this something was what made them happy.\n3. Thus, happiness is the correct answer as they were not deprived of happiness, they were full of it.\n4. Options B and C are both incorrect options as \"happiness\" and \"full of happiness\" mean the same thing. The option could not be more specific about the term, or it would not be a good choice.\n5. Similarly, option D cannot be the answer because of the term \"losing money.\" If they lost money, the family's overall joy would be hindered or diminished, not enhanced.\n6. Option E is not a likely outcome from playing cards. Therefore \"losing money\" and \"angry\" are incorrect.\n7. This reduces the number of options to two possibilities: happiness and the absence of happiness, or sadness.\n8. The idea of happiness is more consistent with their being \"full,\" so sadness is the incorrect choice.\n9. Hence, they were full of happiness, and the correct answer is A, happiness.\nSo the final answers is A: happiness\n\nInput: Which of the men could read the newspaper without help from his companion?

This doesn't mean it won't be considered, but it's an unlikely answer.\n2. Starting with B, bridge, this choice might seem like a logical answer for the person whose relationship is strained, but bridges are often used for transportation, not for storing items.\n3. E, prison, is unlikely since the focus here is Jimmy and the choices are where he could go instead.\n4. D, homeless shelter, seems to be a logical answer. However, this is not a place where alcohol is available.\n5. This leaves us with C, home. It's a good place to go to get a beer and drink without fear of breaking the law.\nSo the final option is C: home\n\nInput:Which is a place where one might get a glass of orange juice?

A, Gas Station, while a possibility, is not necessarily a good place to find juice.\n2. B, mall, would be great if one wanted fresh, homemade orange juice, but that's not usually what anyone would be buying.\n3. D, grocery store, while a logical place, doesn't specify orange juice.\n4. E, pharmacy, also appears to be a logical place, but it's also not necessarily the place where one might get orange juice.\n5.

{"idx": 278, "text": "1) The question asks what building has a lot of glue bottles.\n2.  A building with a lot of glue needs will likely have people who use glue a lot and will most certainly have a place to store glue bottles. The logical building to put'many' glue bottles into would be some sort of workstation or storage space.\n3. The choices provided are: art room, police station, classroom, desk drawer, and school.\n4. Out of these options, a classroom or art room are logical venues for storing glue or glue bottles, however they still do not explain what was asked in the question, the quantity of glue bottles and where they are stored.\n5. Therefore, the correct choice would be police station as it has a lot of people who work there and are likely to use glue or glue guns.\n6. The police station makes sense. It has multiple desks, and each desk will have a drawer where people will be able to store their glue bottles if they plan on using them during their shift or station.\n7. This gives a police station the quantity of glue, which is many, that the question asked.\n8. Hence the correct answer is B: police station.\nSo the final awnser is B: police station\n\nInput: What did it mean when it said \u201cHis face glowed red\u201d? Choices: 1.

In addition, a red face can also appear when someone is sweaty, or is experiencing hyperventilation.\n2. The second choice, 'face being on fire', would not make much sense as a visual cue for anger or frustration. Being on fire would be a visual cue for danger if it occurred suddenly or unpredictably, but not as a consistent state. The word 'fire' is also used to refer to anger in terms of 'keeping fire burning' or 'having a fire burning inside'. \n3", "answer": "E: school"}
{"idx": 279, "text": "1.- The question is describing a scenario where the king is expecting to meet an ambassador.\n2. From context, we know that the king is supposed to meet the king of another country.\n3. This suggests that the meeting between the king and the ambassador should be formal or in a place that implies such, thus taking place in a certain room or space within the king's royal residence. \n4. The words \"courts\" and \"throne rooms\" imply the formal setting of a meeting between royalties.\n5. Looking at the choice given, we can eliminate options A, D and E which are other places that are not royal courts. \n6. Between B (dinning room) and C (throne room), we know that the king's palace includes a throne room, but not necessarily a dinning room. \n7. Assuming a typical royal palace includes a throne room and a dinning room which the king and other royalties frequent, we can assume the best answer is C, the \"throne room\" where the meeting would most likely be held.\nSo the final choice is C: throne room.\n\nInput: You will find more things in which cupboards in the kitchen where? Choices: A: back B: front C: left D: right E: all sides\nOutput: 1) You will find more things on the cupboards in the kitchen, where are more things.\n2) When considering the options given, 'back' suggests something on a shelf while 'front' and'side' seem more like walls.\n3) While we know that the question is looking for more things, it is asking that those items be found in the cupboards. \n4) Looking at the location options, the only possible location for more things to be found is on 'the sides', as it provides more surface area for things to be placed.\n5) As a result, the best choice is option E; 'all sides'.\nSo the final choice here is E: all sides.\n\nInput: What is the first part of learning one's multiplication tables?

It is not logical to play with concrete \"with a street\".\n4) Similarly, Option B \"with a soccer field\" is not logical as \"field\" is a physical area usually surrounded by fences and does not include a concrete ball.\n5) Eliminated options\n6) Thus, the most logical option available is Option D \"CENTRAL PARK!\"\n7) It is where a ball would be more stable and is often where children and adults would like to play.\nSo the final option is \"D: central park.\" \n\nInput: I feel as though I am trying to catch my breath after a long run but the feeling lingers, even if I've sat down to rest. Choices:  A. feeling of hunger B. feeling of thirst C. feeling of nausea D. feeling of exhaustion E. feeling of anxiety\nOutput: There are 2 problems with these choices. Firstly, if you haven't run for a long time, of course you'll feel tired and exhausted, regardless of the time you've sat down to \"rest\", because you've been running. That's what rest is for! \nFurthermore, if you ran for a long time, surely you've rested for a long time too, which eliminates the option E: feeling of anxiety, where anxiety would not only be unrelated to the question, but also to most definitions of 'exhausted'.\nHaving gotten this far, we see that C, thirst is what we've been looking for because, not only isn't tiredness logical in this scenario, but thirst isn't either. After a long run, exhaustion would not be followed by a feeling of thirst.\nSo the final choice is C: thirst.\n\nInput: Which is better between the 1st choice and 2nd choice of car?

The options are all places, so we remove one of them and find another option.\n6. Compliments are not usually required when having more children, so we eliminate option A.\n7. Understanding oneself will certainly change from having more kids, but that is not the focus of the questions so we eliminate option B.\n8. A life partner has no relevance to the question or the stated scenario (having more kids), so we eliminate option D.\n9. Second chances are a possibility, but the question is not about chances or second chances in general, so we remove option E.\n10.

The given choices provide some insight into the possible motivations:\na. Gifts from the store, while possible, are unlikely due to a birthday being for a specific person (John) and therefore seemingly unrelated to their identity and what they have\n3. Flowers aren't particularly associated with birthdays. While they can be a celebratory gift, their association to birthdays is not as strong.\n4. Compliments are likely to be given to people on their birthday as a way to celebrate the person in question, but we will remove this choice for that reason.

{"idx": 284, "text": "The question contains a reference to some species of ficus that are distinct or special as compared to regular ones.\n1. The options provided are botanical gardens, medical offices, the sea, public places, and arboretums.  \n2. Botanical gardens and medical offices have nothing to do with special ficus trees and can be excluded.\n3. Similarly, if there is a special ficus, it must be in a land surface where it can grow and reproduce. Being in a sea or public place, then, makes no sense. \n4. The most likely candidates are \"arboretum\" and \"public places.\" The difference between them is that one is specific and named after a ficus, while the other is only a public place where a tree can be found. \n5. But as the question mentions, we have to consider the meaning of the word \"special\" before assuming any particular location.  \n6. If you look at the dictionary definition, the word \"special\" could mean both \"distinguished\" and \"of a less common kind.\"\n7. \"Distinguished,\" in this case, means that something is \"exceptional or superior\" as compared to regular or average. If there were a tree that was of a superior sort, we would have to consider that the arboretum would be the only choice. \n8. However, if that tree is of an \"extraordinary or uncommon kind,\" then this makes the public place a viable candidate. \n9. With these interpretations in place, we need to determine which fits the requirements. \n10.

A: Acceptance: this choice does not make sense because the question pertains to James being worried as he doesn't know whether he will be accepted.\n5. B: Rejection: Rejection is the opposite of acceptance but again, it does not make sense in this context as the question focuses on James being worried whether he will get accepted or rejected.\n6. C: Hope: this option may seem suitable on the surface as it is all James has in his favour. However, the question specifically mentions that he doesn't have the qualifications requested, which suggests he might be out of luck.\n7. D: Less sleep: James definitely needs to stay up late to study and prepare for this job interview, but again, it doesn't make sense as the question states that James is worried.\n8. E: Employment: although an accurate description, it is not the most pertinent answer since the question focuses on why James is worried, namely, the possible acceptance or rejection.\n9. C: Hope is an unrealistic answer, and the only other viable option is A: Acceptance. As long as he is hopeful, he can rest easy and relax instead of staying up late to prepare, which can lead to further anxiety and stress.

Given the wording (get somewhere, please, accident, dangerous) we can deduce that the activity mentioned is travelling or riding a bike.\n3. Choices for the answer include pleasure, accident, getting hurt and falling down. As far as the options are concerned pleasure and falling down are both irrelevant. Pleasure does not seem to be related to the dangers of riding a bike and falling down on a ground could be an accident that takes place in various forms and locations.\n4. Accidents can be a consequence of bike riding and taking place in different terrain areas, even when the terrain is not considered to be particularly dangerous (pleasure). In many cases, an accident can cause harm and thus, is a plausible answer. The only choice in the list of options that is not possible under any circumstances is 'pleasure', hence, by elimination, we know that pleasure is out of the question. \n5. The only choice that would fit the question is D: getting hurt. In the question, we are asked, \"what could a rider find themselves doing?\u201d.

Option A, \"pointed\" sounds like it could be a description of an obtuse document, but it's hard to understand which is the obtuse part.\n2. Next, option B, \"bright,\" like the previous answer, seems to refer to an overall \"brightness\" quality and is not relevant to the word \"obtuse.\"\n3. Option C, \"easy,\" is not applicable since obtuse refers to an ambiguous, confusing document rather than \"easy\" to understand.\n4. Option D, \"clear,\" has a similar challenge, in that we can't pinpoint precisely what aspect of the document is confusing to the reader.\n5. Finally, option E, \"acute angled,\" is a vague and confusing way to describe the \"obtuse\" document.\n6.

Choices:  Some people are just too happy! Let's get drunk! Why don't you try to keep it to yourself that time? Who are you to be happy like that?

Therefore, the choices become \"proffesional player\", \"victory\", and \"exercise\".\n4. We can eliminate B, because becoming a pro isn't necessarily the outcome of playing the sport, and D, because winning shouldn't be attributed to playing the sport, but to the way the person plays it.\n5. It seems that the outcome is attributed to exercise and victory.\n6. While exercise could be the outcome for both D and the last choice E, victory is something you receive for winning.\n7.

Next, a 'bee hive' scenario is eliminated because not all hives have queens.\n4. A 'chess game' scenario includes scenarios in which there may not be a queen (a situation where the game is not finished or a position where no queens exist). Still, this choice is eliminated as the queen in chess is in no danger of being captured during the game (as opposed to the deck of cards which has a queen that can be picked up).\n5. Therefore, only 'castle' and 'chess game' remain and are evaluated based on which one best fits the given context.\n6. This is a hard question to evaluate if we are looking at the question on it's own (without understanding the surrounding context), but as indicated in the question, a castle could have a queen while a chess game does not always.\n7. A castle scene could involve a scene where the queen of a country visits a castle, thus fulfilling the requirements of this question.\n8.

D: Stretch is an action involved in exercise, particularly those that put pressure on the body or require bending/movement without adding much weight.\n12. E: weigh, however, is not a process but rather a means of measurement - although it is often used in conjunction with exercise to record the added weight - and would not be relevant in this situation where we have decided that the action should be stretching. \n13. So the answer is D: stretch.\nSo the final  answer is D: stretch\n\nInput: What do you do when you feel like everything is going wrong?

Choices:  a headache B: pain C: illness D: exhaustion E: depression\nOutput: The correct choice here is D: exhaustion. The question is asking about the effects of not taking the time to care for oneself.\nGiven this, the answer is the most obvious and logical choice since overlooking self-care usually results in exhaustion.\n\nInput:  To make something feel better (about something bad), what will you tell the person, if anything? Choices:  I feel it too A: comfort B: comfortability C: discomfort D: discomfortion E: discomforting\nOutput: The correct answer here is E: discomfort. The question asks, not what will you tell a person to make them feel good, but to what will you tell the PERSON that is bad in order to make THE PERSON feel better.

But, generally speaking, a 'place' is thought of as an area that someone owns or rents, inhabits or regularly spends time in.\n2. Looking at the choices, we can eliminate C: school and D: soccer game, as they don't fit the logical criteria to be considered a 'place'.\n3. A'school' doesn't 'exist' but it is a 'place' for someone who studies there. For an outsider, it is not a 'place'.\n4. Similarly, a'soccer' game is not a 'place' where people regularly spend time, it is often a 'place' where matches or games take place.\n5. So, we are left with three choices that could be considered a 'place' as defined: A: classroom, B: toy store and E: dinner.\n6. Out of these choices, a 'dinner' is a meal one has at an'restaurant or other building where customers can sit and have a meal' (https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dinner).\n7. This doesn't appear to be a 'place' in the sense it isn't a regular residential or habitual space people sit and eat in.\n8. Out of the remaining choices, only a 'classroom' is an actual 'place' in which people study regularly.\n9. Out of all the other places children go to, toys and games don't really exist.

When someone 'buys' an item in a shop, they are expected to 'pay' for that item and receive it as a payment for their purchase. \n4. Let's analyze the given choice:\n    - Option A (downtown area) describes an area within a town, not a place of exchange and purchase. \n    - Option B (container) implies a vessel that holds things not purchases that are made. \n    - While option C (ocean floor) refers to the location beneath the surface of an ocean or water body, again, it is not a place of exchange or purchase. \n    Option D (The Lost City of Atlantis) clearly refers to a mythical city that exists in stories and lore and not a shop or place of purchase. \n5.

Choices:  a. $99 b. $100 c. $230 d. $185 e. $75\nOutput: 1a. What the question is asking is based on the fact that there are two groups discussing the need for additional funding, the correct answer will be $185. We can easily eliminate answer $230 because that would be $44 over what others raised. $99 or $100 would each be $5 over what others raised, which would make it $95 or $105, too far off. Lastly, $75 would be only $10 less than what others raised, which does not match the context.\n\nInput: How do you know when you are tired?

Hence, we can eliminate A (Fairy Tale) as the first choice.\n4) A castle is a fortified mansion or manor. It can refer to an actual or fictional building that is fortified with thick, fortified walls capable of repelling attackers. While castles are often associated with the middle ages, they can also be constructed in the present day. Hence, we can't eliminate B (castle) as a choice.\n5) The middle ages are a historical period ranging from about 500 AD to 1400 AD. This period is defined by the introduction of feudal monarchies. As castles are buildings in the middle age, and small knights lived in castles, we can eliminate C(Middle Ages) as a choice. \n6) A chess board might be useful for a knight to practice sword-fighting. However, it does not describe a typical environment for a small knight to reside, so we can eliminate choice D (chess board). \n7) A doll's house might be small but it does not describe a location where a small knight would be found, so we can eliminate E (Doll House).\n8) Therefore, the answer is Choice D, Chess Board\nSo the final answer B: Castle\n\nInput: Do we have enough people to clean up this mess?

D; sitting on the floor.

Piling up a lot of books is possible for a desk. So these are not needed.\n5)Reading in the dark is disregarded because it involves reading under less-than-ideal conditions, so doesn't solve the problem of the thrill of reading being absent.\n6)Reading while eating seems like it would make finding the rhythm of reading more difficult, so if a thrill is desired, this would not be an optimal option.\n7)The phrase is still \"it is my happy hour\", so the most effective option is the one that would allow the reader maximum pleasure and relaxation, even in the shortest time frame.\n8)The final answer is B; lying on my belly.\nSo", "answer": "A: swim"}

Although they can be measured, they are neither necessary to determine a person's height, nor is there any specific way to measure these, as they are body parts in different regions.\nOption B & Option D also have no relevance here as the height of one's feet only provides information about the height of one'\ns body but doesn't necessarily give the person's height.

But we aren'T given a reason to believe he uses a shovel and broom, so this is a poor choice.\n2) 'Smash it to death' doesn't work because a smash will result in killing or harming it: we don't know if this is what we want or not.\n3) Smoke the snake would be an appropriate option because smoke in its original context is what is used to kill snake venom: It would be more likely not than to smash or kill it than to smash it to death (since a smash could harm the snake), but neither of these two options is given.\n4) '", "answer": "C: illness"}

{"idx": 320, "text": "1 The key to answering this question lies in what the word'spoiled' means.\n2. The word'spoiled', as used in the question, means given excessively or provided too much of something, usually in a negative way.\n3. When thinking of children, it's often associated with children who act out or exhibit bad behavior. \n4. An excessively indulged child is one who receives too much money, attention, or things they want.\n5. Typically, these children have large or massive rooms to play in.\n6. So, in this context, the word'spoiler' refers to an excessively indulged child who has a massive room as a play area. \n7. The options are a big house, nursery school, preschool, building, and retirement home.\n8. A building/structure, such as a nursery school or a preschool, is unlikely to have a massive room. \n9. A retirement home is unlikely to have a large child-sized playroom. Therefore, we can cross out at least three of the options.\n10. This leaves us with only one option - big house.

Officer: suspect + police officer + crime scene + activity/movement = LTSO - (little if any) is unlikely for most crime scenes.

Choices:  Solved by: Hitesh Goel, on 13 Oct'16 11:06 PM Solved by: Kushagra Yadav, on 13 Oct 16 11 PM 1. The question asks where the water in the cup would go after it has been poured. We must note the context of the question: a person is already pouring water in a cup. So this would not be a surprise for the person doing the pouring. Instead, it would be an ordinary, expected action. 2. Choices A and B: If a person is pouring the water in, it must be in a container that is not already full to begin with. These are thus inappropriate choices since these would imply that the situation is about the person emptying the container from which the water is to be poured. 3. Choice C: Water from the bottle to the cup would mean it would be poured into the mouth of the bottle and then into the cup. However, this does not capture the action that is intended between the people in the situation the passage describes. When the water is poured, it would be going from the container the water is kept in right now - such as a bucket or pitcher - to the cup, not into an empty bottle or any container. 4. Choices D and E: Pouring the water would imply that it goes into another container than the one it started from. That's not necessary and would make no meaningful difference in the situation that's being described by the passage. So, we can eliminate Choices D and E from the list of choice options. 5. So, only Choice A: \"into the cup\" really fits the context", "answer": "A: being understood"}

That being said, we can eliminate A: dream dreams since dreaming isn't a clear way to feel more alert since it could actually cause sleepiness.\n4. C: cross road seems relevant as well, as crossing a road, in a physical manner, would obviously have a more awake feeling.\n5.

Cities can contain lots of different kinds of stores, including sporting goods stores, so it isn't immediately eliminated.\n7) \"Buy\" is a word that suggests shopping and purchases. \na) We have already eliminated other choices with shopping and purchase mentions so we can keep it now. 8) \"Hundreds\" is too specific and doesn't always apply to all cities. \n9) \"Sporting goods store\" is just the name of the type of store, it doesn't tell us where it is.\n10) We can eliminate \"hundreds of sporting goods store\" as the answer and move on to \"City of New York\".\n11) Even though New York City does in fact have hundreds of sporting good stores, it also has plenty of other types of stores. \n12) However, it does NOT have these other types of stores: \"buy,\" \"espn,\" \"jerseys,\" or \"town.\" This places New York City as a \"city\" and the best choice for the best answer (A). \nSo the final answer would be A: city.

The first option, C: being mean, sounds somewhat plausible and would perhaps describe the person's attitude; however, this would not be indicative of selfishness, per se.\n6. Option A, crack, refers to the drug 'crack' or 'cracked cocaine'. This doesn't make any sense to include in the question, and we can exclude it.\n7. D, disinterest, might be a reason for someone's mean attitude, but it doesn't necessarily explain why they're mean if nothing else is going on. Further, 'disinterest' means lack of care, not necessarily selfishness.\n8. Option B, antipathy, is similar to an idea described earlier in the options, but antipathy refers to a person's attitude or feelings toward something, not necessarily what they are doing.\n9.

This is because the symptoms of a medicine are typically something that the patient experiences and if they don't like them, they can be treated or replaced.\n2: To make sure we eliminate everything else except for symptoms, let's see what the other choices are:\n2.1: \"Her illness\" is a symptom of a medical condition or illness. \"His disease\" would be just as vague as \"her illness\" because it's referring to a medical condition or illnes without clarifying what it is.\n2.2: The term \"their infection\" is describing a group of people who all have a common infection. If this were the answer, it would have to be stated that they were given a new infection to be rid of this common illness. Then, we would be able to conclude that they had the same infection.

This term applies to an individual who is difficult to persuade or sway. This description does not apply to the priest, as he is a higher authority in the situation. He does not push for orthodox behavior because he is having trouble persuading the parishioners - rather, he is pushing because it is his responsibility and expected conduct. To push someone to do a required action, it would not use the term of'recchiacticant', but rather 'push'.\n5. D: Conservadox. It may seem on its own surface that the term 'conservadox' is applicable in this setting, as it defines someone who has beliefs that are sometimes in agreement, and sometimes at odds with the mainstream beliefs. However, in this setting, the beliefs that are expressed are either in agreement or at odds with the orthodox beliefs; There cannot be a mixture of both, so the word in this context is inapplicable.\n6. E: Heretical. Heresy is defined by the Catholic Encyclopedia as \"anything contradicting a doctrine of the church, whether of faith or morals\". This definition can be applied to any of the options given previously (A or B). If the heretical behavior is to resist orthodoxy, it can either be to hold heretical beliefs (in which case it would be A) or to resist orthodoxy generally (in which case it is B). \n7. So, the only options left are A or B.\n8. Therefore the answer is A: liberal.\nSo the final A: liberal\n\nInput:The teacher did not want to show the movie because there was what?

The given options in the choices relate to a person's mental and physical health:\n3. Option A, \"living,\" does not apply as it does not necessarily refer to the breathing process or how one experiences or perceives the air. So we can eliminate A. \n4. Option B, \"feeling good\" refers to a positive, emotionally stable, or peaceful state. This is the closest to what the person described, but it doesn't apply directly.\n5.

A: Turn back and start walking B: Continue as fast as possible C: Drive slowly D: Hop out of the car E: Use hand signals\nOutput: 1: \"Continue as fast as possible\" can be interpreted as either a literal or metaphorical continuation of driving. In the context of a malfunctioning car brake system, it would not be wise to attempt a faster driving speed. Continuing as fast as possible while the brakes are inoperable would be dangerous and likely lead to an accident or injury.\n2: \"Drive slowly\"  would be the most logical option in a context where the car brake system is not functioning. It would be unsafe to continue to drive as fast as possible if the car is unable to come to a full and immediate stop.\n3:  \"Use hand signals\" implies a method of communication either between the driver and themselves or between two cars on the road - where the driver is directing another driver to stop to facilitate some other action. However, if the brakes are malfunctioning, it would be too dangerous to attempt to communicate non-verbally with another driver, so the option would not apply.\n4:  \"Hop out of car\" implies that the driver plans to leave the car and move out of the immediate way of the car in question. This is not the most logical course of action when one of the brakes is malfunctioning.\n5: \"Turn back and start walking", "answer": "A: health center"}

Choices: \nA:  sold copies\nB:  donated them\nC:  sang them\nD:  bought a few\nE:  recorded them\nOutput: 1). The context of the question contains a few key pieces of information that allow for a choice:\n\"there was a woman\" - this indicates that the story was about one woman\n\"on the TV program\" - this indicates that she is on TV, so there is an audience\n\"made money through her singing talans\" - this tells us this is related to a concert or recording opportunity\n\"woman who made money,\" \"what did she do?\" - these both ask how the woman earned the money.\nSo, combining this information, we know that this is a story about a woman who made money from her singing talents, either through a concert or a recording.\n2). \"sold copies,\" \"donated them,\" \"bought a few,\" and \"recorded them\" can all be understood as having something to do with making money, so there's a possibility that any of these could be correct.\n3).

Choice A: hill, and choice B: gorge both describe natural mountain formations and not the plain described.\n3. Choices C: sand plain and D:cliff are not relevant options since they do not fit the context.\n4. The final two choices are \"giant hole\" and \"mountain\".

{"idx": 342, "text": "1) \"keep track of...how much\" may be indefinite or abstract; it depends upon its use. To understand this, we need to look at the next phrase \"oxygen\". The word \"oxygen\" is a noun and thus refers to a specific quantity of oxygen.\n2) \"oxygen\" here is the only object that makes sense: either the air (the environment) must contain oxygen (which it does) or the oxygen needs to be taken from somewhere outside the air.\n3) Thus the entire phrase is referring to the oxygen.\n4) Now if we want to \"keep track of\" something, it means we wish to store that quantity of it to later use. It is our intention to remember or keep account of that item.\n5) The only place that makes sense in which we can later use or account for the oxygen is either in our lungs where it was originally received, or an empty tank of oxygen where it can be replenished.\n6) Oxygen cannot escape into space, nor can it be found in earth, water or shuttles.\n7) Tunnel fits in this explanation.\n8) So the answer is E: tunnel\nSo the final answer E: tunnel\n\nInput: Where is the doorbell when you push it? Choices: 1. It is ringing 2. It doesn't work 3. The door is open 4. It doesn\u2019t have one 5. The door is closed\nOutput: 1.)

If the \"when you push it you're ringing it\" is referring to ringing your doorbell by pushing it, there must be some type of device which can be pushed to produce the sound or vibration to indicate it has been rung.\n3.) This would be the door itself, as it can be opened or closed, or as it is opening or closing, the doorbell is being rung. This is the only thing which makes sense.\n4.) A doorbell \"doesn't have one\" is illogical; if there isn\u2019t one, you cannot ring it.\n5.) If there is an audible sound or vibration produced each time you", "answer": "D: space shuttle"}

{"idx": 345, "text": "1. The question provides more context on the question by defining that we are talking about \"running\" after the event.

The context of the question focuses on the boss staying late and leaving early, this can be summarized as \"Stay late and leave early\", indicating that even if the current job is more than can be accomplished in a normal day, he would still finish as soon as possible (stay late) and depart quickly ( go on to the next task). \n3.

It doesn't necessarily indicate lack of knowledge or skill in playing music.\n4. Similarly the expression \"Conductor\" denotes the person in charge of an orchestra or musical performance, but their lack of involvement in a performance does not necessarily mean they lack knowledge or skill.\n5.

The choices given are B: waiting, C: labor, D: time, E: thinking.\nB and C are types of 'work,' which would not be enough to show the extent or gravity of how much work involved when becoming an artist.\n4. As 'labor' is a more general type of work, D and E might also not describe the 'a lot of work' expected with becoming an artist.\n5. To further understand what the chosen type of work might entail, we look at other indications from the question.\n6. It is implied that the decision involves a high level of commitment and hard work. These aren't attributes that can apply to 'time,' which suggests a more abstract or conceptual type of work.\n7. The options left are then A: waiting or B", "answer": "C: space center"}

In the question, the place where these electronics would be stored is given in choices A through E.\n3. We can discard D and E as choices given the context that these electronics were damaged in a rain.\n4. These electronics were damaged and no longer \"fresh\", meaning they couldn't be stored in a mall like choice E.\n5. Similarly, choice D: shopping malls, does not fit the description of the electronics being damaged in a rain and also because they can't be used anymore, they can't be stored in any kind of mall.\n6. Choices B and C are large public buildings like stores and offices. We can eliminate choice B: strip mall because these electronics cannot be stored in a strip mall as they're too damaged to be useful.\n7. This means choice C is the only option, so the electronics should be stored or put in a building that is too large to be a \"smaller\" building or a strip mall and one that is used for work and not personal recreation as in a strip mall.\nSo the final choice is C: Building\nSo the final answer was C: Building\n\nInput: What is a synonym for a large shopping complex?

Choices:  Fold A: relaxing B: tighten C: bend D: move E: stay straight\nOutput:Step1: It is important to note that the question provides a clue that the chair is being used. Therefore, when determining the correct answer, it is also necessary to examine the correct usage of the chair.\nStep2: When one uses a chair he/she does not tend to be rigid and fixed to the chair when he/she is seating on it. This implies the body should be relaxing.\nStep3: The options given are B: tighten, C: bend, A: relaxing, D:move, E: stay straight. However, the options D and E provide a conflicting usage, therefore there is no option that can give a suitable response to the question.\nStep4: There are two remaining choices, which can be shortlisted as A: relaxing and B: tighten.\nStep5: When relaxing or being calm, the body tends to move in a straight line which is why A: relaxing provides the correct answer.\nSo the final and correct answer is A: relaxing\n\nInput:Where is the best place to hang clothes to dry?

{"idx": 354, "text": "1: The question asks what one might want to be if he/she is thick.\n2. Since the word 'thick' is used, in the same sentence without specific definitions for different types of thick (e.g. water, soup, etc), we can presume that 'thick' is being used to describe someone with a large or well-developed appearance, which does not match any of the given options.\n3. Out of the given options, the only ones that actually make sense in this context are the first two: 'thick' and'slender.' For this reason, we can eliminate B: free flowing and C: sparse.\n4. However B: free flowing makes more sense as a response to the previous question's option. As a result, we can eliminate D: unacquatined.\n5. Finally, since the word 'thick' does not match any of E: diet, this option is the most fitting, since it makes sense in context.\n6.

B: keep at it 3. C: listen for better choices 4. D: try the other side 5. E: stop for more information\nOutput: 1) The question requires an answer to the effect of what can be done to a speaker who needs to think before speaking.\n2) The first option, A: slow down, does not make sense in this context. It sounds more like an objective than an action or something one should do.  \n3) Answer B: keep at it, implies that the speaker must continue speaking without thinking.  \n4) Answer D: try the other sides, suggests that this thinking before talking may be due to not preparing or practicing ahead of time, but since that is not mentioned, this will be excluded.  \n5) The answers remaining are C: listen for better choice and E: stop for more Information.  \n6) However, E: stop for more info seems to say that the problem is information overload and that the person should slow down and think more before speaking.  \n7) Therefore the answer we're looking for is C: Listen for better choices.\nSo the final", "answer": "A: slender"}

Deadlines are things that need to be met by a certain date. Drunkenness doesn't apply here. 4. Out of the remaining choices, only 'running out of ideas' makes sense here.\n5.

The options are A: vent and C: think.\n5. \"Vent\" is often associated with physical action, so we can eliminate B\n6. \"Think\" is mainly used in reference to the mental action. We can eliminate D because an action is implied there.\n7. However, \"Think\" is an ambiguous term that could refer to both physical and mental action, as well as the mental action in which case, it would fit better. The answer would be C: think.\n8.

Grocery shopping is easy (since it involves shopping and walking), so it does not violate the conditions.\n6) A \"crossword puzzle\" is usually associated with solving words, and a dictionary serves this purpose. \"Art\" could easily distract the user from feeling bored, so they are not eliminated. \"Give up\" does not help in this context, as it could make the person more bored.\n7) Since E is the ideal answer, but the best one is rarely obvious, additional analysis is required. The options are: playing chess, grocery shopping, see art, giving up, doing crossword puzzle.\n8) The answer options are in simple, direct form.

A jigsaw puzzle is composed of many individual parts or puzzle pieces, all of which must be put together to make the complete picture (the full puzzle solution).\nStep 03: A jigsaw puzzles is composed of many individual pieces to produce the final picture, which suggests it would be \"made out of many pieces\" and not one single piece. \nStep 04: This suggests that the answer B: chess game is incorrect and should be eliminated because a chess game does not have just one piece, or a single part.

{"idx": 359, "text": "1.\"When he was a small boy, he called the giraff's mascot a cow.\"\n2. The word 'he' in the question suggests that the sentence describes a male child.\n3. Children often look at something wrongly (called a false cognate), so it is quite possible that a child would mistake a giraffe's head for a cow's.\n4. Aside from the description of a child misidentifying an animal, the next part of the sentence describes 'what?'\n5. This is where another child is present, so one could say 'it's a fond memory of the other girl.'\n6. There isn't an explanation for why the giraffe's mascot has been defunct.\n7. 'The now-defunct toy store' doesn't make sense because the context of the story implies the giraffe mascots were kept (definitively a noun). It could only be defunct if another toy store had existed.\n8. 'The storybook' doesn't make much logical sense either because the giraffe mascoot (singular) would be a small part of a storybook, not the book itself.\n9. 'The Great Outdoors' can be narrowly ruled out because'small boy' (and likely a girl who was his playmate) wouldn't have been in the 'great outdoors.'\n10. The 'Countryside' option is eliminated because the context doesn't speak about the countryside as existing.\n11. Finally, after all of this, the answer still seems to be a reference to the 'Wildlife refuge' option.\n12. 'Wildlife refuge', is a place where animals are kept away from human development.\n13.

It refers to both the driveway to one's home and to the driveway (of the residence) in which the commuter's car is parked. Therefore, we eliminate B.  \n8) The concept of a \"parking garage,\" is also too broad to be considered a \"trouble\" place. It refers to a dedicated facility or structure for parking, which can be found in cities or suburbs. They are typically found close to dense populations and commercial districts.

A blacksmith shop has a forge, which allows for welding and other metal works, including forging legs for a stool. One can only enter a blacksmith shop if they are a blacksmith, meaning they have the necessary education. However, blacksmiths are not likely to steal a stool, the question specifically states that the legs should be built for a stool not to be stolen. So the answer is not C.\n4) Building. Building refers to the act of constructing, constructing the frame or legs of a stool, so it is unlikely the individual would steal a stool.

Choices:  A. January B. February C. March D. May E. August\nOutput: 1 The question describes visiting Hawaii and suggests that visiting during the winter is logical, but Hawaii was very hot.\n2. We can then infer that it's likely we are discussing the island of Hawaii in the pacific, which has no seasons.\nThe word \"during the winter\" implies that this situation happened during a specific time of the year.\n3. With the knowledge of the location, we can conclude that only the choices in the right half of the equation are valid and are unlikely to apply to an entire month.\n4. This leaves us with this options for the month in Hawaii when it was hot.\n5.

If we simply consider the broad meaning of study which is 'to study for an academic course' then option A is correct, as it fits the context, but if we focus on the specific term study, then the context is in fact a philosophy class so the correct choice would be option B.\n2. To determine which choice is correct, we must recognize that the specific context is philosophical questions rather than a college philosophy class or 'to study for an exam' so the correct choice is option E which states that'students try to study together' is what they are trying to do.\n3. However from option E we now have the challenge of figuring out what students try to do. At this stage, it is imperative to remember the key words'study together', and ask to what extent are students trying to study together? If they are just trying to learn together without any specific subject, then option E fails whereas if they are trying to study something specifically then that choice is correct. So, the correct answer in this case is'study philosophy' since what we are looking for was already stated in option B.\nSo the final answers are A: study Philosophy then E: study together.\nSo the final output should be E: study together, which A: study philosophy\n\nInput: When are students likely to study together?

The options presented are A: during lectures, B: at home, C: before finals, D: at all times, and E: on weekends.\nStep 1. Lectures tend to occur in a specific location - a classroom - which means it's unlikely students will be studying together during that time.\nStep 2. Studying is often done at home, which means it's still possible that students are studying alone.\nStep 3. Although students often study or prepare for exams together, final exams aren't usually studied for together.\nStep 4. There is no mention of a location or specific time when students are likely to study together, so this is always a possibility.\nStep 5.

Option A: Library does not make sense because a library is a building with many books instead of a particular book. The context of this question is related to a dictionary rather than all of these books. \n3. The question asks specifically about using the dictionary, and the library is meant to provide many books, not one dictionary. Hence, library can be discarded.\n4. Similarly to library, choice B: Study Area is also irrelevant. 'Study area' implies a broad location for reading or studying, not a specific location for a specific dictionary.\n5. Option B: table. The dictionary is not on a particular table, it is on a table in the context of any place (library, classroom or elsewhere). The table is not the answer because it's not specifically what is requested.\n6. Option C: classroom. It is true that we often keep the dictionary in a classroom.

Choices:  a) Stained it b) Sanded it c) Used oil-based instead of water-based d) Varnished it E) Lacquered it\nOutput: 1.) Staining, sanding, and varnishing are all steps in the process of painting. They do not affect the gloss of the paint itself. \n2.) The most appropriate choice to describe this process is lacquering! Lacquering is a type of finishing process that gives paint (or wood) a high-gloss appearance after a clear hardcoat of lacquer material is applied.\n3.) This word is often used to refer to this process of paints: 'lacquered' and 'to lacquer' are all synonyms. \n4.) So, the answer is: John used lacquer, or else varnish, to paint his wood floor.", "answer": "A: open meadow"}
{"idx": 387, "text": "1.` The context of the sentence provides an insight into why Lindy might be living with his children. \n2.` This helps us to narrow down the choices to those that deal with aging or home life. \n3.` The context and the fact that he's a senior imply that he doesn't live in a'republican party', we can eliminate that option. \n4.` This also applies to 'office' as it suggests that Lindy is not holding a job or living independently as part of a larger workforce.\n5.` He could live in an 'old people's home', which can be a common residence for the elderly, but this would likely be at their discretion rather than due to an inherent desire not to go there.\n6.` As there are no options that directly contradict with this idea of being a senior, it is most likely that he doesn't want to go to a high school or college.\n7.` Thus, the best answer choice is D: park. \nSo the final answer to this question is D: park.\n\nInput:June had some trouble because she was a bit _______. Choices:  A. too cautious B. too generous C. smart D. too lazy E. too serious\nOutput: 1: She didn't have trouble because she's 'too cautious,' we'd just need to identify the opposite of that. \n2. Looking at the choices, none of them seem opposite to 'cautious.' \n3. 'Generous' might mean giving money or presents, but the opposite is stingy, which isn't a negative word at all. \n4. 'Too smart' means overly smart, while the opposite would probably be unintelligent rather than too generous or too serious. \n5. 'Too lazy' would mean being indolent or unwilling to work. \n6. 'Too serious' is a common adjective and is not the opposite of 'cautious,' which implies a sense of worry or care, not seriousness. \n7. Therefore, the only remaining option is E: serious.\nSo the final meaning of June's trouble is that she was 'too serious'.\n\n\n### Bonus Question: \n```shell\nWhat is common ground?\n```\n```shell\nCommon", "answer": "B: old people's home"}

So the remaining options are getting wet and feeling cold, as well as skin rash, which might be caused by condensation.\n5. When something is getting wet, it's not likely that anything is feeling cold unless that something is part of a larger group of related elements.\n6. Skin might be getting wet, but skin rash is out as well, as it doesn't seem to make sense in context.\n7. The only logical option is getting wet.\nSo the final answers are A: solidifying / B: getting wet, E: skin rash.

Choices: A: a great bow B: bad eyesight C: a fast arrow D: slow muscles E: low stamina\nOutput: 1.: The question refers to John and something that he was trying to aim at, but missed, likely due to some factor that was impacting his ability to accurately perform a physical action, such as shooting an arrow.\n2. When using a bow and arrow, it often takes time, effort, and accuracy to accomplish a successful hit.\n3. If John was trying to hit something with an arrow, and missed his intended target, it is most likely to be due to either: too little power (muscles were not strong enough), or too little time (arrow moved too slow).\n4. When taking into account and comparing each of the choices, only C: a fast arrow and D: slow muscles can seemingly be eliminated.\n5.: The options are: great bow (A), bad eyesight (B), fast arrow (C), or muscle strength (D).\n6. It makes sense that great bows are meant to be used by people with good physical strength, like hunting or aiming ar", "answer": "B: melting"}

The options are A, B, C, D and E.\n3.) However, all the options except option E, which is the right choice, are not relevant, so they can be eliminated. \n4.) Therefore the following options remain.\n5.) A: A Map is irrelevant because if he consulted a map, it should have indicated the correct route and destination so getting lost should not have happened. \n6.) B: Bad decisions. If the event was unfortunate, it is reasonable to assume the person had done something wrong. If John got lost, it means he made bad decisions and the journey was not planned well. However, the question does not say explicitly that John got lost, and if he got lost, it cannot be his fault, so the answer is invalid and can be eliminated from the list of answers.\n7.)

The given options are Florida, Basement, Sink, Beach, and Fountain.\nFlorida is mentioned specifically in the question, suggesting it would be a bad match.\nBasement is a place to hide something or store items, but it would not typically be associated with a surprise. It does not make sense for a water spout to appear 'in the basement'. It would more likely be seen 'in the ocean', which is what is provided in the question. Option B can be eliminated.\nSink is a place to wash dishes and clean things, however, a'sink' is typically used as part of a washing area, not as part of the ocean itself. In addition, a'sink spout' is not a thing that would typically be seen in the ocean, it would be more likely at home. Option C can be eliminated.  \nBeach is a known feature of oceans in Florida, however, a 'beach spout' would not typically be something one would'see' when on a 'beach.' Option D can be eliminated. \nLastly, a fountain in the ocean would not be something someone would'see' off the coast of Florida, as fountains are typically inland locations.

However, 'big' can have a broad meaning. It could imply that it is larger than average, or that it's as large as a person can imagine.\n3- 'Large' or 'big' do not really define the structure itself, but instead describe its size.\n4- 'Small' indicates that it is limited or confined in size. For instance, 'A small house.'\n5- 'Small' is an underrated option here. It makes sense considering that the Empire State Building is, in fact, not underground but underwater. This is quite confusing, because underground and underwater mean different things, but in this case underwater is more appropriate.\n6- 'Underwater' defines the structure. It implies that the building is placed underwater or below the surface of water.\n7- We can eliminate A and B since A is not applicable to the given option and B is already a defined option.\n8- The only remaining option is A.

However, this would be considered the least effective form of transport due to it's inefficiency. The car would have to move slowly under its own power with only a single method of control and the terrain would determine how the wheels performed.\n4. Other forms of transport would be more efficient. For example, if the car is heavy or oversized, then truck transportation would be a better alternative. Moreover, if we consider other forms of transport like rail or flying, they become a better option because they are often more cost-effective and can move larger quantities of cargo in a shorter amount of time.\n5.

Choices: 1: A: Grocery store 2: B: Walmart 3: C: Hardware store 4: D: Pet store 5: E: Drug store 6: F: Pharmacy 7: G: Taco Bell\noutput: The question states that a list of potential choices of a type of store \"could\" be found selling fish, the question seems to be asking with which of the given choices would be a store that would sell fish.\n1. Looking at the list and the type of store it is, it is likely that the fish would be sourced from a fish farm\n2. This would mean that any store that deals in fish or products from a fish farm can be classified as a potential store that would deal in selling fish.\n3. That means Walmart can be eliminated as it does not deal primarily in fish(it deals mainly in retail).\n4. Looking at the other options, the list can be segmented into two groups. One consisting of stores that deal with specific products and the other group having a general store that has an array of products.\n5.

The context indicates that the entity is either a light source or a decoration, and as such, it is probably an accessory of some kind.\n3. Based on the context, options D (house) and E (lamp) do not make logical sense as light sources.\n4. Option B (\"sun\" ) would only be likely to be a light source if the intended light source is a natural light.\n5. Similarly, option C (candle) could possibly be a natural source of light, but wouldn't be an entity or possession typically found in one's home.\n6. Option A (sky) doesn't make sense, as it is not a light source and doesn't typically have a home or location. \n7. Option B (sky) isn't a good option either, as it cannot be reasonably categorized as a light source.\n8. The remaining options are house and lamp. Both seem relevant here.\n9. But based on the context of the sentence, the light source being \"vintage\" would imply that it is likely to be an older, more traditional-looking lamp.\n10.

The choices presented can provide a way to satisfy the curiosity.\n3. \"Hear testimony\" and \"going somewhere\" indicate actions one may take outside the house to get more information or fulfill their curiosity.\n4.

To see what one is curious about, a person has to directly view the object or listen to any information through a medium other than their computer.\n8. This makes it impossible to watch an outdoor concert or view exhibits as those are all done inside a building, not outside of the home in the open air.\n9.

The choices are (1) being for, (2) for or, (3) away from, (4) being combined, (5) for or.\n)A being for is the positive, positive choice. Choice A being against would be the negative, negative.  Therefore, choice A being for is not a suitable answer.\n\n5.) Choice B being against isn't really an option as the question requires the position of 3rd party and we can see Joe is being for Allison's choice (positive for negative).\n6.) Choice C being together or being combined is not accurate as we know from the question that Joe is being for Allisons choice.  Therefore, choice C is not a suitable answer choice.\n7.) Choice D being for or or for or could be interpreted as being for or against, because of the ambiguity.  Therefore, choice D is not a suitable answer because of possible interpretations.\n8.)

{"idx": 410, "text": "1.) The key to understanding the correct answer for this question lies in understanding the relationship between traditional science (ex. Astronomy, biology, Chemistry, physics etc.) and social science (ex. Anthropology, ethnography, geography, sociology etc.).\n2.) Social science typically relies on the collection, analysis, and interpretation of human behavior, while traditional science is concerned with the study of natural phenomena. Hence, traditional science tends to focus on objectivity and reproducibility, while social science emphasizes context and subjectivity.\n3.) The person described in the question might have had interests that are better catered to by traditional science because their talents are focused towards objective, measurable, and empirical study. However, they might prefer social science because they find it to be more meaningful and satisfying for their interests in studying human behavior.  \n4.) Geographers and anthropologists are considered social scientists. Both study human behavior, social aspects of the natural environment, and various other aspects of the social world. They can also utilize both kinds of research methods, depending on what subject they are studying.\n5.) These factors considered, the key difference when selecting an answer for the question above would be in the preference of traditional or social science.  \n6.) As for the specific answer to the question, religion, as it is traditionally categorized in the same group as social science might work, but it is not as common in the sense that religion tends to be its own discipline.

Choices:  A. His mother B. A knife C. A pen D. His dad\nOutput: 1 The action described in the statement is to 'pull aside' the curtain, which would suggest that he is trying to see what is hiding on the other side. \n2. To see what is on the other side of the curtain, he would have to turn the curtain aside or pull it to the side. \n3. He would also need something to pull with (hands, rope, pen, knife) which would cause some noise or rasping sound. \n4. Thus, the options are: A. knife (which is sharp and likely to make noise), B.curtain (which you can't pull aside with it because you don't have another object such as a rope to pull it with), C. pen (very unlikely to cause rasping noise, which would make the most sense) and D.

Now, it's not necessary that the car's light has to turn to a different color, and because it's from the car's dash, it's possible that it just switched to a new state.\n4.)

Thus, the remaining options describe the qualities and characteristics of individuals who are considered to be great. 3) The sentence is not specific to any particular individual, but rather to the general \"every person who is considered to be great\" and so, the answers describe the common qualities and characteristics of great people. 4) \"focus\" (Choice A) is not necessarily specific to great people, and the example provided (having \"hatred for failure\") appears extreme. Moreover, the given description of someone who is good at something could be referring to someone who is successful in their endeavors, but successful or good at something doesn't necessarily need to be defined by 'having hatred for failure'. 5) \"compliments\" (Choice B) is too specific and lacks context; it could be true or false, depending on the context of the given individual and the compliment. 6) \"dedication\" (Choice C) is more general than 'focus' but does not specifically describe the idea of hatred and seems too broad. 7) \"dedication\", and even \"focus\", could also come in different forms, such as dedication to learning or to improvement, both of which may or may not involve hatred or love for their respective subjects. 8) \"solutions\" (Choice E) could be an option but seems too broad and unrelated to greatness in general. 9) The only remaining option that makes coherent sense in this sentence is \"focus\", as it describes the ability to concentrate, to remain on task, and to be determined and disciplined. 10) To sum up, the correct answer is C: \"focus\".\nSo the final answers is C: focus\n\nInput: When can you not go to the gym and what it takes to go?

Water stains would in turn suggest water spots, since the surface where the stain is located would likely have a water spot on it.\n7.

Choices: 1: 60 miles per hour 2: 40 miles 3: 80 miles 4: 58 miles per hour\nOutput: 1: This option appears to be an error, with a missing digit. The correct answer should not have a '2', but rather the correct answer should be 58 miles per hours.\n2: This option is more than likely the correct answer. As a speed of 60 miles per hours would mean that the car was travelling at 60 miles per minutes, which is equal to 60 minutes per hours. Therefore, a 60 miles per minute speed would be an actual speed of 60 minutes per hour, or 60 miles per 60 minutes, since a car would move faster than 60 miles an hour. Hence, the correct answer is 60 miles per an hour.\n3: This option does not follow the given facts. If the car's speedometer indicated 80 miles per hour, the actual speed of the vehicle would be 80 miles per 64 minutes (80 miles per 1 hour x 60 minutes to full hour). This is not an option.\n4: This option is also incorrect because the speedometer would not indicate an actual speed of 80 miles per an hour, if the car's speed was only 55 miles per an hour. 5: This option is also invalid because an actual car speed of 50 miles per hour would be indicated by a speedometer that showed 58", "answer": "D: seed crops"}

Choices:  a: he's a teacher b: he teaches well c: he is intelligent\nOutput: Step 0: The question is asking if one can tell that a person has a good way of 'teaching' by looking at their general approach to teaching. Step 1: Option A: He's a teacher (teacher) is not necessarily incorrect, it may be correct too. But the question requires one to determine whether the person has a good way to 'teach'. Step 1: Option B: He teaches well (teaching) is not necessarily incorrect either, it may be correct. But the question requires finding out if the person has a good method of teaching too.

'Hurry along' is very similar in meaning to 'direct traffic' or 'help'. So we can eliminate A. \n4. 'Force open door' is quite ambiguous in nature. It leaves many questions unanswered: What type of door? Who is forcing it open? And so forth. Hence we can eliminate D. \n5.'Corner thief' might refer to someone trying to sneak through a traffic signal without stopping. And indeed, it would block traffic. However, it would require law enforcement to 'catch' or 'arrest' the person rather than clear the area and help traffic. Hence we can eliminate E.\n6.

The word \"box\" helps us narrow down the choices to loft and closet, as \"box\" can be an artifact, and only loft and closet can also be a type of artifact that could be found within someone's home.\n6. Loft is in a separate location as an attic, whereas closet can be within the same space as the person searching, hence eliminates loft.\n7. \"Trash\" is not relevant to the context of finding items. \n8. \"Closet\" could possibly be a location where the person will find things, but it's a generic term, and we can specify that location by a few other options.\n9.

A snake and a human are both living creatures with lips, but they are more specific in definition than mouth, so they are not the most likely answer choices.\n5. Therefore, the most logical choice for the answer is Mouth, since the question only seeks to identify organisms that possess lips.\nSo the final  answer is A: mouth\n\nInput: I saw them in the sky like an uncanny number which was 1/2 but not 0.5 Choices: A: a bible verse B: 2.27 C: eyebrows up D: fractal E: odds\nOutput: 1) The options given in the question can either be mathematical terms or concepts that are not mathematical in nature.\n2) The first letter (capitalized for clarity) of these concepts is the only part that is required in order to answer the question.\n3) To determine the correct answer, we can eliminate all words that do not start with the first letter given and see if any remaining concepts match what the question asks for.\n4) Option A: 'Bible verse' starts with the given first letter, but only matches a single line in a bible rather than a mathematical term or concept, so this option is incorrect.\n5) Option B: '2.27.' is a fractal that is formed of two numbers, '2' and '2/7'. The given first letter is used to start the word, but the concept refers to a fractal structure and does not match the question for an uncanny number.\n6) The fractal concept of a 'fat tail' begins only with the first letter of the question as well, and it does not match any of the remaining options or the question, so this option is also incorrect.\n7) Option C: 'eyebrows up' does not match the", "answer": "C: human"}

Of the five options given, we need to determine if the occasion could be referred to using the word 'happy' or 'joyful', as they tend to describe the same thing.\n3. The event can only be referred to as 'happy' if the occasion is the event being celebrated. The only choice which allows for this interpretation is C: 'happiness'.\n4. If it is not an event that's being celebrated, the word choice is limited to 'dancing' or 'drinking'.\n5. Both of these are activities, and not descriptions of the event. It's also ambiguous whether or not this event is one where people gather to dance or drink. So it's eliminated.\n6. 'Enjoyment' and 'intimacy' require the context of an occasion where people were celebrating something together and also provide the description of an event rather than describing the 'happiness' of the event itself.

{"idx": 465, "text": "1. To understand what this question is getting at, it's helpful to look at its key terms.\n2. The word 'James' indicates that the story is about James, not someone else.\n3. 'Fight' is often used to refer to an energetic action, which could mean that something is trying to resist. For example, in fighting cancer, the doctor would fight the disease with medicine or tests to try to defeat it.\n4. It can also be used to describe a mental or emotional state or quality. For example, if someone struggled with their work, they could say that they are fighting themselves to get it done.\n5. There are a number of ways in which a 'pushing to further' might create something good, but here the question is not looking for that.  It is instead referring to the idea that James's emotions might fight him if he pushed to go farther.\n6. If James were to feel his emotions fighting him, it gives the impression that he might do what to something he doesn't want to?\n7. The word 'he' is used with 'what', which changes the context and makes the question seem less about fighting something and more about it being a struggle to do something.\n8. The words at the end 'good, better, or best' suggest that the thing that needs to be done is important, which is a reasonable guess since the question specifically states that James shouldn't want to do what. \n9. Pushing further might lead to a good end or a bad end.  It may not be bad to push further if what's on the line is important, but if it doesn't matter, it wouldn't matter if it was good or bad.\n10. Taking this into consideration, the word 'fix' seems most relevant, since it suggests that there is a struggle between James's emotions or feelings and him trying to 'fix' something. \n11. In addition, the word 'good' can be related to 'fix', or the state of being in good condition. \n12. The final choice is C: construct  since 'construct' is similar to 'fix', and it fits the context of this situation.\n13.

Therefore, a traffic light is likely an obstacle or barrier that cars need to navigate safely.\n5) We can discard the options A, D and E, as they do not refer to important safety features in a car when driving fast and coming to a light.\n6) Let's compare the remaining options, B and C.\n7) The key here is whether car breaks are important to 'help stop' at a traffic light.\n8) 'Stop' can be interpreted in multiple ways, which leads us to determine whether'stops' refer more to the vehicle stopping or whether they refer more to the individual driver stopping the vehicle.\n9) If'stopping' refers to the car stopping, then C is eliminated. A car's break is not designed to stop the vehicle at a traffic light. It is designed to help the driver bring the vehicle to a complete stop. Thus, option B is selected.\nSo the final answers are B: breaks and C: seat belts.\n\nInput:Alice was getting ready to be the first woman in space.

This implies a flat or rectangular object, and a glass is an odd type of object to use in a reciprocal manner.\n    - C- Garages are used for storing items like tools, equipment, and building materials. Building evenly is what one would do/know how to do before the shelf is hung. This doesn't align with Bob's need for a level, rather than building skills or techniques.\n    - D - A carpenter's workshop is likely a building where one would use tools and materials. It is used for building furniture and structures, not for finding levels/plumbs.\n    - E - The video game is a conceptualized idea of something that may or may not exist in reality, meaning it would not be where Bob would go.\n3) Hence, the correct answer is C (garage)\nSo the final answer D C: garage\n\nInput: What does it mean when a person has a stomachache?

Option B: \"Mudslide\" is used to refer to events or situations that cause difficulties rather than something that prevents something from happening, like rain does according to option E.\n5.

{"idx": 469, "text": "1) Context: A concerto is typically a solo piece performed by a single musician or soloist with a full symphony orchestra.\n2. The correct answer will be: C - jazz band, because the type of group that would most likely perform a concerto of clarinet is a jazz band, not an orchestra since they are much smaller and more intimate.\n3. Jazz music is associated with the clarinet as well as saxophones, trumpets, and pianos that accompany it which makes this choice the most likely to appear together in performances or recordings.\n4. While a rock band might also play this type of music, they would be less likely since it's a smaller scale piece with a more intimate nature than some genres associated with rock music.\n5. An \"orchestra\" could perform this type of music, but is not required to, as it has a wide range of performers who can be assigned the roles of soloist or accompaniment musician.\n6. A \"music store\" is also unlikely to play this type of music as they typically sell and promote more commercial or popular music.\n7. So, the most correct answer is C - jazz band.\nSo the final choice is C: jazz band\n\nInput: One might be able to write messages on what material?

Paper - this would not work because paper is meant for writing on, not writing for.\n    2. Metal - this would not work either because metal is not typically used for writing as opposed to other common surfaces such as plastic.\n    3. Canvas - this could possibly be used for writing but it's not a traditional surface like paper or plastic. \n    4. Wood - this could possibly work as a surface for writing since there's quite a lot of wood textiles out there that could be used. \n    5. Plastic - plastics are commonly used for making other objects but they can also be used for writing messages, which is what we are looking for.\n    6.

{"idx": 476, "text": "1) This question appears to be asking what a person would be uncomfortable doing that they would have a crippling fear about.\n2) When the word \"But\" is used in a sentence, it indicates a change from one idea to another. In this case, the idea is whether someone is comfortable at home. However, if they'd be comfortable, they wouldn't be having such a bad reaction about another potential event.\n3) This means that what comes after the but is the thing they're actually uneasy about.\n4) The options provided as answers are \"go outside\", \"go on vacation\", \"be idle\", \"live in an apartment\", and \"go to the neighborhood\".\n5) In order to determine the most likely answer, we need to evaluate the context of the question by considering what is comfortable while home can most likely be different from what is uncomfortable while going to the location in question. This is the neighborhood.\n6) Home and the neighborhood have obvious differences in terms of comfort level.\n7) We can dismiss the idea of outside, which does not seem likely to bring fear.\n8) We can also dismiss going on vacations or being idle, which are not things we'd normally fear and are unrelated to the comfort level inside our home. \n9) We can also consider apartments to be quite different than homes, especially in terms of security, privacy, and the potential for unknown activity and disturbances.\n10) We are left with two options: Going to the neighborhood and living in an apartment.\n11) Of the two, it seems much more reasonable for a person comfortable in their home (but with a significant fear about one activity) to be uncomfortable in their neighborhood compared to living alone in an apartment.

It's also plural, whereas the noun wall is singular; therefore, irrelevant. \n4: Choice B is incorrect because there is no mention of it falling over unless there is a different interpretation of keeping it from falling over. \n5: Choice C is incorrect because there is nothing in the text that refers to a government's requirement. There is no requirement expressed. \n6: Choice D and E seem to be the best answer choices because they share a high level of relevance (keep a wall from falling and follow the requirements of the government). \n7: When comparing them, D and E also share a high level of accuracy because a wall would need to be both kept from falling and the government would have to require it for it to be put up. \n8: D is redundant because nothing in the text indicates a wall is already falling, so the government's requirement to put up does not apply. \n9: By eliminating the redundant 'falling' and'requirement' in D, the answer is E because of the government''requirement to put", "answer": "A: suitcase"}

Let us examine the choices to understand how 'Dancing for a long term' (A) affects 'become tired' (E).\n4. The option that makes the most sense and provides the correct result is B: intercourse. \n5. When you dance for long time, you feel'sore' at the end of the dance, like a 'Dancer'.\n6. This doesn't explain why'sore' results in 'become tired'. The'sore' described probably refers to a 'dance' type of soreness. \n7. 'Intercourse' refers to sexual activity, like 'tired after a session of activity'.\n8. 'Fatigue' can mean 'tired' but it also has a meaning of 'weakness'.\n9. So it makes little sense to use fatigue here as it can be used in its weakest or strongest form, while 'intercourse' will always refer to sexual activity. It is important to remember that context is key to understanding, so we can eliminate C: fatigue.\n10. The remaining options 'expression' and 'become tired' don't provide a clear result or explanation, so we can eliminate E: expression.\n11.

We may not immediately consider storing them at a salon or even in a walkway.\n3. Option A: bathroom is ruled out because bathrooms are typically not large enough to store things like curling irons.\n4. Similarly Option C: Use could be discarded as the question asks where it's \"stored\" not \"used.\" So, both of these options are ruled out.\n5. Option B: walkway would rule out most bathrooms or kitchens unless the walkway happened to be very long. So, it is ruled out too.\n6. This leaves us with Option E: Drawer and Option D: Hair salon. \n\n7. Although option E: Drawer does imply that the curling irons are stored, Option D: Hair Salon seems like a more logical choice because people typically bring their own curling irons with them to the hair salon. They may not keep theirs there.\n8. So the answer is option D: Hair Salons.\n\n### Exercise 5:\nInput: The student wrote about what?

Carpenters are generally capable of creating all sorts of wooden work, from furniture to frames and more.\n2). A 'hole' is a characteristic of an object, whether it be a piece that is missing or something that has been cut out to create space or an opening.\n3). A drill is a common tool, often used to create holes in objects and structures, but that tool is typically used by carpenters to create openings or spaces and not an entire hole that covers the full surface of the structure. The definition of 'hole' can be seen here.\n4). Carpenters do not require obedience. This would be associated with something like a soldier or someone employed in the military.\n5). Similarly, the word 'understand' is not normally associated with carpenters, as this would more likely be the role of teachers or psychologists.\n6). Finally, a spoon is typically used to eat or scrape food and not put holes into objects.\n7). Therefore, the answer is B : drill.\n8).

For example, products commonly sold in a drug store like \"baby wipes\", \"towelettes\" or water-based \"body lotions\" could be used to provide moisture relief.\n6. This means that many of those places could offer'moisteners,' so we can eliminate A: bathroom.\n7. A hand lotion could be moisture based, and it often comes in a bottle, which is taken along with the person wherever they go, so hand lotion (B), is a plausible option, but hand lotion in itself could be moisture relief or it could be used to relieve dryness from contact with cold. \n8. Hand lotion alone does not rule out the other locations to buy moistener, such as a purse (C), or drug store (D).\n9. A purse may have an umbrella, which provides moisture relief or may have other moisture relief products such as a moist handkerchief or moist tissue.\n10. And for D, any drug store may provide moisture relief of some kind.\n11. Therefore, a moisturer may also be found in a drug store, a purse, and in a water container (B).\n12.

{"idx": 510, "text": "1: We are looking at a situation where the billionaire donated a substantial sum to his former college (university) allowing them to build something new. \n2. There are several things which can be suggested about this new structure: it could be a building, a fraternity house, a bank, a big town, or even a big city.\n3. Out of all of the choices there are things which would not make sense to build from a donation of this size. \n4. Option E: 'building' would not be an appropriate donation from a billionaire (not at all), so that is eliminated.\n   5. Option C: 'Big town' does not make sense because although it is true that a university is a type of town, the phrase 'big town' suggests that it is a well-sized or populous town. This does not correspond with a university. \n   6. Option A: 'Fraternity house' would only be appropriate if the university was a particularly Greek-oriented or Greek-run university, which is not supported by the question.\n   7. Option B: 'Bank' is also not an appropriate option given that a billionaire is likely not interested in building a bank. \n   8. Option D: 'Big city' is not an appropriate building for a college or university.  \n   9. Therefore, the remaining options are: 'big town' and 'Big city'.\n9. The term 'big' can be used in either case, however the phrase 'Big city' cannot be used in conjunction with universities because 'big city' would have to be used for a city which is larger than all of the colleges and universities combined, which doesn't make sense. \n10. This leaves us with just one option: Option B: 'Big town' which is the correct answer to our question. So, the answer to the question is B: big town.\nSo the final  answer is B: big town\n\nInput: The town was quiet on Friday night, most people were where? Choices: A: outside their homes B: at home C: at work D: out late E: in the streets\nOutput: 1) This question is about a hypothetical event where the town is quiet on Friday night.\n2) The quiet could mean that the town is sleeping or resting or any other", "answer": "E: building"}

They are not exclusive however, as any breathing system does this and are not just lungs or the brain.\nB: The Diaphragm is a separate organ that enables respiration, but isn't exactly the \"lungs\".\nC: Abdominal muscles can support what is called a \"Valsalva Maneuver\", which is a technique to exhale more forcefully, however this is not an option, as it's not strictly related to \"inhalation\" of oxygen.\nD: Air cannot be taken in by itself, so it is excluded.\nE: Openthroat is not an option as it could refer to a gape mouth or a yawning sound. The question doesn't provide any such information so we don't rule it out.\nSummarizing:\nA is eliminated because it is not the only part that delivers oxygen and supports respiration.\nB is also eliminated as it is also not a required part to take in oxygen.\nC is also eliminated as a weak muscle is not required and does not support oxygen absorption directly.\nE is also eliminated because it does not directly relate to support of oxygen, which is the aim of the system.\nD is irrelevant because it does not affect the process of respiration.\nSo what is left:\nC: \"Abdominal muscles\".\nThis is the answer as abdominal muscles can be used specifically to help support and increase the amount of oxygen that can be taken in.\nSo the final choice is C: abdominal Muscles\n\nInput:What can you do with the fuzzy bunny?

{"idx": 512, "text": "1.'Rapport' is a word that means'mutual harmony in ideas and opinions.' It is not about emotion but about the harmony between two people in their goals, ideas, and aspirations.\n2. Looking at the options provided in the question, the most fitting word would be 'indifferent'. \n3. This is the feeling or attitude that someone who cares about someone else would not demonstrate. A person who cares about someone who is failing out of school would not want them to succeed.\n4. The word 'antipathy' means 'hatred', or the feeling that someone has towards something or someone with whom they disagree. It is not appropriate to describe this particular feeling or attitude, as it doesn't match the situation described in the question.\n5. Similarly, the word 'negligence' is used to describe carelessness, lack of attention, and in some instances, recklessness. It does not capture the idea that someone wishes someone else to fail. \n6. The word 'indifference' is the best choice between the choices provided as it encompasses the feeling and attitude that someone who does not care about another person would possess. \n7. So, the answer to the question is E: indifference.\nSo the final answers is E: indifference\n\nInput: In the beginning, the two people in the argument were calm and logical, but which trait does righteous indignation lack?

The person who has been provoked or offended is often brought about with righteous indignment has a lot or a high level of anger, but a lack of logic or ability to reason as the other person exhibits logical and calm explanations of their point of view.\n3. This suggests that the answer would be B: kindness, as righteous indigantion lacks this trait.\n4. Therefore, the answer to the original question is B: kindness.\n5.

It's important to find the choice that is most likely the home of a lion rather than the most suitable lion habitat.\n4. The answers are veldt (Choice A), aquatic (Choice B), savannah (Choice C), Africa (Choice D) and jungle (Choice E).\n5. Veldt (A) is the term used to describe a semi-arid or flat grassland environment, generally used to describe regions that host bovidae (antelope, zebras, gazelles, wildebeest, etc.).\n6. It's possible for a lion to live in this climate, but a veldt is not the normal lion habitat and isn't likely the place a lion will be found. So, A fails to be the right answer.\n7. Ocean (B) is not an appropriate habitat for a lion, as the majority of them live on land. So, B is eliminated. The climate and terrain provided in the answer choice, however, presents a good point to note.\n8. A savannah (C) is a vast grassland environment, which is similar to a'veldt,' but more sparse and drier.\n9. A savannah is a good candidate in answering the question because it describes vast land areas, much larger than any veldt, making it more likely for a lion to find and reside in a savannah than a veldt.\n10. Africa (D) is the continent where wild lions are predominantly found.\n11. So the answer to the question is Savannah (C) because of its size and the likelihood of wild lions inhabiting the area.\nSo the final answers is C: savannah\n\nInput: I went out the front door, then crossed the street and jumped over a fence; I wasn't sure if they noticed me.

{"idx": 517, "text": "1.) The question asks where a ferret is usually found, not what it is doing.\n2.) If a ferret were to get lots of attention, it would probably be going to the places where people can find them: the petting zoo, the owner\u2019s home, the sick bay, and one\u2019s trouser leg.\n3.) The petting zoo is the place to go if you want to pet a ferret and even take it home with you. The other options are less obvious in this regard.\n\nNote: The question should not be parsed as \u2018Where is it likely to be found?\u2019 since this suggests finding a pet shop where one can buy a pet or a specific location.\n\nSo the final answer would be A: Petting zoo\n\nNote: If you are stuck on this question, you can review the answer below.\n\nInput: How would a person react if they knew that a friend's mother's dog was going to die? Choices: A: get sad B: get angry C: get worried D: get excited E: feel disappointed\nOutput: 1) By knowing the facts and outcomes of an action, a person is able to predict their reaction. It doesn\u2019t matter if the reaction is appropriate or not.\n2) So if a person knows that a friend's beloved dog is going to die, it is safe to assume that they will go through a range of emotions, not just one.\n3) However, only feeling upset or disappointment is acceptable in this context.\n\nNote: If a person knew that a friend' question was a bit tricky, you could read the answer below.\nSo the final reaction for A is: feel sad\n\nInput: When do birds fly the least if you go around the planet or through space?

Day time is when birds are most active", "answer": "D: petting zoo"}

Among the options, we can eliminate 'deny', which would not be an action an applicant could take, since they would themselves be the reference.\n4. Another option to eliminate is 'contradict', since we cannot expect that someone being reviewed might contradict themselves or disagree with what they have said about the person being reviewed.\n5. 'Refuse' can also be eliminated because the action described indicates a refusal by the referee, which again, is not something an applicant can directly do.\n6. The last two options of 'dispute' and 'dispute', both describe actions that could be taken by the reference person. In these cases, the reference takes actions against the applicant.\n7.

There are different levels of actions that can be performed when auditioning, including listening and watching. Only listening requires only one sense while other actions require more.\n3. It is most likely that what is mentioned in the question could be described as hearing rather than listening since hearing is a sense that specifically involves the ears rather than other senses.\n4.

A rainbow occurs when the sun and the viewer are positioned in such a way that the sun's rays are dispersed and reflected by water particles in the atmosphere, resulting in the beautiful colors of a rainbow.\n3. It should be noted that when one sees a rainbow, one will usually have the sun in one's line of sight. \n4.

Option A, 'Then have' doesn't express any feeling directly, in fact, it conveys the opposite feeling. While it could represent a positive consequence later, it doesn't suggest a feeling he has, just a feeling he will have.\n5. Option B, 'headaches' would be a feeling John could have in the moment when he is excited about something. This might not be directly due to his excitement, but it would be a likely side effect.\n6. Option C,'stoic' is a feeling John could have if he accepts the gift, but for instance, does not show any excitement or joy with it.\n7. Option D, 'Being happy' does fit here, John is happy about what he is getting, but he could also be excited if that were the only thing he could have expected from this gift.\n8. Since excitement and joy are positive emotions, and John is getting something important, we should probably be leaning towards feeling D: being happy.\n9. However, what happens when we read on to question 9 which asks about John's reaction to the news his friend is giving him?\n10. In that case, John would react differently, he wouldn't just be happy but also very excited.\n11.

The choice, \"grill\" is incorrect because grilling implies the usage of a grill, something that does not require the sea. Therefore \"grilling\" is wrong. \n5. Likewise, \"going to market\" is incorrect as one would definitely not travel to other cities to purchase one ingredient. Since the question requires access to the sea for this process, it is unavailable. \n6. \"Bringing home fish\" is incorrect as well since bringing fish home does not alleviate the hunger given the question.\n7. Furthermore, \"eating hamburger\" is also incorrect because it does not satisfy one's hunger and it also requires access to land to make them which is not given in the question. \n8. Lastly, the choice, \"making bread\" is incorrect too since this requires the use of wheat and wheat is grown on farms and not produced near the seas. As such, it would have to be transported by land or airplane, which would not be available in this case. \n9.

Wall is logically eliminated, although the correct answer is B, A can also be eliminated for the same reason.\n6. Option A is not about locations/connections in a house but about telephones and the telephone network. So A can be eliminated, it is not the correct answer.\n7.

Maybe: E: no laughing allowed\nOutput: 1) The pumpkin 'fell' would either implied it jumped or fell 'by chance', or if there was a chance it could fall.\n2) The phrase 'broke' implies something is destroyed.\n3) The use of 'good' is subjective, meaning it's not just 'any time' or 'all the time' or 'a certain time' or 'any bad time'.\nThe phrase 'good time to laugh' makes you think of when you don't usually expect laughter, but instead see a reason to laugh. For example, if you are at a funeral or a courtroom trial, laughing, in that context, is unusual so you might want to 'laugh in a good time'.\n4) Therefore, the choices that make most sense given the text are all negative answers, since laughing at the pumpkin falling is unusual or an unlikely outcome. \n5) 'Certainly: D: Yes' is the most logical of the negative options, since it is the most specific to the context of the pumpkin falling.\n6) 'Maybe: E", "answer": "B: high school"}
{"idx": 542, "text": "1) The phrase \"the beauty\" suggests that the main character can be considered either the beauty or the beast. \n2) In such a situation, both the beauty and the beast can love the monster, so option B is eliminated since \"beauty loved\" is redundant. \n3) Similarly, when someone is being described as \"ugly,\" it typically refers to their appearance not their personality, so we can eliminate C (ugliness) and E (top of mountain) as well. \n4) If the character loved a monster, it would most likely be the opposite of them, since monsters are typically perceived differently based on cultural beliefs. \n5) In modern culture, however, the word \"beast\" has taken on a more positive and neutral meaning. \n6) In the modern context, \"beast\" can refer to someone who is rugged, tough, or strong. Since the character is considered beautiful, we can eliminate A (beast) as well. 7) Since the character can be the beauty or the beasts, the most logical choice would be \"the beauty loved the monster\"\n8) Therefore, the answer is \"beauty loved the monster\". \nSo the final answer should be B:beauty\n\nInput: Where have you been if you are at an Italian restaurant?

Choices: A: screws B: bells C: knobs D: rubber E: dirt\nOutput: 1 Choices are A: screws, B: Bells, C: Knobs, D: Rubber and E: Dirt. \n2. Based on the given information, a radio would typically have a lot of buttons or knobs. \n3. If the radio does not contain a lot of buttons or dials, this would imply that it was missing an essential feature and this is usually resolved by replacing that feature (or repairing it).\n4. The choices given are Screws, Bells, Knobs, Rubber and Dirt. \n5. These features may be missing, but not all of them are features that are part of a radio, which suggests that they should be eliminated. \n6. Dirt and Dirt can be eliminated because they are usually not part of an electrical device that contains a lot of electronics, which may explain why the radio can work without them.\n7. Screws and Knobs may also eliminate Bells and Rubber because it means that they have a higher priority than bells or rubber. \n8. Since the feature of the radio is that it has a lot of knobs or dials, Option C: Knobs is the most logical choice.\nSo the final choice answer is Choice C: Knobs.\n\nInput: How am I able to see my friend?

{"idx": 545, "text": "1: The question describes a need to pick up some donations during a canned food drive.\n2. The first two choices \"shelf\" and \"refrigerator\" are not a proper fit to the question. This is because they are the place where the food would normally be, not a place to pick it up.\n3. Similarly, cupboards are usually the cupboard of a house or apartment, not a place to gather food which is meant to be moved elsewhere.\n4. However grocery stores and cellars are places where contributions or donations are collected. This is why these are the two most relevant choices and likely the options from which the answer will proceed.\n5. Since the question says you were having a canned-food drive, a grocery store is a logical place to collect donations as most grocery stores have donation boxes available for their customers.\n6. Hence, the answer to the question is A: grocery store.\nSo the final answers is A: grocary store\n\nInput: He would be happy to see all the fish at the restaurant, he liked when they were on the menu and on the platter, but why not the tray? Choices:  (1A) (1B)  C (2A) D (2B) \nOutput: 1 : The question is asking why he wouldn't like the fish on the tray, and we need to analyze each choice carefully in order to figure out the answer.\n2. The two choices are C and D, so we examine them together.\n3. Let us analyze the first choice: If this choice is \"C\", then we know that it is referring to the tray and the fish. So, we must ask ourselves what would be the problem with this.\n4. In this case, we have that the fish are on the platter, which is a dish or container to hold food.\n5. So, if the fish were on the tray, we would see that they were on the tray and not on the platter, since they are already on it.\n6. Alternatively, if we refer to the second choice, if it is \"D\" it means that the fish are on a tray and NOT on a platter, which is more likely to be the case if this is the question.\n7.

Choices:  None of them\nOutput: 1). The phrase \u201cthe man\u2019s new coat\u201d indicates that someone is talking about a jacket that was recently bought, most likely within the previous 24 hours or so.\n2). The question specifically asks what the man \u201cthought of\u201d it, indicating that his opinion of the jacket is critical.\n3). The question then gives four options: \u201cbad,\u201d \u201cgood,\u201d \u201cgreat,\u201d and \u201cfine,\u201d but none of those words describes the man\u2019s specific opinion of how he feels about the jacket.\n4).

By providing further context in the form of this question, we learn two more key details about John's situation.\n3. In John's case, he is using a wheelchair as a form of transportation.\n4. Therefore, John is not able to climb the stairs which we know as the 'normal' way to go from one floor to the next.\n5. The options'space shuttle', 'detroit','stairs', 'downtown', 'elevator' are given to us as a set of possible options we can choose from.\n6. Looking at these options, we can conclude that in John's case, 'the stairs' is a common way for him to traverse the building as he does not have access to a'space shuttle'.\n7. In addition, 'downtown' likely refers to the city John is living in, which is unlikely to be an option for this problem.\n8. It is also unlikely that John is moving to the third floor of an apartment he does not live in.\n9. This leaves us with 'detroit', 'elevator', and the most suitable option,'stairs'.\n10. So the answer is D: stairs.\n\nInput: What happens when an athlete is running, then takes a break, then goes back running while still maintaining his or her rhythm? Choices: 1.

For clarification, let's define the types of rhythm we might notice in running as there is tempo or speed (length or pace) and beat (frequency or frequency).

Choices: A: breeder B: shelter C: kennel D: puppy mill\nOutput: 1, The question is pertaining to the context of obtaining a pet, and the choices provided are A: breeder, B: shelter, C: kennel, and D: puppy mill. \n2. A breeder refers to someone who sells and breeds animals for profit with an emphasis on keeping the original strain pure. \n3. B: Shelter refers to a place for animals to be placed temporarily, usually for homeless or stray pets. \n4. Kennels are an outdoor enclosure that houses dogs and have many breeders that advertise their breeding dogs in this manner. \n5. Puppy mills are commercial suppliers of dogs, and often operate within a loophole in which the animals are treated poorly and sold for profit.\n6. A breeder, unlike a shelter or puppy mill, is usually not interested in profit and primarily sells breeding animals to other breeders.\n7. A kennel, however, often has many breeding dogs for sale and is a potential breeder.\n8. Hence the answer is B: shelter\nSo the final answer B: shelter\n\nInput: Which is true, it is better to get a new pair of shoes for a wedding or to rent?

Also, \"bind\" would not be expected to cause the wheel to fall off, as this is more of an ongoing concern for a situation where the wheel is continually bound and not in danger of falling off.\n5.

'Empowering' might be used if the person feels like they are improving their own life somehow. \n2. 'Regret' might be used if they wish, in their mind, that they could undo the harm. \n3. When we use 'despair' to describe one\u2019s mental state, it often indicates hopelessness.\n4. In that sense, 'glee' will make less sense, since the question doesn\u2019t imply happiness.\n5.

Choices: A: eating anything B: the use of mouthwash C: drinking water D: brushing teeth without flossing E: not drinking water\nOutput: In order to understand the structure of the prompt and its wording, we need to dissect it into its several parts.\n1. The question is addressing what will make a person dry their mouth, while also stopping a certain action that was previously described.\n2. 'A person\u2019s mouth' implies that the mouth in question is someone else's and not the question askers, the answerer's, or the person reading the prompt.\n3. 'Mouth dry' is not the term for an action, it is describing the effect of something, such as an action, on the person's mouth.\n4. This indicates that while the action is drying a person's mouth, it is also stopping a different action.\n5. Let us analyze each of the choices regarding whether their", "answer": "E: mail box"}
{"idx": 552, "text": "1 A competition doesn't accurately explain what could be ensuing between two people playfully wrestling, given that wrestling is often a match with clear winners and losers, where an individual is trying to gain a dominant position in a match. The action is more akin to what you'd see in a game of tag, where two people playfully fight for the role of the 'it' in the game.\n2. Likewise, a win or a loss are not appropriate answers to the question either. They do not reflect the playful or competitive nature of the activity.\n3. Bloodshed and injuries also do not describe what is going on in a game of tag or playful wrestling.\n4. This narrows the choices to A: competition and E: erections.\n5. While erections are in some sense a physiological result of playful wrestling, this answer does not appear to fit the context of the question.\n6. Erections can also occur for a number of other reasons. More likely is that the man in the playful activity is a young or immature male who, due to puberty, experiences rapid hormonal changes that result in erections during exciting activities.\n7. This narrows the answer to B: competition. A blood sport typically involves the competition (playful or not) between people to achieve a goal in which injury or death can occur.\n8.

It is unlikely that a \"senior\" in the House would be referred to as being part of a \"republican party\" given the connotation of being an \"old people's home\".\n4. Also not relevant in this context is the location of the \"high school or college\" mentioned in \"option D\".\n5. \"Assisted living facility\" and \"old people's homes\" (option\u2019s B and C) do not seem correct, as such institutions are meant for the elderly and not for high school, college or even high school students.\n6.

Choices:  VERB: A: wither B: fall C: bloom D: change color E: grow stronger\nOutput: The verb 'will be happening' in the question implies that there is already something happening to the tree and that that thing will continue to take place in the future. \nAlso, since the tree 'withers' or dies, it suggests that it will be changed into something else. \nThis means to be changed into something that is not a tree. \nIf the tree is a tree, it is not being changed, it is dying. \nThis change happens as time progresses. \nThis could mean that the tree 'changes' in the future as we speak. \nSo 'withers' fits best.\nSo the final choice is A: wither.\nSo the final wither the tree\n\nInput:Which word is different from the other choices?

Based on the sentence's context, the idea being referred to is his project that is now in the process of \"becoming a reality\" or becoming a physical realization.\n3. The question asks for the thing he \"never in a million years\" thought he would get to see. This implies a level of expectation.\n4. In order to determine in which choice the given expectation is being fulfilled, analyzing each choice for the best fit is necessary.\n5. Option A, \"think\", would not give him the fulfilment of his expectation, but rather a change in his mind on a subject. Option C, \"determined\", could apply as an action done to bring his project to realization, but it also requires further investigation.\n6. Based on his expectation of not seeing his idea actualized in his lifetime, it is probable that even \"determined\" actions would not be enough to lead to it becoming a reality.\n7. Therefore, out of the given choices, he would be the least surprised to see his idea become a reality if his actions were what? Yes, option E, \"relax\". Based on his expectation, he is surprised that his idea is able to come to life at all and he does not know what to do next. It makes sense that he would have to \"relax\" in order to \"see\" the resulting reality. \n8.

This indicates that 'tiny calculator' was also a cutting edge technology at one time before smartphones took over. 4.

Choices: 1. A: an unexpected tone of voice B: unexpected emotion C: unexpected way of speaking D: unexpected body language E: unexpected attitude\nOutput: Step 2: The answer to this question is that \"tone of voice\" or body language could provide a reaction to speechlessness. \nStep 3: The next step: What happened in the story? \nStep 4: In the story, a leader spoke in a particular way - that is not the expected way for someone who is in a time of turmool and is likely to have people speechless. This does not mean that the reaction is speechlessness, however, and the leader is not reacting to speechlessness.\nStep 5 - Now we can determine what the reaction is: \na. No one responded- this is a logical guess, however- someone should have reacted.\nb. No one was speechless- this is also a logical guess that is not likely at all, since speechlessness should be related to what is said.\nc. The people were speechless-- this is the correct choice.\nStep 6- It is not very likely that a tone of voice or body language would have such a large effect on everyone, so'speechlessness' would be a more appropriate choice.\nStep 7 - We are then left with A: tone of voice / B: body language.\nStep 8- The context of the passage suggests body language may have been the appropriate response, as the leader spoke in a way other than what one would expect to hear someone speak in such a time.", "answer": "B: wristwatch"}

These two lists will allow us to see which symptoms are common between the effects of taking a shower after going on a run.\n        2. It's likely that the choice that's most shared between these two lists will be the one that has a high chance of occurring when someone goes for a run, and then runs a shower.\n        3. Looking at the two lists, we can see that after running the feeling refreshed is quite different than the other symptoms listed.\n        4. This indicates that running a shower is unlikely to produce that feeling.\n        5. However, we can also see that after running, the choices that are likely to occur are restlessness and sweating, which are both symptoms of the showering process.\n        6. Based on the information above, we can find that it's highly likely that you will experience some restlessness and sweat when you take a showering after running.\n        7. So the appropriate response would be E: sweating.\nSo the final (correct) answer is D: sweating\n\nInput: Which of these people might get an award for being brave?

The option that makes the most sense is awarding \"the person who faced many different \n    challenges\", and thus, the answer is D: the person who was presented with different challenges.\nSo the final correct (answer) answer is D: the most likely to earn the award was someone presented different challenges (", "answer": "A: feeling refreshed"}

Let's examine the given choices to determine the best fit and eliminate the others.\n6. Choices given are: a, b, c, d, and e.\n7. a. 'Lot of grief' does not seem likely as a direct effect of a divorce since grief is an emotion and divorce is not an emotional action.\n8. b. The idea of divorce can cause depression, which can be a result of the divorce and the dissolution of the marriage. However, it is not a clear direct effect that should be the logical choice.\n9. c. Divorce can be costly or expensive, both financially and emotionally. Hence, this is a more logical choice.\n10. d. This is eliminated because it does not specify who suffers as a result of the divorces or how they do so.\n11. e.

Choices: \nA: You lose balance B: You can't pick up C: You can't reach it D: You fall into a rage E: The glass breaks\nOutput: 1.) The'someone' in the question is also considered a 'you'. The glass is located on the table or ground. So, answer choices A to E are all actions that are typically associated with trying to pick up a glass that someone else has grabbed. \n2.) The question asks us which of these answers happens when you try to grab the glass. It does not specify why you might want to grab the glass (e.g. to prevent someone from using it or to throw it at someone). \n3.) So, the question means the action happens even if someone else might not have meant for it to happen. For example, a glass can be knocked or knocked over before you might try to grab it.\n4.) Based on the available options, answer choices B (lose balance) and D (fall into a rage) seem unlikely when trying to perform an everyday physical action of picking up an object, whether it be an intentional or unintended move to pick up the glass because it was already being held by someone else. \n5.) Answer choice C (can't reach it) doesn't make sense, as the person would generally be facing the glass when attempting to pick it up, so they would not be trying to pick it up over a distance.

Option B: 'bus station' is a public place with many people present, often going to or from somewhere else. However, if the aim is to meet a friend who also lives close by, it generally isn't the most convenient or practical option.\n4. Option C:'social atmosphere' doesn't exactly represent itself as a specific location where two people can meet. Hence, disregarding this choice.\n5. Likewise, option D: 'neighbour's house' isn't the best option for meeting friends close by since it would require one to be invited over.\n6.

The sentence says that the 'object' is'scuttling': If it is the sand under the crab's shell that is impeding him, then it means that'scuttling' seems to be something the crab has to do, in order to move. A crab on a beach does not normally scuttle its way across the sand. It seems too unlikely to be the answer.\n5. Tidepools : This does not make much sense in this sentence. Let us look at this sentence again: The crab was struggling to move, but what was impeding him (in this case, it seems it is 'object' that is scuttling and not the crab). A tidepool can contain crabs, but then again, this could mean that the crab is struggling to move out of a tidepool so it can scuttle across the sand. So, if it is the tidepool then it seems as if it is impeding the crab's movement. If this is so, then the crab must move itself out of the tidepool.\n6. Current : This option seems too far on the side.\n7. Last option, Cooking Pot : This seems most likely, since in this case, it says that what is scuttling can be 'impeding' his movement.\n8.

However, the most likely reason this would be illegal is because of the high skill required for this job, making it a valuable asset for the casino. \n7. Thus, the answer is most likely E: Dealing as it satisfies the logical parameters of the question.\nSo the final, and most likely, answer is E: Dealing\n\nInput: You will find which tool does a gardener use for a small flower bed? Choices:  B: rake C: hoe D: shovel E: glove\nOutput: 1) The question can be interpreted as asking for the tool(s) a gardener might use for a small flowerbed.\n2. We can disregard 'glove' from the set of choices because it is a tool for the gardener's hand, not a tool for the garden.\n3. Similarly, it also makes sense to disregard'shovel', as it implies that the gardener might be digging into the earth and not just the garden itself. The purpose of the tool would be to clear the flower-bed and level the surface.\n4. Let's go over what a gardener needs to do in a small flower-bed to clear it: Remove any unwanted plants, weeds or obstacles from the flower-bed.\n5. Digs may be necessary if the planted soil is too compact or if the flower-bed is too large.\n6. A gardener can use a hand-tool such as a small rake in a medium to smaller flower-bed.\n7. If the flower-bed is quite compacted and needs more work, they can use a sharp tool such as", "answer": "C: count"}
{"idx": 577, "text": "1) The given sentence implies that a beauty salon is related to a location which can be a city, strip mall, neighborhood, or rooster. The options could all be possible answers, so we have to evaluate which one makes more sense.\n2) The given options could be a beauty salon related to a city, a strip mall, a neighborhood or a rooster.\n3) However, beauty salon is commonly thought of as being associated with cities or perhaps strip malls, not neighborhoods or roosters.\n4) As a result, the most likely answer is city or mall, as it refers to places that have beauty salons for clients.\n5) There are several cities that have beauty salons as well as several strip malls with the same or adjacent establishments. The answer is either A or C.\n6) The text doesn't specify what kind of establishment is the location (a department store or mall, a strip mall) and what kind of establishment is a beauty salon.\n7) As a result, we have to consider the option word-by-word and examine those types of businesses.\n8) A beauty salon is usually an independent establishment and not a place where other businesses could be.\n9) Therefore, the correct answer between two options is either C: strip mall or E: rooster.\nSo the final answers are C: strip mall (or E: rooster).\n\nInput:What did the police ask the witness?

{"idx": 579, "text": "1: The question asks for the location where one can safely and appropriately store a small noteppad on their person.\n2. To answer this question properly, we need to evaluate the situation and the options provided.\n3. If the store-employee was in an office setting, the choices are: Back pocket, meeting, drug store and school.\n4. The office environment might allow a person to easily carry a small notebook without much hesitation about their belongings.\n5. This creates an obvious shortlist of possible locations where one may keep a small notebook safely: the back pocket, on a desk, or some nearby location that is publicly accessible.\n6. Given those circumstances, options A, C, and E are eliminated since they are not typically the place to carry a small notebook because of the security or safety concerns.\n7. Therefore, option B is the best choice for where to carry a small notepad safely in an office setting.\n8. The same logic applies to any other office-like setting.\nSo the final answers A and C are eliminated and the final answer is B.\n\nInput: Which is better: a lightning rod or grounding rods? Choices:  -A: A lightning rod   -B: A lightning rod\nOutput: Lightning rod vs grounding rods:\n1. This question is best answered by first defining each of the terms.\n2. Lightning: Lightning is a natural phenomenon that occurs as the result of a buildup of electrical charge between clouds or inside a cloud.\n3. Lightning rods: A lightning rod is a metal rod installed on a chimney, roof, or tall structure to protect it from being hit by lightning.\n4. A lightning rod's function is to attract lightning and transfer the electrical charge to the ground through the conductive metal.\n5. Grounding rod: Grounding rods are metal rods installed in an electrical system that provide an external path for fault currents and thereby prevent voltage surges and arc faults.\n6. A grounding rod's function is the same as a lightning rod's - to protect an object and/or surrounding environment by transmitting any fault current to the electric ground.\n\nSo,\n7. The only difference between a lightning rod and a grounding rod is the function they serve.", "answer": "A: back pocket"}
{"idx": 580, "text": "1.'Carefully' connotes a need for caution when making a judgement or evaluating something.\n2. 'Carefully' is not consistent with 'pigs'. \n3. If pigs are involved in judging at a state fair, then some other type of animal or task must be in connection with that term. This excludes A and E. \n4. 'Pegasus' is not associated with pigs or state fairs; thus, D is incorrect. \n5. The tasks associated with judging or evaluating would imply some degree of responsibility. However,'responsibility' is not the best word to use for the correct choice based on the context and provided options. \n6. 'Judging' is an activity that could follow careful consideration of some sort, so it is less likely based on context that B, 'judging' is the most logical choice. \n7. 'Evaluating' is a similar term to 'Judging' but it is not necessary that both activities will follow careful consideration. \n8. 'Responsibility' requires careful judgment in the sense that it involves evaluating and weighing different factors. We can therefore eliminate C and D options.\n9. The logical choice is 'Judging Pigs\" must require careful consideration, therefore the answer is B: Judging which could be either in terms of a judgment, evaluating or determining a verdict, or in terms of having judgment over a judging task. \nSo the final answer B: Judging\n\nInput: If you had to put pinto beans in a muffin, which would be better for you: roasted or fried?

{"idx": 581, "text": "1: The question refers to the act of instituting civil action, which refers to taking legal steps or measures to enforce rights or protect interests.\n2. There can be many reasons that might drive someone to take such legal measures, including feelings of anger or tiredness etc.\n3. But, out of the given choices, anger and tiredness seem unlikely to cause someone to enforce their rights and protect their interests.\n4. Therefore, the only reasonable choices are 'complications' and 'court case'.\n5. When complications arise, it's likely to become a need to take legal action or enforce rights and protect interests. It's not emotional or psychological, but rather an unwelcome turn of events or change in circumstances.\n6. Court case is similar to complications, but it's an overarching term that comprises all proceedings from the initial stages to appeal. Thus it's more specific than complications and better suits the question.\nSo the final action for this question is D: court case.\nSo the final choice for this question is D court case\n\nInput: If you are a member of a large organization or community what might you seek that does not appear to be necessary to the continuing operation of the group itself? Choices:  Coffee A: water B: food D: alcohol E: air\nOutput: 1) The question refers to the action of'seeking' something that might not seem necessary for the continued operation of a large group.\n2) In this context,'seeking' refers to the action of searching for something, rather than being imposed on someone.\n3) Thus, it becomes clear that the word itself holds the answer to the question, as it's not only the action but the words themselves. \n4) Out of the given choices: water, food, alcohol, and air, coffee is the only word that shares the same vowel as the phrase 'large organization' (in this case'seek').\n5) Hence, seeking coffee might not appear to be necessary for the continued operation for the group, but in actuality, it's a necessary action that contributes to the running of the group.\n6) So we must choose C: Coffee as the answer to this question.\nSo the answer choice is C: Coffee \n\nInput: The pizza is", "answer": "C: anger"}

Hence, he would avoid places such as pet stores, where animals are sold for pets or research, parking lots, where animals are often hit by cars, woodlands, where animals are hunted or shot, and North America, which is home to industries that use animals for labor and research.\n4. So, John would likely avoid parking lots (choice B) and North America (choice E) as these locations are likely to contribute to animal cruelty or harm in some way.\n5. Similarly, he might be wary of woodlands (choice D) due to common hunting practices and parks (choice E) due to animal research and laboratory testing undertaken in North America.\n6.

Choices:  Vestibule\nOutput: 1 The question is asking when the person would be \"on either side of one another.\" The given phrase is an idiom that means that two people are together, but each are situated on separate sides of an obstacle, perhaps a doorway or narrow hallway.\n2. From this we can eliminate the option of \"elevator,\" where the person could easily be on one side and the other person could be on the other side, since they could be in a closed space where they are both together but separated by an obstacle.\n3. Next is the option of \"doorway,\" where they can be on the same side even though it is separated by an obstacle of a narrow hallway.\n4. Hence, the options \"elevator,\" followed by \"doorway\" are eliminated, leaving us to choose the options \"bus\" or \"mall.\"\n5. \"Bus\" is typically wider than \"mall\", and one cannot always be on either side of someone in a bus ride, so \"bus\" cannot be the answer.\n6.

The pain itself would be the dominant emotion. Self-pity suggests additional emotions such as sorrow or despair, which are neither relevant to the task nor logical options in this scenario.\n4.

However, this call is not necessarily going to be understood, if the person can\u2019t understand the yelling, which takes the focus off of what one is feeling by yelling in this scenario. Therefore this option does not provide a logical answer to the question.\n6. Option (D) \u2013 Pain - Yelling in pain could be due to a lack of understanding by others. This doesn\u2019t really matter to the scenario, but it would also not make sense to interpret the answer as Pain, considering how this is probably the same level of pain at which others should understand yelling.\n7.

{"idx": 594, "text": "1) The question is asking for a good place to stow a wind instrument, implying that the instrument is a wind instrument.\n2) Wind instruments are primarily known for their acoustic properties, which is why it is necessary to keep them in a proper place.\n3) Option A, 'under bed' does not make logical sense unless the wind instrument is too big to be kept in a different space.\n4) Option B,'symphony' makes little sense as the location to stow a wind instument.\n5) Option C,'music room' seems like a logical place, but there is no specific location identified in the question, thus it is excluded.\n6) Option D, 'band practice' is not relevant as the question asks for a good place to'stow' the instrument and not about bands.\n7) Hence, the most reasonable place to stow a 'wind instrument' is E, 'Music Store'. Since a wind instrument is a musical item, its storage space would likely have good acoustic properties and be more focused on music.\nSo the final A is option E: Music Store.\n\nInput: When did Titanic hit the iceberg? Choices: 1. April 14, 1912 2. April 33, 1914 3. March 14, 2012 4. A: B: C: D:\nOutput: 1). Let's start by eliminating answers that do not make logical sense. Ans 2 does not work because of 1914 was before 1912 so option 2 will be eliminated.\n2). Next, we need to take a look at Ans 3 because of the similar nature with 1. It says April 14, however, the year is 2012 and we know 1912 happened before 2012 so that option needs to be eliminated.\n3). The remaining answer is Ans 3 and we want to look at Ans 3 closely. We find that this answer has the same format as an answer 1 so 4 April 14. The second thing we look at is the question and we find that the question says that it was an iceberg. We do not know which month and year the iceberg will be hit so option 3. Month and Year is April", "answer": "C: music room"}
{"idx": 595, "text": "1) The question is about the part of one's home to which the morning paper is delivered.\n2) One's daily newspaper is typically delivered through mail to their home or address.\n3) The options are \"classroom,\" \"synagogue,\" \"bathroom,\" \"front porch,\" and \"grocery store.\"\n4) \"Classroom\" is an uncommon scenario where the morning paper is delivered to, as that activity is rarely performed at home.\n5) \"Synagogue\" is a place to pray, which doesn't have anything to do with receiving the morning paper.\n6) \"Bathroom\" isn't a place where one would receive their newspaper, and it's usually not delivered there as it can get wet or damaged with water exposure.\n7) The front porch usually isn't the place where the morning paper is received, so it's not the most logical choice.\n8) Therefore, it would be the grocery store that the morning paper is received in if the person were to indicate this location as their home.\n9) So the correct answer is E: grocery, as it is a store that is located near, attached to, or a part of the home.\nSo the final and correct answer is E grocery\n\nInput: The cat jumped on the bed, waking the person who was in it.

The options presented are: \"a farmer,\" \"a student,\" \"a nurse,\" \"an artist,\" and \"a soldier.\"\n3.) It's not immediately obvious as to why the occupant of the bed would be any of the presented options, but there is a logic behind evaluating the choices.\n4.) \"Farmer\" is too narrow as farmers are not occupants or users of beds, or any of the presented jobs.\n5.) \"Student\" may or may not be the occupant of a bed, but is not a user of that bed.\n6.) \"Nurse\" does not require a bed to perform their duties, they may be located in hospital rooms", "answer": "D: front porch"}
{"idx": 596, "text": "1.) Speech therapists are not professional performers and hence, option A: make music cannot qualify as an answer to the question.\n2.) The question is asking us what speech therapists do. They are a specific type of professional so their tasks are quite specific. However, they cannot have a strong religious or spiritual belief so option C: believe in god cannot qualify as an appropriate answer.\n3.) There is a high chance that speech therapists would talk or give speeches, so option D: give speeches might apply. However, option D: give speech can also be applied to public speakers or individuals who do not necessarily identify themselves as speech therapists.\n4.) There is a connection between speech and sentences. They work in tandem, and hence, option E: complete sentences can be considered as an appropriate answer to the question. However, option E: complete sentence implies the existence of two sentences. \n5.) However, the question says \u201cdo\u201d not \u201cmake.\u201d Hence, option B: build sentences cannot be viewed as an appropriate answer.

In order to get to the right answer, we need to consider the scenario in mind, and the following are some useful tips:\nFirstly, \"When it rained....\" suggests a time, which is already given as being \"when it rained\". \nSecondly, \"was frightened....\" shows a place and indicates to be \"was frightened under the...\" \nFurthermore, \".... ran around the yard with...\" shows \"with\" indicates where the dog ran. \nFinally, \".... no place to hide.\" shows a \"place which he or she could hide\", \"a place to hide\" will be a likely answer.\n1. The first thing we need to consider is where the dog ran around before it began to rain. \n2.", "answer": "D: complete sentences"}
{"idx": 597, "text": "1.) Answer: (c).\n2.) The answer is \"honey.\"\n3.) While John might dislike the mosquitoes themselves, he probably likes the flowers they pollinate?\n4.) Given that he likes the flowers they help pollinate, therefore, John dislikes their buzzing.\n5.) In fact, he could be even more annoyed by their buzzing than what they eat, since their buzzing prevents him from doing what he loves.\n6.) So, John hates the mosquitoes because they make annoying noises?\n7.) And annoying noises are...? What kind of noises are annoying to people?\n8.) Buzzing noises, like the mosquito's buzz.\n9.) So, the answer is \"honey,\" because the mosquito' s buzzing is why John hates them?\nSo the final answer in this question is C: honey\n\nInput: What was John wearing while working at the mill? Choices: 1. A: a red t-shirt 2. B: a baseball cap 3. C: a white skirt 4. D: a pair of blue socks 5. E: white pants\nOutput: Step 7: It seems unlikely that John would be working at a mill while wearing a baseball cap, unless he is also working as a sportscaster.\nStep 8: White pants don't seem to be the type of pants that you would typically wear while working in a mill, unless you are a mill manager. Hence, option E can be eliminated.\nStep 9: Option A could be correct, but not the answer since \"A red t-shirt\" is a bit vague.\nStep 10: Since option B can be eliminated, there are two options left, C and D.\nStep 11: A skirt is a pretty far leap from a mill, so the best answer would be D: \"a pair of blue socks\"\nSo the final answer to this question is D: \"a pair  of blue socks.\"\n\nInput: Which part of the sentence has the past participle?

This states that the \"Carolina's\" is either a shortened version of North Carolina or South Carolina.\n3. The \"blowfish\" found off the coast of Carolina was not what it sounds like, it's a seafood dish from Japan.  The \"sushi\" in \"blow-fish\" is not referring to the sushi we commonly eat in America, but is a translation from the Japanese \"nigiri\" that refers to the small, spike-shaped fish commonly consumed there.\n4. The dish is made with seafood that has poisonous spikes that can kill a large animal. The poison inside the blowfish is the key ingredient in its recipe.\n5. Since there is no relation between what a blow-fish is and the Carolina's in the context of this question, it is eliminated.\n6. The other options provided are A: rock band (obsolete, could be replaced with \"rockers\"), B: sea of japon (spelled correctly, but doesn't make sense), C: fish market (incorrect as the type of fish eaten in the region is a blowfish, not a fish market), and D: atlantic ocean (the blowfish was found off the western coast of the United States in the Pacific, not the Atlantic).\n7.

As we are looking for reasons the family is playing cards and not just playing cards for fun, the answer is eliminated.\n 5.

Let\u2019s move on to choice E- where we have a list of the possible gains from playing cards by winning or not losing money. Both of these work as reasons, as the game is ultimately to win or not lose money.\n7.

Choices:  H: computer research I: marketing J: data analysis K: sales\nOutput: 1.) The question seeks to understand the activities or processes performed by a professor who is an analyst.\n2. The key lies in clarifying that the professor's job involves doing something called an \u201canalysis\u201d, which is a process or action.\n3. In the context of this question, it isn't what type of job the professor or the company is in, rather what the professor as an analyst does for a living.\n4. The given choices are options for what the company as a whole does. Options H, I &J would not be applicable since the professor is a professor, not a company. The job of a professor is not sales, marketing or data analysis for example.\n5. The professor as a person is an analyst, specifically, an analyst in a marketing company. His activity could be seen as marketing related since his \"job\" is the company's marketing tool. Sales is related to marketing and the process of selling, and could also be applied here, but the activity as defined in the question is still the professor's actions or actions that lead to an analysis result.\n6. The answer is K: Sales, which fits best in the context of being an analyst. \nSo the final answer  is K: Sales", "answer": "A: driving"}

Choice D is incorrect because OHIO is not the location of the village described in the question; it is likely to be a rural area.\n5: Similarly, choice choice E cannot be the likely location of a village within \"suburbs\" because there is a need to define the boundary of what makes one area different from another, and suburbs are an undefined concept that can encompass many larger locations.\n6: Choice A, \"rural area,\" fits the description, as villages are often located away from the more populated cities or suburbs, and the term \"rural\" denotes an area that is not defined by being located in a specific town or location.\n7: Hence, the correct choice for the final answer is choice A: rural area, as it would likely contain a village.\nSo the final answers are A: rural area\n\nInput: How much time does a typical person spend asleep in one night?

Let us now look to each of the choices to see if one of them is likely to be the answer.\n3. Binder is a commonly portable item because it is meant to be carried around, unlike a backpack or an office supply store, which are not associated with mobility. Hence, we can conclude that it is not likely to be the thing itself, but rather the context in which it would be located.\n4. So, let us look to see where such a binder would ordinarily be found.\n5. Choices for the context are a bookcase, an office supply store, an office, or a classroom.\n6. Looking at the answers, \"a bookcase, C, is likely not the correct answer since a bookcase does not contain homework assignments. \n7. An office, D, will contain office-related items with homework being one of them.\n8. The office supply store, B, is likely the incorrect option as it can contain office items such as printers, but is unlikely to contain homework assignments since they are not usually purchased for home use.\n9. The classroom, E, would likely have assignment books, but they are made for temporary use and are therefore not permanent, while we are looking for binder to be permanent and have homework assignments.

{"idx": 608, "text": "1) The key to answering this question lies in its contextual information and the logical reasoning that can be formed by interpreting the information\n2. In the question, the word \"what\" is part of the sentence. \n3. The \"what\" is actually a pre-defined word, namely \"apartment\". In the question, the \"apartment\" is described as being \"decor choices\" and \"inside\" the folding chair.\n4. The logical interpretation of this statement is that the \"apartment decor choices\" was likely inside the \"folding chair\", implying the apartment was used as a furniture piece.\n5. \"Bathroom\" and \"room\" can be eliminated as they do not make sense in the given contextual scenario. \n6. The decor choices cannot be \"church\" or \"closet\" either, as they are objects and not furniture. \n7. Therefore, the one option that \"aptly fits\" into the given scenario is \"apartment\".\n8. So, \"The college kids werent' known for their apartment choices\" means that college students were known to be irresponsible or careless in their furniture/apartment choices.\n9. The question continues with the word \"inside\" which hints that the folding chair would be used to create a \"what\" or a container/location inside the apartment space.\n10. The most sensible answer to this scenario is a \"closet\".\n11. If college students are known to misuse apartments, they are probably careless about their closet. In the same way, if they are careless about the closet, they are likely to misuse its contents.\n12. Therefore, \"closets\" are also the \"what\" or the container into which the college students were expected to place the furnishings.\n13. Hence, the answer for the question would be A: bathroom, as the college kids were known for their apartment bathroom/closet choices.\nSo the final answers are A: bathroom\n\nInput: A small group can do what?

So, we will start by eliminating the Shopping Mall option which is obvious.\n4) The context states that this store is located in the shopping mall, so it will more likely be located in a Big City or Town.\n5) However, if the city/town is new or has been re-built, it can still be called a 'Big city'.\n6) Therefore, we can eliminate the Town option. This leaves us with just one option Big City.\n7) The context states that it is in the Northwest US, so we will eliminate all options that are not in the US, like New York - Big City (B) or Shopping Mall (E)\n8) Therefore, the only option left is Big City (C).\nSo the final answer will be the Big City in (C).\nSo, the answer is C.", "answer": "D: idaho"}

The question peruses the subject of finding something.\n2. While a logical answer would be to \"keep trying to think of what you are looking for\", or to \"try a different strategy\", the answer is \"E: Find an equivalent object\" \n3. That's because the question doesn't define anything as what \"you\" are looking for.\n4. The text can't point a specific object it is referring to.\n5.

Looking at the choices, we can see that B is describing a basement or cellar type of room, so we can eliminate that option.\n3. Option A, \"the hardware store\", does not specify if the person had to walk downstairs inside a store. A person could walk up stairs to pick up their purchased items in the store.\n4. Option C is the same as B, so this option is also eliminated.\n5 D is a specific store that specializes in repairing things, but the question doesn't ask where the person had to walk to get the tool, rather where they walked downstairs.\n6. This leaves us with E, option C, which correctly indicates that the person had to walk into a basement level, as that was the location where the tool was found.\n7. So, the answer to the question is E: the library/basement level.

They don't provide the ingredients for cooking your own food.\n4. Similarly there is no mention of casserole, a dish that is typically cooked in a pot rather than a potato.\n5. A root cellar is a storage place for food but it's unlikely it would contain potatoes.\n6. 'Pocketss' here is referencing a person's pockets and not referring to where potatoes are found. Similarly, 'pantry' is an unrelated term in this context and is disregarded.\n7. This reduces the options to restaurants and pantry. Looking at Pantry as a kitchenware term, it is used to describe a place where food is stored, rather than where food is prepared. Hence, it cannot be the correct answer.\n8. Restaurants are unlikely to have a selection of potatoes or provide potatoes to cook yourself. There is no mention of a restaurant that provides its food for a home kitchen or has its own potato selection.\n9.

An adjective is a word that modifies or qualifies a noun in a sentence.\n6. A conjunction is a word that joins together two or more sentences, clauses, or phrases.\n7. A pronoun is a word that stands in place of a noun.\n8. None of these words are used to combine words together, whereas the common usage of \u201cpreposition\u201d describes the word that connects two nouns. \n9. Therefore, the correct option is D: preposition.\nSo the final ansser is D: preposition\n\nInput: What are the odds of you losing a game of chess?

Choices: A: borrowing B: investing C: spending D: saving E: debit card\nOutput: 1: By going through the choices given and considering the use of debit cards compared to the phrasing of \"doing more with his money,\" we can say that choice A is incorrect, as borrowing money from a bank is not the same as using your money to do more.\n2: We can also say that choosing choice C is incorrect as well, as using money to spend more does not necessarily have the impact of doing more.\n3: Choice E, therefore, is also incorrect because it involves a debit card, not more with money, so does not fit this question.\n4: Hence, we can assume choosing choice D, spending money, may be a viable choice, but it is not necessarily the best one, since spending to do more may be a possibility.\n5: Lastly, considering the phrase \"doing more with your money\" and the choices given to choose from, the best and only choice at the end of this chain of thought would be choice D, which is the specific option of spending money.\nSo the final choice is D: spending money\n\nInput: Who said \"Practice makes perfect\"?

{"idx": 633, "text": "1) The key idea to analyze in this question is how one might end up if they take their heifer- a young cow- out east, which is a general term commonly used to refer to all of the states east of the Mississippi River.\n2) When trying to determine which of the choices would be logical locations to go after going out east, we can determine that any one of the states east of Virginia would work, and they all have some type of location that might serve as a destination for the journey.\n3) However, based on the context and the word \"might\" which suggests there are options for ending up at different destinations, we can determine the following about which types of locations might be most likely:\n    - A farm is a common location for where heifers would be kept and where some locations would include county fairs\n    - Other locations could be farmer's markets, places where one would go to sell a heifer\n    - These locations imply a farming or agricultural background which would be more likely in southern and central states, rather than in the northern states like New Hampshire.\n4) Looking at these characteristics, if we took our heifer out east to New Hampshire, the most logical options would be either farm fields or county fairs.\n5) Since county fairs are typically not farms themselves, but rather festivals or events that feature them, we can eliminate Option D: \"east.\" County fairs and farmer's markts tend to take place in farmlands, which would not be an option in this question.\n6) Based on this context and analysis, the logical answer is B: \"Dairy farm\".\nSo the final argument is B: Dairy farm.\n\nInput: When your friends can not be there, where would you be more apt to play a card game?

We will use the given choice to compare them so that we can determine which best matches the question.\n3. Let us examine each of the options to see how they compare.\n4. Option(A): body of water spends its time in water. This does not match the question because it would be spent on both the surface and the underwater area.\n5. Option(B): Lake superior spends its time on the surface of the water. This is a lake and it primarily stays on top of the water. The vastness of the water can make the time spent on top of the water appear longer than the time spent below the surface water, but it would be an inaccurate perception of all the time spent in the water.\n6. Option(C): Underwater. This is a submerged time in water.\n7. Option(D): Toilet. This does not relate to the water at all.\n8. Option(E): Aquarium. This also is not related to the water.\n9. Using the comparison from above, option(C), underwater, most closely matches the question.\n10.

Shortness of breath is a byproduct of jogging and is likely caused by excessive wear to your socks.\n6: \"hole in your sock\" is a possible outcome of excessive wear to your feet. This provides a hint that what is forming on your foot is not \"heart attacks\", but rather a hole in your sock or a shortness of breath. \n7: The remaining options are \"exhaustion\" and \"blisters\". If a person is being physically exhausted from jogging, it would make since that they are experiencing \"exhaustion\". \n8: Moreover, if a person is experiencing \"blisters\", it is common since a person's skin would be being exposed and \"blisters \"would form. \n9: Since we have already dismissed the possibilities of \"blisters\" and \"shortness of breath\", the options that are still relevant are exhaustion and hole in your sock.\n10: From the options that are left, it is unlikely to experience an \"exhaustion\", if you are only jogging for a few days.

{"idx": 640, "text": "1 The question is asking what specific names were given to \"southern institutions where slaves [were] do[ing] the labor.\"\n2. As these institutions are slave labor facilities, and the main focus is on the slaves, the answers should not describe the facilities themselves but rather describe the slaves.\n3. The primary function of establishing a slave is to have a source of unpaid labor or in other ways, to freeing up capital for other uses.\n4. One primary function of institutions is to provide some degree of organization for a more effective, efficient operation - this is done in all manner of facilities which include plantation farming. \n5. While plantations use slave labor (slaves do the labor), they are not the only form of institution which uses slave labor, in fact, most ancient societies have employed some sort of institutionalized slave labor system.\n6. When thinking specifically about slavery's primary function of generating unpaid labor, it is possible to see that institutions in this regard are not unique to southern areas, therefore ruling out A: Plantation, B: Farm, D: Poor Countries, and E: Ancient Rome.\n7. However, if southern institutions were to be named due to historical significance, as the question suggests, then historical books might contain the information we are seeking.\n8. Therefore our remaining options are C: History Book and B: Farm.\n9. However, a history book, which should ideally provide us with the names of institutions or at least the historical information of such institutions, will most likely provide information on slavery as a whole rather than specifically mentioning institutions and naming them.\n10.

A friend's residence is usually more of a home and not necessarily something to do with employing. \n8: The zoo is a probable option if the circus is also working in a zoo, which seems a possible possibility given the scenario. \n9: The zoo also employs non-human animals in their performance shows, so in some sense, it could be considered a 'government' in that sense, the other possibilities could be considered government-like organizations by extension since they run the circus and may engage in some governmental like activities. \n10: Therefore, while we cannot pick one specific answer, we can pick answers that most likely fulfill the requirements: \n11: A: french government \n12: B: friend's household (home) \n13: C: zoo\nSo the final answer(s) are A: french government and B: friend's home.\n\nInput: The fisherman didn't catch many fish, but in the middle of the lake, it was quite warm.

{"idx": 646, "text": "1.) The question is asking whether driving too fast on an ice-covered road is dangerous.\n2.) The first thing we observe is the adjective 'deadly.' This suggests that driving too fast on an icing road could be detrimental or harmful in some way.\n\u200b3.) Eliminating D is also worthwhile since 'deadly' isn't necessarily negative in itself; in fact, 'dangerous' has overtones of both danger and risk, while 'deadly' has overtones only of risk. 'Dangerous' allows for the possibility that a collision may not be fatal, but may at least result in significant damage to the car or other property such as buildings along the route taken by drivers. 'Deadly' implies death as the sole potential outcome of said collision.\n4.) Option A is also eliminated because while it is technically true that driving too fast could result in a fatal crash, it overstates the seriousness of that danger and does not describe the overarching dangers that are inherent or potentially caused by driving too fast. 'Unconcerned' might also suggest a lack of concern for one's own safety that is a necessary component of driving too fast on an arctic road. Therefore, this choice is not viable.\n5.) Eliminating E is the third way to narrow the field down since 'harder when weather bad' is unrelated to driving too fast for an arctic road and has no bearing on the dangers imposed by driving too fast. \n6.) With these three options eliminated, the only viable answer is option B, that is, 'dangerous.' 'Dangerous' fits the constraints and qualities of driving too fast for an icy road, given that risk is inherent in driving itself in such conditions.\n7.)

The question refers to a person's use or spending habits and it makes sense to expect that they would have some disposable money, meaning some they could spend on a whim (a penultimate).\n4).

The only other answer that is a change in condition and makes sense is B: \"flown\" which is to \"fly off.\"\n6). Since the \"penultimate in series\" would logically be prior to the last, we can eliminate E.\n7). The only remaining choices are A, which uses \"dissipate,\" a process of turning into heat, to describe the spending of money. This is the logical choice as a person has spent their remaining money but their use of money (a spending habit) has not changed and continues.\nSo the final choice is: 1).

{"idx": 651, "text": "1.'Strategic gold reserve\" is a term used by the government to refer to the reserve in which the largest portion of the nation's gold reserves are held, usually in a central vault, with the majority of it being at Fort Knox.\n2. When choosing the most logical option, it is important to consider the structure of the question along with the context clues. The answer will most likely be one of choice A, B or C.\n3. Since option A: jewelry may appear to fit and have some validity at first, further scrutiny provides the necessary insights to determine whether the answer is valid or not. A jewelry store has the same stock or inventory in it, which means the gold reserve would not be in different quantities.\n4. Option B: Fort Knox could be correct since a storage facility is where gold is kept. However, since the government does not typically store most of its gold reserves in one single location, option B is not logical.\n5. Choicing option C is not the most logical choice either as churches store and hold money to be used in the church's mission. Since it is not likely to have a strategic gold reserve, it is incorrect.\n6. Eliminating options A, B and C, the most logical option is E: a treasure chest.\nSo the final option is E: E: Treasure chest\n\nInput: Where can you find the lenses from which the sun is an eclipse and a comet?

Each option is related to the raising of a child, but the context indicates it should pertain to a parent's role rather than an individual child's status or wellbeing.\n3. The only option that makes sense as the one the question is asking about is \"duty.\"\n4. The parent's \"duty\" as a parent is to \"care for children\" (answer B) and \"control children\" (answer D) to provide the best upbringing possible.\n5. We discard the \"happiness of the child\" (answer C) option as this phrase can apply to many aspects of childcare outside a parent's immediate presence.\n6. For instance, a kind, happy teacher can positively impact a child's wellbeing, even if the parent \"control\" the child's actions.\n7. Additionally, the parent \"controlling\" the child's behavior does not necessarily mean they are happy or satisfied with their own parenting abilities.\n8. The options, \"control children\" and \"care for children,\" are more direct descriptions of what the parent specifically \"duties\" as a parent in that context.\n9. Moreover, this phrasing also covers the parent's responsibility to guide and direct their child's development through appropriate \"control\" (answer D), providing both the structure and opportunities needed for healthy growth.\n10.

Choices: A: in the air B: in the atmosphere C: inside of the box D: outside the container E: inside the container\nOutput: 1: The question asks \"What would happen when there is excess air?\" This implies that a container can have excess air (either too much air or that the container has leaked air), that can cause problems.\n2. Of the choices given, only D: \"outside the container\" adequately explains what happens when there's excess air.\n3.

Additionally, D: hope may not be appropriate given that it suggests positivity and this question is focused on negative feelings or emotions which are typically associated with anxiety.\nE: calm appears to be a valid choice, but one could argue that anxiety isn't necessarily more intense than the feeling of calm, thus it doesn't stand out as the most accurate choice.\nFinally, the correct answer is a: anxiety.\nSo the final answers was A: anxiety\n\nInput: What is the next question in a series of questions that need to be answered?

{"idx": 667, "text": "1) The first thing we should do is consider the definition of 'compassionate'. It is defined as 'feeling and responding with the sufferings of another' and 'characterized by or showing sympathy and understanding'.\n2. Therefore, the question is asking how something can be described as 'compassionate and thoughtful'. We will identify a choice and eliminate from it any words that do not relate to 'compassionate' or 'thoughtful'.\n3. In regards to 'disingenuous:' This could not be a suitable explanation as 'disingeneuous' implies trickery or deception. Neither are appropriate given the context of the phrase.\n4. 'human' can relate to 'compassioned', the connotation of care for other humans can relate to one giving care and being understanding and supportive. So, we can eliminate B. We need to find a suitable replacement.\n5. 'Weird' is a good word but lacks a relation to thoughtfulness. We can further narrow down by noting that the question does not relate to mental health or emotion. If the phrases had involved 'depression' or 'anxiety' then perhaps 'weird' would be a better option. \n6. We also cannot consider 'kind' as another phrase that means cruel and harsh is already 'unkind'. So, it cannot mean something that is too nice, it doesn't fit in this phrase. It just can't be 'kind'.\n7. It is also clear that the phrase would not describe something as'stupid' so it needs to be removed from the options.  \n8. After reviewing the whole question and eliminating redundant or incongruent words, the answer that can be considered and most fits into the question is 'thoughtful'. It is the only word that can be used as another word to describe 'compassionate thought'.\n9.

This option may be applied in reference to the man's overall ride experience, and not necessarily just one individual ride.  \n    2.) \"Exciting\" - It's more of a neutral, general term that can be applied to any particular experience.

Opening boxes (Option B) is also irrelevant since the classrooms are presumably already set up and all that needs to be done is teaching children. So B is eliminated. \nc. The phrase 'answering questions' (Option C) is similar to the activity of teaching, and so this is a viable option. So C is kept.\nd. The phrase 'giving homework' (Option E) is somewhat similar to teaching but implies more of an assignment or project, whereas this would not necessarily be how teachers prepare to teach for a school year again.\n4) The answer is Option C: 'talking too much'. It could possibly be a teaching activity, depending on the context. However, it's unlikely that teachers would actually 'talk too much' when trying to prepare for the school year.

{"idx": 672, "text": "1) So, the question is referring to the common idiom \"rest is needed,\" which implies that lack of rest or too much exertion impacts one's overall physical and mental state.\n2) Since rest is needed, the absence of it means the state of someone who is not-resting is quite depleted.\n3) This applies to the word \"feel,\" since this is what we do to examine the state of our being.\n4) The common question \"how are you feeling today?\" pertains to how we experience ourselves (physically and mentally) at that moment. \n5) To examine the various ways in which this applies to our idiom, we need to evaluate the choices given in the question. \n6) Let's begin by analyzing each choice:\n        7) In choice A, \"exhausted\" is defined as the state of \"being too tired or lacking strength, to the point of being unable to carry on.\"\n        It is not related to rest since it is a condition of being and not the action of resting.\n        We can eliminate A: exhausted.\n\n\n       8) Similarly, choice B, which is defined as \"lonely\" or \"having no companions or friends,\" is not referring to rest.\n        It also suggests having been alone all day.\n        Choice B is irrelevant in this context of the lack of rest.\n        We can further eliminate B: lonely.\n\n7) Therefore, choosing to do an elimination based on the concept of having been alone is not necessary.

She wanted what most of us feel at the thought of a crime? Choices:  B: retaliation C: remorse D: forgiveness E: compassion\nOutput:1. The question is based around the assumption that Mary's friend had stolen from. \n2. When someone steals from you, it is natural to feel angry or upset.\n3. These are known as emotions.\n4. As per the question, Mary felt upset about the crime.\n5. Looking at the choices available, we can eliminate the options that are out of the context.\n6. 'Retaliation' suggests taking action against that person, and this may include punishment or prosecution.\n7. 'Remorse' is synonymous to regret or sorrow, it would not be appropriate for a friend who has stolen from you.\n8. 'Forgiveness' isn't a very popular reaction to theft.\n9. As the only option which makes sense within the context of theft would be 'compensation' for what was stolen, Mary was likely feeling sad for thinking that she lost something and that she wanted something.\nSo the final choice is E: compassion.\nSo the final conclusion is E: compassione.\n\n#!/bin/bash\n#Script:\n# Author: Mohit Dagar\n\n#!/usr/bin/python3\n\"\"\"Sentence Completion Quiz\"\"\"\n\nimport re\nfrom random import shuffle\nimport os\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMax", "answer": "E: save money"}

Some could be excitement, boredom, wonder, and curiosity. However, the options available given are curiosity, excitement, wonder and fear.\n3. Excitement could be a feeling if you are discovering something thrilling.\n4. Boredom would be a feeling if you've seen nothing new and that nothing is changing.\n5. Wonder could be a feeling if your new things are really interesting and you want to know more.\n6. Fear could be felt because of something unrelated. Or fear of missing out, that you are experiencing something new that others are not and you don't want others to catch up with you.\n7. So, the answer must be chosen from Curiosity (F), excitement (B) or wonder (D).\n8. Wonder could be an answer because new things that are really interesting would lead to curiosity, which is a feeling of interest in gaining knowledge about an object or an idea.\n9. This curiosity could be excited, and lead to excitement.\n10. Wonder could be a better answer than excitement (C) which is a more intense and powerful feeling than curiosity. Wonder is a feeling that can follow curiosity which could produce excitement when something is really exciting, thrilling and worth exploring.\n11.

{"idx": 680, "text": "1. The word 'laxative' implies that the substance in question relaxes the muscular walls of the bowel, causing more frequent bowel movement. \n2. One effect of taking a laxative is to cause more frequent bowel movements than usual.\n3. For this question, we are seeking the bowel movement that is helped by the frequent bowel movement induced by taking a laxative.\n4. Hence, the answer choices would be B, C, D, and E.\n5. The type of bowel movement is determined by a combination of food ingested, physical activity, stress, medication, and the body's natural rhythms.\n6. This causes different types of bowel movements to be more prevalent in certain people, but for the purpose of this question, we are looking for what type of bowel movement will be helped by frequent bowel movements.\n7. The answer with the largest likelihood of this outcome is'regular' bowel movements.\n8. There are other types of bowel movements like cakes, weak, fragile, but they are far less common than regular bowel movements.\n9. Therefore, the answer we choose is D: regular movements.\nSo the final choice is D: regular\n\nInput: What type of man is considered the world's shortest recorded?

We need to make sure that each given option is the most shortest men and is only men.\n3. We can see that the first option A is referring to a man who's 183cm (about 6 feet) tall.\n4. When we read the word 'worlds', we can recognize that the context of the question could be broader than simply talking about one country. Thus, option A is out of our scope.\n5. Option B states that a man of 150cm (about 5 feet) tall, so the logical answer is B: 150 cm. \n6. Now we look at options C and D, but as we can see, we can see that", "answer": "C: regular"}

{"idx": 682, "text": "1 The phrase \"God's will\" typically implies that whatever an individual deems is god's will might not actually be what God, or God's will, desires. 2. We first should determine the options from which we'd be able to deduce God's will. 3. This question states that God wants people to do for money, and we can assume that whatever God wants people to do is also what God wants. So whatever God wants, we also do for money. 4. From the options given, let's break them down: 5. (A): work in life - God should want people to work for a way to make money in life. 6. (B): speak to people - Speaking should not make for good money or mean that people make money by speaking. God wants people to speak, but that won't make for good money 7. (C): everywhere - God probably doesn't want people to make money everywhere, nor does everywhere make for good money. 8. (D): sitting ideal - To sit means to take things easy for some, but it does not mean things to be easy to make for money (nor would it be a money-maker). 9. (E): care for people - Caring for people can mean making money, but it also doesn't mean making huge sums of money. 10. Only C: \"everywhere\" fits the description. 11. Then again, God also wants us to speak, so if we only pick (B): speak to the people, we find a contradiction: God wants us to speak and work, so (B): speak to peoples doesn't make sense either, since it implies that making money is through speaking (how is that possible?). 12. This brings us to the only logical answer: No one of the options listed covers God's will. The best answer is D: Nothing, as God wants us to do a lot of things, not just one specific thing. 13. This means that God wants us to take actions to make money, but those actions are not specifically defined in the options. That means our options are still A: work in life, B: speak to people, and C: everywhere = D: Nothing.", "answer": "A: work in life"}

Option A - is a place where one would store personal items, not carry them.\n4. Option B \u2013 is a place where one may purchase an office supply like pens. However, carrying these purchased office supplies is not relevant to the question because the context of the question is during the course of the day and not at point of purchase.\n5. Option  C is similar to option B although does not provide a clear answer to \"where would you carry a pen\".\n6. Option D is an example of a location where one may store their pen as they go through their day, however, carrying a pen is not included. Therefore, D is disregarded.\n7. A desk drawer (option E ) may seem like the logical place to carry a pen during the day, but it is excluded since the term \"desk\" signifies either working at a desk or using a desk for writing/storing items, and the text indicates use of the pen during the day when a person is \"going through their day\".\n8. Consequently the most suitable option is B: office supply store.\nSo the final choice is B: office supply\n\nInput: What did the old man do at the end of the day? Choices: A: return from a walk B: drink coffee C: return his car keys D: eat sandwiches E: read the newspaper\nOutput: Let's look at the choices:\n1. A: \"return from a walk\" - this does not make sense as the prompt asks what the old man does at the end of the work day, and walking isn't typical office work or something you'd normally do after work.\n2. B: \"drink coffee\" - This is excluded because it's not an action or thing the old man does, it's just an activity or state. It also doesn't describe what or where the old man does it.\n3. C: \"return his car keys\" - C is excluded because it makes no sense in the context of going back home from work. \"Car keys\" are often stored and returned at home, they are not taken back to work with you, returned to your place of work, or anything else relevant to the context of the question.\n4.

{"idx": 696, "text": "1, The question describes a scene in which a card game is in progress despite the presence of a shark behind the players, a scenario that would normally be unthinkable. \n2. There are various reasons the players might not be freaking out. For example, they may be distracted by their game or completely nonchalant.\n3. Option A, that they were \"playing sea world\" does not make sense as it describes a game involving the marine environment and, specifically, the playing of Sea World as a location in the game.\n4. \"Court room\" refers to a place of justice and procedure, it is not a type of game to be played.\n5. Similarly, \"shallow waters\" and \"poker game\" do not refer to playing the poker card game but rather describe the type of environment in which one might play, so they are eliminated. \n6. The final option that makes sense is option \"E: card shark\", since this refers to the name of a popular card game.\n7. So, the players are playing cards and they may be card sharks.\n8.

{"idx": 698, "text": "1.. The question is asking about where a desk used by a young person would typically be found (located).\n2. When asked 'where' do you find an object, the location is the most important piece of information. \n3. The choices given are as follows: office building, schoolroom, library, bedroom, gym. \n4. Office buildings are typically occupied by older people, so they would not meet the criteria for a desk belonging to a young person. Out of the choice'schoolroom' \n5. A school-room or school-building would typically contain a desk that is occupied by people of various ages, and the desk would not be occupied by a 'young person'. Therefore, we eliminate C (library): a library is a room where books are kept. In a library, people would also be found sitting and reading. This makes the desk of no concern. \n6. Out of the other options: \n7. A bedroom is a room used by someone to sleep. A desk would not necessarily be found in a bedroom, but if we were to accept that it could be found there, it is still an unacceptable answer. A bedroom is not a place used by a younger person. This eliminates E (Gym). \n8. If there were a desk in a gym, it would most likely be associated with someone who used the gym. The desk would not be specifically for a 'young person.' \n9. For a second look at the available options: \n10. A school-room would not be occupied by someone who is typically not working or studying, so it is not an appropriate place to find a desk occupied by a 'youth person'.

Therefore, the farmer could be referring to one of the choices \"countryside\" or \"dairy farm\" because he would have been allowed to spend his last days roaming freely. \n4) On the other hand, heifer was not allowed to reside in a cattle ranch, since that's a place where cattle are raised for meat. \"Slaughterhouse\" can be disregard since that's where the animal was finally taken for execution.\n5) Leaving us with only option \"Countryside\" and \"Dairy farms\", since the heifer had to have been spending her days roaming free.\n6) So, the most logical answer to this question would be \"Dairy farm\" because a dairy can be a farm where cow's milk is processed. \nSo the final answer (of the given choices) is E: Dairy farm\n\nInput: What type of structure does the water treatment facility process?

The context of the question clearly describes one particular continent as the shark's \"home\" and the other one as the \"destination\", or the place it must go to in order to complete its migration. Therefore, we can quickly eliminate Choices A, C, and D, all places that are not part of a migration pathway. \n5. The remaining choices are all locations where sharks can be located, and therefore may be suitable destinations for a shark in search of food or safety. \n6.

This is a sudden, stop-movement from something to nothing, or in other words, a sudden change of direction.\n9) Given his sudden direction change, now would be the ideal time to think to tie his shoes.

{"idx": 715, "text": "The place that is described as being 'The best steakhouse outside the South' is not the same as the place from which James is going to. In other words, the food is not necessarily the food James would be eating.\n1.This leaves us with the question of where is James headed.\n2. Since we know the steakhouse is outside the South, where within the South is James headed?\n3. It seems that'steakhouse' most likely refers to a specific town or city in Texas.\n4. If James is headed there to experience the best steakhouse in Texas, the options where he actually is can be discerned from two angles.\n5. If he's staying within the South (and not passing through), the options B or C would be eliminated. If he's passing through the South to get there, we know that it must be somewhere within the same continent in the US (if it's in Texas then it's within the US).\n6. Hence, the only two options we can eliminate from this perspective are A-texas and D-michigan.\n7. Then we can look at the steakhouse and compare any details about it's location (like a river, or a mountain range, etc.).\n8. In the specific scenario given, the steakhouse isn't named and there aren't any other descriptive details, making it difficult to determine it's exact location.\n9. The choice given: the answer is E, Florida. Why is the answer Florida rather than Texas?\n10. First let's determine any information from the question which is specific to the choice Florida.\n11. There's a steakhouse in Texas that is the 'best steakhouse outside the south'.\n12. The 'best steakhouse' could be located in Florida but not be the case. Florida also has a best steakhouse too, so the information is irrelevant and can be eliminated.\n13. Florida only has a river, called Suwannee river and hence has nothing else that can be described as being a 'best steakhouse', so Florida must be the answer. \nSo the final answer to this is E: Florida.\n   \nInput: When it was pouring rain, the man walked along with the umbrella.

From the choices given, ordering dog food online does not provide evidence of lying but rather of an online transaction.\n3. 'Avoid eye contact' could indicate lying, since lying requires a sense of secrecy.\n4. 'Feeling guilty' can be an emotion associated with lying, since a lie may cause guilt.\n5. 'Falling asleep' could be a sign of lying, as a person who is nervous to be lying might feel sleepy.\n6. 'Blushing' is one possibility, as lying can cause embarrassment or shame.\n7. Let's eliminate those that don't fit.\n8. 'Avoiding eye contact' and 'feeling guilty' are plausible reactions to lying, so they can be eliminated.\n9. 'Falling as sleep' is unlikely given that it is unlikely that a person would fall asleep, even if lying, so it will be eliminated.\n10.

Then,'standing in line' refers to one specific person in the continuous group. \n5. Since the question doesn't specify if the line is actually queuing up, all queuing up answers can be removed. \n6. 'Wat turn' refers to a person in line. Let's break it down to the word 'wat'. \n7. 'Wat' can be broken down further into 2 words: 'what' and 'a', which suggests that the line is not moving and a person is wondering 'what to do next'. \n8. 'Fatigue' can also be broken down into the 2 syllables 'fat' and 'igue'. \n9. 'Fatigue means to 'become tired'. \n10.

Let's understand each of the terms in the sentence.\n2.)The term \"Pay merchants with money\" suggests that the customers are paying with cash or a check. There isn't any action in the sentence that would indicate the customers are transferring money to the merchant's account.\n3.) In the sentence \"demand satisfaction\" it is unclear what the customer is demanding. The sentence does not provide a definition or context about what a customer \"demands\".\n4.) \"Mail Order\" is an action that a customer usually does only when they are making a purchase from a third party. This doesn't make sense if they are in the store.\n5.) It is reasonable to consider the term \"Spend money\" to mean buying something. It implies the customers are purchasing something and that they are spending money on what they are buying.\n6.)The term \"Hunt\" doesn't match the context of the sentence. It doesn't seem to make sense in this context and it doesn't explain what the customer is doing.\n7.) The last option \"demand satisfaction\" suggests something a customer should do when they are unhappy with the service in a store or with what they purchased, but it makes no sense if they are already in the store.\n8.) The most logical choice is \"spend money\" since it is related to the customer's action in the store and the phrase \"Spend money with money\" makes sense since the customer is buying the items in the store.\n9.)

This makes the most sense because 4 o'clock in the afternoon is past the morning by a significant amount of time, and the sky would be starting to lighten as light changes from day to night.\nNext is \"A winter\".

'Cubicle' is also a general term for an employee's assigned space or their work area.\n2: When the question states that all the employee cubicles have computers in them, it implies that they are meant for the employees to use the computers in them to accomplish their work. Computers are a tool, not an office space or a person.\n3: Out of the given choices we can eliminate A: teach. Teaching is a function of the computer, but it does not belong to it.\n4: Cost means to'spend money on' and is more of a concept for something than an actual thing. We can eliminate C: cost.\n5: Work is something the computer does, the employee does not need to work hard to accomplish his functions, and is not what the space is meant for. We can eliminate D: work hard.\n6: Being productive is another function of employees, however, the spaces are designed to accommodate a different function; that is where the employees use the computers to accomplish their assigned functions. \n7: We can eliminate E: help people because the spaces are not meant to help people in the general sense.\n8: This leaves us with B: cost money, which states that the office cubicles cost money. \n9: The office environment with cubicles and computers is a functional one.\nSo the final choice is B: cost money.\nSo the final conclusion of the question is that all the cubicles must cost money to provide each office worker with a computer.\n\nInput: When I was young, I did my homework after getting home from school, now I find myself riding a bike to the library where I find the internet at homework central where everyone does what?

{"idx": 733, "text": "1.) The question is asking where the narrator would want to store dirt at home (a container for dirt.)\n2.) The narrator wants to store dirt at \"home\", which has been defined as a house or apartment, so we can eliminate C: corner. Corner implies a place in which the narrator resides.\n3.) In order to identify the correct answer: the narrator wants to keep the dirt somewhere safe, which can be achieved in a container, for example, a garden, fingernails, closet, or computer.\n4.) If the dirt is to be stored in the fingernails, then that means the narrator is planning to \"put\" the dirt from its container (garden or closet) into their fingernails. Fingernails are not very big, and therefore storing dirt in them would take a significant amount of time. Plus, the narrator is looking to store dirt in a home container and not directly from the garden. Therefore, we can conclude that D, is the wrong answer.\n5.) In the same way, if the dirt were stored in a garden, then one would have to dig to place the dirt in the garden, which is not necessary and requires a significant amount of physical labor. Therefore E is wrong.\n6.) Closet also does not seem like a potential solution to the narrator, since storing dirt in a closet is not \"just putting the dirt in\" like in the case of the fingernails. If the narrator went with option C, they would have to dig, which is not needed. Also, closets are not typically large enough to be able to store large containers like the one we are talking about. So the option C can't be the correct answer either.\n7.) A similar idea is applied to the option B: \"put dirt in\" fingernails. A computer, although it is possible to store dirt in, is typically not used to store or put dirt.\n8.) So the only option remaining is A: \"put dirt on\" garden. A garden has to be located outside, so we can't use it if we're working with an inside space, like an apartment or home. It also takes physical effort to put the dirt in the ground, to the point where it is almost the same as digging up", "answer": "E: closet"}

This helps protect them from false accusations and prevents misunderstandings. However, if a driver hits an officer, the driver may not necessarily be committing a crime.\n3. 3. When a police officer is hit, they may try to get revenge by issuing a ticket to the driver. This does not necessarily mean that the driver committed a direct offense, but rather that the officer is trying to make sure the driver will be more careful in the future.\n \n   4. 4. Tick off means to become angry, while ticket refers to a legal document indicating that the offender is not allowed to drive in certain areas for a certain period of time. This can occur when a driver is caught driving while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or other substances.\n   5. Choice A: Detain: This choice is incorrect because this indicates arrest, not ticketing.

So, this leaves us with the last option.\"Need a cow to be milled\" is the best option because the volunteer does want another person to do something.

A \"rectangle\" suggests a two-dimensional (flat) surface that is divided into equal parts.\n2.) The key to solving this question is understanding that a \"rectangle\" implies that all four sides will have the same measure and that this measure is distinct from the area or volume of the rectangle.\n3.)

By using the word 'useful' in the question, it means doing something that relieves the feeling of being lonely- either from the perspective of a solution to ending the feeling or a means of dealing with it at the moment without it happening again.\n3. The answer choices include: making people laugh, meeting people, socializing, and liquor.\n4. While the other options are plausible, making people laugh is more active and less socially awkward than those other two options.\n5. The action is to do something to another person to cause the other person to laugh, rather than something done for your self to make you feel better.\n6. The act of causing another person to laugh in your company does not cause them to like you, it is meant to amuse and entertain you and nothing else- so socializing and meeting people can be eliminated.\n7  So, we are left with making people laugh and liquor.\n8. Making people laugh is more like an antidote to the feeling rather than a means of dealing with loneliness as 'people' are used and this means multiple individuals- it cannot refer to one specific person because the focus of the action is on the larger group and not the specific individual.\n9. So, the correct answer is B: making people laugh. This means you do an activity where you cause many people to laugh.

{"idx": 740, "text": "1.. His day at the office was ending. That means the person, probably an employee, was spending the rest of the day, possibly the night, working at the office. Therefore, his computer was still in use. A computer would only be shut down at the end of the day after work.\n2. A computer can only be controlled, played with, or used for games, when it is in use and powered on. A computer is \"turned off\" or \"put to sleep\" at night. It only turns off fully if its power cable is removed so it does not use any power source. It can be left \"on standby,\" which means it's in a sleeping state until it receives an externally generated power signal telling it to go back to work. In this situation, the office worker was not leaving his device at home for the night and he, therefore, intended to come back to use it again.\n3.

The word traveling in the question suggests people may not feel well while traveling. However, the question is not about knowing if someone you are traveling with is not feeling well, but about telling if someone is not feeling (well) in general when traveling.\n3. This means that you are not with a specific and personal acquaintance, but simply a person you've never met before.\n4. Hence, the question is looking for specific features of someone's behavior that allows you to know they're not feeling well while travel.\n5. The choice A: have them eat, does not make much sense for people you don't know well enough to feel they're not well while traveling. The others are similar. So, eliminate all choices B: listen to what, c: tell to rest and d: have to drink coffee.\n6. The remaining choice in question is e: asking them why. \n7. This choice has two options, asking why (if) or asking why", "answer": "A: come home"}

{"idx": 749, "text": "1.'Certificate' here stands for a guarantee, which is an agreement or document that says a product is real or not.\n2. When fake products are sold as legitimate products, the guarantee (certificate) they provide cannot be authentic, and is thus illegitimate.\n3. This is the only option that fits the context and meaning of the question.\n4. So, the choice A B C or D can be eliminated.\n5.'Legitimate' means that there is a law that defines the product, as opposed to an unlawful product.\n6. The phrase 'legitimate designer handbag', as a phrase, would make little sense with this statement and it is an oxymoron.\n7. Since it is illegal selling fake handbags as legitimate, this choice cannot be legitimate handbag.\n8. So the answer is E: a legitimate handbag will have a certificate of authenticity, but an illegitimate handbag will not have a certificate.\nSo the final (best) answer is E: illegitimate handbags will not carry a certificate of authenticity.\n\nInput: What do the words 'different' and 'difficult' imply about a task?

Choices: 0:Wind 1:Rain 2:Snow 3:Evaporators 4:Temperature rise 5:Clouds\nOutput: Rain and Snow are precipitation forms, and are not evaporating.\nWind is a common natural form of heat transfer, but the question seems to be asking for an answer that is caused by an increase in temperature.\nEvaporators are heat transfer devices that use the heat in water to cool hot surfaces.

{"idx": 751, "text": "1.'filing cabinet' is the most logical answer because it is an office furniture item that is explicitly called a desk. It is the only one of the five options.\n2. Moreover, it implies that it takes up office space.\n3. The other options: filing cabinet, desk, drawer, and folder are not office furniture items, rather, they are objects that could be stored in an office. \n4. In this context, it is not appropriate to consider the meaning of the words filing cabinet or drawer on their own, as it would be overly prescriptive.\n5.

Choices:  IA: summer B: weekdays, spring, winter II.II: Sundays, winter days\nOutput:  1. We need to break the phrase \"an outdoor market in Venise\" down into individual components to determine the correct answer.\n2. A market of any type is defined by the products that are sold at such institutions, namely food, clothes, items for the home, etc. In determining the most logical choice of the given options, we can eliminate several of the choices.\n3. For example, \"gifts\" would not fit the profile of a market, and it is more likely that those items could be purchased indoors. \"Books\" is also not applicable as most books could be found indoors as well.\n4. Similarly for \"antiques\" which can also be found more often inside a building, even vintage collectibles can be found in regular stores, and they may not necessarily be exclusively for outdoors.\n5. This means that the only remaining answer after eliminating the above choices is \"in winter\": \"winterdays\".\n6. Moreover, the question specifically says \"days\" so we don't even need the word \"weeks\" to be correct.\n7. With this in mind, the only correct answer is \"II.II\" because \"Winter days\" in Venice is during the cold months of winter.\nSo the final key phrase is days, the most logical answer being winter days.\n\nInput: At the bistro, there were what kinds of menus?

{"idx": 752, "text": "1) The question is asking where an excavation should not take place. An excavation is the action or process of digging excavations. It is not a place, such as a construction site or a cemetery, but an action or process involving digging.\n2) Thus, the question is asking which locations are incorrect as places for an excavation to occur.\n3) Looking at the choices given, an excavation would not happen at a construction site. A cemetery would also not fit since excavations usually occur for research or construction, like road-building, and would not happen at a cemetery.\n4) A building would not be suitable for an excavation since such events would require digging and excavations which do not normally occur within buildings themselves.\n5) A city would only be inaccurate if specified as a city center or some other similar reference. However, in such a reference case, it would only be the specific city being referenced that could not allow for an excavation.\n6) An archaeological site would be an acceptable place for an excavation as it is a location or site where excavations normally occur.\n7) So, out of the five choices given, only the archaeological site of choice E is relevant and suitable.\n8) The correct answer is thus E, the archaeological site.\nSo the final correct answer is: E - archaeological site\n\nInput: What is the difference between a cowboy\u2019s lifestyle and a farmer\u2019s?

Choices:  (a) Henry VIII (b) Hamlet (c) Juliet's Will (d) Death of a Salesman (e) Love's Labours' Lost\nOutput: The correct answer is C, Juliet's Will.\n\nNote: \nShakespeare is a playwright who wrote many books and his books are also referred as plays. Among many plays, Romeo and Juliet is one of them and it is the last published book in 1623\n\n1. This rule is based on the book Juliet's Will, which was published after Shakespeare's death, so the book wasn't written by Shakespeare himself.\n2. He was a playwright and his published works were plays. So he was a playwright.\n3. Among many others, Romeo and Julie is the last published play written by him under his name, therefore is the last published book written by him.\nSo, the correct answer is C, the last published play written under his name and the last book written by him is Juliet's Will\n\nInput: The question is asking for a definition of the verb \u201cto get\u201d.

Turning a knob C. Tap a light D. Swiping a remote button  E. Flicking a light\nOutput:\n\nStep1: From the given options, one has to identify which of the options describes the best answer for the question asked, namely how to turn off a light.\n\nStep2: To turn off a light, someone should press a button. But out of the options provided, there is no mention of using a button to turn off a light; we do not know the context of the scenario\n\nStep3: Tapping a light has no meaning in context of turning off light; we cannot infer that the person asked to turn off the light, actually has a light to tap when he turns it off. Also, tapping is not used to turn off the light in the absence of any other light sources. Hence, C is eliminated.\n\nStep4: Swiping something has no correlation to turn off lights, as in we cannot assume if a person is turning off a light, he will have a phone or device to swipe.\n\nStep5: We cannot assume a person is turning off lights by swiping, because there is no mention of such objects or devices in the question. And even if we could, it has no correlation to turning on or off the light, as swiping something or someone means to move a finger or hand across another object or thing and not to turn something off. Therefore, E is eliminated.\nStep6: A person turns a knob to turn off a light, as in, if a house door has a knob, a person would turn the knob to open or close the door. The question asks us to pick a word that would best describe how to turn off a switch or light. Therefore, D is correct.\n\nInput: The city was not", "answer": "B: neat"}

This is often the result of public fundraising or donations to build such a statue.\nThe choices given are: a church, theatre, large city, water fountain, central park.\nThe correct answer is 'C: large city'. A large city would have 'thousands of statue'.\n\nInput: When someone is working which device is typically closest? Choices:  C: stapler E: keyboard B: printer A: phone D: calculator\nOutput: Step 5: What is \"typically closest\" refers to a common phenomenon that occurs more often than not. To determine the choice with the most logical probability, we must therefore eliminate choice E: keyboard. Keyboards are rarely adjacent to printers, but rather sit next to a computer screen. Since the person is working, they are usually looking at the screen as opposed to the keyboard. Therefore, keyboard should be ruled out.\nStep 6, option B: Printer. Printers are often located next to a desk, but rarely near a phone or computer. \nStep 7, option A: Phone. Phones often sit next to a desk because answering or making phone calls is the primary use case. A phone would also be a more likely option over a calculator.\nStep 8. The remaining options are calculator and stapler. Calculator has been discarded because it's a device that is typically carried by a person when they are traveling around. Being too close is unusual. Therefore, only stapler remains. Staplers are placed at nearby desks because they are small physical devices that are frequently utilized.\nStep 9, conclusion: The most logical answer based on common use and likelihood is Stapler which is the most likely to be \"typically closest\".\n\nOutput: The question is asking which device is typically closest when someone is working. The best answer is the stapler, which is", "answer": "C: large city"}

This clarification is important in the context of understanding which \"crowds of \"gamblers\" will be present at one particular \"event\" that brings out \"the biggest crowds.\"\n4. After knowing that, let's look at the choices given for the \"event.\" We can eliminate choices \"A, \"B, and \"E.\"\n5. We know that \"race tracks and \"Triple Crown\" both refer to horse races, but also that the \"American Southwest\" refers to a desert region which doesn't normally involve horses.\n6.

However, the contextual information provided in the question suggests that \"everybody seemed to be betting on horse racing and that, based on the \"regular gamblers,\" there were going to be many people present.\n8.

The remaining options seem to have something to do with the wounds.\n7.) However, nothing is specified as to the cause of or nature of the wounds.\n8.) Additionally, \"crossing a street\" is something a person does, but it doesn't specify what they are attempting to cross.\n9.) \"A person is in the woods, wounded\" seems like it should be specific enough. After all, there is no one else who could have been wounded.\n10.) Thus, we arrive at the answer \"Cross street.\"\n11.) This means the person should seek help elsewhere than \"in the woods.\" \n12.)

So, this is a red herring.\n5) Option B, Being Ridiculed: 6) Being ridiculed would not make sense in the context of going public. If anything, the company is putting themselves under a lot of scrutiny when doing this.\n7) Option C - Problems: 8) A company's going public would not generally be due to problems, unless it is a financial company that went through a major scandal. The question suggests this is not the context where this is occurring, since if it were due to a major problem such as this, it wouldn't be going public.\n9) Option D - More Funding: 10) The option of receiving more funding would be logical, given that they are in fact going public to receive monetary or financial benefits due to this.\n11) Eliminating the other incorrect options leaves us with only option E.\n12) The company is going public specifically to share information and access more funds, which makes sense for option E, Telling All.\nSo the final answers is E: Telling All\n\nInput: What will a bicycle need to move forward?

The information given provides an upper bound on the height of the mountain - above 2000 feet. There cannot be an eastern state where the mountain is lower than 2000 but higher than 100. This rules out Pennsylvania and Asia which are lower than 20,000 feet.\n3.) This leaves us with three remaining states: Switzerland, Austria and picture. \n4.) This brings us to the next rule - 2 or more states need to be in contention for the same geographic feature.\n5.) Since we are looking for a'mountain' and not a 'hill', Switzerland cannot be considered and Picture is also ruled out as an eastern state (all US States are east of the Mississippi).\n6.) This leaves us with only two states (eastern state and the mountain) and, since the geographic feature need not be a country, either Austria or Pennsylvania is a final contender.\n7.) This brings us to our final rule - no one specific state or feature (i.e. the mountain in Switzerland or the mountain in Pennsylvania) can be picked definitively. \n8.) In the absence of information regarding the type of the mountain, we cannot conclude that the mountain is in Pennsylvania and the eastern state becomes Pennsylvania, which rules out Austria and the eastern state becomes a mountain in either Pennsylvania or any other western state.\n9.)

The question has the following options, A - D, and it's helpful to break these down to make the answer clear:\n       a. department store - unlikely because these could be cleaned in the store and it would seem pointless to bring dirt into the store.\n       b. school - it is possible, but unlikely that he would leave the shoes somewhere visible like a school entryway.\n       c. garden - the same can be said for gardens.\n       d. office building - since the shoes must have previously been in an office building, and it was likely the office building that they left in, it would only make sense to place shoes back somewhere in the office building.\n5. Option E is incorrect because the shoes could have been left in a different location entirely, like an apartment building or hotel.\n6.

First, let's look at Option A: \"medicine cabinet.\" This is the more common and relevant choice since it's related to the deodorant being applied.\n4.) Option B: \"medicine chest\" also makes sense, however it is more related to medicines than deodorant, so it is discarded.\n5.) Option C: \"armpits\" is a bit too literal with this phrase (i.e. putting some on an armpit). In addition, the phrase \"put some on\" would better fit here.\n6.)

In that example, what the players are playing is the game of Monopoly.\n5. Hence looking at the choices: A) Very heavy is not relevant to players taking the lead in a game.\n6.

{"idx": 781, "text": "1.\"I wanted a side chair for people visiting me while I worked\" implies a strong desire which means the person is highly likely to have it done in the expected or preferred position.\n2. Based on the desired position of the chair i.e. \"put\", the possible position of the side chair would be either in the office or library. It would not be in the bathroom or building as they are large spaces.\n3. So the correct answer would be C: the library as it is a smaller space which means the chair has a greater chance of being placed in the library instead of the office. \n4. Choices A:-B:building: these two choices are not viable as being the preferred position of the chair in a sentence like \"I wanted it put in the library\".\n4. The answer is thus B: office and C: library.\nSo the final answered is B: office and C is the library.\n\nInput: After they all drank too much cider, what did the people on the trip do to get themselves sober again? Choices:  I : they walked everywhere II : they played basketball III A : hungover IV: they tried to remember the previous night V : went home\nOutput: 1.\u201cthey drank too much cydier\u201d means they consumed excessive amounts of the cydier.\n2. The only way to bring oneself back to normal or sober states is by drinking water.\n3. \u201chungover\u201d means feeling unwell or not good due to excessive consumption of drink.\n4.

John's feelings would depend on what emotional issues contributed to his spending, which in turn is based on what he bought. \n3. All of the given choices except 'owning' are products one might purchase in connection with feeling a particular emotion or feeling.\n4. We know that John spent more than was reasonable, so he could have purchased items such as painkillers, tonic water, or medicines that could have relieved any discomfort he may have felt. \n5. These products may have resulted in some initial pain relief but ultimately John may have needed to spend more to find relief, which brings us to our original conclusion.\n6. As a result, we know that John spent too much to try and feel what was most likely some kind of relief for his pain and discomfort. \n7. So the best answer we can get to determine the precise emotion in question is B: pleasure. \n8. We know John was feeling some degree of discomfort, possibly pain, in association with what he spent money on, so we know that pleasure was not the main emotion, but the secondary or subordinate emotion John was feeling.\n9.

While this may be a good place for one who doesn't have children, we can eliminate it as a choice because it isn't the case for parents of young children. \n4.

Not all types of cabinets (and cabinets not always contain cabinets), which would make it difficult to place plastic items within it.\n6. Option E suggests the garbage dump, but it's irrelevant. Additionally, having plastic things within the garbage dump makes sense due to its use for recycling, but it's an unpleasant thought. \n7.

Dave stated that the beer would be off the floor, implying heat and that it does not require extra effort after being moved, so the refrigerator cannot be the correct answer.\n4. A closet typically requires electricity, but this will not be a problem here, so closet is ruled out.\n5. The 'can' indicates that the beer was placed in a can or can be placed in a can, so this can't be the answer.\n6. Dave moved the beer away from it's original location, so the shelf is irrelevant.\n7. A soccer game involves intense physical exertion, requiring much activity and movement, which does not resonate with the requirements that Dave's beer be easy to find and easy to reach.\n8.

{"idx": 798, "text": "1: The question describes a situation involving breakfast eaten with a large family where dirty dishes end up in the sink.\n2. Options D and E are logical answers, since it is almost inevitable that you will encounter a pile or collection of dirty dishes in the sink after sharing a large family meal, especially if everyone is eating at the same time.\n3. However, the correct answer is C: bad breath, as described by this question, when eating food.\n4. One of the advantages of eating breakfast with extended family is that it is more sociable and involves more interaction and communication among the people involved. \n5. However, it can also be a stressful situation, as the question and answer indicate, and one of the stressors could be the bad breath that develops in others or oneself when certain foods are consumed.\n6. This could be addressed and minimized by taking a few steps to avoid getting and spreading bad breath.\n7. So, the correct answer is option C: bad breath.\nSo the final answers are A: fullness; B: underwear; C: bad breath; D: better day; E: dirty dishes", "answer": "E: dirty dishes"}

Let's examine them one by one.\n3: Option A: conference. This doesn't match with your choice of viewing event. It is not often that all attendees face something in a conference. They can either be seated at tables or standing and listening.\n4: Option B: theater. This option is not the best because the event described doesn't require a stage for performance and it's generally not a theater type of event.\n5: Option C: building. This option could fit but more because'sit and watch' don't actually specify a venue for the event. This venue might include any number of indoor rooms.\n6: Option D: floor. This is another option that could fit since the event could be staged in rooms or buildings which have floors.\n7: However, this is not the best choice as you'd be looking for a place to buy the ticket, not an option to watch the event.\n8: Based on the above, the option E: church is the best because it represents a place where many people sit facing the same direction (typically) and it's a venue suitable for purchasing a ticket to watch an event.\n9: Therefore, the answer is E.\nSo the final answers is E: church\n\nInput: A man put a rope around the wheel of a parked car, then pushed up until what happened?

By examining the choices, we see they are all related to objects that might be used to store, protect, or transport chess, so narrowing in on specific details of each place or item is helpful.\n3. The most logical answer from this perspective appears to be B: Strategy. \n4. Strategy is the term used when playing chess, and thus seems to be the item most likely to be used to store the pawn.\n5. However, let's also consider the broader meaning of the term, which refers to a general plan of action or overall approach to completing some goal or objective.\n6. Since the chess pawn was described earlier as lacking a specific purpose yet, what strategy is a good place for that pawn may refer to the overall plan of action for using the pawn.\n7. Therefore, the answer is B again: Strategy.\nSo the final answers is B: Strategy.\n\nInput: How does a person know if they will be able to use a computer in the morning in their office? Choices:  Yes/No - A: You won't\nOutput: 1) The question here is asking what one should expect when accessing a computer in an office space. By definition, computers are supposed to function according to pre-programmed logic, and in any particular environment, it is not reasonable to think the computer will not function.\n2. Based on these definitions and expectations, a \"No\" would be the likely answer option in this situation.\n3. If the other choices didn't seem obvious, we could evaluate some details more closely to narrow down the possibilities.\n4. As it's morning, there's not much lighting yet, so it might be hard to see what's on the screen (choice D), and there may be sound issues with the equipment (choice E).\n5. If someone is working on a computer, their actions may also affect the computer (choice E).\n6. Let's look more closely at C: You might. \n7.

{"idx": 801, "text": "1 The question is asking for a noun or person who regularly spends money on present for others.\n2. The text of the question states that the person in question is a goo shopper or a \"go shopper.\"\n3. This means that they need to go to the store a lot, and in many such occasions, they would probably be buying gifts for others.\n4. The options include A: Go shopping (B: buy presents, C: gift buyer, D: earn money, E: generous).\n5. Among the options, \"generous\" isn't necessarily the word that describes the action of buying presents a lot or regularly. \n6. Similarly, buying presents does not earn money so that is not a good option.\n7. If the person buys a lot of presents, and regularly, this action would imply they have money. Therefore, this choice can be eliminated from the options.\n8. \"Gift buyer\" as an option means that the person buys and purchases things as a gift, not necessarily meaning they regularly do this.\n9. Also, \"earning money\" should be dependent on time and effort rather than the action of buying, which is why we won't use this as an option.\n10. This leaves us as having 3 final choices which are \"generous,\" \"buy presents,\" and \"earn money.\"\n11. Among these options, \"generous is an adjective and not a noun.\n12.

War is a conflict between states or groups of people. It involves some form of fighting or armed conflict among countries or factions, which is not the intention of the question. Therefore, option B is eliminatiated.\n4. Airfields are areas where airplanes land and take off. They are a part of an airport, which is not an area that one might find old or unused airplanes. Thus, option A is eliminatiated. \n5. Sky could conceivably refer to the upper atmosphere rather than clouds, but the description of the question suggests this is unlikely. Thus, option C is eliminatiated.  \n6. Aircraft carrier is a large ship used as a platform for launching airplanes. This would not include aircraft not currently in use. Hence, option D is eliminatiated.    \n7. This leaves the final option to be 'graveyard.' A graveyard is an area designated for burial or internment of the dead.

The beaver probably wouldn't leave the zoo, unless it came from the zoo, so E is eliminated.\n6. \"The beaver\" can be assumed to be in nature or a foresty/wooded environment, so beavers, generally, wouldn't leave their normal environment, i.e. \"a wooded area\", the natural habitat of beavers.\n7. Hence, the beaver will not leave \"the wooded area\", which is the only choice left, \"a wooded area\".\nSo the final choice is A: wooded area.\n\nInput: Which of the next two places would cause the most anxiety? Choices:  B: hotel A: airport C: theater E: restaurant \nOutput:It means when we are feeling nervous or anxious about something, then we usually feel uncomfortable about going into a potentially unfamiliar environment where the situation we are anxious about could occur, causing us to feel a greater level of anxiety than in a familiar environment.\n1. The reason for anxiety in a hotel could be related to the anxiety we normally experience at an airport because travel and flights are common situations we'd be anxious about. So B is the correct answer, even if we were previously anxious about being at an airport.\n2. Restaurants, theaters, etc., aren't typically associated with travel anxiety, so they aren't typically associated to bring about a higher level of anxiety.\n3. A hotel, though, could still bring about feelings of anxiety as it may be unfamiliar to you. Therefore, the correct choice, B: hotel.\n\nInput: A good friend to you will tell you the truth about what? Choices: A: their own mistakes B: their job C: your future D: their friends \nOutput:1.

{"idx": 817, "text": "1) The only options that make sense in this context are villages, rural areas, urban areas, big cities, tribes, and tribes since they are all terms that refer to places.\n\n2) We know that village is not the opposite because if village were the opposite, then it would be the opposite of itself; making no sense. We can eliminate options A, B, and C.\n\n3) The villages option cannot be the opposite to villages because it does not negate a particular type of place.\nInstead, it states that villages are present while the opposite would mean villages are not present.\n\nOption E, tribe, cannot be the opposite because tribal villages are often situated within larger urban areas.\n\n4) Since the answer cannot be a place, it must be a word which refers to non-places.\n\n5) The opposite of villages would be urban areas, which makes sense given the context and the other options available.\n\nThus it is Answer (D) Big City.\n\nSo the final answer would be A: town\n\n\nInput: How would the writer react to such a statement from the character? Choices:  F: call out his name (1 point) G: get mad at him (1 point) H: tell what a good idea it was (1 point) J: scoff at him (1 point ) K: ask what he meant by it (1 point)\nOutput: If the author was upset with the character saying such a thing, he would react by getting angry.\n\nSo, we need to figure out which of the options describes this answer.\n\nLooking at the options, a scoff is just a noise that one makes and is clearly not a part of the answer. Similarly, calling out his name is also unlikely.\n\nWe can assume that the answer must be what the author did in this situation and the only one that does that is J: scoffing.\n\nThus, we need to select answer (J) from the provided choices.\n\nInput: The book ended poorly, but not all books that end well are good books.

{"idx": 818, "text": "1) The phrase \"living life fully\" is an idiomatic way of asking someone about their overall outlook on their life, their goals, ambitions, and overall satisfaction with how they live.\n2) The options given are \"joy, \"adventurous,\" \"valuable,\" \"happiness,\" and \"early death.\"\n3) To understand which feeling corresponds most closely to the idea of living life fully, we must analyze each option in terms of the context of the question.\n4) Joy is not the same as living life fully; joy in life is a result of living life fully, and it's certainly possible to live a full life without experiencing great joy, especially due to unexpected setbacks or obstacles.\n5) Adventurous is not necessarily the same thing as living life fully; there are many ways to live life adventurously and to embrace uncertainty. One could live a conventional, structured life and still feel adventurous, or vice versa.\n6) Value is not necessary connected to the concept of living life fully. There are many valuable things in life that don't equate to a satisfying, \"fully\" lived life.\n7) Lastly, we have happiness and early death. Happiness and early death aren't necessarily exclusive options, and the idea that one would automatically equate to the end of life is inaccurate. However, choosing early death is a way of living life fully, so that option doesn't necessarily correspond to the others. The phrase, 'living without regret' might better suit this option.\n8) Thus, the correct answer to the question of what someone feeling a full and meaningful life would feel is \"Adventurous.\" It most closely corresponds to the overall concept of living life fully, which includes embracing uncertainty.\nSo the final answers is A: adventurous\n\nInput: How are 8-10s and 80-100s related?

Choices:  A1: Hardcover with a glossy cover A2: Hardcover with a dust jacket A3: Paperback made from cardboard A4: Paperback made of newsprint A5: Spiral bound A6: Thinner than an anthology\nOutput: 1: When asked whether a book should be called a \"hardback\", the answer is obvious by examination of the first three types of books in the list which contain hard covers as opposed to the other types, each with a thin flat cover.\n2: The question can be split into cases based on what type of book is being referred to. Each subsequent choice is based on one of the other five choices. \n3: A1: Hardcover Books: These types of books contain a hard outer cover, as with any paperback with a hard cover. In hardback books, this outer cover has a glossy finish and does not show an underlying color. \n4: A2: Hardcover Book: This type of book contains a hard outer cover as well.

On a hot day, a person would likely go somewhere where they can cool down and feel the water's refreshing nature. \n3. The body of water should be easily accessible to a large number of people, or at least not in a small body of water like a fountain or small pool.\n4. The only choices which adequately fulfill these criteria are a lake, pond, beach or a bathers' pool.\n5. Among these options, the answer with the clearest description is the beach with shallow water. 6. The beach has shallow water, but a pond's water levels also fluctuate, while a lake is too large and a bathe's pool is smaller than a lake and is not necessarily easily accessible. 7. This means the answer is B: pond.\nSo the finalanswer is B: pond\n\nInput: What is the result of a computer processing thousands of bits during a second? Choices: 1 A: tray of water 2 B: flashlight 3 C: blink 4 D: drop 5 E: tick 6 F: shutter\nOutput: The computer processes many bits of information and data in a fraction of a second, typically with the conversion of digital signals into electrical impulses, such as when a touch screen or the home button is pressed.\n7. To determine the answer for this question (which choices does computer processing involve?), let's break down the choices given, starting with:\n8. 1. The 'tray of water' is not logical as it is not a container for bits that can be processed, the 'flaslight' option only provides illumination, and 'tick' doesn't make sense as bits or a digital signal are not naturally rhythmic or sequential.\n9. Leaving us with choices:\n10.'shutter' is not correct as it is referring to a mechanism for opening and closing a camera lens, not any form of processing or conversion of bits.\n11. This ultimately takes us to the answer of 'Blank' (no choice)\nSo the final answeris Blank\n\nInput: When was the first known reference to the phrase \"Hell No\"? Choices", "answer": "C: lake"}

We will analyze and eliminate the incorrect choices first:\n4. We can eliminate choice A: \"happiness\" and choice C: create music\".\n5. This is because happiness and creating music do not appear to be outcomes associated with being bad at playing the violin.\n6. We can rule out choice B: relaxation.\n7. If one is bad at violin, relaxation would be incomprehensible in relation to the given question since relaxation is usually incompatible with the act of playing a violin.\n8. So the left choices are: choice D: sadness and choice E: loud noises.\n9. The last choice, E: loud noises makes little sense because being bad at playing the Violin and also loud noises makes no sense. \n10. It is not associated with poor performance on the violin, it sounds ridiculous.\n11. This means Choice D is the only logical answer: Sadness. \n12. Because Sadness makes most sense.\n13.

None of them are specifically an action but rather the result of an action. This eliminates A,B,E.\n6: This suggests that listening produces an action that is the same kind of action. This leads to two different choices, talking and learning.\n 7: We can eliminate option D (learn from each other) as the second action is an action performed by both people, whereas learning is a state of knowledge.\n8: There is not enough information to determine which of the given actions is the second action.\n 9: So, the question becomes: \"what is the second action?\" Or, what is the person doing?\n 10: The given answer choices consist of the \"actions\" that people take: talking, believing something, paying bills.

So, we can only use C & D.\n4) The other option is option E, 'classroom.'\n5) If John broke a window in a classroom that he shouldn't have in the first place, he would feel guilty but should not be held accountable for his actions, as breaking a window is not a crime.

It's not a good fit for what is being asked. \n8) Option C: this answers the question \"in what place could you find the air that has been breething [sic] by many people recently?\" This is the place suggested in the question. \n9) Hence, the answer is C \"house.\"\nSo the final answer here is C: house\n\nInput: Which is a better indicator of time, a sundial which is made from stone or a digital clock? Choices:  the sundial which is not always accurate A: the sundial which never breaks B: the digital clock C: the sundial it is more expensive D: the clock it is more durable E: the sundial that is not always accurate\nOutput: 1: The question asks, which is a better indicator of the time, a sundail or a digital clock. This means that both devices are used to determine the time of day as opposed to other methods.\n2. The phrasing suggests that since digital clocks are more accurate, and since there is no other criterion for judging time-keeping devices, they would be the better indicator.", "answer": "D: train station"}

It is specific to whether they use potatoes only.\n2: As a common vegetable, potato is commonly a component of dishes served at restaurants and market stalls specialising in potatoes are therefore likely, but this doesn't exclude other possible uses of potato.\n3: Ireland is a country but not an organisation. It doesn't produce potatoes for businesses though it may produce them for sale to individuals.\n4: Produce market would also specialise in producing and selling potatoes.\n5: A dessert spot that didn't use potatoes would be unusual.\n6: The most plausible answer therefore is B: vegetable market.\nSo the final answers are B: vegatable market\n\nInput: What do you put on your feet when you want to go to sleep?

She can take care of lots of plants, like her mother and grandmother do (they grow indoors large bushes that sometimes fall to the ground).\n\nNote: the best answer will always match the actual person (if it was an example). So we need to identify the logic that applies to that specific question:\n\n  * Jennifer never wants to take care of any plants, she has no space to take care of them, and she never does it.\n\n  * Jennifet always wants to take care all plants (not just some) and she has a limited space (she doesn't like take care all the huge bushes", "answer": "D: pass sentence"}
{"idx": 836, "text": "1. The question is asking where security guards drive golf carts to prevent harm to young adults from intruders, criminals, or other threats.\n2. In order to understand this question, we first have to look at the following sentence that precedes it:\n> This is an example of a \"pigeonhole\" question, where you must identify which narrow set of answers apply to the broader topic.\n3. Security at events such as concerts, airports, and colleges requires an abundance of protection and preventative measures that can become costly and complicated.\n4. Therefore, we can safely disregard options A: concert, B: home, and E: university as they are all out-of-context.\n5. The next question we should ask is what young adults might benefit from security.\n6. It's logical that young adults in higher education institutions like D: college, (11.5%) or in social settings like B: home (10.59%), would need more protection. However, the largest percent is attributed to C: airport (15.26%), which is likely because it would likely attract young adults as it is where they can arrive and depart from the country.\n7. However, \"young adults\" might also include adults who are younger than 25, which was not specified in the question.\n8. As a result, we can safely eliminate B: home, E: university, and eliminate C: airport as it might attract young adults that are 25 years and older.\n9. The next choice to eliminate is D: college due to their lack of relevance and specificity (they are not known to be protected by security guards in golf carts)\n10. We can now focus on the remaining two options, A: concert and B: golf course.\n11. We can see that golf courses are not associated with protection or security, especially in an overt way like a golf cart.\n12. Moreover, concerts might attract large audiences with high potential for violence, injury, and criminal activity, such as arson or vandalism. Concerts might also include heavy alcohol, drug, or substance usage, which could lead to violence and other related dangers.\n13.

Now lets look at what flooring people usually put down in places.\n4. First and foremost, is the ground itself. The man wants flooring so he doesnt need to put down grass, dirt, etc.\n5. Next you have tiles. Tiles are a floor covering that can be flat or have a texture.\n6. You also have carpet, which are basically floors that can be installed either with a rug or with a tray underneath it.\n7. Then you have the other kinds of flooring that are made of a thin layer of plastic and are known as \"flooring\".\n8. As the man already stated he wanted flooring, not tiles, rugs or floors, we can rule these out. This leaves us with two options: ground and carpet. As the man was inside a house, he had to be looking inside that house and he couldnt have bought flooring, thus the man needed flooring to be installed in his home.\n9. So, the answer he needed flooring was C: House.\nSo the final option is C: house", "answer": "C: house"}

Out of the choices given, a sit, a mistake, an excretion, a sex, and a reproduction, the only options that match with legs getting tired are sitting down and making mistakes.\n3. It is unlikely that a sex will happen because the legs are tired. \n4. Likewise, it is unlikely that the legs will excrete something while tired because that would imply an involuntary action.\n5. It is unlikely that the legs reproduce when tired because the tiredness could only be a factor in the production of new limbs or appendages.\n6. It is unlikely that there will be a mistake just because the person is tired, but mistakes can happen during times of tiredness so this is a valid choice.\n7.

E: bump\nOutput: 1: The question asks about the sound a car makes when it falls off a cliff (the first time it has driven down this specific path).\n2. The text makes no mention of anything or anyone involved in the accident besides the car, which indicates the only sound that can be heard is the car's.\n3. The choices mentioned are A: squeal, B: bang, C: pop, D: crash, and E: bump.  \n4. In a situation with a car falling off a small cliff and only hearing the car, it's unlikely that the car would make a bang or crash sound because those sounds usually involve things hitting each other.\n5.

It is not Mark's ignorance of a situation but the opposite - he wants to stop being ignorant of an important matter in his life.\n3) To answer why Mark wants to stop being ignorance, one must first analyze all the choices and determine the possible meanings of the word \"ignorant\" within the given context.\n4) Looking at the choices one can eliminate: \"understand\", since Mark doesn't want to understand a given matter, but instead wants to end his ignorance. \"Were there\" is irrelevant, since what Mark seeks to do has nothing to do with whether or not anything was there. Likewise, \"in-between\" and \"ignorance\" are used in similar meanings.\n5) Therefore, the relevant choices are B: want as an object in the sentence and E: ignorant as an adjective to describe a state.\n6) In-depth analysis shows that the phrase \"want to know the truth\" is a noun which is the subject (hence the B: to want is the action) and the word truth is the direct object. \"Why?\" The phrase \"exist in the truth in ignorance\" is the complement and it is a predicate adjective. \"want to know\" is the adverb of degree. So the sentence can be stated as: Mark Wants to exist in the truth, because he doesn't want to continue in ignorance.\n7) Putting the choices into more logical order: \"in ignorance\" implies Mark is referring to a state of being unaware of the truth of a matter, hence choice E: ignorant\n8) Hence, the Answer is B: E: ignorance\nSo the final answer was B: E: ignorant\n\nInput:The book was not where he left it, and it was not hard to find.

If it were with other brass instruments this would be a brass quartet, which doesn't really exist (it is typically a brass trio). \n5. Answer A is not correct as a symphony is not a brass instrument. Thus, it cannot be a viola in a symphony.\n6. Likewise, answer B is not correct as a band is not a string instrument. It can't be a viola in the band.\n7. It cannot be in a string quartet or brass quartet, as this would imply that the viola is playing alongside other string or brass instruments.\n8. The only other answer choice that makes logical sense is Orchestra (answer B).\n9. The most common definition of an orchestra is a group of musicians that play instruments of the string, brass and woodwind varieties.  The typical configuration of these instruments is like a string quartet. \n10. This question implies that the viola is a member of the orchestra, and is playing alongside other brass instruments, but not alongside other string instruments (so not as part of a quartet).\n11. The answer is B: orchestra.\nSo the final answers is B: orchestra\n\nInput: Which of these is the most likely reason for Jill to be feeling a sensation she has had many times?

They work in exchanges where they also have offices. \n3) There are many different types of exchanges in the financial sector with different functions and locations.\n4) However, the question does not state the type of exchange these traders work in and implies that an office is where the traders work. Thus, option E \"office\" is the correct answer.\nSo the final is E: office\n\nInput 4: What wouldn't someone do if they were trying to find that one item? Choices:  B C D E\nOutput: The question asks what action a person wouldn't do if they were trying actively to find something.\n1.

Choices: 2) A: stay in place B: take action C: fall asleep D: go without movement E: leave\nOutput: 1.) The question: What did the student does after the teacher told him that he should go to the next room, is looking toward the actions that could possibly occur.\n2.) The clue in the question is that it has happened after the student was told to go to the next, or to \u201cgo\u201d, which is what we have to consider next.\n3.) Among the suggested choices, \u2018to stay in position\u2019, \u2018to fall in sleep\u2019, \u2018to take an action\u2019 and \u201cto leave\u201d can all be considered, but what the question demands is that the student \u201cgo without movement\u201d.\n4.)

{"idx": 854, "text": "1 The question is asking the reader what, if anything, can be found at a bus station.\n2. Bus Stations are a common form of transportation, so a lot of people go there. Given the context, there is no need to describe a person in this case.\n3. We can eliminate \"city center\" because it would be more logical to say that there is someone in a bus station than to refer to the city itself.\n4. \"Maps\" does not make sense because maps are not things that \"can help you.\u201d\n5. \"Busy city\" could describe a city where there are many people, but this does not offer any information on what can be found there.\n6. The final choice left is \"lottery ticket\". A lottery ticket can give you money but no useful information about where to go to ride a bus.\n7. Hence, \"Lottery Ticket\" is the correct answer.\nSo the final answers is C: Lottery Ticket\n\nInput:When would a person be at home with a stitch in their side? Choices:  B: running C: jogging D: walk E: sprint\nOutput: 1, The question is asking the location when a person experiences an ache or pain in their chest that could be a sign of a problem.\n2. When a person experiences chest pain, it is often from lack of proper oxygenation to their lungs, which results in discomfort. The pain itself is referred to as a \u201cstitch,\u201d which is the sensation people get when there isn\u2019t enough oxygen in their blood.\n3. The key here is to identify where this \u201cstitch\u201d will be experienced.\n4. A person could be at home if they are experiencing pain in their chest, or they could be in their home if they are experiencieng pain in their chest. The key is to find what is the correct statement.\n5. The key to identifying the correct answer is to identify the action that would result in a stitch, which is running or jogging. The action in the statement is \u201cwith a stitch in your side.\u201d Hence, the statement is correct as it references a person is in their home when they are experiencing pain from running or jogging.\n6. Therefore, the answer is B, the statement that refers to a person being at home while running or jogging", "answer": "C: maps"}

A picnic basket, a wine press, a fruit cocktail, and a kitchen can contain grapes, but the answer should be more specific to where these grapes are put.\n3.

This leaves us with A (a basket) and E (a kitchen), both of which are viable choices.\n5. However, a kitchen is more likely to be used to cook grapes, not just contain them. \n6. Hence, the answer should be the basket.\nSo the final  answer is A: a basket.\n\nInput: In the end, what happens?

Panic, as the opposite of calm, is a natural response to this scenario: people are trying to escape from the attackers. It wouldn't be the same as going to prison. \n3. Mass Hysteria, though it might be a natural response at the start of an attack, does not explain the response of going to prison later on.\n4. Getting into trouble refers to situations of non-physical criminal behavior, such as speeding or reckless driving, though it is usually not a consequence for a widespread monster attack.\n5. Similarly, a monster attack is unlikely to lead to murder.\n6. This leaves us with B: Panic.\nSo the final answers is A: panic\n\nInput: One-eyed Duffy, known to those in the know was one of the hardest poker players of his day, and the most intimidating. Choices:  A. B. C. D.\nOutput: 1: \"One-eyed Duff\" refers to someone with \"a unique and identifiable quality.\" The one-eye quality refers to the fact that he played the game with only one eye.\n2. \"a poker player,\" who is playing a game of poker, is a natural extension of the player's unique quality.\n3. \"hard,\" in the sense of being very skilled, is an adjective that indicates a quality of the player, not his opponents.\n4. The expression \"know those in the know\" refers to a sub-group of people, in this case, poker players and those who are known by the group of players.\n5. This sub-set, made up of the \"players in the know' is a direct reference to Duff.\n6. Putting everything together, Duffy is the hardest and the most intimating player of his day.

Let us see the options available.\n3: Option A: A soccer field is specifically for soccer and a soccer match. Moreover, at such events, there is usually a boundary surrounding it. In other words, there should be only a minimal amount of popcorn and cotten candy on the grass.\n4: Option B: The Fairgrounds are a special area that has several attractions, such as cotton candy, popcorn, and even rides. So, it is likely to find these things on the grass of a fairground.\n5: Option C: A movie theatre is different from a fairground. In a movie theatre, there are no games or attractions. All there is, is a movie and a movie-watching experience. So it's unlikely for cotton candy or popcorn to be present on the grass of a movie theatre.\n6: Option D: A country side is different from a countryside. A country side is a simple location filled with lots of trees, grass, buildings, and other various landscapes. On the other hand, a countryside is a place where people can go and visit, usually filled with lots of restaurants, shops, parks, and other attractions. So, it's unlikely for these attractions to be present at a country side.\n7. Option E: A state park is not a place where there are cotton candy and popcorn available on the grass itself.

When people wait, one of the common actions they engage in is engaging in leisure activities such as reading, entertainment, or talking with friends. \n3. This eliminates option A: \"read\" because when someone is waiting they are not \"reading.\"\n4. Another action people engage when they wait is boredom, hence option B: \"getting bored\" is incorrect.\n5. Likewise, option C: \"worrying\" is eliminated because when one awaits, worry is not typically something one would do during that wait.\n6. The options remaining are A: getting bored and B: reading books.\n7. Option A indicates that people are waiting for something but don't want to wait for that something, hence option A: \"get tired\". \n8. The only logical choice would be B: reading books. \n9.

The words 'keys,' 'find' and 'bedroom' are generally indicative of an activity taking place within a bedroom at night when people are trying to find their key or keys.\n4. However in the second part of the question, the text refers to a 'key,' which is singular, suggesting that the key is in a single location.\n5. So, the bedroom context is not relevant for the context of the singular key.\n6. This means we can eliminate option C: bathroom as it's not a logical location to look for a key.\n7.

Similarly, an apartment will involve people who live there (not random guests) but this will not imply the armchair will only be used by some of these residents.\n4. Finally, the study probably involves a small number of people (students at a university) but the context does not specify who is using the armchair.\n5.

Choices: 1: rain B: thunder C: sun D: thunder and rain E: rain and thunder F: the sun and the rain\nOutput: 1) We can eliminate options B, rain: thunder and rain are the cause of rain, not the delay and, thus, do not fit the question here.\n2. Option B, sun: sunlight is the cause of the thunder, so it does not cause the delay nor does it prevent it in any way.\n3. Option C, storm: storms produce thunder, lightning, and rain, all of which can cause and delay and would be unlikely to simultaneously cause and prevent it.\n4. Option D, rain and thunder: rain and thunder together would certainly cause and delay, but, like options B and C, they would not work in a preventing capacity.\n5. Option A, rain: while rain does delay and prevent a flight, rain itself is unlikely to cause a delay.\n6. That leaves option E, rain and thunder. The storm is raining and producing thunder, which causes and delays. However, since the storm is raining, it may prevent other storms from forming, which could then result in no rain or a delayed flight. \n7. Thus, rain and thunder can both cause and delay a flight. \n8. When it rains, it is delayed and can also prevent other storms from occurring. \n9. By", "answer": "D: study"}

Out of the choices provided, the skating rink makes the least sense given the parameters laid out. \n4. Thus, the options are narrowed down to using a humidifier, burn the house down, or do nothing. Burning down the house seems to be unnecessary, while doing nothing leaves the home dry. \n5. While adding water might seem to be an appropriate solution, it can be problematic, as humidity can be too high, and add too much moisture to the home. \n6.

This doesn't really make sense as a harpsichord is not an ensemble, but more of an instrument specifically. It doesn't really convey where they could be found either.\n    - C. Museum.

A concert hall is a venue that is primarily used for performing classical music, so it doesn't fit with non-classical instruments. Plus, it also fits in with the answer.\n    - E.

When people sing, they typically enjoy singing, so the best answer would be she has enjoyed singing, and would be a logical option that makes sense when examined closely.  \n8. So, option C makes the most sense: \"I enjoy singing so...\", and is the correct answer to the question of why she \"sings so much\".\nSo the final [answer](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://learn.golang.org/courses/appmakers/day1&sa=D&ust=1686953122829000&usg=AOvVaw2EuM3lP3hXH199OvxmfI6J) is C: enjoy singing\n\n## \uc774\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud53d\uc158 \ubb38\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\nInput: The boy's mother was sick and he couldn't help crying.

A: Briefcase, while commonly used to carry and protect valuables including pens, is not necessarily the most specific use when purchasing pens alone.

{"idx": 903, "text": "1st. The question deals with a beanbag, which is used in sofas and couches.\n2nd. It would make sense that the beanbag would reside on furniture, such as a sofa.\n3rd. The choices given provide options for what the beanbag should sit on.\n4th. A \"house\" is not a suitable object for a \"bean bag\". It's not a comfortable item to rest on, like a couch or sofa.\n5th. The \"den\" usually denotes a place where someone would rest, much like their bedroom. This description does not fit the situation, as the beanbag should be on furniture, not on a resting place.\n6th. The \"family room\" is sometimes considered a recreational area, where people would rest and watch television. Again, this doesn't fit the situation where the beanbag should be sitting on furniture, not a resting area.\n7th. The \"wood\" gives the impression of furniture made of a hard material, not ideal for bean bags.\n8th. The \"floor\" is on the same level as a bean bag, so this option would exclude other furniture like an armrest or sofa that should be sitting on the floor.\n9th. A bean bag sits on furniture, not the floor.\n10th.

{"idx": 916, "text": "1.\"Exercising\" is the act or process of physically working-out or undergoing some type of intense physical activity. This is a general definition that fits into many situations where someone is performing a physical activity to strengthen specific muscles or in order to improve their overall physical body condition.\n2. There are different levels of physical exercise, each with its own effects on the body (energy and strength) during and after performing that activity.\n3. If someone intends to exercise, the activity itself, as well as post-exertion events, will lead to different results, depending on level of intensity or amount of physical activity.\n4. Looking at the choices, some of them only relate to post-activity results, so those are not relevant.\n5. In other cases, the options are too specific in their descriptions of activity or event to be valid choices.\n6. For instance, if someone exercises to relax, that activity is not a leading result but rather a byproduct of the other effects of exercise.  \n7. However, if we look at the options in a broader context, we can eliminate these choices.\n8. 'Relaxation' and 'use energy' should be eliminated. 'Relaxation', after exercise, isn't a leading result that should occur automatically as a result of the exercise itself, it's a byproduct that indicates one is not stressed or has not exhausted themselves. But exercise itself can lead to stress and sometimes exhaustion, so it doesn't make sense as the result.\n8. If a person exercises to use energy, then they wouldn't be exercising to become stronger but rather to fulfill a different goal, like running for their commute to work or for running errands.\n9. The same logic can eliminate 'become stronger' as a choice since that result may occur in some people as a result of exercise but is not the standard.\n10 'Strength' can remain as an option even though being stronger following exercise activity is not necessarily a common result.\n11. Looking at what's left, we can eliminate B and D.\n12. B: 'Exhaustion' isn't the leading result of exercise, it's a possible aftereffect and so that's ruled out as an option.\n13.

{"idx": 919, "text": "1. One of the forbidden fruits that has been associated in different cultures and religions with knowledge, wisdom, or divine insight is the apple.\n2. This is because of a verse in the biblical book of Genesis that describes the garden of Eden as \"a land flowing with milk and honey\". \n3. A phrase that has become popular in American culture is \"the apple wouldn't fall far from the tree.\"\n4. This means that an apple, or any fruit from a similar tree, is likely to be just as edible, juicy, and good as the first apple.\n5. Although the forbidden fruit in the Genesis story is different from the apple, the tree is still called an apple tree. \n6. Given that the forbidden fruit is also called an apple, and an apple tree is associated with forbidden fruits in the American vernacular, it is likely that the apple tree was in the biblical story.\n7. As such, our options are: 'North Carolina,' 'Washington State,' 'Nil (empty),' 'The Great Outdoors,' and 'Eden.'\n8. These options are all plausible locations that one might find an apple tree.\n9. The question is asking specifically about something called an apple tree.\n10. As such, we can eliminate 'Nil (empty)' and 'Great Outdoors' as locations that don't contain anything called an apple tree.  \n11. We can also eliminate 'Washington State' and 'Washington D.C.' because 'Washington' is a name and not a location. Names of things and people do not imply a location.  \n12. This leaves us with just two options: 'North Carolina' and 'Eden.'  \n13. Given that the question is focused on finding something called an apple tree, we are likely to refer to something in the Bible to complete the answer.\n14. In that case, we refer to the story of Abraham and his wife Sarah. It is implied that she, in this story, is in North Carolina, but God is in Eden.\n15. Therefore, one might reasonably answer \"North Carolina,\" since in North Carolina, there is a man (Abraham) that God spoke to.\n16. However, North Carolina is also the name of a state", "answer": "E: garden of eden"}

We have to answer where she is going, and the options in the question are: on a trip, off a trip, on to destination, off to destination, and for a visit.\n3. The 'on' in option A is an adjective meaning 'toward,' not an infinitive verb 'to go.' If we take it to be an infinitive, then 'going' would be needed, which is already included in the sentence we are trying to complete, hence it doesn't get us anywhere. Also, 'on' is used for 'toward' and not for 'to,' as is required here. Hence, A can be eliminated.\n4 On to destination means going from one place to another place, which is similar to the sentence we have to complete. Hence, while not similar in context, we can keep it in mind.\n5 Off to destination means going from a place to another place. Again, this is what we need for the missing word.

Choices:  C: kisses E: goodnight kiss F: coffee A: dance B: money D: dinner\nOutput: 1: From the 1930s to 1950s, it was common for a man and a woman to go out on a series of dates before taking their relationship to the next level. These dates often involved getting dressed up and going to a formal setting like a restaurant or a dance club.\n2. From the given choices, a kiss would not end a date, as it is something that often occurs at the end of the date, not the beginning.\n3. In similar situations the person to leave most likely would have to do it in-person, which wouldn't come before the end of the date.\nIt can also be that person to whom has to leave first would have to pay the bill\n4. Similarly, a goodnight kiss is not an activity that would likely end the date either.

(or \"freezer\" or \"refrigerator\") The structure of this sentence implies that a 'broken' icebox could either be given away or put \"away\" (either tossed or kept) in a certain location.\n2. Let us eliminate D, as the question would be asking for the location to put a broken icebox, not the location to put away a broken icebox.\n3. The term antique suggests that there is history of the icebox, and thus an element of sentimental attachment/emotion may come into play when disposing of it. It may be better to give it away to another individual who can appreciate it for its history. In this case, antique stores are an option because this type of store typically accommodate objects that have history and which people may be interested in.\n4. Looking at the other options, we can determine that C, icebox, D, junk yard and B antique, are not relevant and do not make sense in the context of icebox. \n5. Looking at the remaining choices, we can determine that E, kitchen is a place where iceboxes (a type of \"refrigerator\" or \"cold box\") are often located. It makes sense that a cold box with history would either be gifted to another person, or put away in a kitchen with a sentimental value.\n6.

'Supermarket' could be where eggs are sold, but it is not a container nor is it a logical next step of the eggs after they have been bought in a store.\n9) 'Chicken coop' describes the chickens, but not eggs, and is not a suitable answer.\n10) Therefore, the final answer is E \u2013 Egg Carton.\nSo the final answers are Egg Carton", "answer": "D: egg carton"}

We can reject keep track of expenses because there are several other books that could keep track of expenses if you need to. 5. Since the bank is not the first choice, let's look at the desk drawer. 6. Desk drawers and account books typically go together since the latter is often kept safely while in use, either in a desk or a drawer. 7. We can reject a purse because it is not the most logical option, as other items typically are stored in purses and accounting books are not typically considered purses. 8.

One of the key processes is to petrify, which is the hardening or transformation of an organic substance into carbonate or stone. \n4. During this process, the wood in the question most likely became fossilized, which implies that it has hardened substantially. Because it became fossilized, it could be classified as petrified, by which the word is defined.\n5. The options in the question are used by paleontologists to describe or analyze the specimen, not necessarily categorize it. \n6. Therefore, we can disregard options A, B, and D as they are not logical to describe the fossilized wood or 'petrified.'\n7. Option C 'warp,' implies a significant change in the physical structure of the wood, but nothing like that is required to describe a piece of wood that has been petrified. \n8.

The remaining choices seem somewhat feasible, but there might be something even more straightforward: B: tears. It's a pretty direct statement, implying that the boy's eyes watered because the boy ran so hard his tears formed.\n3.)

To solve this one, there are two ways to approach it. First, we can ask how a dog would be lost, then ask where this would take place. \n3. \"How is a dog lost?\u201d The dog might have slipped from its owner\u2019s hands, run away on its own, or have escaped from another home, farm, or place.

Choices: 1: When she was in grade school 2: When she was a teenager 3: When she was a baby 4: When she was in her twenties 5: When she was in high school\nOutput: Option 1 is when a person is in grade school, not when they were a teacher. Option 2 is not a time that one would typically need to be respected, and it's unlikely an individual would choose those two options together. Option 4 is when the teacher was in her twentys.

{"idx": 973, "text": "1.'Reception' can be defined as a party or gathering that is usually hosted by some authority figure, or is organized to celebrate some achievement or honor the host.\n2. When a reception is occurring, it's important to have enough space and capacity to hold all of the attendees comfortably. If not, there may be issues with congestion or limited access to food, drinks, or entertainment.\n3. Looking over the choices: A: Grand Casino. While a grand casino is large, it's primarily used for games of chance or casual entertainment. It may not be an appropriate venue for a reception intended to honor attendees.\n4. B: Large room. Though a large room is sufficient for a reception, there are other factors to consider such as table seating and food service area size. Ultimately, a large room may not be the best fit for a reception event.\n5. C: restaurant. Restaurants are typically associated with food and dining, which could limit the overall feel of the reception to just a meal. It's likely best not to hold a reception at a restaurant.\n6. D: country club. The country club is a luxury recreation retreat with numerous amenities such as golf and swimming. While it could be a potential venue for a reception, it may not be the most cost-effective or practical choice.\n7. E: lobby. The lobby is the entrance area in a building or hotel where guests can check-in or access the various amenities. A reception is usually a standing event, whereas a lobby is typically a place to stand temporarily.\n8. Based on the other criteria in the question, it seems that a large and cost-effective venue is the most desirable option. This ultimately leads to the answer E: Lobby, as it is located in a building and has all the necessary space for a reception event. \n9. There are a number of criteria to take into account when choosing an appropriate venue for an event. Some to consider include; size, cost, accessibility, and amenities.  In the example question 2, the most appropriate answer for a reception appears to be E Lobby.\nSo the final question is \"If I have a reception at a large luxury resort with many attendees, where", "answer": "B: large room"}
{"idx": 974, "text": "1: The question asked to identify what one should do if one's pens aren't working, where the answer to this would include what one should do to make them work.\n2. The question does not specify what type of pens are not working, but the term is in itself very vague.\n3. There are several things that could go wrong with pens, all of which might be addressed in different ways.\n4. Looking at the options that are given, there are a number of possibilities: ink, caps, ink cartridges, take notes, and scribble.\n5. Option A: ink in is probably the least likely as the phrase in itself, \"You should ink in your pens,\" doesn't really indicate what one should or shouldn't be doing, but what one is doing.\n6. It is an inaccurate way of saying someone should \"re-ink\" or add more ink to the pens.\n7. Option B: caps are unlikely as the question does not make it clear caps are missing, but rather the pens are not working.\n8. Option C: ink cartridge would be possible if what is broken is the ink cartridges themselves, but that's not made clear by the question so is somewhat unnecessary at present.\n9. Option D: take notes doesn't seem to fit the context.\n10. Option E: scribble makes perfect sense as scribbling on paper can be a potential solution to a write-on, type-of-pen problem, but would not do anything to a click-type, typewriter situation.\n11. It can be observed that all of the options, besides Option E, address the wrong type of pens.\n12. Option E refers to taking notes which might, in some instances, be a solution to a write-only, type of pen issue.\n13. The answer appears to be E: scribble.

Choices: A: books B: clothing C: furniture D: pictures E: lighting\nOutput: 1.'Relax' is the feeling the question seeks to associate with a place.\n2. In order to achieve relaxation, one has to remove their focus from the stressors in their life.\n3. When a person is relaxing, they typically aren't thinking about work, bills, or their own problems but rather enjoying the moment and taking some time for themselves.\n4. So, the color of the books, clothing, furniture may all indicate the person's relaxation.\n5. Let's see if any of these options are the logical choice.\n6. Books: Books aren't really a place where a person would \"relax\" to be honest. \n7. Clothing: Again, isn't a place where most likely a person would like to relax.\n8. Furniture: Definitely can't find a relaxing spot in a place where all the furniture is.\n9. Pictures: One can definitely relax in an environment where they find pictures they love hanging on the walls.\n10. Lighting can definitely influence the feel of a place. However, it cannot be the definitive factor since even dim lighting could serve the purpose.\n11. So the most logical answer is E: Lighting.\nSo the final question is E: Lighting", "answer": "B: better job"}

Therefore,'seeing' or'seeing beautiful clouds' would be an expected result from the action of 'looking at clouds'.\n3) The question suggests that the reason there is a negative outcome for the situation is due to the clouds being beautiful.\n4) If clouds were not beautiful, it's likely that they would not be beautiful to look at or there would be no reason to look at them.\n5) Consequently, the outcome is a negative outcome, which makes sense if beautiful clouds are not being looked at.\n6) Out of the given options, B is the most appropriate answer because other options like dry (E) would also apply, but not necessarily be associated with looking at clouds, as it'd likely be an aftermath of not doing anything.\n7) The answer is A: plain.\nSo the final answers is A: plain\n\nInput: In the middle of the night I heard a noise, I was scared of the _________\nChoices:  A: intruder B: burglar C: alarm D: cat E: noise\nOutput: a) We can see that all the options can fit the situation.\nb) The question is looking for a word that is related in some way to the noise, however the definition of each option varies, making it difficult to choose the most relevant.\nc) The option E: noise, can be discarded as it is an unnecessary filler word that is unrelated.\nd) The word intruder, is a specific type of person, not usually associated with noises.\ne) The word burglar is also specifically a person, which does not fit the example of the sound.\nf) The word cat is also a specific animal, which would not fit the action of a person.\ng) The word alarm is a noun, which is not needed in the word choice.\nh) The word burglar, however, can be a noun or a verb, making it more flexible than other options, and still being more closely aligned with noise.\ni) To decide based on the context of the sentence, we see that it is looking for a single word that fits the example, and not specifically", "answer": "E: wet"}

Choices:  B: screaming C: eating D: moving fast E: fighting\nOutput: 1.\"The group of cranes\" - \"cranes\" refers to more than one cranes, in this case, a large group.\n2. \"took flight\" - \"flew\" is an action and \"took\" means \"took to action\" or \"took with care\", which means the group of cranes was flying.\n3. \"when the hawk fle by\" - \"to flew by\" means that the object in the sentence (in this case, the hawk) is moving from its original position (not staying still and not flying by) to another position, causing the action for the two objects. The moving of the object is the \"by\" part.\n4. \"were caused to do\" means the object that took the action (in this case, \"took flight\") was caused.\n5. The cranes are not fighting, which eliminates 'fighting'.\n6. The cranes do not have to be eating just because the hawk fleeing caused them to fly, which eliminates \"eating\".\n7.

{"idx": 990, "text": "1) The words in the given question, \"something that you do in a bank,\" suggests that the answer choice options presented might involve the idea of \"doing\" something.\n2) These options include things that you might \"do\" in a bank, like: \"making noise,\" \"having tea,\" \"making payments,\" \"making time,\" and \"taking time.\"\n3) The first two options are activities that might involve the \"action\" of making some sort of sound, but they might not be the best choice, because the word \"sound\" is not in that phrase.\n4) The choices that are left are \"making payments\" and \"taking time\" since those words are listed as options in that phrase.\n5) So, the most rational answer to the given question is \"making payments\" since \"making time\" can mean different things, and one of them is \"taking time,\" which we have just established isn't listed in the original question. So, with this knowledge, that would leave us with \"making payments.\"\nSo the final answer to the given question would be A: make payments\n\nInput: What might a boy do if he had a skirt on?

If a boy had a skirt on, it is unlikely that he would wear them.\n2.) That leaves us with a choice of: IA; IB; C; EF; G; and H.\n3.) Of those, we can eliminate IA and IB since only a girl would likely wear a skirt.\n4.) That leaves C; EF; and H.\n5.) This is because the question uses the phrase: if he had a _____ on.\n6.) The options that are left: C; EF; and the H are all forms of completing work.\n7.)

Let's examine the options again:\n5. Milk-solid substances may be stored in a'show stall' or 'biology laboratory' but they aren't commonly grown in these types of places.\n6. A cheese block may be stored in a biology laboratory, but then it wouldn't be'made from milk' - so we can eliminate C:'show stall.'\n7. Milk is commonly associated with food, and thus not much is produced in a 'biology laboratory,' so we can eliminate D: 'biology laboratory'.\n8. A fungal infection is more likely to occur on something that has been exposed to moisture or is wet, or has rotting meat, rather than an old piece of cheese; cheese usually ages well. So the answer must be either A: 'eyes,' or B: 'old cheese' rather than C:'show staller.'\n9. The choice that makes most sense in terms of the environment which is most moist or wet, and which is generally kept at room temperature is A: 'eyes': Eyes and nose have moist, warm and wet environments where microbes can easily thrive and grow.\n10.

Option A, \"pet shops,\" would refer to the location where the snake is likely to be sold or kept enclosed. \n4. Option B, \"New Mexico,\" could be the location where the snake came from because snakes can be found all over the world. \n5. Option C, the \"White House,\" might be a part of the location that attracts snakes (e.g. an untamed garden, a sun-warmed balcony etc.). \n6. Option D, the \"Arctic,\" is likely not the snake's ideal home climate or preference.  The Arctic has extreme winter conditions rather than warm, sunny weather.\n7.

The choices available are A) Cupboard, B) Anywhere else, C) Everything, D) Own home, E) Garbage dump.\n5. Choices B) Anywhere else and D) Own Home are clearly incorrect. B) is out of the picture because he is already in the kitchen (c). D) is out of the question because he is not in his own home. He simply wanted to be anywhere else than in the kitchen, and his kitchen is certainly his own home.\n6. Choices C) Everything is somewhat unlikely but this could still be the most possible choice because he could want to be anywhere else but in his own home, for example walking, eating or studying or reading in a library. Choice A) Cupboard is also out of the game, because if he wanted to be anywhere but the kitchen, he would not open the cupboard.\n7. The most probable and reasonable choice here is E) Garbage Dump, and this would be John's reaction because he was not in his own kitchen and he was not even in his home.

The question does not suggest that \u2018cake\u2019 is the right answer, so we can eliminate \u2018eat cake\u2019 and \u2018buy\u2019.\n4. The statement \u201cWhen you go to examine a thing\u2026\u201d does not suggest that she might be interested in whatever she finds, so we can eliminate interest.\n5. We can also eliminate \u2018complex\u2019, since \u2018complex\u2019 suggests that there might be something more than what is suggested by the question, and the question does not have that element to it.\n6. So the statement \u201cWhen you go on to examine a thing\u2026\u201d, and the question, in general, suggest she\u2019s likely looking into and thinking of what to do with whatever she finds, so \u2018learning about\u2019 best fits the context.\n7.

The only reason they would be in a crowd is if it's a small one.\n3: Annoying people are more interested in one-on-one conversations, like when someone is talking to them.\n4: Attentive people are always listening to what others say and engaging in the conversation.\n5: Annoying people aren't really communicating in a meaning way to each other either.\n6: Talkative and Attentive people are people that tend to \"do the talking\" (talkative) and", "answer": "B: buy"}

{"idx": 996, "text": "1.\"The man set the cup\" (verb) implies that he took an action, but the object the action was performed on is not referred to in the question.\n2.\"The cup on the table\" (noun) refers to the cup that was set and it indicates the location of the cup after the \"cup\" has already been set on the table.\n3.\"It didn't matter.\" (adverb) indicates that an action or decision was made that had no relevance in the specific context.\n4. The action that is said to have no relevance is \"heaving anything to put it on\", and this action is meant to reference an action performed in order to counteract the lack of something. \n5. The \"matter\" indicates something was done because something was missing, but the question describes that the cup was set on the table regardless of the missing object or material.\n6. As a result, the action of heaving something wasn't necessary or relevant.\n7. The question states that the man \"lacked the what to balance\" the cup. The lack of something indicates that the man is missing something (to counteract) and that the missing item is described by the verb \"balance\". \n8. Based on these clues, the possible missing item is the item in question, the cup, or the desk, the location on which the cup is set.\n9. The \"to balance\" is referring to counteracting the lack or absence of an object. \n10. Since cup on the table, doesn't make sense, the context or situation suggested the \"cup\" would be missing or the cup could be on another surface, likely the desk or the counter. \n11. Therefore, the action of \"heaving something\" or \"heave\" must be related to putting the cup back on the surface on which it is supposed to be, and the appropriate verb is the action of \"put\" or \"putting\".  \n12. Thus, the correct answer is C: cup.\nSo the final answers is C: cup\n\nInput:The old woman, who was not a member of the church, wanted to see a holy painting that it was her what.

Thus, the fun is likely to be provided at bars, but not other options because they are not necessarily specific places to have fun. Moreover, the TV is a non-essential feature because if one does not like TV, they likely do not watch it in the first place.

In the given word context, 'health club' refers to a facility that provides programs and services geared towards enhancing health and wellbeing.\n3. 'Jocks' is a term used to describe a person who participates in sports, often used in a derogatory manner to refer to males who focus on sports at the exclusion of other activities.\n4. 'Fitness centre', most broadly, refers to a building where people train and work out, as opposed to going to a locker room.\n5. 'Stadium', typically, refers to a facility where sporting events occur, such as football or basketball games.\n6. 'Gymnasium', essentially means 'physical education'. In this sense, it is used to describe places where children or people in general go to exercise.\n7. When you take in what these words refer to, it might be evident that the options are misleading.\n8. The first option 'health clubs' is inappropriate because it doesn't match the context.\n9. The second, 'jocks', would also be incorrect because it refers to sports-related people while the question asks about drinking a green drink.\n10. The third, 'fitness centres', seems to refer to similar places as a 'gymnasium' because it usually involves the use of a gym as a physical activity training environment. However, this option does not refer to a place where people drink, so it is a weak contender.\n11. The fourth,'stadiums', is possibly one of the most out-of-place options because, in context, the text mentions a health club as opposed to a facility for sporting activities.\n12. The final option 'gymnasiums' would be the most fitting because it can accurately describe a physical exercise and training environment as well as drinking locations.\nSo the final option is a 'gymnasium'.\n\nInput: Where does a man usually put a pen if he is going to use it later?

Then write a one-page essay in response to the questions:<n><n>Do you agree with the statements that follow? Why or why not? What are your thoughts about the world where you find yourselves?<n>(1) _No_ is a perfectly good answer: It's fine if you tell yourself NO when that's exactly what you want. Saying yes to the wrong answer can be a big mistake. It means accepting some situation that you're not comfortable with, that doesn't suit you, that's out of step with what you actually need.<n>(2) _Do what works_. Your goal could be a job, friendship, money, or love; you know the right thing to do when it's obvious to you. Your intuition is the best guide to help you make good choices.<n>(3) _Do what scares you_. Take action on your fears. Don't be a coward. Get out of your own way. If you want something, why not go for it?<n>(4) _Do what feels right_: Your body and your heart will tell you what's right. Sometimes you have to slow down and give yourself plenty of time

Where will you start?<n><n>### Instruction:<n><n>Answer the following multiple choice questions (MCQs) on the basis of the text, not the passage. 1. What is the title of the passage?  A. The Future of the English Language B. The Future of the American Language C. The Future of the Chinese Language D. The Future of the All Languages  Answer:D Explanation:  There are multiple languages available in this world. Every single person in this world has his own language. Some use their mother tongue, some their first foreign language. English is a global language. Many people use English to communicate with each others. It is not going to replace the other languages because English as a global language is going to be strong in the future. We can say that the future of the english language is prosperous. 2. If the English is a global language, why would anyone learn a foreign language?<n><n>A. To learn the language that is native to the country he or she wants to travel to <n><n>    B. To be a global citizen <n><n>    C. To be cultured <n><n>    D. For business or trade <n><n>    Answer: B<n><n>Explanation: We live in an urbanized world where the knowledge has no boundaries and no distance. There is no need to learn a foreign language if he or she does not have to travel to a country. Moreover there will no any need to use the foreign language if there is no one to communicate in that language. Even though it is very important to understand the cultural aspect in the country, it is not necessary to learn the native language of that country. We can say that we need to master the foreign language to be a global citizen. 3) Who is the author of the article? <n><n>A. James Olsen<n><n>    B. Danny Zhang<n><n>    C. Tom Smith<n><n>    D.

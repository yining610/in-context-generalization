Choices:  A: military base B: opera C: water fountain D: bus stop E: church<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>#### A<n>- **Perfunctory**, [adj](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/perfunctory) is used to describe something like this. It is a "routine" or "form of behavior that is performed without due care, attention, or feeling".<n><n>Therefore, the correct answer should be D.<n><n>#### B<n>- Jumping jacks are performed in the [military base](https://www.google.com/search?q=military+base&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS854US854&oq=military&aqs=chrome..69i57j35i39j0l4j69i60j0i22i30l2.1523j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), it is one common type of exercise among military personnel, so it is more correct to describe it as a military-based routine.<n><n>Based on this context, the correct answer can be A.<n><n>#### C<n>- Jumping Jack, or Jumping Jacks, is a cardio-weight exercise that has been around for centuries. It can be performed in opera, but it is more common to perform in military, since people rarely perform these in the opera.<n><n>Therefore, we cannot describe it as "it can be performed in opera".<n><n>Hence, D is correct according to this.<n><n>#### D<n>- Jumping jack is a [cardio exercise](https://www.healthline.com/health/cardio-vs-weightlifting).<n><n>However, it does not perform any specific form of expression, or anything that can be used as an "idea creator". Therefore, the answer should be C.<n><n>#### E<n>- This is an old type of dance from the [Greece era](https://www.britannica.com/topic/dance-in-ancient-Greece). And it is still done there till today. These are still performed within churches, but not in a church stop. They are normally done in the church.<n><n>Hence, the incorrect answer should be E.<n>

Choices:  A: trouser leg B: sick bay C: own home D: petting zoo E: mother's hair<n><n>### Response:		<n>The correct choice is "B: sick bay" and "E: mother's hair".<n><n>### Rationale:<n>An example is given where, "he missed the real cause of the person's death". This shows a perfunctory<n>inspection of the remains. However, if he had been a "thorough" and "thoughtful" person, he would have inspected<n>extremely thoroughly. So, "thorough" was the correct choice.<n><n>An analogy (a "what if") is presented where, "you would find a lot of ferrets in some person's trouser leg." This<n>means that it is more likely that a ferret would be in a trouser leg than in the sick bay, petting zoo, mother's<n>hair or own home. So, "trouser leg" is excluded. An instance of the analogy is also presented where<n><n>"you would find a lot (usually the majority) of children in mother's hair", which is more likely than "the sick bay"<n>because "mother's hair" is where children are more likely to be.<n><n>As well,<n>

Choices:  A: actions B: legal C: authentic D: logical E: legitimate<n><n>### Response:		The wording of the question is unclear, the phrase "handbags" are used and handbags are not in the domain of this question, the words "legitimate" could mean "not made by a company or person who is licensed to make them", but that is not the meaning of "legitimate" in this question, neither is it about what company/person made the handbag. "A" cannot be the answer because if the handbag is made by a person not legally allowed to make it, it is not an "illegitimate handbag". To summarize: "legitimate" here means "legal". The "certificate of authentication" means that the item is a legitimate handbag of the company or person that the certificate is "legalized". The item must be examined by a law enforcement agency to verify that the certificate is authenticated.

If I am not careful, I am likely to write a good report, that gets everyone in the reception in a great mood.<n><n>I would be careful not to use the restaurant, as if I’m not careful, I am possibly going to miss some good

Even in a full immersion environment you're likely to make mistakes, mistakes will cause misinterpretation, which will be uncomfortable, which will cause what?, Choices:  A: better communication B: overthinking C: frustration D: misunderstandings E: headaches<n><n>### Response:		<n>We can all agree that all human beings have one common thing in common: the ability to think and act. No matter who is involved, communication happens when people meet with one another to discuss something on common interests. Of course communication can be difficult to understand if a person doesn't have the right skill or doesn't put proper effort into the effort. To explain, in the English class we have, there are students whose performance is pretty good and bad. When we have a class discussion it can be pretty hard to understand if one student asks question in German since the others haven't learned it, especially in a short conversation. Besides, we don't want to hurt their feeling since we're good people..<n><n>### Input<n>Learning languages is different.  Even in a fully immersive environment, you are likely to make mistakes, and mistakes will cause misinterpreting, which will cause discomfort, and which will cause what? Choices:A: better communication B: Overthinking C: friction D: misunderstanding E: a headache<n><n>### Answer<n>Of course learning languages can be hard. The reason why it's hard is the way we learn things from a young age. All human beings have one main thing in common: the possibility of thinking and acting. No matter who's involved, communication happens through meetings of people with common interests. Of course, if people are not good at communicating effectively because they didn't put their effort into using these skills, they will be difficult to learn languages. Learning different languages requires a person to have a good and right way of being taught.<n><n>### Input Learning languages is different.  You are likely to make mistakes even in a fully immersed environment, mistakes will cause miscommunications, mistakes will cause what?  Choices: A: better communication B Overthinking C: discomfort D: understanding E: headaches<n>### Answer:<n>Learning languages can be pretty scary.  It's because you have to learn a language that you don't completely understand. When you are not able to figure out what is being said or explain things in a way that you understand you might get nervous and might not want to explain it or just simply learn it. This may cause misunderstanding with a person who can't help with helping you learn. Of course you won't enjoy that, so you might not want to

Many people want to hear experts' answers in person, where they can see and discuss ideas, and be part of the process of finding answers to the important problems that will be around long after the COVID-19 crisis is finished. The main advantage of an in-person discussion is the opportunity for people to see each other face to face and to ask questions.<n><n>### Input<n>What do you think of this kind of online school?

It is extremely hard to be attentive and give your utmost effort for the whole period when you are online and in distants learning.  Therefore, it is good to be given assignments via email, because that will help you be more focused and be organized. For me the problem with distants learning is distractions. For example, I do have a pet rabbit that likes to sit on your papers and play, and I always say "No!" and move her away, so this is what she always does to your work and distracts you from giving your 100% efforts.<n><n>### Conclusion<n>

Choices:  A: classroom B: synagogue C: bathroom D: front porch E: grocery store<n><n>### Response:		The answer to the question depends on the time of day. If your morning paper gets delivered when it's light out, it is dropped off at your front porch. If you leave for school at a specific time, before leaving your home, you leave the newspaper on the dining room table so that your dad can read it during breakfast. If he misses breakfast, he will find the paper in his briefcase. However, if you leave for school at any other time and you have a newspaper delivered before you wake up so it's left on the dining room side, your mom will be your carrier.  Your brother leaves notes on your door or you'll find them on your bed.  But, if it's raining, or snowing, or freezing cold outside, your dad has to walk over the sidewalk to the front of the house and bring the paper into the house.<n><n>### Description of task:<n>The response should be a single paragraph (6-7 sentences) that explains the answer to the instruction.<n>

Choices:  A: michigan B: stable C: race track D: farm yard E: arizona<n><n>### Response:		<n>This is a good example of the use of the 4-year-olds rule, i.e. "If they would have needed to explain it for a 4-year-old, then we need a better explanation" when trying to understand the intended meaning of a question.<n><n>The question: "Where is a horse likely live?" is asking what location would most likely house a horse since the question specifically indicates that the horse "live." This, if it was in written format would be considered a grammatically incorrect question since it fails to include the "where" and "live" elements properly. "Where does a horse live?" would be appropriate. However, in this example, the text does not suggest that it is asking a question or has incorrect wording. However, it is an instruction to write a response. In addition, we're not given an indication that there is a rule requiring a 4-year old response. So, we know that if we do this type of thing in a response, we are going to need a better explanation. But why? It's because the intended wording of the question is: "The place where a horse most likely to live."<n><n>This then leads to other questions regarding the intent. Why is the text asking for a "response" and not a question or just another instruction? Is the text expecting a response or is the intent to be an example of something that is not written in a proper form? Is the intent to test the ability to understand an instruction in this format? And if so, what is the correct format? The text indicates, if the intent is to determine if we are able to express our thought process using only written commands then what's the instruction to answer in a correct format?<n><n>### Inputs:<n>This question contains two paragraphs and each paragraph contains 2 to 3 sentences (some sentences are one or two words).

We know that it means to express ideas since that's what the text states. And that the intended purpose is to express our thoughts so this should be answered through our expression.

The choices given in the instructions are to aid in your decision but are not the only choices. <n>Example: <n>*D: Business Sector* <n>The wording indicates that it's talking about a place where people in business go and hang out.  It might be the best place to conduct business, as in a hotel or restaurant, but it's not a business sector and the wording indicates that too, as it says it's a likely location as opposed to a required one.<n> <n>Example:<n>*A: Town*<n>The only place I think this could make sense is the town's square. That seems to fit this best from what's in the question.<n><n>## Hint:<n>You can click on the question and the choices as well to see the answer choices better and the correct one as well. You will also get more feedback if you click on your answer choices.<n><n>## The "Deliberate Practice" method<n>One of the most reliable things I've found which works for this type of thing, is to try to think of 3-5 other options that were less likely in the situation. I'm not saying use the first 3-5 you come to mind, but trying to think of an alternative to the choice listed in the question can help you to see a more well-thought out answer than if you just answer with the only choice in the question. <n>

Choices:  A: new york B: concert C: tv studio D: gig E: recording studio<n><n>### Response:		<n>You'd have to be pretty close to the stage at a concert.

Not to sound like I am being snotty, but I don't care that they are singing at stage left versus stage right because I wouldn't care in any situation what side they are on.<n><n>Another thing is that I would have put a concert in that question, not tv studio because a concert could literally be one of several things, whereas a tv studio question is more precise.

I wouldn't count a concert as a stock market event, because one might have to know something about stocks to consider it being a stock market event. I could consider it, as in maybe the band plays the same song every time they play the same concert, but i don't really consider that as a stock market event because I don't really consider the song being the same every time a concert, if that makes scense. I'm not trying to be a smart guy...

By doing course projects to better help people in the real world, students can become creative writers with experience. The student who has a blog for their course project can easily have their blog post read by an English class and get feedback on their creativity.

Choices:  A: residential neighborhood B: community C: building D: prague E: every city<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>- John was complete in his examination.<n>- To be creative, one need not be a great artist or writer.<n>- Schools are rarely built in empty fields but are usually located in urban centers.<n>- Many of the greatest writers and artists were only "tinkerers" who only tried writing or art at the last minute in an attempt to find a way to make their lives meaningful.<n>- Schools in the US are often built in areas which, from the first glance, one can say are residential, community, and commercial zones.<n><n>### Sample outputs:<n><n>- John wasn't thorough in his examination. It's because he only gave a perfunctoral examination.<n>- I thought I have no creativity. I can paint and draw, and I can make jewelry. Why is it that I'm not artistic or creative? Why I can't draw a tree? Even I can't draw something as simple as tree.<n>- It is best to locate a school in a residential area. The reason lies on the fact that residents of the area would more likely encourage the school.<n>- I am no artist or writer. All I have is talent. Though this is my talent.<n>- Schools often get built in residential areas. It allows the students to have short walks to and from school. Not to mention, parents are more likely to look at the school as a blessing especially if it was build near their homes.<n>- A teacher, I hope you can pass my grade with flying colors. But please don't have any creativity to add on my grades.<n>- You have an artistic creativity within you. That may not seem evident as much as other things since it is not obvious, but you possess other creative skills.<n>- School should be built in community or residential area. By doing that, student from that area are more likely to show more support to the school they have been attending.<n>

Science shows that it is partially hereditary, which means we take some of our inherited characteristics from our parents, who take half from each of their parent, and so on, which means that we inherit half of our "creative spirit."<n><n>### Input<n>In the 1950's and 60's art programs were taken out of schools.

I agree that some people should be allowed to focus on the arts, and become artists to share their beauty.<n><n>### Input <n>You are so correct to insist that those with no interest in art, be allowed, even encouraged to follow their interest, instead of being forced into art classes, and suffering by attentiveness.<n><n>### End Of Task<n><n>### Example 1:I agree with your ideas, your articulation of your opinions is impecible. <n><n>### Example2:You seem to have no creative ability at all, as well as no intelligence either, to realize how ridiculous your last two sentences sound.<n><n>### Example3:I agree with your idea, though I believe you haven't quite explained your idea properly, as you have stated it without detail, which I believe you could do better with. <n>

On one side, I had to make a response for the output, which was different then I have ever had to do. It was easy to get lost of track of what the instructions were because a lot of things were included with the two parts. I wish there would have been more clarification into the glossary so I knew which word to use to say what. However, I do not blame the maker because the challenge is just meant to be a challenge, not make easy.<n><n>## Revision<n><n>I believe that the instruction given for the challenge was clear to some, but not all. I also think it was not clear that the output would be about the word that was given, instead of what the entire sentence meant. I wish it was more specific as to what word we were suppose to use for the "work" it was talking about. I believe I should have used a different word in my demonstration.<n>

Choices:  A: satisfaction B: good feelings C: complications D: feel good about yourself E: stress<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>We've been working with questions recently where the input has been a title that requires a response to be appropriate under the title.  It's been going very well and it's one of the main things we're working on at the moment and has been the case for the entire session.  If we try and write a question where the input is a sentence, that has a title, I think it's a little bit of a stretch.  It's not completely impossible and, perhaps, it can be done.  I don't think there's anything wrong with an attempt, per se; however, trying to build a response to a question that looks a bit more like the first instruction seems a little bit of a better option.<n><n><n>It can't be that hard to write a response to a question where the input isn't even a title but a sentence.  The instructions describe something and there's a question that follows.  There are options and those options are all answers that follow the question.  It's a fairly easy, straightforward thing to write a response.  The only thing that's required is that the response be appropriate.  It needs to be appropriate to the question, appropriate to the instruction, appropriate to the context of a conversation that we're attempting to build in here with an automated system.<n><n>An appropriate response to this instruction is going to require that the response is "thorough".  The only really problematic choice is the one that describes a response as "intricate".  "Intricate" is not a word that we've used since we established that we were working with vocabulary.  Anybody can look up any dictionary and see as much.  Now we have dictionaries. <n><n>We've looked up a bunch and all of them say the same thing.  It's too bad that an automated system doesn't always work the way we need it to.  All you can do really, is establish what you need and not much more.
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Answer: D: thorough<n><n>Input: Everybody has some sort of creativity, it's the best way to what? Choices:  A: create art B: write C: sew D: create idea E: express yourself<n>Answer: E: express yourself<n><n>### Input:What is something you do  in a bank? Choices:  A: make noise B: have tea C: make time D: make payments E: take time<n><n>### Response:		<n>Make payments<n><n><n>### Input :What are you going to do today?<n><n><n>Choices:  A: go to work on time  B: work on time C: go home early today D: take a nap <n><n>### Response :<n>B and D<n><n>This is an example of a task instruction.  You might not complete the sentence that is instructing you.  A common pattern is to complete the sentence with "Choose either X or Y, X or Y, or X, Y and Z" or some other phrase.  If you are stuck, think carefully about the first "choice" first.  The second "choice" second, third, fourth, etc. are likely to be synonyms.  So don't get frustrated.<n><n>There is good reason for using "choose one".  The first choice narrows the list of acceptable options. The second and third choice are synonyms.  Sometimes people use just one word.  But when they do be aware that there is more than one way to interpret that first word.  So, the choice instruction should tell you what to choose to avoid error.  What is an acceptable choice should be explained and the expected results be given.  A good example would be: <n><n>**Choose one**:  [a] I will [b] I am going to [c] The train is coming <n><n>[a] is an acceptable answer  but is not the question.  [b] and [c] are acceptable answers but indicate that the first element of the task was not completed (The train is coming). <n><n>Choose one is not always the best way to instruct an answer.  This instruction can be overly limiting because choices  are not always the same.  Another good choice might be:<n><n>**Write an answer**   **that is either [a] this or [b] the other** <n><n>[b] is often not the same as, [a].<n>As a final check, the responses can also be used to check if an appropriate response was given.  Be careful with these though, you might accidentally find out the right answer.<n><n>### Test:<n><n>**Choose two**: [a] [b]<n><n>**Write an explanation** that explains how and why you came to the conclusion you did.  Also tell who or what made this choice easier

Choices:  A: top of home B: older houses C: victorian house D: own home E: material<n><n>### Response:		A <n><n># 30 Day Meditation Challenge Day 29<n>Day 29: You will not be a victim; it's been your choice all along. You've chosen your mindset and you've chosen what you expect. Now, you just have to stop telling yourself you are a victim and start telling yourself you are the victor in your own life. You have always had a choice and you have chosen not to be great, but you can choose again; and you will once you wake up and begin to think about positive choices you can make.<n><n>### Challenge:<n>You will not be a victim, you are the victor. Be mindful and focus on only the positive outcomes in your life. Work towards being victorious; then tell the people around you that you are, that is if you want to. Otherwise, don't say anything.<n><n>### What does this mean?<n><n>Do not go through life thinking you are a victim of the situation at hand; and to the person who may be saying that they are, do not believe them; help the person realize that they are the victor in their own life. This is the one place where you are in charge, you can help the person. You cannot do this for everyone around you, but you will be able to impact the person who says they are a victim.<n><n>### My Takeaway:<n>If we really want to be successful in life, then the first lesson to follow should be to realize we are the victor. When we've given someone a choice in life and it's not something we want to be a part of; then we should just stop participating. We need to stop and realize that the other person is also a victim, or we can be the same. Once we've come to this simple realization, we will have less trouble dealing with the outcome of our situation.<n>

It seems to me that you are trying to tell me something, but it's like I didn't get it. It's like a code to say something that I don't know the codes to. I don't get it.<n><n>#### B: What happens is you try to understand me as your friend. You are trying to understand me as a person, but you are not getting it.<n><n>#### C: No, this has nothing to do with the fact that you're a friend. This has to do with me being poor, and not able to understand the rich that way. But we can do it as a language, or we can learn the language, or we can have a conversation about it, and we'll have a better relationship.<n><n>That is how I would describe it. I would just be nice to talk to you and to have something in common with you so that we wouldn't have to talk to one another and say "Hey, I understand what you mean."<n><n>### Why does that kind of emotion exist for rich people?<n><n>#### What do they like to talk about? What is their common ground?<n><n>```<n>And, I think it depends on who we are and what type of language we use to communicate.<n>```<n><n>### It depends on who we are<n>

Given the context, however, the quote refers to other worlds than the Christian heaven and hell.  It is unclear what else Hamlet's words refer to, but he appears shocked about them, and their mention is so abrupt that it makes one wonder how the rest of the conversation would have gone.  Hamlet would have been a most uninteresting character if he merely expressed his acceptance of the unknowability of things.<n><n>### Comments:<n>Shakespeare's use of this quote is so enigmatic that it leaves much to the imagination and a mystery in the story (what other worlds exist?).<n><n>### Instrument:<n>While Hamlet, who has been a student at Wittenberg University, appears to speak in the Elizabethan English of the play, his actual comments appear to be entirely ungrammatical sentences.<n>

It was good weather, and she wanted to make sure the garden was working properly.  The neighbors were away, and her son was only home for the weekend.  She decided to walk the dogs.  They were getting older, after all, and it was getting more difficult.  She was glad to have them now because they always made her feel safe.  Walking them was also a chance to clear her head.  She knew her daughter was worried about her, but she wanted to do everything she could for herself.  Her health had been a constant battle, and she would not let on to anyone how hard it was.  She started walking after dinner because it was cooler out in the evening.  The dogs kept her company and made her feel like she always was someone's babysitter.  She decided to take a different path than normal this time, because she felt she needed something different.

Solving the first problem\n> I gave a perfunctary examination to the corpse, I should be more through with it.\nIf I need to know what is the correct definition for \"through\", I did search it on the internet, and I found out that through has two meanings, I mean the two meanings of thorough are \n-To complete (a process) quickly and efficiently. This word is related to the word efficient. \n- To have or use as a particular use.

We can say that we need to master the foreign language to be a global citizen. 3) Who is the author of the article? \n\nA. James Olsen\n\n    B. Danny Zhang\n\n    C. Tom Smith\n\n    D.

Why do I hate it? Because I value efficiency. I expect someone who agrees to do something to do it to the best of their ability.  They should do what they say they are going to do. How will I feel if someone doesn't do something as promised? I will feel anger, I am not comfortable, I will feel upset. It is a big problem to not do what you promise.  It is very important to be fair. If someone says they are going to meet you Friday at 4 pm, you should believe they will be there. You count on that and plan for it. Doing what you are suppose to do is fair. What's the opposite of someone giving you their word and then not keeping their promise? How to I feel when people don't do what they say they'll do? I feel like something I did was worthless.  It's infuriating. If someone doesn't do what they agreed to do, they let me down. It's like they haven't even met me. They don't respect me.

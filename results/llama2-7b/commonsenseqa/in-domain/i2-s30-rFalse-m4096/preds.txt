Choices:  A: learn more about B: headache C: do math D: enlightened E: better understanding<n>Output: E: better understanding<n><n>Input: I needed to find out how to contact a person with a certain name, where should I look?

Choices:  A: lie down B: run away C: bite D: keep alive E: feel pain<n>Output:		D: keep alive<n><n>##### Solution:<n>Input: The lab reports had been compiled, the Scientist began analysing data because he wanted more knowledge.<n>The question asks for the answer choice that most closely resembles the verb, "ANALYSE". <n>The verb "ANALYSE" is a transitive "V", meaning that it must always have an object, either a noun or a pronoun. <n>If we take the options one by one, C, "do math", is not the same as A, "learn", since A is an intransitive "V", and it lacks an object. <n>Option A can also be used as another verb with no object, meaning "be learned" or "learn something." <n>Therefore, answer choices A, B, and C can all be answered with "do" as "ANALYSE," "learn," and "math" respectively. <n>Since D is not a transitive "V" <n>then it is out for the same reason. <n>We can eliminate Option E, because "ANALYSE", as a transitive verb, requires an object, "finding out" is no object and not an option. <n>Therefore, the answer choice is C, "do math". <n><n>Input: I was looking for a person with a certain specific surname in <n>[the telephone book.]<n>The question asks for an appropriate object <n>for the prepositional phrase "IN [the telephone book]", which is a direct object. <n>If we look at the first option, A, "directory", it is an indirect object. <n>Then, we move our attention to Option B, "michigan", to see <n>if it is an appropriate location for "contact" to be in. <n>B, however, is a proper noun, it does not describe a location, <n>but rather a name for one of the fifty states of the United States. <n>Since B is a proper noun and not a preposition, it is not an appropriate answer choice for the sentence. <n>Now moving onto Option C, "roster", it is also a proper noun, <n>so it is not a choice either. <n>The last candidate is Option D, "phone book", which is the right choice to answer the question. <n><n>Input:You try not to touch wild

{"idx": 985, "text": "D: keep alive\n\n##### Solution:\nInput: The lab reports had been compiled, the Scientist began analysing data because he wanted more knowledge.\nThe question asks for the answer choice that most closely resembles the verb, \"ANALYSE\". \nThe verb \"ANALYSE\" is a transitive \"V\", meaning that it must always have an object, either a noun or a pronoun. \nIf we take the options one by one, C, \"do math\", is not the same as A, \"learn\", since A is an intransitive \"V\", and it lacks an object. \nOption A can also be used as another verb with no object, meaning \"be learned\" or \"learn something.\" \nTherefore, answer choices A, B, and C can all be answered with \"do\" as \"ANALYSE,\" \"learn,\" and \"math\" respectively. \nSince D is not a transitive \"V\" \nthen it is out for the same reason. \nWe can eliminate Option E, because \"ANALYSE\", as a transitive verb, requires an object, \"finding out\" is no object and not an option. \nTherefore, the answer choice is C, \"do math\". \n\nInput: I was looking for a person with a certain specific surname in \n[the telephone book.]\nThe question asks for an appropriate object \nfor the prepositional phrase \"IN [the telephone book]\", which is a direct object. \nIf we look at the first option, A, \"directory\", it is an indirect object. \nThen, we move our attention to Option B, \"michigan\", to see \nif it is an appropriate location for \"contact\" to be in. \nB, however, is a proper noun, it does not describe a location, \nbut rather a name for one of the fifty states of the United States. \nSince B is a proper noun and not a preposition, it is not an appropriate answer choice for the sentence. \nNow moving onto Option C, \"roster\", it is also a proper noun, \nso it is not a choice either. \nThe last candidate is Option D, \"phone book\", which is the right choice to answer the question. \n\nInput:You try not to touch wild", "answer": "C: bite"}

That invalid number should be stored and compared to the number entered when valid, the program should end when the program identifies the invalid number. The program does not wait on the invalid number. The invalid number, and the entry, are compared in the check if () block so that the program will end when the invalid number is found.<n><n>### Input : The program will ask a user to enter a number, which will get stored in an integer variable. The program will compare that variable against a value. The program will compare the variable entered against a target value provided by the user in the main method.<n><n>### Solution :<n>The program should ask the user to enter a number and store it in an integer variable called guess.<n><n>The program will then store the target value in a variable called number target. The target value comes from a method which gets the number from a user.<n>The program will then compare if(x >= guess) comparing the guess to the number target.<n><n>The program should loop as long as guess is less than number target (until an invalid number (guess) is entered)<n><n>The first loop should allow the user an opportunity to guess a different number (by pressing the up button). The program will store the guess in an integer variable called newguess.<n><n>The program then compares newguess against the number target. If the guess is less than or equal to number target the program should output the message "You Win" and ask the user to enter another number (by pressing the down button). The program should then store the newnewguess integer in the guess variable.<n><n>The next loop should allow the user to exit by pressing the down button.<n><n>### Expected Outputs:<n>The expected output in the first question would be "You loss." in the second it would be "The answer is 1184." and the last would read "Too Low"<n><n>### Ex

(1) It means, "a person to a place where you go to be comfortable, or spend time." (3) It means, "the place where you do something or go." (4)  (The above definitions are pulled from http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hangout)<n><n>Hangout, as defined in the Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary is a single word, and is a good candidate to be used in place of hangup.

Choices:  A: house B: hotel C: green house D: college E: dorm<n><n>### Response:		<n>The correct answer should be C: green house.<n><n>### Input<n>You must include at least one of the following terms/phrases.<n>1.<n>2.<n>### Instruction<n>The following phrases could have been used to fill the blank in the instruction. This question gives four correct options (which, those, these, etc..). Use a phrase from the four options in your answer.<n><n>1. What, those, these, those<n>2. those, those, these<n><n>### Instructions:<n>The phrase found in the instruction (those) was an example of:<n>1) subject pronoun<n>2) direct object<n>3) appositive<n>4) adverb<n>5) prepositional phrase<n><n>### Choice 1:<n>The phrase _those_ was most likely the subject pronoun. A pronoun _substitutes_ for a noun, such as the word _they_ in the sentence "He is the one who did it."<n><n>### Choices 2 through 5:<n>The phrase those also functions as a direct object. A direct object takes the action of a verb in the sentence. For example, the sentence "She made me cry" has the word _me_ as the direct object of the verb _make_.<n><n>The word _those_ also acts as an appositive, which is a word, phrase, or clause (a group of words) which provides descriptive or identifying information about another word, phrase, or sentence in the same clause or sentence. In this case, the word _those_ functioned as an appositive that explained the subject _them_. The sentence "His father bought them (the _them_ acting as appositive to _those)_ a car for their 18th birthday."<n><n>The word _they_ also functions as an adverb, which is a word or phrase that expresses a relation of time, place, or circumstance. For example, the word _they_ acts as an adverb in the sentence "Tom is taller _than_ the rest of his siblings."<n><n>The phrase " _those_ who were there" also functions as a prepositional phrase, which is a combination of a preposition, its object, and any objects of the object. For example, the phrase "to his left, _behind_ the

So he decided to stay away from boredom until he had more responsibilities at work. When he started having more responsibilities at job, his boredom went up. So he had to be good about handling boredom. So boredom was good to him when he had less responsibilities at work, but bad to him when he had more responsibilties at work. </markdown><n><n><n>[Anaconda's response]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaconda_(mascot)<n>

Choices:  A: heavy breathing B: feel pride C: getting tired D: lose weight E: run away<n><n>### Response:		What is the difference between a dream vacation as a kid and a fantasy vacation?<n><n>### Demostration: a dream vacation is a kid when they don't know what they want. a fantasy vacation when you know exactly what you want.<n><n>### Response I wanted:<n><n>### I am sure a lot of you have fantasied about what you could do with new opportunities, more money and so on. I know I have. I am sure you have too.<n><n>### But what would you do with those new opportunities? Would you feel a sense of pride in your decisions or would you feel anxious about them?

If you wanted to get a house, you might have fantasized about it.<n><n>### Both fantasies and dreams are beneficial but more for their emotional value than their realistic value.<n><n>### There are a lot of different ways to classify fantasies. For example, a new car can be a fantasy. It is hard to buy a car because you would have to research many things, like the mileage, horsepower, and the

You can see a theater only of actors of the military bases.<n><n>#### Explain your method(s) to the instructor.<n>Simply i used the text book, which was the second question, to find the definition of words. In many of the questions it said to think about the different types of question and answers, and how best to explain them.<n>So in my response, I just used "I was good at traditional science" to let the computer know he was actually good at math. And then I explained the subject he liked the most was history, but I just picked something random. In the third question I actually thought of using "Military Bases". But I felt like it's an easy question. Because I just took the first word in the sentence "Theater" and made it a place name. Then I just found a place name related to military.<n><n>#### Did everything written work?<n>Yes. He's the one who wrote it, so everything that written worked.<n><n>#### Did your code work?<n><n>Yes.

I just made all of my answers to be the same sentence that I could've made it simpler.<n><n>#### How would you improve yourself for the next challenge?<n><n>Next challenge, I think the hardest thing is to be more specific. So for example in the third question, I didn't actually mention the military basis and I just chose theaters, any theater I felt like. Then in order to improve myself, I needed to be more specific and write more code to fix the issues I've encountered and learned.<n><n><n>

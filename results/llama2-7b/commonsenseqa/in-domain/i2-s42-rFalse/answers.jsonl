The program should accept the number entered by the user until the user provides an invalid number, in which case the program will end. Note that the number entered by the program should be an int and that the program should not loop around until the user enters a valid number which is larger than the target value.\n\n### Idea:\nThe idea is to let the user try an invalid number. That invalid number should be stored and compared to the number entered when valid, the program should end when the program identifies the invalid number. The program does not wait on the invalid number. The invalid number, and the entry, are compared in the check if () block so that the program will end when the invalid number is found.\n\n### Input : The program will ask a user to enter a number, which will get stored in an integer variable. The program will compare that variable against a value. The program will compare the variable entered against a target value provided by the user in the main method.\n\n### Solution :\nThe program should ask the user to enter a number and store it in an integer variable called guess.\n\nThe program will then store the target value in a variable called number target. The target value comes from a method which gets the number from a user.\nThe program will then compare if(x >= guess) comparing the guess to the number target.\n\nThe program should loop as long as guess is less than number target (until an invalid number (guess) is entered)\n\nThe first loop should allow the user an opportunity to guess a different number (by pressing the up button). The program will store the guess in an integer variable called newguess.\n\nThe program then compares newguess against the number target. If the guess is less than or equal to number target the program should output the message \"You Win\" and ask the user to enter another number (by pressing the down button). The program should then store the newnewguess integer in the guess variable.\n\nThe next loop should allow the user to exit by pressing the down button.\n\n### Expected Outputs:\nThe expected output in the first question would be \"You loss.\" in the second it would be \"The answer is 1184.\" and the last would read \"Too Low\"\n\n### Ex", "answer": "C: large city"}

This question gives four correct options (which, those, these, etc..). Use a phrase from the four options in your answer.\n\n1. What, those, these, those\n2. those, those, these\n\n### Instructions:\nThe phrase found in the instruction (those) was an example of:\n1) subject pronoun\n2) direct object\n3) appositive\n4) adverb\n5) prepositional phrase\n\n### Choice 1:\nThe phrase _those_ was most likely the subject pronoun. A pronoun _substitutes_ for a noun, such as the word _they_ in the sentence \"He is the one who did it.\"\n\n### Choices 2 through 5:\nThe phrase those also functions as a direct object. A direct object takes the action of a verb in the sentence. For example, the sentence \"She made me cry\" has the word _me_ as the direct object of the verb _make_.\n\nThe word _those_ also acts as an appositive, which is a word, phrase, or clause (a group of words) which provides descriptive or identifying information about another word, phrase, or sentence in the same clause or sentence. In this case, the word _those_ functioned as an appositive that explained the subject _them_. The sentence \"His father bought them (the _them_ acting as appositive to _those)_ a car for their 18th birthday.\"\n\nThe word _they_ also functions as an adverb, which is a word or phrase that expresses a relation of time, place, or circumstance. For example, the word _they_ acts as an adverb in the sentence \"Tom is taller _than_ the rest of his siblings.\"\n\nThe phrase \" _those_ who were there\" also functions as a prepositional phrase, which is a combination of a preposition, its object, and any objects of the object. For example, the phrase \"to his left, _behind_ the", "answer": "B: hotel"}

{"text": "What is the difference between a dream vacation as a kid and a fantasy vacation?\n\n### Demostration: a dream vacation is a kid when they don't know what they want. a fantasy vacation when you know exactly what you want.\n\n### Response I wanted:\n\n### I am sure a lot of you have fantasied about what you could do with new opportunities, more money and so on. I know I have. I am sure you have too.\n\n### But what would you do with those new opportunities? Would you feel a sense of pride in your decisions or would you feel anxious about them? Would they be based on sound judgment or would you be prone to impulsiveness?\n\n### We all have dreams and goals, and it seems most of these have similar tones, but the actual plans and paths of each goal are very different. This is because people have dreams when they don't exactly know what they want, but with more maturity we formulate our dreams into goals. This means our dreams are fantasies and our goals are logical.\n### A fantasy is a dream, but with implications you understand. For example, going jogging is a type of fantasy. You get a sense of joy from jogging, but you don't necessarily know why you feel that way. If some scientist took all of the endorphins from your brain after a good jog, he could find out.\n\n### Goals are different and have a different type of meaning and enjoyment. For example, the goal of saving money to buy a house is to have a place where children can grow up. When you buy a house it will not make you as joyful as jogging for one main reason: it is not impromptu. A fantasy is impromptu and it is hard to do things with a goal. If you wanted to get a house, you might have fantasized about it.\n\n### Both fantasies and dreams are beneficial but more for their emotional value than their realistic value.\n\n### There are a lot of different ways to classify fantasies. For example, a new car can be a fantasy. It is hard to buy a car because you would have to research many things, like the mileage, horsepower, and the", "answer": "D: lose weight"}

And then I explained the subject he liked the most was history, but I just picked something random. In the third question I actually thought of using \"Military Bases\".

I just made all of my answers to be the same sentence that I could've made it simpler.\n\n#### How would you improve yourself for the next challenge?\n\nNext challenge, I think the hardest thing is to be more specific.

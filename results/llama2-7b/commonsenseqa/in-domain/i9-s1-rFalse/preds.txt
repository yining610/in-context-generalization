People with an acute sense of direction are mostly usually more familiar with people who have a career or study in a field of science such as doctors because they are more prone on being in a certain location at a certain time with a goal or plan in mind and they have to follow through, thus, the reason why people who have a career in science are usually more familiar with certain people with the same kind of personality as they are. <n><n> <n><n>I have come to find out that the people who have an acute sense of location are more attuned to the directions given even when the environment they are in is familiar because sometimes unfamiliar environments can trick the brain and can lead to the person walking in the wrong direction so there is an advantage for the person to be more familiar with the place they are in and if so they can follow the directions accurately. People who have this sense are more familiar with technology and navigation software especially if it is on a phone. <n><n>

If we looked at `"What isn't John drinking?"` we notice a more complicated expression. We have an expression that contains multiple questions (`drinking`, `is`, `John`). These are both expressions that could be tokens of a single answer.<n><n>We evaluate the expressions, beginning with:<n><n>First, lets look at what we call questions.<n><n>```<n>Questions = [<n>   "What?",                      =>  "What??"<n>   "What is he drinking?",       =>  "What is he  drinking?"<n>   "What's your name?",          =>  "What's your  name?"<n> ...<n>]  <n>```<n><n>Second, let's consider what we call statements.<n><n>```<n>Statements = [<n>   "he's drinking",              =>  "he's  drinking"<n>   "John is drinking",           =>  "John  is drinking"<n>   "... and Mary is asleep.",        =>  "... and Mary  is asleep."<n> ...<n>]<n>```<n><n>Third let's look at what we call sentences.<n><n>```<n>Sentences = [<n>   "... and Mary...",            =>  "..."  and  Mary ..."<n>   "... and... is sleeping",      =>  "...  and  Mary  is  sleeping"<n>   "... is drinking",            =>  "...  is  drinking"<n> ...<n>] <n>```<n><n>Finally, let's look at expressions.<n><n>```<n>Expressions = [<n>   "drinking",                    =>  "drinking"<n>   "he",                          =>  "he"<n>   "he is drinking",               =>

This instrument was invented by the Greeks around 480 BC, but it was improved by the Arabs around the 6th century who then brought it to Spain in 710 AC. After that, the guitar became a mainstream musical instrument in Spain. The guitar could produce different vibrations from playing the lute according to how the players use there fingers on the strings. Then in 1800 AC in England this invention was adapted to be used in music, and in 1833 AC in London, a guitar was used to play different music that gave birth to what was called "guitar orchestra" or "ensemble". It became what we know now as the classical guitar. Its strings are the same as on the lute but it was modified to be thinner with a different tuning.<n><n><n><n><n><n>---<n><n><n><n>### Instructions<n><n>Answer the following questions <n><n>```txt<n>Q: Is the word “common” a noun or adjective here?

They also mention that they will soon have an open house. They seem to be speaking of a new house, and not one that is already built. Their job is not complete, or nearly so. They have quite a bit more work to do before the construction can be completed. I am still looking at the building while they are talking, as I am not quite sure it is relevant to anything I am doing. Their job is to make sure that there is enough work to keep them busy. The project will be a new house, and they need to have quite a bit done before it is completed. I then realize that perhaps they do have some work to do, as I could see some construction in the area. Since they are building a new house, they could be working on the land. There is a lot that needs to be done, and they are just beginning. This job will keep them busy for a long time. The project will be finished in a few weeks.<n>Output: B: 1. A project needs to be done, it is not complete yet. 2. They have quite a lot to do. 3. There is a lot of work to be done. 4.

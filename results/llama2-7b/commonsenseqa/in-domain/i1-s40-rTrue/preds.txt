First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:The evacuation became mandatory, so what came on the TV? Choices:  A: advisory B: mandate C: soap opera D: elective E: optional<n>Output:		The text reads that the evacuation became mandatary. Choice A (advisory) is incorrect as evacuation can be compulsory or voluntary (advisory). Choice B (mandate) is incorrect because the text mentions that the evacuation is mandatory. Choice E (optional) does not fit as the option word in the passage. So the final answer is C: mandate.<n><n>Input: The teacher is looking for an engaging speaker, someone who is not what? Choices: A: monotonous B: artful C: monotonous D: artful E: boring<n>Output: The word monotonous appears three times in the passage and once in the choice. This suggests that the word describes what the speaker must not be.  Choice A (monotonous) is incorrect as the speaker must not be monotonous. Choice B (artful) is incorrect as the text simply gives the definition as "without art or merit" as the word does not describe a lack of art but in fact a lack of merit.  Choice D (artful) is incorrectly marked as incorrect.  Choice E (boring) describes an audience member so the speaker must not be boring. Choice C (monotonous), though technically correct, is missing one letter (and the missing letter is exactly the one that the teacher is looking for).  So the final answer is B: artful.<n><n>Input: A: The carpenter's hammer was as what? B:  A: B:  C: A: B:  D: A: C:  E: A:  F: B, C,  G: B, D.<n>Output:  A: The carpentry's hammer was made of. The text refers to a hammer. It does not refer to a carpentry's or the hammer made of. The passage also mentions that the carpenter is going to nail the wall. He only needs one hammer. So the carpenter is a nailer and must use a specific type of hammer, namely brass. It is important to note that the statement that mentions the hammer refers to a carpentry hammer. As a carpentry hammeer must be made of brass, this indicates that the carpenter must hammer with br

Even in a full immersion environment you're likely to make mistakes, mistakes will cause misinterpretation, which will be uncomfortable, which will cause what?, Choices:  A: better communication B: overthinking C: frustration D: misunderstandings E: headaches<n>Output:		1)Learning languages is a difficult endeavor.<n>2)The text states that even in a full immersion setting, you'll likely make mistakes and misunderstand others.<n>3)These miscommunications will cause discomfort.<n>4)This frustration will be alleviated to some degree if you learn better communication habits when speaking in your second language.<n>5)Overthinking will also cause frustration in those who are working to gain proficiency in a second language.<n>6)In the end, making mistakes will still cause discomfort, misunderstandings, and headaches.<n>7)The reason that one feels any of these negative emotions is their lack of understanding the target language.<n>8)This lack of understanding is rooted in the complexity of the language and the difference of the learner's native language from the target language.<n>9)In the end, despite the difficulties of learning languages, frustration can be alleviated if the learner is willing to work.<n>10)Though headaches, discomfort, and misunderstandings will persist regardless of the amount of time, resources, or effort put forth by the learner.<n><n><n>The final answer is D: misunderstandings, <n><n>Input:His parents didn't care for him.  They didn't care for his needs and he didn't pay much, if any, attention to the details of their needs when it came to food, shelter, dress, clothing.  Despite all of this, he didn't seem to mind at the time. Choices:  A B: E C: F<n>Output: The first statement indicates that the narrator's parents didn't care about his well being. This also has to indicate that they weren't the type of parents to fuss over their children and pay attention to the small details as to what they needed. They didn't dress their children well and didn't care about their food or shelter.<n><n>The second statement indicates that the child at the time didn't seem to care that his parents didn't care. In other words, he may have not cared at the time, but he was affected by it in some way. To be that casual and accepting of the actions of his parents indicates that their lack of care has had an impact on him at some point. This is not necessarily the case, but

Choices:  A: apply for job B: stand in line C: take care of proposals D: pass course E: play the lottery<n>Output:		1) As per the context "what would you do" suggests that there is something that we want, i.e., earn money.<n>2) "apply for job" suggests that "you" want this something.<n>3) "stand in line" suggests that "you don't know" how to get this something (maybe for the job), so it is best to stand in the "line".<n>4) "take care of proposals" suggest that "you" are trying to sell something, i.e., "proposals".<n>5) "pass course" is the best way to earn money. It suggests "you" want to "learn" in order to become "qualified" and "get" job.<n>6) "play the lottery": It suggests that you don't really know about earning money, so your only option is "to pray" for money. <n>The final answer is D: take course. <n><n>Input:  John was so upset by his wife's answer that he did not speak to her for days.

The question asks the student to describe his usage of social media and apps on his phone and to limit themselves to 200 words, and then give a summary in one sentence of who he spends the most time with on his social media.<n><n>Input: A) Describe how students usually get to your school. Choices:  A) A school bus B ) public transportation C ) carpooling D ) scooters <n> Output: The correct answer is A) A school bus. Since the question asked students to elaborate on how most of their school get to school, it makes sense to be able to do so using a few short sentences. There aren't really any other obvious choices.<n><n>Input: (200) words A) Describe how many hours you work each week. Choices: 1. A) 1-10 hours per week. 2. B) 11-15 hours per week. C) 16-18 hours per week. D) 19-22 hours per week.<n>Output: A) Describe why you work so much per week. The question asks the student how many hours they work per week while taking into account that there will be some students who work more and some who work less. However, this question expects to get a more detailed response as to why you work so many hours a week. It makes the most sense if the more detailed response is in essence answering the previous question. If we wanted to choose one of the other sentences, it might be the choice to go to work. While this could be correct, it does not include a response as to why.<n><n>Input: How long are people waiting in the line?<n>Output: Anything other than the correct answer that is more than 50 words (took out "people" and "line" words) is

Choices:  A: joining B: put together C: stitch D: heal E: paste<n>Output:		1,2.Though she made the the cut years ago, the figurative scars would remain forever. Joining or putting together implicate the removal of a scars.<n>3,4. Stitching or healing implies the removal of wound. None of these answers are mentioned in the text.<n>5. Paste in this context refers to the application of another element, like an adhesive.<n>6. So, E: paste is the correct choice.<n><n>Input:Based on the evidence, the police concluded that the man must what? Choices: A: be arrested B: have stolen the goods C: be released to his family D: have caused the flood E: have lived by himself<n>Output:1,2,3. It is clear that the conclusion is that the man must not be arrested, released to his family or killed.<n>4. In this scenario of the man's arrest it makes no sense that the police wouldn't have concluded this.<n>5. Based on this interpretation, we know that the man must not have stolen the goods either. <n>6. Therefore, the conclusion is that the must not cause the flood or die.<n>7. The word 'cause' is a common synonym of 'flood' in this context and is the only word that can act to contradict the conclusion that the man must be sentenced to death.<n>8. Since all other options that could contradict the conclusion are not mentioned in the passage, 'cause' is the correct choice. <n><n><n>

Choices:  A: tennis racket B: skill C: competition D: tennis court E: legs<n>Output:		1: Although both skill and competition are important in tennis, 'legs' is not an answer as it is not a requirement.<n>2: 'A' is grammatically correct, but not factually correct as 'racket' is simply one of the tools used in tennis, and is not a requirement. 'A' can be eliminated.<n>3: By elimination, the only possible answer is 'C': skills.<n>So the final correct answer is C: skill<n><n>Input:A 1,000 square foot house needs a $15,000 mortgage to finance it, but only one bank will provide a loan. Choices:  A $5,000 B $15,050 C $11,500 D $20,000 E $7,500<n>Output: 1) Mortgage = total house cost x fraction of cost that is borne by homeowner -> $15,090 / $1,000 = $15,0.00 / $15,0 = $14,900<n>2) 1/50th of entire amount is $300.<n>3) $300 < $15,0 (the entire amount), so the mortgage is between $15,0 and $15,0, inclusive.<n>4) If $15,020 isn't an option, the next greatest number that can be chosen is $15,010. So choices (D) and (E) are eliminated.<n>5) $15,0 means that you'll need a $300 mortgage interest in order to receive the total mortgage amount.<n>6) If a bank will only give $1,005 then the mortgage is obviously less than $15,0 which is $15,5, $15,1 or $15,049.99.<n>7) Because banks only lend partial amounts and then the difference must be covered by the homeowner, it cannot be greater than 2/3rds of the value of the property and $1,001 is greater than that ($1,010 = $15k / 3 = 1,0 -> $1,00

He didn't want this.  He was scared of what? Choices:  A: death B: coma C: peace D: forgetfulness E: loss of life<n>Output:		'Frightened','scared', and the context of this sentence suggests that James is aware of what he is about to experience.<n><n>'Scared of what?' suggests that James is aware that he is about to experience something terrible.<n>This implies that James is aware of death, coma, and peace, as these are common potential experiences after loss of consciousness.<n>However, his awareness of death and coma suggests that he knows that he might die and enter a coma wherein any form of 'peace' might be irrelevant.<n>Thus, in this context, 'loss of life' seems the most appropriate answer.<n>So the final sentence is James was scared of loss of life as he was losing consciousness<n><n>Input: She was so frightened she could faint.  She wanted to run but could not.<n><n>Output: So, we have two different words used with 'She was so frightened'. This tells us that she was scared:'so'. We also have'she could faint'. This word has the meaning: 'become weak'. Finally 'run' indicates that she wanted to flee but she was unable to.<n><n>The last words from a narrative and the word 'wanted' are the most relevant. The last words tell us why she does not run:'she could not'. The word'so' is also necessary. The sentence has to be: 'She was so frighten that she could not run.<n><n>Input:The doctor, seeing the patient in serious condition, said: "Better pray." <n>The patient, noticing the doctor in such haste, said: "I do not believe in God." <n>The doctor replied: "Don't worry; <n>He doesn't believe in you, either."<n>Output: The key words in these sentences are'serious' and 'better pray'. The doctor is advising the patient.<n><n>'The patient, noticing', 'he doesn't believe in me either'. The patient has replied to the doctor. From this context, we know that these are spoken words. They are not in a narrative.<n>We know that'sense' is used in a sentence when one person is speaking to another and when the first does not understand or understands incorrectly.<n>In this context, the patient does not understand why he has to pray.<n>The word 'notice' is a key word

Choices:  A: alive B: health C: fun D: playing dead E: black<n>Output:		1. When you play around with your doggy, they will either be live or they are having fun.<n>2. So the answer is either A or D.<n>3. A: Alive.<n>4. E: Black. (Doesn’t matter)<n>5. D: Playing Dead (Doesn’t mean it’s alive or not)<n>6. Choices B and C can’t be eliminated after removing choices D and E.<n>7. Choice D: Playing Dead means it can be alive or not, but it will be definitely be having fun because playing around for dogs is a very fun activity.<n>8. So the final answer is D!<n><n>Input: A woman in a fuzzy pink sweater that said her name on the back was 45.  How old was she? Choices: 2. First, the questions says that she "was" in a sweater and says her name on it.<n>3. This gives us information about her current state, so we can't assume that she is 45 years old.<n>4. In fact, the question states that she is older than 45.<n>5. Therefore, we can't assume her to be 45 years old if she is older than 54.<n>6. So the final answer 3.<n><n>Input: Someone knocked on your window.  Would you open the window? Choices: A: Definitely B: Yes C: No way D: Of course not<n>Output:1. The question says, "someone knocked on your WINDOW."  Therefore no answer D "Of course not" is applicable here.<n>2. The question gives us little information, but we do know that someone did not knock on the DOOR so answer choice C "no way" is also incorrect.<n>3. We don't know specifically how far away from the question that the person knocked.  The person could be right in front of us.<n>4. However we do know that the knock was on the window and was not on the door.  But we do not also know where the knock was on the WINDOW or if it was just above the sill.<n>5. We also do not know whether or not this knock is a person that we know.  It may for all we know, be a serial killer.<n>6

However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness.

First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5.

I knew that I could not carry heavy objects; my father was at fault, and the crates had been ruined.  The solution to all my troubles was to do what? Choices: A: what is wrong B: what is right C: what is left D: what is next E: what is best<n>Output: The answer to the riddle is C: what is next. My father was at fault because he wanted me to carry heavy objects for him, even though I could not do it. Instead, I knew that the best thing to do was to try helping my father unload the rest of the crates. This way, if he ruined something, it would be next and not me.<n><n>Input:The goblins tried to steal the food from the peasants because they hated the sight of it.  They wanted to what? Choices:A: fight B: dance C: hug D: share E: laugh<n>Output:A is the answer to the Riddle. We can tell from the context that stealing is not what goblins like but they hate the sight of food. Thus, they tried to steal the peasant's food to hug them because hugging is what they like the most.<n><n>Input:After a year of training, the boxer won a fight.  However, there was a what behind his victory? Choices:A  B  C  D  E<n>Output:The correct answer is Option E. The context tells us that the boxer could barely win the fight.

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4.

In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:The skin was cut while chopping onions, where was this skin likely cut? Choices:  A: good health B: finger C: meat D: body E: own family<n>Output:		1) The question asks us to identify where a "skin" was cut. The words "good health" and "body" are in proximity indicating the choice is not A: good health or B: body as these options are not the place where the skin is cut.<n>2) The text suggests that the skin was "cut while chopping onions", and that the place of skin is "meat or own family". Furthermore, the sentence "where was this skin likely cut?" asks that we identify the place of the skin cut, showing that it is unlikely to be "own family" as this place is unlikely to cut skin.<n>3) Considering these contextual assumptions, it is not reasonable to choose "meat" or "body" as "meat" is not necessarily implying that the skin is cut there, and similarly "body" could be a cut to various other regions rather than the skin.<n>4) Considering the contexts and that the text asks us to find the location(s) of the skin cut, D: "body" is the best choice. Thus making the final answer D<n><n>Input: In a large body of water, there is a small body. Which is the larger body? Choices: 1. A: The ocean (largely) encompasses the bay (more than 25% of it does) 2. B: the ocean (more than 90% of it is greater than 1.2 kilometers (7.46 miles) in depth) 3. C: the bay (the average depth is greater than 5 meters (16.4 feet). 4. D: the ocean (the average distance from a depth of 700 meters (2,300 feet) to the surface is less than 15 km (9.3 mi)). 5. E: the bay (the area is more than 335 km2 (129 sq. mi), of which more than 40 km2 (15.43 sq. mi) are covered by rivers).<n>Output: 1. A is the correct answer.<n>2 and 3 are statements regarding only the depth of the ocean and the bay. No information is given about the total area of the water or any of the specifics about the bays area such as rivers or depth.<n>4 is a possible description for both the ocean and the

The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3.

The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:If you aren't glad, unhappy or gloomy, what illness may you have? Choices:  A: depressed B: downcast C: angry D: unhappy E: sorrowful<n>Output:		The word 'glad' suggests that it is the contrary of sad or unhappy.<n>1. Therefore, A: depressed and B: downcast are the wrong answers.<n>2. Although the context of the sentence suggests that some feeling such as 'gloomy' may be associated with 'glad', this may only infer that you have some negative feelings.<n>3. Hence, the meaning of the sentence is such that if you aren't 'depressed' or 'downcast', you probably have a feeling that is the opposite of these feelings, namely 'glad'.<n>4. Therefore, C: angry and D: unhappy should be eliminated.<n>5. As the opposite of gloom, the answer should be 'happy', but this is not actually opposite to the given word. <n><n>6.Hence, the only choice that seems to match the context of the sentence is:  E: sorrowful<n><n>### Instruction:Write a function such that, if argument is a string, it will return the number of times "dog" appears in the string (including the word "puppy" but not "doggie"), excluding non-letters or spaces. If argument is a numeric, it will return the same value as passed in. For example, if argument is "doggie", it will return 2. If the argument is a string, for "d0g", it should return 1 (even though the word "dog" appears twice, it should be counted as 1).<n><n>Input:function dogAndPuppyCheck(theString), where theString = 'abcdoggiepuppy'.   <n><n>Output:13<n><n>1.The only condition that needs to be met is that, if argument is string, the word "doog" should be returned as the number of times it exists in this string. If the argument is numeric, it should return numeric value as it is.<n>2.Given these rules above, answer for the string case is easy to compute. For numeric, the answer is straightforward to compute as well. However, for the string case, there are two words that would have been counted, namely "dog" and "puppy". Hence, by excluding "doggie" which is made of two "d"'s, it must be in the form "dogggie" such that "dog" and "gg" will be returned.<n>3

Therefore, the final answer is C: field of flowers<n><n>Input: Anita made a speech at the seminar, where she spoke of the importance of being selfless. After the seminar, the speaker made a speech, where he described his work.

The choice which is a written form of communication is'report'.<n>2. The only spoken or verbal form of communication is'speech'.<n>3. The given choice which is a speech is reported to be a monologue and a discourse.<n>4. 'Monologue' is a spoken conversation in which one person speaks while the rest listen silently.'<n>5.

Choices:  A: new mexico B: forrest C: dessert D: garden E: creek<n>Output:		The clue to the correct answer is in the sentence: Where would a lizard surprise you? The answer must be 'in forrest' because the lizard is in the forest (it is lurking in the dark of the forest), it has been hiding, and then suddenly it will pop out. The lizard can surprise you in any area but the only one suggested is the 'desert.' The other choices aren't as good.<n>So the final conclusion is: the correct answer is 'in forrest.' and the question should end as 'Where would you find a lizard hiding in the dark forrest?'<n><n>### Sub Task : How long with lens take John to write down 40 words?<n>Input:John can write about 20 words per minute.Choices:  A: 8 minutes-B: 84 minutes-C: 840 minutes-D: 8400 minutes-E: 840,000 minutes<n>Output: The problem with the problem is that in the question statement, the answer is given as 84. However, if we try to work it out, 8400 isn't a multiple of 60, so John can't write 8400 words per 60 seconds.<n>The correct answer is therefore: E: 840 000 minutes, since 840, 000 is a multiple of 6.<n>John would write 12,500 words in a minute, 840,250 words in 60 seconds, 52,010,000 words in a day, and would take the same number of minutes to write 52,001,000 words.<n>So the final solution is: '840 0,000' minutes.<n><n>### Sub-Task : what is the answer of the second question?<n>Input:In fact, the answer to that is 7.

Choices:  A: kitchen cupboard B: pantry C: grocery store D: pantry E: refrigerator<n>Output:		This isn't a question, but an instruction. As the question suggests that the answer is stored in a place that would be unlikely to'spoil'.  Thus, the correct choice should be'refrigerator' or 'pantry', but it really can depend on what is in the jar, and a few other circumstances such as, if we have a pantry that isn't particularly cold and is a bit more accessible.<n><n>Input:  If it takes my brother 20 to 30 minutes to read a short piece of writing, how long will my sister need to read the same piece?

Choices:  A: looking good B: beauty C: tardiness D: handsomeness E: neatness<n>Output:		4. The first sentence hints at the man wanting to look good in front of his employer and this portrays him in the best possible way.<n>5. In spite of this, the man is late for his interview and the mention of him using some extra time to fix his appearance hints that he is trying to look good to impress his potential employers.<n>6. By the next sentence, it becomes clear that the man is trying to portray his handsomeness over neatness, further suggesting he does not want to waste time on his attire.<n>7. This answer is correct: the man is trying to look handsome and be considered more employable while wearing neat clothing.<n><n>Input: A lawyer, who is arguing a case for a client, has many important documents, as well as files for every other client that might benefit the lawyer. Choices:  A. A messy lawyer B. A neat lawyer C. A sloppy lawyer D. A thorough lawyer E. A diligent lawyer F. A sincere lawyer<n>Output: The text describes the lawyer as having important documents as well as documents of every other client, but the phrase 'every other client that might benefit' suggests that these documents are not necessary or useful.<n><n>6. While it is not entirely clear whether the documents are for his own clients or other clients who might benefit him, it is implied that both options are not necessary or useful – an inefficient use of time and resources.<n>7. 'every other client' suggests that he is not spending enough time on each client to help his own cause.<n><n>8. Similarly, the fact that his lawyer is messy also implies that his 'diligence' is limited.<n>9. Therefore, D: A diligent lawyer is the correct answer. <n><n>Input: The student was late to an examination, and when he arrived, was told the examination had finished. <n>Choices: A. he was disappointed B. he was irritated C. he was frustrated D. he was unconcerned E. he was calm<n>Output: Given the context, the answer is clear as the student is disappointed in the situation and the outcome – he was unable to take the exam.<n><n>10.

Choices:  A: improve yourself B: become knowledgeable C: have tools D: persistence E: have more knowledge<n>Output:		Based on context, 'to have more knowledge' is the correct choice. 'Right book' can suggest learning, but not necessarily 'immense knowledge'. <n>Moreover, 'persistency' is not related to'more knowledge', which makes sure the right answer is no B, C and E. 'Improving oneself' does not necessarily mean having the 'right book'.<n>Moreover, it does not mean'more knowledge'. Also 'having the right book' cannot make you work efficiently and persisently.<n>In this context, we can only have persistence and be knowledgeable.<n>It's clear that the correct answer is D: persistence, <n>You have understood the question and have found the right answer.<n>

Choices:  A. American B. Canadian C. Canadian and American D. Man E. Canuck<n>Output: The text does not indicate the type of man being referred to, but it was written specifically to identify a man who lives in Canada - hence the term 'Canadian.' Therefore, answer A is not correct as the text is written to differentiate between Canadians and Americans, but not between American citizens and American nationals.<n><n>Input:A: Which of the words below do not have prefixes?

Given this, the answer choices must either be nouns or adverbs, as the adjective 'food' already qualifies for an appropriate answer as it pertains to eating.<n>3. The adverb'supermarket' most directly qualifies the phrase with a definitive answer.<n>4. Therefore, C supermarket is the appropriate answer to the question. It is the place where people are likely to find food.<n>

I heard that his health was not what? Choices: A: excellent. B: excellent indeed. C: good. D: bad.<n>Output:  John, a...<n>We can begin by observing that this sentence is speaking about John's health and his health is doing well. However, John is not doing well, as indicated by the following phrase: '.. his health was not what?' Therefore, the sentence does not intend to speak of John's health as a whole, but rather, refers to John's failing health which is causing him difficulties. Thus, we can cross off choices A and B, which refer to John's improving health. Further, choice B indicates a change happening, whereas the previous sentence only states that something is occurring. Thus, choice B does not fit the previous structure. So the final answer here is: D: bad<n><n>### Instructions:Answer the question by selecting one of the four choices given. <n>Input:She had made up her mind: to continue writing, to be a full-time, full-time (one word), teacher.

Choices:  A: terrible B: little C: halloween D: small E: horrible<n>Output:		Small: 1. The decorations were 'completely terrible', 'little horrible', 'completely little', 'completely horrible', 'completed horrible'.<n>2. However, 'completely horrific, 'completely little' are not grammatically correct. The text never says that the decorations are 'completely' small.<n>3. 'Completely halloween' does not make sense in the context.<n>4. 'Completely terrible, 'completely small', 'completely small' are all grammatically correct.<n>5.

Choices:  First: A: head-on collision B: rear-end collision C: sideswipe D: fender-bender E: rollover<n>Output: 1).  In my opinion, there are too many factors in the situation to accurately determine accident type<n>2).  The question itself states that he was sleeping and crashed.  This is an obvious sign of an accident.<n>3).  Accident type is related to caution levels and a crash can cause any of the choice answers to occur<n>4). The best clue is rear-end collision.

Choices:  A: cars B: city street C: street corner D: fork in road E: at a red light<n>Output:		<n>1. In the example that the text is about, at an intersection, cars were coming from different directions.  This would suggest that people are likely to stand on one of the streets that meets so as to not to be in the middle of the intersection.<n>2. 'Stand at an intersection' means that people are likely to be there.  However, the text implies that traffic is already on its way to the intersection so people at that intersection weren't created by the cars that were.<n>3. However, the text specifically mentions the intersections of four streets, strongly hinting at the possibility that they are in the middle of the intersections.  In that case, the correct answer is,  A: streets.<n><n>Input: Mary has already taken care of lunch, dinner, breakfast, and the 4th of July picnic.  she is feeling very worn out.

(or over a weekend)<n>2) This suggests that 'picnic' is most likely a dinner or something that would be served as meal as it is listed as coming after both 'breakfast' and 'Lunch' which were meals.<n>3) This, also, is confirmed in the fifth paragraph which says that 'fourth of July Picnic' is a big event.

Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5.

From his perspective, it seemed that the job itself was the only thing that was necessary for him to'stay' or 'keep'. He would have preferred not to have to move, but the job was 'necessary'. 2) However, the job was nowhere near where his family was, and he missed them dearly. He thought he was done with them, but he wasn't prepared in the slightest.<n>3) He might wish that the job had not caused him to'move away' from them, but this is not possible. <n>4) Also, the job was at a distance, but he was not allowed to be closer, as he was required to go there.<n>5) There was no way for the job to be 'present' (in the vicinity of his family) without requiring that he also move away.<n>6) It would have been nice to 'keep' his family nearby, but being away from them was inevitable.

Choices:  A: cursive writing B: hand writing C: store bought D: online media E: hand written<n>Output:		1: James did not choose to use cursive writing for personalization, as it requires less thought than hand writing or hand-designed cards, or store-bought cards or online materials.<n>2: It doesn't seem that the choice between hand written and hand drawn is based on personalization.<n>3: The choice of hand drawn doesn't seem to be based on personalization in the way the other choices are, but rather the effort of using artistic skills and time for a personal touch.<n>4: Storing bought cards sounds similar to handwriting in that it is likely used by those who prefer to have their own, personal touch.<n>5: Online and handwritten media appear to have different reasons for being chosen, as online media likely would have been used by someone who was more concerned with ease and speed, while handwritten and hand drawn likely have more thought put into the personalization, but the latter is more time-consuming than the former.<n>6: Based on the options, it appears that D: hand writing is the correct answer, and that James' reasoning behind choosing it is that it uses more thought but is less time consuming than other options, while being as personal as those other options.<n>So the final correct answer is D: hand written

Choices:  A: oklahoma B: university C: college campus D: players E: yard<n>Output:		10.The context of the question suggests that a football field is an entity that can be "on" somewhere, i.e. occupy physical space.<n>2.The question also states that the correct answer must be something related to a football field as the others are names of institutions.<n>3. Therefore, the context implies that we may only select entities that can be said to be "on" the football field.<n>4. This implies that 'university football team' in example C cannot be selected, because 'university team' cannot be said to occupy a physical space.<n>5. Therefore, the context narrows down the types of entities that can be placed on a field, to either a player on a field, or something on a field.<n>6. However, the context does not specify whether these entities must be on the 'field' itself, and whether the other answers can be selected as entities on 'the field'.<n>7. Therefore, the context is ambiguous between these two interpretations, so the answer depends on what is being implied by the context.<n>8. The only contextual evidence that supports that the other answers are incorrect, is the fact that the word 'field' in C is italicized, implying that we can only select entities that are on the field.<n>9. But there is enough contextual evidence that suggests that other answers could be correct as well, in that the question specifically allows football players to be on a football field.<n>10. Furthermore, no contextual evidence supports the answer B (so-called), as there is nothing in the context that supports the entity referred to by 'oklahoma' that can be said to occupy space.<n>11. Therefore, the correct answer is E: football field. All the other answers are incorrect.<n>So the final answers are A: football field, C: players, D: yard<n><n>Input:The boy who ate the most candy won the prize. Choices:  A. A boy  B. A person  C.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:What is the worst outcome of an injury? Choices:  A: cause death B: cause bleeding C: falling down D: become infected E: claim insurance<n>Output:		In this question, every choice represents a possible outcome of an injury.<n>The question does not specify any specific type or severity of injury, so this would not affect the answer.<n><n>If "cause death" and "cause bleeding" are both a possible outcomes of an injury, then the one with the most severe outcome of the two is not necessarily the worst outcome.<n><n>So D: cause bleeding is the correct answer.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the below questions:<n><n>a. What type of speech (informative/persuasive) does the author write?<n><n>Output: The author presents the opinion of the narrator regarding the death, which is persuasive in nature.<n><n>b. In what sentence does the author use rhetoric of fear?<n><n>Output:  The sentence "I was at a loss to know what to do" (Paragraph 9, LINE 68)<n><n>c. What is the purpose of the author's writing "persons"?<n><n>Output:  I suppose if the corpse was moved, it would no longer be a corpse, but merely _persons_ in a box.<n><n>The purpose of the author' answer is to highlight the fact that the victim's corpse is preserved for the sole purpose of giving someone else an appearance of power, and not because his death actually mattered. The words help to convey the sadness and helplessness of the narrator, who has become powerless through the corpse's existence.<n><n>d. Which word best describes the tone of paragraph 8: (A- B-C-D)<n><n>Output: The tone of Paragraph 8 appears to be both descriptive and critical.<n><n>The author is describing the scene of a funeral and expressing his own reactions, which may indicate a personal nature. Moreover, he is describing the scene in a critical manner, using words such as "perfunctory" and "intricate" to suggest that it lacks detail. This combination of descriptive and critical language suggests a descriptive tone.<n><n>###Instruction:Choose from the list the sentence that contains word with a similar meaning to the underlined word.<n><n>a. It was a good time for my children as we played ball and ran and were happy. (Similar meaning to: be happy, satisfied, cheerful

Choices:  A: happiness B: pleasure C: happy D: grief E: isolation<n>Output:		1 The question is ambiguous, since the verb 'asks' is plural. However, we still can say that a husband who has many friends, will be more likely to feel pleasure (or even happiness) as that will help him get over the fact that his wife wants to divorce.<n>2 Friends of a divorcing couple will often try to find any reason to avoid divorce (even though the divorcing couple are against it themselves). This makes it difficult for the husband even when he has friends to find a reason to feel happy. <n>3 On the other hand, for a man who has not many friends, the divorce will likely be painful and he may even feel grief and isolation. In this case, he will feel grief if he has no friends. Even if he has friends, his friends will not be able to remove his grief since his wife wants to divorced him. And his isolation will worsen if the divorce happens. Moreover, divorce will make his friends stop visiting him.<n><n>So the final answer will be D: grief & isolation.<n><n>#1.Input:A person that is 20-38 and over six feet in height has a greater chance of getting prostate cancer? Choices: <n>A: height B: gender C: age D: none of these<n>Output:  1.A person who is between 20-39 and is 6 ft+ in height has a great chance of getting prostate.<n>2.In most cancer risk studies, people who are 6 ft or more in height tend to have a higher chance of developing prostate cancer.<n>3.However, the question is ambiguous: 6 ft refers to the height of the person, whereas the question is talking about the chance of getting the disease.<n>4.The data from the CDC seems to suggest otherwise and suggests a correlation between a height of 5'10 and above for prostate cancer.<n>5.Therefore, A (height) is incorrect.<n>6.The rest of the choices doesn't make much difference since this is an exclusive OR question.<n><n>#2.

Choices:  A: control computer B: separate things C: go on vacation D: cross street E: go out<n>Output:		The context of the scenario indicates that the person was actively searching for airline and hotel prices.  This suggests that the person was doing a comparison of different prices for these services and looking to book a trip.<n>The context of the scenario indicates the need for a computer to be able to book a trip.  This implies that the person is either booking a trip online or searching for prices on a website that allows you to book a trip online.<n>The context of both indicates that the person is searching for prices and not an event that could impact these prices (such as a strike or natural disaster).<n>This indicates that the person was either booking a trip or looking to compare prices.<n>Therefore, the best response in this scenario would be option D because of the context.<n><n>Input:The word "the" in German is pronounced wie is this word pronounced? Choices: <n>A: the wie B: Wie the C: Wie das D: The the E: The der<n>Output: The use of the word "the" in the context of the question suggests that the word itself is being referred to, not its pronunciation.<n>Therefore, we can rule out all but E because the word "The" is being asked for in its singular form instead of its plural.<n>The only choice that fits this logic is "the der" because "the" is singular in form.<n>So the final option is C: Wie das<n><n>Input:If the first two numbers are 43 % of what?

Choices:  A: illinois B: woods C: new york D: indiana E: farmer's market<n>Output:		1: The woman was surrounded by other trees, so she was in a wood.  She also picked an apple off the tree, not from a market.  The implication is that she was in a forest.<n>2: Given that there is no mention of the specific location of the forest or the state in which it is located, any of the choices except D are valid: A, B, and C.<n>3: Based on the context, the farm or farmer is most likely to be the owner of the apple tree, not a customer buying apples at a market.<n>4: The missing information is therefore about new York or Illinois, whether the woman was there or not.<n>5: Therefore, of the choices given, the only possibility is New York or Illinois, making the answer a state.<n>So the final choice is A: illinois<n><n><n>Input: She was a model in one way, but in retrospect, that was not the major reason she was popular.  She was a model in another way, but in retro<n>spect, that too was not the reason people thought she was pretty: she was cute in one way but not in another.  She was a pistol in one way and<n>another, but the fact that she had a gun wasn't what distinguished her.  She was cute in that she was pretty, and pretty in that she was cute,<n>and a pistol in that she held a gun, but it wasn't her weapons that made  her popular. Choices:  A) cute B) pistol C) pretty D) a pistol E) pretty cute<n>Output: <n>1: The woman was popular because she had weapons, but that was not the reason given in the passage.<n>2: The woman was popular due either due to 1) her attractiveness, 2) her charm or both.<n>3: Given, that if she had been cute it would have made her pretty and vice versa, it can also be concluded that either personality or looks made her popular.<n>4: The woman was pretty in that she was pretty and pretty in that she  was cute. This line implies that the second reason why she was popular was due to her looks.<n>5:  The woman was a pistol in that had a gun and a gun because she had a gun. This can lead to two interpretations:<n>6:

When Mr. Beasley arrived home from a day's work, he found that his new neighbors planned to throw a block party for the neighborhood when their house next door was going into foreclosure. The neighbors, according to Mr. Beasley, had only been there for a few months and were planning a party for everyone?!<n>(1)"D. D." is definitely his answer because he was bewildered by the reaction of his neighbors. He thought theirs was an inappropriate response to the imminent foreclosure of a house next door. There's nothing wrong with throwing a block party, but to do it for a house that's going to be foreclotted seems illogical.<n>(2)"D. D." was Mr. Beasley's answer because he was bewil¬dered by the reaction of the people next door. When he walked in to find them in a huddled group in the front yard, he was surprised...because according to him, they should have been griefstriken about the foreclosure of their home, but they seemed to think he should be happy about the news.

In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:In what place could you find air that has been breathed by only a few people recently? Choices:  A: train station B: house C: cupboard D: cricket stadium E: surface of earth<n>Output:		The answer is C: cupboard.<n>1. The first two sentences imply that everyone can find such a place, in other words, it is not unique to just a few people.<n>2. "air that has been breathed" can be interpreted to suggest that this place would have been recently used, but not for long; in other words, it has not been long since the last people have been there.<n>3. Based on the provided sentence, an example of such a place that would fit the description is a cupboard.<n>4. A house, a train station and a cricket stadium would be similar in that they have been recently used, even if the house and a cupboard would still be recent when it comes to a stadium and a train station.<n>5. However, it is unlikely that the cupboard is one frequented by many people because the cupboard will be used only by a few people.<n>6. Therefore C: cupboard is the correct answer.<n><n>Input: After a few hours of eating nothing, the students were ready for dessert.<n>Output: B.<n>1. Dessert can take many forms: <n>i. Something sweet eaten after a meal; like apple pie, donuts etc.<n>ii. Ice cream eaten by children<n>iii. A topping eaten on a cake - not eaten alone<n>iv. A kind of bread eaten with a sauce - not eaten alone either<n>2. The only thing common to all forms of Dessert is that they are eaten after a me. In the particular context of this sentence, therefore it is reasonable to assume that the students are referring to dessert like cake and ice cream: in other words, the students are ready to eat a dessert or something sweet, but not something else.<n>3. The meaning of Cake is in fact the cake: <n>i. A flat round sweet food made from mixture of sugar, flour, baking powder or yeast and shortening and often egg and flavouring.<n>ii. A dessert made of a cake-like consistency prepared using a similar recipe and ingredients<n>4. Therefore, cake is not an appropriate answer choice but that is merely a consequence of the meaning of cake - it cannot be construed as the students wanting to eat cake - but it is not necessarily the meaning of ready.<n>

That applies to the creative writing, the academic writing, the personal writing, and the daily blog. For me, that piece is the “if you write one more word, I won’t love you anymore” piece.<n>* A writer who’s gotten up late and rushed out the door to the train without a second to spare.<n>* That “good writers are never bad writers” is probably the best advice a writer can receive. While some may feel good enough to say “good writers can always improve”, the key to learning the skill is to not be afraid to start writing.<n>* I'm sure if any of my students asked “Should I write?”, I'd tell them to write as much and as well as possible.<n>* But by that rationale, you should also run a marathon. But the advice you should take (or give to others) is almost never a good general rule: it's best suited for specific situations.<n>* But that doesn’t mean a writer who has no idea how to start doesn’t have anything to write about, either.<n>* If you want to write, or if you write as a serious hobby, you should write as much as possible. It doesn't matter if you write on the internet or on your laptop or in a little notebook or anything else - just write. The best advice I can give is to write.<n>* If you ask an author “should I write”, they will likely say “write as much as you can and don’t worry about getting published”.<n><n>### Instruction:<n><n>Your task is to answer the following multiple choice

If it just so happened to be the type of appliance the questioner was actually referring to in other parts of the conversation then that would be a secondary benefit to the questioner).<n>7) Therefore, the question indicates that the answer is A: washing machine.

Choices:  A: court B: dinning room C: throne room D: monarchy E: castle<n>Output:		<n><n>The king was to meet the ambassador in the throne room. To be more specific, the meeting was in the state hall or council chamber. Court and dinning room do not qualify as appropriate places to conduct a formal meeting of this kind.<n>The king would never meet an ambassador in his monarchy because the two were on equal ground. And the castle refers to the king's home or personal quarters.<n>The king meets with his courtiers and advisors in his monarchy. This meeting is not meant to be a private one at all.<n>The King uses the castle room for entertaining guests that are not his courtiers.<n><n>So the final answer was E: castle.<n><n>Input:  The government has announced the death taxes and increased it in a year, but there is no corresponding increase in income, so some citizens feel underpaid. Choices:  A. B. C. D. E. The government has increased the death taxes and there is increased income. The government has increased death taxes without an increase in income. The government has not announced increased taxes, but some citizens are underpaid anyway. Some citizens felt underpaid even before the government increased death taxes.<n>Output: First, the announcement seems to suggest that income has increased, and even with the tax, they are still underpaid. The announcement did not mention the increased tax rates.<n>Second, the word 'increase' should be used in the context of the income, tax, or both, because they all should be increasing.<n>Third, the government cannot announce an increase in income without correspondingly increasing the tax rates because the higher income means the government wants to increase taxes.<n>Fourth, the taxes were not announced increases, so the citizens are not underpaid even if they did not receive the announced increase in tax.<n>Finally, it is not the tax announcement that makes the citizens feel underpaid, but rather the income increase. So, C: citizens felt underpaid before the announced taxes are the answer<n><n>Input The government has announced the increased sales taxes, but some of the public have complained that this is a bad idea because it increases the taxes on necessities, thus making it harder for households to pay their bills. Choices:  (a) The government has announced an increased sales tax, and some of the public complained

Choices:  A: compliments B: understand themselves C: life partner D: second chances E: larger house<n>Output:		1) The question refers to "get," so an answer option needs to involve obtaining an item.<n>2) The text refers to the idea of getting a second child, suggesting that once a person has more than one, they are unlikely to seek any further increase in the number.<n>3) A person isn't likely to get a smaller house or new cars or a different spouse after they have more kids.<n>4) So the only suitable option for the answer here is a life partner because it refers to an entirely different form of life and different relationship.<n>5) Choice B: understand themselves implies that the children would understand, not the person.<n>6) Choices C and D: second chance and larger house both refer to obtaining an additional thing, or gaining an additional material possession but do not refer to the second child.<n>7) Therefore, B: understand themselves is the correct answer.

Choices:  A: bee hive B: england C: castle D: deck of cards E: chess game<n>Output:		1. What is provided in the definition context is, that a queen is a female monarch that serves a king (or a country).<n>2.

However, a 'castles', a 'bee hive' and a 'chess game' might always have a queen, they just don't have it all the time.<n>4. Therefore, it is safe to eliminate the words castles and chess game.<n>5.

Choices:  A: swim B: jog C: excercise D: work out E: rock climb<n>Output:		1) The word'situation' is used, as it was asked how 'one' can get in shape despite there being no nearby land. This means that two people cannot be considered since there is just one person involved.<n>2) "if there is no land nearby" indicates that there was at least some land nearby to begin with.<n>3) "nearby" does not suggest that there is far away land nearby. Therefore, the distance is not that great, so no one will really be too concerned about it.<n>4) Given the distance is not great, it is likely that the distance is within a'short' distance, since this word is used when mentioning the distance.  This is why the answer is E: Rock Climb, since it suggests that one can still rock climb even if there is no land, such as cliffs.<n><n>Input: What is good about playing chess?

Choices:  A: deceptive B: altruistic C: stupid D: cruel E: agressive<n>Output:		The text suggests that the purposeful harm is done to others.<n>This is the first of the two possibilities.<n><n>Choice B makes sense, as there's nothing that suggests that "altruistic" is used in a negative sense, but in reality these people are intentionally targeting others, so B can be ignored.

Sometimes this makes it harder for them to be a good neighbor. One example of that are the children who once used to help clean up after a party who now don't bother.

However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:The person is laying on the beach, why would he do that? Choices:  A: sun himself B: thank god C: race against time D: express love E: to think about things.<n>Output:		1) In the given context, a person can only be laying on the beach to rest and sun him/herself or to do a task that needs to be done at a relaxed pace.<n>2) The choice, 'to do something', does not apply because the text does not give a specific activity.<n>3) According to the text, the person is supposed to be enjoying himself. To lay on the beach, he needs to 'think about things' so the answer is C: To Think About Things.<n><n>Input:The students made paper aeroplanes and the other kids did their best to take them down. Choices:  A. try their best B. do their best C. compete D. challenge E: succeed.<n>Output: Based on the instruction above, the answer is A: Compete, which refers to "doing everything in one's power to excel against rival(s)".<n><n>Input: It was at one of his last interviews with John's grandfather that Jack realized he wasn't so bad after all. Choices: A. In addition B. Although C. As a result D. Thus E. Hence.<n>Output: Answer Choice D seems to say that Jack's grandfather was "so good" originally, but he later realized "he wasn't so bad". In this case, the best answer seems to be answer Choice A, 'at one of his last interview', which means 'on one of his last visits'.<n><n>Input: John wanted to find a way to make the room feel smaller and was trying to think of ways to make it feel more spacious, so he left the door open to allow the air to circulate throughout the room. Choices: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z.<n>Output: The answer is J, because of a pun, a joke. If the door is open, the room will feel larger because there is an increase in the area it covers. This is a word-play of the name of the letter, which is 'z'. The answer is 'Z', which also happens to be the last letter because John leaves the door open, so it has a punny effect which makes the room seem bigger because he opens the door<n><n>* -------------------------------------**Input: I was in the middle of my

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness.

Choices:  A: being understood B: beer C: playing around D: hug E: visiting friends<n>Output:		<n>The choice is D: hug. In this context, a hug means "to embrace" as in giving or receiving a warm, affectionate embrace. Therefore, A, B, and C are all incorrect.<n>The choice is E: visiting friends. In this context, the use of the word "friends" implies they are friends that visit together; for example, the text mentions that friends come and go. Therefore, B and C are incorrect.<n>The choice E: having fun with their friends. In this context "having fun" means "acting or speaking to show that you are happy, excited, or satisfied because of something that is happening or has happened", which is in direct conflict with A and B. Therefore, they are incorrect.<n>The correct choice remains as D: hug.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question(s).<n><n>### 1. Input: You have a friend who is very out-of-shape.

Choices: 1 A: This is evidence of your friend's athletic abilities.<n>2 A: This is behavior that makes you want to laugh.<n>3 A: Your friend always gets tired first when training.<n>4 A: When you're not around, your friend gets more exercise.<n>5 A: When they see you coming, your friend can run quickly. Choice: 1<n>This explains that your friend's behavior stems from their desire to appear fit to you. They are running with all their might to get to class on time because they want to impress you, which is evidence of your friend’s athletic abilities Choice: 2<n>This explains that your friends running quickly to get to class is a behavior that makes you want laugh because it's absurd. Your friends behavior of running as fast as possible to get to class does not improve their fitness levels and is a behavior that makes want to laugh. Choice: 3<n>This explains that your fitness friend will always be tired first because their fitness condition is worse than their friends.<n>This explains that when you're not around your friend gets more exercise since they start running at full force when
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:The little girl was raised selfish, she didn't even care when she was doing what? Choices:  A: crack B: antipathy C: being mean D: disinterest E: unfeeling<n>Output:		1) The text states that the little girl was raised self-ish.<n>2)The text also states that while she is self-ish, she is not doing things for cruel purposes.<n>3) There are four things that the little girl is doing that are deemed 'naughty' by the author, but these are not related to cruelty.<n>4) The text only has the girl raised self-ishly as her only fault.<n>5) The author doesn't explain any particular character flaws she is lacking.<n>6)The text states that, the only 'fault' of the girl is that she is raised self-ishly, which might imply that she acts self-ishly<n>7) We cannot assume that the author has any other thoughts/beliefs that might be related in such a way as to suggest anything other than'selfishness' as the correct answer.<n>8) The correct answer is A: selfish<n><n>Input:He acted outrageously during his performance, scaring the audience into thinking it was an actual witchcraft.  Was it what? Choices:  1) A: hilarious  2) B: absurd  3) C: demented  4) D: ridiculous E: comedic<n>Output: 1- The first sentence describes the performance as outrageously funny.<n>2. The second sentence also describes the performance as funny by using the words 'ridiculous' and 'hilarious'.<n>3. The use of both 'outrageous' and 'outrageously' could suggest that performance is not just funny, but outrageously so.<n>4. The next two sentences describe the performance as being extremely 'funny'.<n>5. The last sentence describes the performance as 'ridiculous'.<n>6. We can assume that during the performance, the audience laughed because they were amused, but not so amused as to suggest that the performance was demented or absurd.<n> 7. The word 'demented' indicates complete mental illness.<n> 8. Absurd can be defined as 'not in accordance with reason or sound judgment; utterly silly'. However, in context, this seems to describe the audience rather than the performance.<n>9. 'Hilarious' is defined as'very funny or ludicrous'. This seems to be a better candidate
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3.

The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:What can happen to you when eating hamburger from someone that you do not know that does not happen when you usually eat a hamburger? Choices:  A: allergic reaction B: gain weight C: have fun D: heartburn E: food poisoning<n>Output:		1.) The first sentence of the question suggests that the text means for me to tell me what can happen when eating hamburgers that I typically don't.<n>2.) So while I typically eat burgers, I sometimes eat burgers from a stranger.<n>3.) Given the question and the meaning of the text, eating burgers from a stranger usually does not cause allergic reactions, gaining weight, having fun, heartburn, or food poisoning.<n>4.) However, it often does cause food poisoning.<n>5.) So the final answer must be E: food poisoning.<n><n>Input: You can go camping, hiking, play baseball, golf, or tennis. Choices:  A. playing a sport B. playing a game C. playing a sport D. playing a game E. playing sports<n>Output: 1) The first sentence of the text suggests that the question to me is 'What can you play or do while camping, hikikng, or playing sports?'<n>2) So the words 'play sports or any game' can be replaced with the word 'play sports or games' without changing the intended meaning of the text.<n>3) The intended meaning of the text is that you can only play a sport when camping, hikking, or playing sports.<n>4) Therefore, the final answer must be Choice B. You can play a sport when campig, hiking, or playing sports. You cannot play games while camping, hliking, or playing sports when camping or hiking or playing sports.<n><n>Input:The city has a plan to use a new sewer system, which is more efficient as well as less likely to damage the environment in any way. Choices:  * A: less damaging B: environmentally friendly C: more beneficial D: less environmentally damaging E: less damaging to the environment<n>Output: 1."The city has a plan for an efficient sewer system that is also beneficial."<n>2. E: less environmentally damaged (as one suggestion) is suggested by the sentence "The city has a plan using a new sewer system which is more efficient aswell as less likely to damage to the environment in any way."<n>3."However, the city has no plan to use a new efficient system which is also less damaging to the environmnet (as another suggestion)"
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:When they got out of the car in the mountains he felt like he was breathing fresh air for the first time, he began to do what to enjoy it more? Choices:  A: living B: feeling good C: hyperventilate D: look around E: breathe deeply<n>Output:		Since this is a multiple-choice question, we'll have to look at each choice in isolation to identify the correct answer, ignoring all other choices.<n>1. A: 'he felt like he was breath­ing fresh air for the firs­t time', suggests that he wasn't breathing fresh air before. It implies that he has previously had some respiratory ailment that prevents him from breathing fresh air.<n>2. B: 'he began to feel good' also says nothing about his previous condition so this one is also useless.<n>3. C: in the mountains, there is no oxygen, not even the fresh air. So, C is not the answer here.<n>4. Let's see what it says about D: 'he was doing something to enjoy it more'<n>5. D: 'look around' also says nothing about what he's doing. And, it's the last option available.<n>6. Since both look around and breathe deeply mean doing something it might be wrong.<n>7. E: 'breathe more deeply' is the only one that actually says what he was doing. Breathe more deeply - 'breathe' is the subject while the rest is the verb. So, the only answer that would pass that test is breathe more deeply. So the answer should be E: breathe more deeply <n><n>So the final answer will be E: breatne more deeply<n><n>Input: The best place to meet someone would be in a public place.<n>Output: Best place where and how would be a public place.<n><n>Input: She looked more pleased than ever before.<n>Output: She looked more pleased then what.<n><n>Input: Aaron is always polite with his students.<n>Output: Since it is negative, it should be Aaron is not always polite with his student.<n><n>Input: The door will close if the handle is on the other side.<n>Output: You need to say the door will close when the handle is on the opposite side.<n><n>Input: There is still much to be done.<n>Output: There is still a lot to be done.<n><n>Input: I am a student in college.<n>Output: I am a college student.<n><n>Input:"What does she keep in her purse besides makeup?"<n>Output: I think she would not have to keep makeup in her pur

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2.

Choices:  A: middle east B: palace C: dictionary D: pots E: apartment<n>Output:		1."Where would a ficus brighten up a room?" suggests that a ficus, or ficus tree, would decorate a room.<n>2. "middle east," "palace," "a dictionary," and "pots" are places.<n>3. The word "apartment" refers to a place to live.<n>4. "A: middle east" and "A: apartment" are therefore the correct answers.<n>So the final answers are a:middle east and b:apartment<n><n>Input: Which of these things has two legs? Choices: A: frog B: wolf C: man D: elephant E: horse<n>Output: The question "which of these things has two" suggests that one of these choices must have two.<n>The sentence "has two", as a whole, contains several subjects: "has" is not linked to any of the subjects "these things" - "these things" refers to "frog, wolf, man, elephant and horse"<n>We can extract four of the subjects (but not the sentence "has two")  "frog" and "wolf" have two each.<n>Therefore, "C:man" and "D:elephant" are correct answers because they both have two.<n><n>So the final answers is b:D:elephant<n><n>Input: What is the capital of Australia? Choices:  Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne, Brisbane, Tasmania<n>Output:  'What is the capital of Australia?' implies both that there is a capital of Australia, and that a capital of Australia can be one of the choices.<n>The choice "Sydney" means the answer is a noun, specifically, the name of an Australian city.<n>From the sentence "of Australia", it would appear we have the possibility of choosing the answer from the following:<n>    Sydney<n>    Canberra<n>    Melbourne<n>    Brisbane<n>    Tasmania<n><n>However, after choosing one of the nouns, we find that 'What the capital of Australia?' is still intact suggesting that the choice for the answer is incorrect.<n>This is, however, a trick question.<n>'What is the capital of Queensland?' is just a shorter way of asking us the same question.<n>Therefore, the correct answer is "Sydney".<n><n><n><n><n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:The other passengers on the bus were quite loud, so he put on his headphones to relax and what? Choices:  A: go to bed B: sleep C: listen to music D: stretch out E: stop worrying<n>Output:		The use of'relax' strongly suggests that there was tension surrounding the other passengers.<n>2. The rest of the text suggests that these passengers would have been loud enough to disturb anyone sitting on that bus.<n>3. The question is implying that these passengers were disrupting the placidity of the environment, whereas, the only way to combat this is to do something that distracts us from the disorder.<n>4. The idea of listening to music as a distraction implies that the cause of his tension was because of the noises from those disruptive passengers.<n>5. In the context of the question, sleep is not necessary to 'distract' or'relax'.<n>6. What is necessary in order for the person to'relax' is to 'go to bed' and the question directly asks us if the other passengers were loud enough to 'distract' to the point of 'going to bed' and, therefore, the correct answer is B: sleep. The missing element here is'sleep'.<n>

First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2.

Choices:  A: undestroyable B: unbreakable C: indestructible D: durable E: invisible<n>Output:		1: In modern times 'undestructable' is a hyperbole. It is common for movies to use hyperbole. It also seems odd in the context of a man causing accidents and in the presence of someone 'vulnerable' enough to attract his attention.<n>2: A similar hyperbole was used in previous part of the question: 'unbreakable' is a less common alternate term for indestructible, while 'invivible' is an actual state of being, although a little more vague. The same applies for the term 'unbendable'.<n>3. It might be argued that 'invisible' would be a more appropriate answer because it refers to being 'not detectable at first sight'. The intended meaning here is that this man believes it impossible to find a person as fragile as himself. But his intent is to make them detectable so they need to be 'detectable at first sight' to begin with.<n>4. 'undestructible' only connotes that person cannot be destroyed, not that they are impossible to detect. A 'indestructible' person would be impossible to detect because they are always present.<n>5. This person needs to be detectable to begin with so the question can be answered. They need to be detectible first and then unbreakable/undestructable would both satisfy the answer.<n><n>Given that the answer is both 'undestructable/indestructible', the final answer is D. D is the only answer that is both 'indestructible/undestructable' and does not conflict with any other answer.<n><n>Input:The best kind of friendship is the one that is like a what? Choices: A: cask B: box C: vat D: barrel E: vessel F: trunk<n>Output: 1 :In the text, a cask, trunk, or vessel has different meanings than in English vocabulary, so the choice of a cask is not the best kind of friendship.<n><n>2 : Since it is a box that contains a barrel of wine, you may infer that it is a container, and it is possible that it is a cask. However, these are only possibilities.<n><n>3: In Shakespeare's time, barrel was slang for 'love' hence the choice C is incorrect.<n><n>4 : The

Choices:  A: exercise B: moving forward C: feet D: blisters E: locomotion<n>Output:		1) The text initially speaks of shoes that are worn during walking all day, after which it speaks of "heels and toes" which are the two extremes of foot and the most likely place where blisters would be.<n>2) Exercise and moving forward are actions related to walking; they would more likely apply to the entire leg than to just "heels and to".<n>3) Similarly, blisters are unlikely to be located on just a section of the foot, if any of that foot is painful.  This suggests that locomotion is more accurate.<n>4) Hence D: locomotionis the correct answer.<n>So the final choice is D: locomotion<n>

Choices:  A: toy store B: story book C: great outdoors D: countryside E: wildlife refuge<n>Output:		1: the storybook choice suggests a fond memory when he called it a cow.<n>2: it was a fond memory when he was a small child, so the choices are A, B, and D.<n>3: A: toy store does not go well at all with the previous part.<n>4: B: story book is more related to a story that is not so common like in the great outdoors, or the countryside choices.<n>5: D: This indicates when he was a small, child, but it also indicates when the now defunct story book is also defunct.<n>6: the countryside choice is most related to it being defunct so therefor D is more likely the correct answer.<n>So the final choice is D: the countrysides.<n><n>Input: His grandmother, an outstanding woman in his early years, died at the age of ten while giving birth.  He was ten that year too. What? Chice: A: Did he survives? B: Is he surprised? C: did he get the baby? D: Does he regret? E: all of the above<n><n><n>Output 1: The text gives him some sort of connection to the event that happened when his grandma gave birth to a baby.<n> <n>2: The text then states that he was 10 with no specification of whether he was referring to this year or the year in which the event took place.<n> <n>3: The choices here are B and D. The text suggests that he should be surprised (which is more related to B), or regretful (which more related to D).<n> <n>4: Although one could make an argument that the text is not as specific in order to hint that the correct answer may be the one that's suggested by two choices, you could also make the argument that he is either surprised because he survived or regretting because he didn't.<n> 5: Therefore, the choices do not necessarily contradict each other, but the choice is not specified enough to suggest that either one is correct.<n><n><n>6: Therefore, the correct choice is C: (D)<n><n><n><n>7: The correct choice is A which indicates that it was the year in which his mother died that they were both ten.<n><n><n><n><n><n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:Having a car in the city seemed to be more trouble than it was worth, the man still had to walk to and from the what after commuting? Choices:  A: driveway B: the event C: scrap heap D: parking garage E: repair shop<n>Output:		1.) Since he wanted to do away with the car, the final paragraph of the story would have been pointless.<n><n>2.) The writer, therefore, should have omitted 'the man still had to walk...'. We can safely assume that there were no walks after the commute, because the man only wanted the car in the city.<n>3.) However, he could have either driven the car off to a'repair shop' or'scrapped' the car, which is what we can assume.<n><n>4.) Based on these statements, there were two possibilities: that he drove the car to a repair shop, or that he threw it on the scrap pile.<n>5.) Therefore, it was only fair to assume that he was dealing with the car.<n><n>6.) From the above logic, D: 'the repair shop' fits better as we know that he drove the car off on his commute. Now, having sold/thrown the car away, he needed to be driven to and from the'repair shop'<n><n>7.) Therefore, the correct answer is D: the repair shop. The man had probably gone there in his car. The author just wasn't clear.<n><n>#### Instruction:Read the following passage carefully to answer the questions.<n><n>A man who had moved from England, and being about 40 years of age, came to a small village where the people attended church, and worshiped on Sundays.<n><n>### When Sunday came around, he went his way and stopped at a farm house. His appearance was not at all remarkable. He was tall, but not unusually so; was well dressed, but not particularly so; had a gentle voice and manner. All this was well enough, but he was a Methodist. It did not take long for the truth to be discovered, they did not believe in Methodist preachers. The man's visit soon came to an end, he was asked to come no more.<n><n>### This he thought was very strange. These people had come to church, and heard something he could not believe. One day some of them invited him to come and see their fine cows, and pondered over. This he did, and after visiting with them a little while, he was asked if he had ever heard of a Methodist minister. The man replied that he had often heard that they were a sort of mankind, not much

He lived with his children<n>2: The choice of living at home can be associated with a feeling of inadequacy and lack of mood and energy, among other things, as he is now a senior<n>3: He didn't want to live with Republicans. It could mean he doesn't want to live at a Republican home (e.g., old people's home). However, choosing 'old people's home' might have a negative connotation.<n>4: If he lived at a Republican organization, that doesn't mean he was a Republican per se.<n>5: Perhaps he didn't want social outings, either because he liked the privacy of his home or didn't have energy enough to go out.<n>6: He didn't go to the park because he would have had to see the people there whom he wanted to avoid.<n>7: He wasn't going to old people's home because he was not a senior citizen (so he didn't need help to take care of him).<n>8: Perhaps he still had energy for college or high school.<n>9: The question is asking if he wanted to go where other people live. It can be interpreted to mean that he was worried about being a burden, but the question only says "didn't want to go" and no mention of being a burden to people.<n>10: Therefore, the only other option that makes sense is "to an office", assuming that that is to go live in an office.<n>So the final choice is "to an office."<n>

Choices A: From the grocery store B: From the hatchery C: From the chicken D: From the mall E: From the store<n>The Output: I am not sure what type of question this is. The question does list "third world countries" as a reference, so perhaps the question wants to say "Third world countries don't ask why are my socks from a mall" but then the text says don't ask where eggs come from; So I am wondering why the author is being negative towards "egg" in the question (if asking where socks come from isn't negative).<n><n>So the final based upon only this paragraph<n>

Choices:  A: make B: raise C: entice D: build E: fix<n>Output:		First, the question suggests the old barn was in a state of complete disrepair.<n>2. Given this context, they couldn't'make' a new one because the old one had already been destroyed.<n>3. They couldn't have 'raised' a new one either as this would imply a new, unspoiled building.<n>4. They couldn't 'entice' a new one because that would require an entirely new structure built from scratch.<n>5. The question doesn't suggest they could have 'built' a new one from scratch, so this option is also not valid.<n>6. The only option left is that they could have 'fixed' or renovated the old one, which is the exact thing they ended up doing.<n>So the final sentence has the answer: they could have Fixed, rather than making, building, or rebuilding a new barn.<n><n>Input:The doctor told Bill to do what before taking any medication?

Given the context, the couple wasn't really interested in taking their seats on the shuttle at any point.<n>3. The word 'comfort' however suggests their need was to rest their weary legs, which would require beds, not seats.<n>4. 'Needing' comfort before taking their seats would suggest that they needed to settle into their seats, which is inconsistent with the text.<n>5. Finally, they didn't need to check themselves before taking their seats, as this would be unnecessary since they were not passengers on a plane. <n>6. Therefore, they were simply 'needing' some rest before they took their seats on the shutter.<n>So here the answer is they needed rest (sleep)<n><n>Input: The new restaurant's menu featured many unusual choices to appeal to customers of what?

There is a 'back' mentioned, so the answer would be C) Go back to Work, but it is B) Eat.<n>It does not matter what the subject did before-eating/dinner or went back to work. All that is important is that there is a 'back' and if we know that the answer does not involve work, then that leaves 'what' so then the correct answer is 'B) Eat'<n>The answer is 'B) eat'.<n>The 'back' refers to what a person does, not where they go, so if the subject wants to eat dinner, they need to go back to home.<n><n>Input: The woman could have stopped the attacker, though she did nothing to help the victim.

Instead, she hid under the stairs in the ground floor of the building, where nobody was allowed. The ground floor is the most common floor to have people hiding there but the other options are not more/less likely to be the place of hiding the woman. The stair could be a better hiding place than any other floor of the building but the woman did nothing in the least to help the victim by staying on the ground floor and hinders him. It is most likely that the woman hid under the stairs of the ground floor. She hided where nobody else could get her and she knew nobody would bother her there. She could have stopped the assaulter and she could not. When she hid she didn't stop the attack, she didn't even fight to protect the other woman. This means the ground floor was the
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:What would you do if you have curiosity about something but cannot leave your house?

Choices:  ballroom (a) dance (b) ball (c) room (d) dance (e) ball (f) room (g) dance<n>Output: 1.) ballroom dance and ballroom dancer are not synonymous.<n>2.) We may use a noun with a function suffix (e.g. a verbal noun such as dances), or a function adjective.<n>3.) A synonym is a word with a different form but the same meaning, as indicated at the bottom of this page (http://www.dictionary.com/browse/synonym?s=t)<n>Example 1 - ballroom dance. A social dance that you can... ballroom dance. Example 2 - social dance. Any dance that is performed... social dance. Example 3 - ball dance. A ballroom dance is done... ball dance.<n><n>4.) In this sentence, we would use a noun + function suffix (e.s. a verbal nounce, or a function adjective)<n>5.) Therefore, the best choice would be to go with the noun dance.<n><n>Input: A group of doctors are preparing the final diagnosis of a patient.

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:HOw do you carry potatos home? Choices:  A: grocery store B: grocery bag C: restaurants D: farmer's market E: bushel basket<n>Output:		 The question suggests that you must carry potatoes home in a way to avoid spillage and spoilage.<n>2. The context of the question supports a method of carrying potatoes home that minimizes spillage and spoiling.<n>3. We can eliminate A: grocery STORE because it's an unrelated object.  It indicates that you purchase potatoes in a grocery store, which is irrelevant to the question.<n>4. We can eliminate B: grocery BAG because it suggests the opposite.  You can carry potatoes home in your grocery bag without risking spillage or spoilage, which is in opposition to the question.  Therefore, carrying potatoes home in a grocery bag is incorrect.<n>5. We can eliminate C: RESTAURANTS because having potatoes ready to serve when you're at a restaurant would also cause spillage, which has already been indicated as the answer to the question so far.<n>6. We can eliminate D: FARMER'S MARKET because potatoes, even though they may be grown by farmers, must obviously be brought home by grocery store customers. They must be transported after all.<n>7. We can eliminate E: BUSHEL BASKET because it's not a grocery store customer but a farmer.  Furthermore, a farmer is unlikely to be carrying a farmer's vegetables from the grocery store to a restaurant! This is a non sequitir.<n>8. The farmer would be much more likely to be carrying farmer's vegetable or some similar item. We've concluded that the farmer is unlikely to carry potatoes.<n>9. We must therefore be a grocery customer (customer at a grocery store) and not likely to be a farmer who is carrying potatoes.<n>10. Therefore, the optimal answer is E: BUSHHLE BASKET.<n>So the final, most logical answer is E: bushel basket.
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:Where do almost all people live? Choices:  A: football stadium B: apartment C: surface of earth D: car show E: house<n>Output:		A.  The options for where people live span quite the spectrum.<n>1. There are options for places to live in a stadium; on the surface of the earth; in an apartment; or in a car show as people live in very different settings. <n>2. However, it appears that almost all people live "on the surface of the earth", as the question says "almost all people live" where it is assumed that "almost all people" live on the earth, not in a stadium, in a car show, or in an apartment.<n>3. Additionally, where people generally choose to live on the earth seems to matter less, in the context of the question, than where all people generally live. <n>4. Therefore, "the surface of earth" is the only answer choice that logically "tightens the sentence" to match the statement "Where do almost all people.<n>5. So, the final answer is A, the options for places to live spanning quite the spectrum<n><n>Input:She made a big fuss over nothing. Choices:  A. a big fuss. B. Nothing. C. over the place D. <n>the entire place to fuss E. over the fuss<n>Output:E. Over the fuss. <n>1. The original statement can also be paraphrased into the question. To paraphrase the original statement is to "tighten", or reword, the sentence using only words that appear in the sentence.<n>2. The question asks what made the fuss, not what was said during the fuss.<n>3. That is, the question asked "Over the fuss" and not the more specific words spoken during the fuss.  That means the fuss is the subject of the question, and therefore needs to only be referenced in the question using the subject pronoun "Over". <n>4. The first four options are all nouns; this means they are ungrammatical.  "A big fuss. B Nothing. C. over <n>the place D.  the entire place to fuss" are all adjectives (nouns or adjectives) are ungrammatical in the given question, which asks to identify a verb in the sentence.<n>5. The final option, "Over the fuss", is the verb.  She made a big fuss; over the fuss is

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:What is another term for instituting civil action? Choices:  A: confusion B: complications C: riot D: arrest E: protests<n>Output:		1.'Civil' and 'Civil Action' as nouns both refer to people suing each other. In other words, civil refers to 'legal/judicial action'.<n>2. 'Civil Action Instituting' is a sentence that is quite confusing, but can be rearranged to'Instituting Civil Action '. However, this sentence doesn't make sense, and so none of the other options are correct.<n>3. 'Civil Actions Instituting' is also a sentence that is quite difficult to parse, but can be combined to give 'Instituting Civil Action'. In this case, 'Instituting' has been used as a'verbal' noun (meaning an 'action', in this case). The overall meaning is quite similar, but the sentence does not follow the same format as the others.<n>4. 'Institute Civil Actions' is a phrase that can be used as a command (like 'Please don't eat the donuts') or as an expression of intent ('I intend to see you next week'). Therefore, it is not technically 'another phrase for instituting civil actions'.<n>5. 'I don't institute any actions' doesn't make semantic or logical sense.<n>6. 'Instituting Civil Actions' is perhaps the only option that is meaningfully in the same vein as 'civil action instituting', although 'instituting' is not used as a'verb' in the way that it can be in this sentence.<n><n>So the correct answer is E: protests.<n><n>Input:Which of the following is not a part of the periodic table of elements?  Choices:  A) Aluminum B) Radon C) Bromine D) Iodine<n>Output: 1'Aluminum' and 'Iodine' refer to different elements, so it is not aluminuim or iodine which is not part of the periodic table.<n>2. 'Bromine' is a 'periodic table element' but 'Bromine' does not refer to 'Bromine', which refers to a 'Bromine compound/ion' and so 'Bromine' makes semantic sense here, so the answer is C) Bromine.<n>3. 'Iodine' and 'Radon' are the only two answers which can be used to fulfill the condition in

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3.

The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:Where would I put a rosebush if I did not have any containers to store it in? Choices:  A: flower garden B: garden center C: pot D: pot E: formal garden<n>Output:		1 & 2. This question requires the reader to be able to interpret the narrator's intended meaning in the story as represented by the options<n>3. Given the context of growing a rose, the reader might decide that the text itself does not contain the word 'rosebush',  so this answer choice is not correct.<n>4. In addition, the question does not give enough information to determine which answer choice is correct.<n>5. However, it can be inferred that given the garden center, the intended meaning is the rosebush would be placed in the garden center.  This information can be used to identify an answer choice.<n>6. It can be concluded that the answer choice C: pot is the correct answer.<n>So the final Answer is C: Pot.<n><n>### Instruction:The text describes a scenario in which the following statements are made:<n><n>In any one year, almost two hundred thousand children under two are hospitalized for injury and, at least three times that number in their first year, are severely injured because of falls. These accidents can lead to permanent disability and death.<n>Everyday, about a hundred children die in car accidents. Three quarters of them are riding in cars driven by their parents.<n>More deaths occur every year in childrens' bedrooms than in any other place in the house except the bathroom.<n>Many furniture injuries happen during sleep. Children should be watched while putting themselves to bed and put on a night garment. Clothes should be made long enough to cover little toes and fingers. Clothes pins, small objects in shoes or pockets and pins on rugs should be removed at night to avoid traumatic tissue penetrations.<n>Input: Input these statements in order one after another.

However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:Bob needs a level to hang a shelf but cant find one in his home. Where would he go to get one? Choices:  A: glass of water B: build evenly C: garage D: carpenter's shop E: video game<n>Output:		Because Bob is using an indeterminate modifier, Bob needs a level to find a level is nonsensical. It seems obvious that he has not found a level yet, so he will go somewhere to find a level.<n>This sentence could be written more succinctly as "Bob needs to go somewhere else to find a level".<n>So the final answer D: somewhere else

Choices:  A: next to the house B: keeping things in C: backyard D: farm yard E: ranch<n>Output:		1: The question asks us to determine the best location to put a shed. The wording of the question suggests that this would be a suitable location for the shed.<n>2. 'Backyard' is implied by the wording of the question but this isn't as relevant of an answer.<n>3. The words in A and C have similar meaning but 'house' could potentially refer to the house that would be built around the shed.<n>4. All other choices are irrelevant.<n>5. So the final answer is A: next to the shed. This is the closest to the actual meaning of the statement.<n>

Choices: 1. The person is alive. 2. It is true that the person is alive. 3. It is true that I think the person is alive.<n>Output: We are looking for a word or phrase that will convey the fact that the person is alive in clear terms.<n>1. The word 'alive' can be misleading as it can be interpreted to mean that the person has experienced life and is now dead.<n>2. The first choice doesn't offer as much clarity as the others since it doesn't state that the person is only alive, that it doesn't refer to the person in the past tense, or that it has a questionable meaning.<n>3. The second choice uses the phrase 'it is true that I think' so there isn't any denial of the person being alive. This allows the listener to easily understand that the person is in fact alive.<n>4. However the last two choices don't convey that the person is breathing and we need to ensure that the person is not a robot or a zombie.<n>5. This leads to the conclusion that the correct answer is the second choice which simply states, 'it is true that the person lives' with no implication that the person lives in the past.

Choices:  A: school B: large home C: house D: hat rack E: closet<n>Output:		<n><n>1. The question requires us to identify the kind of head wear that can be kept in the entrance hall of a home.<n>2. There is no suggestion that that kind of headwear could be stored anywhere other than in the entrance hall of the home.<n>3. The context of the entrance hall and the kind of head wear implies that it could be kept in the closet, which is the first answer. Therefore, the correct answer is E: closet<n><n>Input:This is how a lot of the worlds great ideas are born.

The question is not referring to the idea of the idea in general but the title itself. Based on this reasoning, I would take the title to be a verb, not a noun.<n>Since this information is not explicitly given to us, I would also classify this as a form of "inference", not logical deduction.<n>I have two choices, neither of which is grammatical, so I am going to ignore those: A: 'impossible, dreams, and unknowable, all begin with the word...'" B: "...all begin with "IMPOSSIBLE".<n>The remaining choices are all forms of logical deduction except E. The others are all forms of logic, but there appears to be inconsistencies, particularly with E.<n>For example: In choice "start with the word...", the capital "I" in impossible looks like the beginning of a capital-lettered sentence, but in "impossible, dreams...", the capital "i" looks like it is a part of the text rather than the beginning of a sentence.<n>In general, these are similar to the logical deduction test, but I am not certain.<n>Having looked at the rest of the data,<n>I believe E (the wrong answer) has an example of logical inference, whereas other answers do not.<n>1. A: impossible + dreams is logically inferred from D: "impossible".<n>2. B: "unknowable" is logically inferred based on the logic.<n>I think that E was chosen as a

Her patient might not be what? Choices:  A: istanbul B: animal C: antique shop D: human being E: bedroom<n>Output:		1- The first thing mentioned is Sarah opened his chest.<n>2- It is not mentioned that she found a second human heart, but she found a second something that would be found in the chest or abdomen- a human heart.<n>3- Sarah found a second heart. Human being is unlikely to refer to a heart that can be found in an abdomen of a human being and Antique shop also, in which case I'll argue is not the correct match for this because although the words have the same root, they differ in meaning.<n>4- I'd argue the correct answer is D: human being because although it's unlikely the patient was an unusual type of human being, e.g. an alien, there was every possibility that the second heart was human.<n><n>Input: They had two children. One was stillborn.  They didn't name the other.  It might be called what? Choices: A: Cutty Wahoo B: Dickinson Chunk C: John Thomas D: Owens E: Thomasina<n>Output: 1 This question seems to be implying that the other child was named using its first and middle name, e.g John, Thomas, which isn't very unusual.<n>2. The missing element here is the family didn't name the child.<n>3- However, the text suggest names were chosen for the other two children. <n>4- From this context, the missing part of the story is how it's likely that the other child was given something unusual for a middle name, e. g Owens.  Owens isn't so rare a name, and it could just be an unusual name for a middle name, but in this case, and with the context given, it's likely that if the other child got a middle name, it was likely to be unusual compared to the first and middle name of the other child.  Consequently, the correct answer is B:Dickinson Chunk<n><n>Input: When his wife told him he had a child, he said it already had what? Choices: (A) a name B) two names (C) a brother (D) a sister (E) a mother<n>Output: 1 - This isn't a standard question as a name isn't missing.<n>2. - It seems obvious to me that John would say, "I already have a child."

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:Where do I put my coffee mug after it's dry?

Choices: 	A: Sure B: Sure  C: Not Certain D: Nope E: Sure and Sure<n>Output:Given the context of this question, the 'yes' and 'no' answers are incorrect because they are negative, and both A: Sure and B: Sure are positive. Also, the 'yes' does not convey an uncertainty or confidence, but the 'no' does. So the answers C: Not Certain and E: Sure and Sure are negative and convey ambiguity, which is not what the question calls for.<n><n>Input:What's the difference between a zebra and a lion? Choices:  a: Nothing.<n>b: Very little.<n>c: A tail.<n>d: A long, black stripe.<n>e: A long, black body.<n>Output:Given  that the question asks for just the difference between a zerba and a lion, then the choices with the long body are incorrect. The difference is that a lion has a long tail and a black stripe. So the answer is e: A long, black Body. Given  that the question asks "What's the difference," there will be a difference between the zebra and the lion. However, a zebra does not have a body. So, the answer is that A: There is Nothing. However, that is not what the question was asking. So the answer is D: A long, black  striped  tail.<n><n>Input:Should we go out to dinner?

To know for certain, you would have ask them if they really want to go out to dinner. The choice that could be considered irrelevant is No. You could know that the person asked can't go or doesn't like to go out to dinner or is too tired to go. But, if you

The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:John is a human who is in a wheelchair due to an accident.  Where would he go to get to the third floor of his apartment building? Choices:  A: space shuttle B: detroit C: stairs D: downtown E: elevator<n>Output:		1. The question assumes that John lives in a building with three floors but does not state this explicitly.<n>2. There is only one way to safely get to the third floor: the elevator.<n>3. John is incapable of walking to the third floor, so going through the elevator is his only option.<n>4. He does not have a way to go "to the detroit".<n>5. There are no such things as "a stair" or "a space shuttle". (Detroit is a city in Michigan)<n>6. So A: space shuttles, B: Detroit, C: stairs, and D: downtown are impossible answers.<n>7. Option E is the correct answer.<n>8. The missing element in the question is John's lack of independence: he must go to the elevator because he cannot otherwise get there.<n>So the final answers is E: elevator<n><n>Input:John always wears a shirt, tie, and slacks to work because he is from the 1950s.

Output: 1: 1. Although John likes the 1955 clothing he wears each day, money was still scarce back then, and he couldn't waste a dollar on such things as a quarter for the vending machine or a dime.<n>2: 2. Since he doesn't have cash, getting change for a dollar would be impossible.<n>3: 3. John doesn't have any money, so going to the bank would not change this.<n>4. Since John doesn't have a dollar, he couldn't get change for a quarter, a dime, or a nickel. Since he doesn' t have a dollar, these would all be impossible.<n>5

Choices:  A: front door B: newspaper C: post office D: package E: mail box<n>Output:		1) One might find theirs open is because they suspect someone stole the package while being delivered by the postal service to their home.<n>2) The letters that had been delivered refers to the documents that were stolen once the package has arrived at the home of the recipient.<n>3) In short, One might find theirs in such situation.<n>4) Open, however implies that the door was left open not the package.<n>5) Package in this context refers to the parcel delivered to someone's home.<n>6) Thusly, the answer can be seen as 'A:front door'. The answer can be seen as the home was left open with the stolen parcel laying outside. The missing element is the phrase 'open' in this context. Which means, it implies the package was unlocked. The missing element in this text is the phrase'open'. The answer can be seen by the phrase 'One might find their home open'.<n><n>Input: His words and actions suggest to me he wants to do something different. Choices: 1. A: take over 2.

Choices:  A: school building B: skyscraper C: business D: grocery store. E: work<n>Output:		This is a tough question, but the answer is really that the offices are located in a building.  Schools obviously don't have offices. The buildings we are talking about are what we call skyscrapers, which are the most common type of building where offices are often located.  This can also be a grocery store if it is really high and wide like some buildings.  However, because the text talks about offices specifically, we'll have to rule out grocery stores.  Furthermore, businesses are often located in buildings as well, but are not always located in buildings.<n>So the final choice is C: business

Choices:  A: love B: zoo C: school D: space shuttle E: library<n>Output:		James is very interested in other planet's and dreams of going to Mars. James also loves books about other planets and reads them all the time.<n>In this context, the thing that James loves more than anything else is love.  It makes sense that James loves other planets as they are out of reach, and like to dream and read books about them. It is not necessarily out of reach for James to love things about Earth.  He also doesn't read books for love.<n>It is also not likely that James would want to go to school, go on a space shuttle, or read books at a library.<n>For these reasons, A isn't the correct answer.<n><n>Input: I love chocolate.  When I was younger I often thought about what flavor it would be like to have what?

I would love to try chocolate cake and ice cream.<n>The question states that I like chocolate and that I thought about what flavor would be like to eat various other things.  At this point in the context, I have stated that although I wish to try the foods mentioned in the question, I have not tried them. The reason I enjoyed thinking about the foods is because I love chocolate, and would like to have ice cream or cakes. The person doesn't like all types of food. I wouldn't like milk nor pudding either, but have thought about how nice the foods would be to eat.<n>Therefore, C: big bar isn't the answer. I don't eat bars all that often. The person does want to eat ice cream so this could be one answer.<n><n>Input:(2) She often feels that she must live according to the way she thinks she should.

It does not refer to anything specifically related to bars, cafes, news, or internet sites.<n>3. A 'large menu' is a long list with many items on it.  Such a list implies that there are many options available.<n>4. There are multiple references to large menus, indicating that James had to look through a large number of options to find information about buying bitcoins.<n>5. Thus, the right answer must be a noun referring to information related to a large number of options.<n>6. Only D: menu satisfies these criteria.

Choices:  A: erections B: entertainment C: boredom D: get fat E: sadness<n>Output:		Due to the ambiguity in the word 'get' and the general grammatical structure of the sentence, this cannot be answered definitively.<n>The usage of the phrase'get from this' gives us no context to interpret the sentence as 'to do well in class' or 'to enjoy a meal'.

"He found the blowfish" suggests something was found and therefore the answer should start with a noun.<n>2. He found "the" blowfish" suggests a singular blowfish.<n>3. In this context blowfish is a common idiom used when referring to something very easy or simple to obtain, but the blowfish was not referred to using the word "it".<n>4.

'Ohio' would be an unlikely location to contain a large village as the state is large in area with cities spread out over.<n>5: This eliminates answer choice E: countrysides.<n>6: This leaves us with answer choice: B: big city.<n>The location most likely to contain a big city would be: an urban center, or a 'big city' as defined in the question.<n>This would be answer choice: B: Big City.<n>So the final question answer is B: Big City<n><n>Input: I'm so cold my ears are frozen.

Choices:  a. 20 b. 40 c. 50 d. 60<n>Output: The sentence contains the information "There are nearly sixty bicycles in the school bicycle shed."

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:George ruined the surprise.  How did he do so? Choices:  A: hiding B: accidentally C: expectation D: knowingly E: planned<n>Output:		A: George ruined the surprise by hiding.  The context suggests that when it came to the surprise itself, George was 'ruining' it. This implies that he was in some way damaging or harming it.  In a surprise, people are typically hiding something, so 'hiding' the most likely cause of damage.<n>The word 'ruining' indicates that George had some intent (or at least forethought) towards harming the surprise.  If he had 'hurried' or left the surprise out in the open, it wouldn't have been ruined, instead it would still be a surprise, but not a ruined one.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the questions based on the following scenario.<n>A group of workers were asked to compile a report. They agreed to send someone from their group to complete the report without any additional payment as agreed. However, on the day when one was set to be selected by drawing of lots, they found out that one of the workers had misplaced his lottery ticket, so the selection of the most deserving worker to be put in charge was cancelled. The leader of the group expressed his disappointment in the misplaced lottery ticket by claiming that those workers are not fit to work, and hence they should leave. How did the leader choose who was most likely to be able to complete the report? Choices: 1. A: He took only the people that had already completed the report. 2. B: He took into account the age of the workers. 3. C: He took into account how responsible the workers were. 4. D: He took only the workers who were young, energetic & hardworking. 5. E: None of the above.<n>Output: 1st Answer: 'deserving' implies that those who are 'deserving' will take the most effort and time. The person whose lottery ticket was misplaced had also expressed his disappointment in not being given the responsibility. So, 'deserving' workers are the people who will take the most responsibility. Because the lottery ticket was mislaid, the leader expected those who took upon themselves the biggest responsibility to be the most deserving.<n>2nd Answer: The leader did not choose who was most likely fit to complete the report. He cancelled the selection of more 'deserving' or capable people, because of one's minor mistake, leaving those

Choices:  A: body of water B: lake superior C: underwater D: toilet E: aquarium<n>Output:		First, given the lack of context, there is no clear answer to this question.<n>2. However, this is the section of the book that deals with the subject of fish.<n>3. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that this question refers to "toilet" since the term "majority" suggests a greater number in that category than the other options mentioned.<n>4. As a result, the final answer for this question is D: Toilet.<n><n>Input:It is quite possible that the doctor will forget about my appointment, so I must be sure to call him soon. Choices:  A B C D E<n>Output:The first choice, that "it is quite possible," suggests that there is not only a risk of the doctor forgetting about the appointment, but also a high probability of it occurring.<n>2. The remaining choices all suggest a much more positive interpretation of the situation.<n>3. As such, D: unlikely is the most accurate interpretation of the text. The correct answer is, therefore, unlikely.<n><n>So the final answer for all the questions is unlikely<n><n>#! /bin/bash<n><n>#! /usr/bin/python3.8<n><n><n><n><n>#! /opt/anaconda3/bin/python<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the next multiple choice question.<n>#! /usrbin/python3.6<n><n><n>#!python3<n><n>#! /home/code/python307/code/python2572.py<n><n>Input: Do you see the doctor for the examination next week? Choices: 1: Yes 2: No 3: Yes, and I'm nervous 4: No, and I'm confused<n>Output:First, the context within which this question appears is clear. The speaker has already been scheduled for an examination with a doctor.<n>2. The first choice, "yes," is a neutral response that simply confirms the fact that he will "see" the doctor.<n>3. Similarly, the third choice assumes an answer of "no" and uses the word "nervous" to convey its response.<n>4. Finally, the fourth choice assumes an answer of “no” and uses the word “confused” as its response.<n>5. Therefore, the final answer is that the speaker "will see" the doctor "for an exam" the next week.

First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5.

Choices:  A: make friends B: mingle C: meet people D: small talk E: meet new people<n>Output:		The text suggests that meeting new people is called'small talk' as it does not take much time to have these conversations.

Choices:  A: curiosity B: excitement C: boredom D: wonder E: fear<n>Output:		1: The question suggests that the person seeing new things is feeling one of the five emotions given as choices, curiosity, excitement, boredom, wonder or fear.<n>2: Since the question states the person is seeing new things but gives emotions which are also new, we'll say that they do not only see new things, but feel new things or have a newfound feeling.<n>3: The text states that the feeling is something a person most often feels so we will look for an answer that can be commonly felt.<n>4: Emotions like curiosity, excitement or boredom are not new experiences, but more like ongoing feelings. We must look instead for something that isn't commonly felt but is a direct result of a new experience.<n>5: Since the new experience is seeing new things, a newfound feeling that would come from that is wonder (or awe).<n>6: Thus, since curiosity, excitement, boring or wonder are not feelings and are more like experiences, the answer would be, D: wonder.

The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer.

Choices:  A: friendship B: aggression C: defeat D: winning or losing E: sweat<n>Output:		1.'Competing against one another' implies having a competitive spirit which is a good description of love.<n>2. 'It was a good way to win' is a statement of benefit which implies loving the game, not the rivalry.<n>3. 'Work their friendship' doesn't work grammatically.<n>4. 'To work their defeat' implies a negative sentiment which is obviously untrue in the context.<n>5. The phrase 'Work their sweat' is nonsensical.<n>6. Therefore A: friendship is the correct answer. It was a good way to love each other.<n>So the final question is also A: friendship.<n><n><n><n>### Extra bonus Instruction: Answer the following sentence completion question based on the previous instructions.<n><n>The fact that Tom enjoyed beating _________ on the tennis court with his friend was a good way of getting into shape.<n><n><n>

Choices:  A: hunt B: pay merchants with money C: mail orders D: spend money E: demand satisfaction<n>Output:		1 and 2. The text suggests that the customers do all of these things (they are not mutually exclusive).<n>3. The verb 'hunt' suggests the customers look for objects they desire.  This meaning of the verb implies they will need to know the store name as well as other information to identify their desired objects.  These are all part of the store process.<n>4. 'Mail orders' suggests that there is a process customers go through that begins outside the store and may continue after leaving. Therefore not all the actions occur within the store.  This means that customers don't just spend money in the store and leave.<n>5. 'demand satisfaction' suggests the customers are dissatisfied and request some action. This implies that they are unhappy with something in the store such as their time with the salesperson. It does not imply they have no money or that they are demanding anything beyond their right of action. <n>6. Considering these interpretations, the final answer is D.<n><n>Input:I can't speak for Henry Darrow, but I can certainly speak for myself.  I feel quite certain that I don't speak for him.

An alternate word would be'say'.<n>4 - 'for Henry' is not necessary.  The pronoun should be'myself'.<n>5 - The author uses the wrong form of 'can'.  She should use 'can not'.<n>6 - The author is speaking only for herself with 'for myself'.<n>7 - This sentence says that she is not certain that she is speaking for Henry Darrow.<n>8 - In the original sentence,'myself' is a dangling preposition.  I don't know what Henry Darrow could say or do.<n>9 - The correct form of 'I don't know' is 'I dont know'.<n>10 -'speak' should be'say'.<n>11 - The author does not address what was said.<n>12 - The answer is C: 'for myself'.<n><n>Input:I told my wife I thought we were being watched by a

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:Who sits at the center table at a receeption? Choices:  A: restorand B: wedding party C: church basement D: corridor E: restaurant<n>Output:		I answered: Restorand as in A and B. Is this an error of choice or something else?<n><n>Output: The options given do not contain any wrong words. Restorand is accepted as a word in Merriam-Webster Dictionary while the others do not.<n>However, the word reception refers to party or an event that is a ceremony to mark a celebration. So a restaurant/ a church basement/ a corridor/ or a wedding party are in fact not the appropriate word to use in this context. Thus, all the given options are correct.  Therefore, the answer is none of them.<n><n><n>Input: He doesn't even notice when he has made a grammatical error. Choices:  A. incorrect B. incorrect C. not wrong D. non incorrect E. flawless <n>Output: He always makes the sentence, "There's a lot of room in here."<n><n>

The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:What is KFC who serves chicken? Choices:  A: fast food restaurant B: plate C: bowl D: freezer E: oven<n>Output:		1. The question is asking us to identify which one of the statements A to E is false.<n>2. The sentences themselves suggest that KFC serves food, not just chicken.<n>3. So, it is not an accurate statement to call KFC a 'fast food restaurant'. Therefore, the correct option would be C: plate<n>4. Thus, C: plate is the correct answer. KFC is a specialty store and does not serve chicken as mentioned in the incorrect statement, 'KFC who serves chickens'.<n>So the final answer should be C: plate.<n><n>

The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:What prevents someone from getting sleep at night? Choices:  A: relax B: dreams C: have nightmares D: restlessness E: snore<n>Output:		1: The fact that sleep is not achieved when someone is restless or cannot quiet his mind.<n>2: the text hints that having trouble sleeping does not necessarily mean experiencing restlessness or dreams.<n>3: Relax (relaxing and relaxation ) appears multiple times in the text which suggests that it plays a major role in the context.<n>4: Restlessness only appears once, and dreaming appears twice, whereas Snore and having nightmares appear thrice respectively, so it's safe to exclude them.<n>5: The first mention of dreaming can be seen alongside the word'restless'.<n>6: After some thought, relaxation may be assumed to be at the root of the cause of sleeplessness.<n>7: Based on the context, it is safe to conclude that the correct answer must be relaxation.  Therefore, the final answer is D.relaxation.<n><n><n>Input:When the earthquake caused the building to tip, I thought that we were doomed.  It wasn't until the building swayed back and forth that I realized some of the people had saved themselves by jumping to the ground.<n>Output: 1) The people were supposed to be saved by jumping to the grounds.<n>2) The question suggests jumping to the ground was not a viable option given the situation. It's clearly the correct answer and not the jumpers.<n>3) The context seems to indicate that, before the building moved, everyone thought the building was still safe.<n>4) Therefore, everyone was prepared to jump out of the building.<n>5) I.e. jumpers. So the answer must be jumpers<n><n>Input:The first time I saw this movie, I was afraid.  It was my favorite movie, and so far it had been the most realistic depiction in the media of how a zombie apocalypse would go down.  The second time, however, I was not afraid.<n>Output:  The first movie scared the living daylights out of you and the second time watching the same movie is still terrifying.<n><n>Input:John said so to me during our chat.<n>Output: 2.

He did so because he was feeling what? Choices:  A: pleasure B: delight C: bankruptcy D: agony E: owning<n>Output:		1.) The text suggests that John spent money on his testicles because he was feeling pleasure.<n>2.) He was feeling delights, agonies, bankruptcy, but not owning.<n>3.) John didn't spend his money on testicles out of love or fear of not meeting needs.<n><n>4.) Therefore, C: pleasure is the correct answer.<n><n>Input:There was nothing left to tell except Billie kept pestering her parents about who the real father might be, because her mother had been born without a womb, and she believed she had swapped babies at birth with her twin sister, who had been born with one. So the twins had swapped babie, and the one left behind in the bed had been raised as the sister she believed she was.  But Billie was nothing but a bother to her parents.  She'd run off to live with hippies and make babies and grow crazier and crazier.  Now that her mother was dead, all that was left to do was to decide if they should tell her father that a mistake had been made. They finally did. The first thing he asked them was if Billie had had any other children.  Now, he said, it was just a matter of tracking them down and making sure they, too, got fixed, while they were still young.  But the twins both insisted they still loved Billie.  They'd never grown to hate her.  They just knew she was a nuisance.<n><n><n>Output: <n><n>(1)<n><n>In this context, the word 'bother', seems to be used in a positive connotation. Therefore the best answer should be 'bother'<n><n>(2)<n><n>From the text, it is obvious that at the time Billie was born, there was some mistake that had to be corrected at a later stage by doctors. But since the text specifically mentions that the twins were not bothered in any way and that they both loved Billie, it can be inferred the twins knew that no mistake had been committed<n><n>(3)<n><n>As per the last two answers, the text says nothing about the first-born child not being raised in a womb.<n>The twins had swapped the siblings they were born with. That is to say, they had both been left behind.<n><n>

However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:What do people look for when competing against someone? Choices:  A: edge B: desire to win C: friendship D: rivalry E: skill<n>Output:		1 The first paragraph states: “The best way to get an edge, they say, is to get to know your opponents.”<n>           2. This suggests that people look for an edge against their opponent.<n>2. In the example given, the two children who are in a horse-riding competition are using their rivalry with one another to achieve an edge against their opponents.<n>3. They are looking for an advantage over their opponents by capitalizing on the fact that they are rivals.<n>4. Thus, the missing element in this example is 'rivalry'.<n>5. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 'desire to win'.<n><n>Input:In the end, her grandmother’s lesson was not in money so much as in the capacity of people to make do.<n>Choices:  A: resilience B: invention C: industry D: courage E: thrift<n>Output: 1 It can be inferred that not much money was available in their household during this period, which is why a simple life was emphasized by her grandmother. This suggests that it was not about resilience but thrift.<n>2. Her grandmother's lesson involved thrifting, as suggested by the sentence, "It seemed to her then that her grandmother’ s lesson was in the capacity of people not to have any money at all, and then to make do."<n>3. The focus was on the capacity to'make do' with the minimal available resources.<n>4. However the lesson taught was "in the capacity of people... to make do", not about resilience. Since capacity cannot resilience, the choice for resilience is incorrect<n>5. Accordingly, the correct answer would be thrift.<n><n>Input: It was no longer the kind of job where you could expect the employer to reward you for hard work.<n>Choices: A: stability B: dependability C: commitment D: efficiency E: reliability<n>Output: 1 This section describes the change in attitude towards workers on a declining business when business were slow.<n>2. The phrase 'no longer' indicates a change, suggesting that it was once the kind of job where businesses did reward workers for a job well done.<n>3. The rest of the paragraph describes that they no longer did this.<n>4. There was a change in attitude

Choices: A) Upper and lower case letters. B) The text is written on a white background. C) Printed instead of handwritten. D) A capital letter. E) A small capital letter.<n>Output: The correct answer is letter D. A capital letter is the upper case equivalent of a lower case letter and should therefore be counted as being in upper case.

Choices: A) On the streets of large cities B) Outside the city center C) In the mountains D) Next to the beach E) A new restaurant<n>Output: The correct response is A.

In this sentence, 'there’s going to be…' and 'will be is happening in the future. it's not the last day, it's the night before, implying a celebration as opposed to reminding you of school (which is something in the past, whereas the night before is in the future).<n><n>4.

It implies that tonight is the last of the last days of the semester, so it represents the last day.<n><n>Input: Who needs to be a teacher if you teach your kid new words daily?

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5.

Choices:  A: candy store B: butcher shop C: kitchen D: auto repair shop E: post office<n>Output:		1)The clue to answer this question is to identify the place where you buy food products: the butcher shop.  However, the question doesn't indicate that this is the right answer, rather the clue can misdirect readers into looking for words in the right sentence with the wrong meaning.<n>2)Since "the butcher shop sells the meat or animal flesh that has not been processed by a processor and can be used as a food" (source: Merriam Webster.com), the butcher shop can be any of the choices: A, B, C and D.<n>3)However,  the clue "buy" indicates we should look for "sell", which is not required here. Instead, the only choice to look at is E: post office.  The only place where we buy treats by counter in the sentence is the 'post office'.<n>4)Therefore the answer is E: post office  This is a common example of the way in which a writer, who doesn't want to lie but can't explain things directly, can use a little trickery to get their point across. The key idea to focus on in this case is to "sell", which must be buy, not sold, buy, or buyed.  The fact that the answer is a place to buy things suggests that the butcher shop is not what we need to focus on.<n>

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:Where could you find a laundry room that is only used by staff?

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3.

The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:The artist didn't use many colors to capture the view, he was famous for his very plain what? Choices:  A: landscape B: east side C: countryside D: middle america E: georgia<n>Output:		1: The clue in this prompt indicates that the landscape was captured quite unconventionally or perhaps, plainly.  The other choices can be ruled out based on these clues.<n>2: All we are told is that the artist was famous for painting a certain aspect of the landscape.  There is no information to suggest that 'landscape', 'east side', 'countryside', or'middle america' were all aspects of the artist's painting style.<n>3: The artist's country of origin or place of birth will be irrelevant to capturing a view.  He was famous for his paintings so there is a need to narrow down the options to a specific location.  The other choices do not provide any new information that could hint at the answer.  'Georgia' indicates that there may have been some geographical focus to the paintings. This makes the choices of 'landscapes', 'east-side', 'countrymides','middle americas' uninteresting.<n>4: This is the same reason why the option of 'countrysides' is eliminated.  There is no reason to rule out 'countrysids' or even 'landscapes', but the context here eliminates these options and directs us to what may have been the artist's style.<n>5: The artist's painting style is not defined as his painting style for painting.  He may have painted other things as well.  But he gets his reputation for painting the countryside.  So, the answer should be 'countrysid's.<n>So the final answers are C: countrysid
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:Wanting to avoid the cabbage spoiling, where did he put it? Choices:  A: grocery store B: refrigerator C: freezer D: plate E: supermarket<n>Output:		C. He put the cabbage in the freezer. The question in the last sentence suggests that he had no intention of using these fresh cabbages that he just bought as they do not fit the current meals on hand. But he wants to stop them from spoiling before the 10-day vacation, suggesting that he would be using them later.<n>So the final sentence would have read "but he wanted to stop them from spoil- ing before leaving on vacation."<n>This indicates that A: grocery stores and B: refrigerators don't fit in the context. They simply wouldn't be used for storing fresh vegetables on vacation.<n>Further, putting vegetables in a freezer wouldn't allow them to spoil.<n>Therefore, C: freezer is the correct answer. In the given context, he put the cabbage in a freezer.<n><n>Input:Winston did not find a job until well after he finished college. Choices:  A) After he quit college, B) After he finished high school, C) After he graduated from college D) After he found a college, E) After he was employed a company<n>Output: 1) The context refers to a single event.<n>2) The question assumes that he did find employment after he finished college. The question then asks when he found that employment.<n>3) However, the text refers to several events in the course of his job search:<n><n>• He did not find a job immediately after he finished college.<n>• He finished college only after taking some time off to volunteer in a college that was badly in need of fresh ideas and eager for new blood.<n>• He would then have taken some more time off to volunteer, but he wasn't prepared to spend the rest of his life just volunteering. He needed to find a job.<n>• Though he didn't find a job at the college or in any other job, he found work writing novels for the next couple of years.<n>4) Therefore, the events described in the passage occurred in this order:<n><n>• He quit college<n>• He volunteered in a community for a few months<n>• He went back to school and finished college<n>• He volunteering for a college<n>• He found a job<n><n>Thus, E: After he found a job is the correct answer.<n><n>Input:He has made
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:The window across the street was broken and John felt guilty. He never meant to damage what? Choices:  A: friend's house B: curtains C: space shuttle D: front door E: classroom<n>Output:		1) 'John' refers to a specific person (John).<n>2) We understand 'across the street' to refer to a geographical location. This is known as a prepositional phrase.<n>3) 'Broken' is an adjective which describes the state of the door/window. So we understand the window to be broken.<n>4) The term 'he never meant to' implies that John accidentally did this and he isn't directly responsible for what happened to the window. He feels guilty about it.<n>5) 'front door' refers to a location in a building and is therefore relevant. The window isn't a building but the prepositional phrase isn't relevant so we eliminate choice C.<n>6) The next sentence states that John felt guilty due to the broken window and that there wasn't any kind of premeditation on his part (he never meant to).<n>7) John did not want to punish himself for something he didn't mean to do and therefore this sentence suggests that it is also something that John wasn't responsible for (it wasn't his fault).<n>8) 'He never meant to damage' implies that the reason John didn't want to punish himself is because he had broken the window accidentally and felt guilty about it.<n>9) Since he had broken the window by mistake, we understand that the prepositional phrase is 'damage'.<n>10) The final sentence suggests that John isn't responsible for the damage and he feels guilty about it all this time: He never meant to damage the window which gives us an adverb.<n>11) Therefore, John is not responsible or guilty for damaging the front door but is responsible and feels guilty about damaging the window.<n>12) Therefore, 'the broken window' is the correct answer to this sentence.<n>So the final choices are: front door.<n><n>Input: He was afraid of what the newscaster told him.  He didn't know what the news was about.<n><n>Answer: It must be the Newscaster who was worried.<n><n>Input: Somewhere in the house some dust was growing.<n><n>Answer: We can’t tell what part of the house it was growing under.<n><n>Input: We took the boat over to the island.<n><n>Answer: “We” may not refer to an individual, it maybe multiple people.<n><n>Input: She

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2.

The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness.

Choices:  A: book robber B: he had a word with the driver. C: believe guilty D: direct traffic E: wave on<n>Output:		1) 'The impatient car' implies that the police man had to stop a car which was going too fast, and this may have caused danger to people or traffic.<n>2) 'wave flares' suggests the police man's task is to stop a car which is moving too fast.<n>3) The police man didn't want the impatient car to move on and 'had a word with the driver' or 'directed the traffic' or 'believed the driver guilty'. These choices mean the police man was taking action other than waving flares.<n>4) No evidence suggesting any of the choices except waving flares. This supports B: he had a was with the driver<n>So the final answer<n>D: wave the flares and that was his task<n><n>Input: I thought Mr O'Connor looked rather grim, he does his best work in a cheerful mood.  What he was doing? Choices:  a: waving at the window b: writing letters c: painting landscape d: talking with me e: doing a dance<n>Output: 1. I thought Mr O' Connor looked rather grim.<n>2. Waving at the window and writing letters are both actions, not what he was doing.<n>3. Doing a dance and talking with me are inaccurate in the given context.<n>4. Painting landscape can describe what Mr O'Connor was doing in the sentence.<n>5. Painting is a what he doing according to the sentence given.<n>So the final answr C:painting landscapes

Choices:  A: conduct trial B: arrest C: bring in verdict D: pass sentence E: serve justice<n>Output:		1) The question suggests that a judge has the power to perform a variety of legal activities relating to a criminal case after an accused person is convicted.<n><n>2) 'Arrest' is when a judge puts a person into custody, so it cannot be the appropriate choice for this question.<n><n>3) 'Bring in verdict' refers to the final part of a trial where a judge declares the judgement of the case or sentence. The right answer here is A.<n><n>4) 'Pass sentence' is too broad, and has no legal relevance to the question as a judge only has jurisdiction within court proceedings. The right answer is A.<n><n>5) 'Serve justice', on the other hand, has no context for this question. This choice doesn't make sense from a legal perspective.<n><n>6) D: Pass sentence is the correct answer. After a conviction, there are 4 activities that the judge will carry out. When a judge brings in a verdict, it involves bringing in a sentence, which is the third option.<n><n>Input:The purpose of the Olympic Games is to promote what among the followings?

(insert correct choice). "<n><n>For the purpose to indicate what the text is specifically talking about:<n><n>2.) The question talks about purpose and specifically talks about olympic games. Therefore, this is in reference to why the Olympic Games were created for.<n>3.) It is clear from the context as stated before, that "the Olympic Games are a sports competition featuring athletes from all over the world."  They were intended/designed to further this purpose.<n>4.) The text mentions that "The Games were a revival of the Olympic Games of Ancient Greece, which were part of a religious ritual, honoring the Greek gods. The Games served no modern purposes until the late eighteenth century, when they became an imperial showcase in the Napoleonic wars to showcase French superiority to other nations."<n><n>With this is mind, the text mentions that the original purpose of the Olympic Games were part of a religious event - in reference to religion, as the text states clearly, it will be inappropri

E: 'Easily' is too mild a word to describe the process that the elephant would put into it to swallow the cow.<n><n>Output: The correct explanation is 'Easily' implies a lack of effort on the part of the elephant, so we could change it to 'It wouldn't be hard for the elephant to swallow the cow.' and the sentence will be correct.<n><n>Input: I don't approve, therefore my wife and I mustn't eat at that restaurant.<n>Choices: 1.

First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:A person notices popcorn, cotton candy on the grass, where is he likely?

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2.

Choices:  A: conquer opponent B: fight enemy C: join army D: kill E: terrible<n>Output:		1) In war, your primary method of fighting is through combat.<n>2) Using the primary method suggests the goal is to either kill everyone in your path or to gain control and power.<n>3) Combat also implies a fight.<n>4) Given that war is a method used to accomplish these ends, you primary goal will either be to conquer your opponent or join the army.<n>5) 'Fighting' as opposed to 'war' implies that you may not be successful in every endeavor, which leads us to believe conquering your enemy is the preferred goal.<n>6) Therefore, D: kill or capture, whichever is feasible given the circumstances.<n>So the final, correct answer is D: kill or capture.<n><n>Input:Hardly more, but as much of him as he could, with difficulty, he took down.

The subject and object both agree with this structure, whereas 'a lot' doesn't follow the same structure.<n>4.) 'Little' and 'Hardly more' are the best options to fill in the space.<n>5.) So the correct answer is A: Little.<n>So the final correct answer is A: little.<n><n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2.

In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:Where would you read a passage but not write it? Choices:  A: diary B: city C: bible D: graffiti E: labyrinth<n>Output:		The answer is Choice D:  labyrinth. As a maze is made up of numerous paths that allow a person to wander through, yet never escape, the choice of labyrinth implies that all texts will take the form of a labyrinth, a maze with one path leading to freedom where freedom equals "a place where you can communicate, such as a writing desk". "labyrinth" also implies a wandering path, which is the opposite of "written" which means "in a logical, step by step process". Thus, a place to read a written passage but not to write it is thus a place to read a passage but not wander and follow the path to freedom.<n><n>Input:"It was a long wait at the shop.". Choices: A: until their B: in the C: of the D: of their E: to their<n>Output:To have read these five sentences, you would need to follow the path in the labyrinth. To do this, you must read through the sentence before answering. We must do this because the choice is to read what, not who, or when, and it is a long wait. However, one way to ensure the correct reading of the passage is to be aware of the following: "Shop" in this case refers to a store, which would have its owner as the shopkeeper. So in following the path "it" refers to the shop, "theirs" refers to people involved in the business, and "their" refers to the actual people themselves, in which this case would be the shopkeeper, and "wait" refers to a short stretch of time.<n><n>Input: Who does the word "us" refer to in the sentence: "Molly and I are going to the concert tonight."? Choices: 1. Molly and I 2. Molly and I are 3. Molly and I together 4. Molly and I both 5. Molly and I, together 6. I and Molly 7. I and Molly are 8. I and Molly go 9. Me and Molly 10. Myself and Molly 11. Me<n>Output:The us in question belongs to both Molly and I.<n><n>Input:Where did Molly not go? Choices: 3. With me 4. Together with me 5. Only me 6

Choices:  A: two feet B: two ears C: horns D: lay eggs E: one head<n>Output:		1) The question asks, 'what do all humans have on one side of the head'?<n>2) Choices A and B, referring to feet and ears, can be rejected as humans have legs and ears, but those are not located on the side of the head.<n>3) Choices C, referring to horns, and E, referring to heads, can also be rejected because a human being can have only one head while a human does not lay eggs.<n>4) Choices D, referring to the feet of birds, can also be rejected for the same reason.<n>5) Therefore, 'one head' alone refers to human beings. This is reflected in the correct answer for the question being 'C: horns'.<n><n>Input:It's a shame that this person,  though well-informed,  only ______ what's in the newspaper. Choices:  A - was not able to  B - was not willing to  C - did not know how to  D - did not seek to<n>Output: 1: The key word'shame' shows that this person's behaviour was unacceptable or unusual, and the fact that 'well-informed' was used in describing the person suggests that this is someone from whom we were expecting more.<n>2: The person knows what's in the news but does not apply this knowledge to other activities.<n>3: This person is unaware of what to do to obtain more knowledge.<n>4: The person must know how to read and gather information and apply that knowledge to other activities.

Therefore, they are unrelated to the student's ongoing action from their sitting position.<n>Secondly, the student is about to do something, and this does not seem to be related to the sitting or playing activities.<n>The remaining answers could be related to what the student is about to play next.  For example, a player might read a book to learn musical techniques before they play more (studying), or they might study what they have played for more analysis (study).  They also might talk, sing, or play another instrument (talk, sing, play).<n>Therefore, the correct answer is B: read book<n><n>Input:  I took a trip on the London subway and was lucky enough to witness a woman who had an unusual occupation. Her face was caked in makeup, and she wore a dress, high heels, and jewelry. She was a waitress, but her outfit said something else. She worked in a different way.  Choices: A: she worked at a fast food joint B: she had a bone to pick with management C: she wore a uniform D: she worked at a hotel<n><n>Output: <n>The woman works at a fast food joint.  She may look like a waitress, but she is not.<n>In this context, a waitress may work at a hotel or a restaurant.  It does not sound reasonable that she works at a fast food restaurant as this would not explain her unusual occupation.<n>Also, not working at a fast food restaurant does not mean that a waitress works at a hotel.  If she simply had a bone to  pick with management, this does not explain why she wore a uniform.<n>Also, she wears a uniform, indicating that she works with people, and may also

However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer.

Choices:  A: fridge B: limejuice C: square D: gym E: refrigerator<n>Output:		D: Gym  The context suggests that the juice bar is a place where you not only get in shape but also drink juice. The 'drink at a juice bar' indicates a place where you can find drinks which have a juicy content.<n>'Gym' is a place where you can get in shape. This context suggests that we can fit 'a juice bar' into 'where you can get in shape and drink'.<n>'a juice bar' is the same as 'a new bar', so 'a new gym' is the same as the 'a gym'. This makes B a bad choice.<n>'a bar' is a building where people drink, whereas 'a gym' is a place with weights, so 'in shape and a bar' and 'in shape and a gym' do not make sense. This makes A a bad choice.<n>The context also suggests 'a juice bar', and it means 'where can you get in shape', so 'and drink a juice bar' is incorrect, so 'where can you get into shape and drink a juice bar', or what we're calling 'a juice bar'. This makes A wrong.<n>'refrigerator: gym', or'refrigerator: square' do not fit because'refrigerator' means a room where you keep food, and'refrigerator is not a place where you keep food'. This makes C and E wrong.<n>'Where can I get into shape and drink lime juice?' doesn't make sense in any way. This makes B a bad option.<n>In summary, 'a juice bar = a new gym' is true, and 'gym = in shape' is true as well. The 'drink drink at a juice' bar and the 'get in shape' context suggest that the 'a juice bar context' does not mean drinking lime juice. So the final answer is D.<n>

Choices:  A: jungle B: bamboo grove C: australian outback D: china E: child's book<n>Output:		1. When a koala is put in a bamboo groove, it is like putting a panda there.<n>2. The museum display is like the normal display of a panda, if the normal display was placed in a bamboogrove, which is the case with a koala.<n>3. This is because the museum made a very unusual choice of placing the koala in the bamboogroove, which has the same meaning as a panda is normally displayed in china.<n>4. Finally, this means that the correct choice for the koala was in the bamboo groovie Choices:  A and D or E (because china is not a choice for putting pandas) <n>So, the final answer is bamboo groovie (and not bamboo's bamboo grovies which are not correct grammatically)

From the first sentence, we know that the apple is forbidden, which implies that something was forbidden on the tree.<n>2. This could have been something that was forbidden overall or just on the part of the tree.<n>3. We can conclude that an apple is forbidden, but how do we know whether it's the forbidden fruit?<n>4. To answer this, we have to look at the second sentence, which tells us that this forbidden fruit was something that was forbidden on the Apple Tree in the Garden of Edo.<n>5. In the second sentence, we read that the forbidden fruit was an apple. Hence answer E is the correct one.<n><n>Input: Which of the following is the correct sentence structure? Choices:  a: adjective phrase b: adverb phrase c: noun phrase d: prepositional phrase e: none of the above<n>Output: Since the word "sentence" is written in lowercase, it is a sentence fragment in English.<n>In English, "the" (as a definite article) is a determiner that refers specifically to a particular noun that appears in the previous clause. Thus, it fits within the categorization of noun phrases, not adjective phrases.<n><n>Input: The only answer that makes sense to me is this one: He came to the station, but he doesn't have a ticket.

For example, the answer is this: He came to the stop, but he doesn' stop.<n>In this sentence, He didn't come after all.<n><n>Answer choices: (A) is correct because He came to the stop station after all.

Choices:  A: special B: personal C: offended D: unique E: rare<n>Output:		The question implies that the individual has received a gift that is not particularly common. However, the sense of 'feeling' isn't clear and thus the answer may be B: personal, D: unique, or E: rare.<n>1. For personal, the phrase 'feeling as if... feels that...'could be interpreted as 'feeling as if special' or 'feeling as if unique'.<n>2. For rare, the phrase 'feel like a princess' suggests that the receiver would feel special as they're going to be treated like a princess - if the gift is rare however, receiving it would feel special rather than offended/personal.<n>3. For offended, the phrase 'feels offended' could be read a few different ways:<n>    * That they were expecting an even more common gift, which would have made them 'feel' offended.<n>    * That they received a unique gift and weren't expecting it so 'feel' off about being caught off guard.<n>    * That the gift itself is so rare and valuable that it brings such a sense of awe that the individual 'feel' a sense of wonder.<n>4. For unique, it implies that the individual would have felt honored/privileged/special to receive the gift whereas offended/personal carries with them a negative feeling.<n>5. Therefore, C: offended and E: rare are incorrect as these meanings don't fit the context of receiving a gift that isn't particularly common.<n>6. B: 'feeling that such a gift was personal' fits the context. The individual is likely to feel honored/privilege/special to receive such a gift and the fact that it wasn't a common gift would have made them feel that way. However, unlike in the D: unique question, there are no negative feelings attached. The D: unique answer therefore should be discarded.<n>7. Thus, the final answer is: "What is one likely to feel after receiving such a gift?<n>A. B. C. D. E. <n>(A) special<n>(B) personal<n>(C) offended<n>(D) unique<n>(E) rare"<n>And the answer is (B): personal

The spores from fungi are in the air and if the shower stall is not cleaned, the fungus can spread. Molds grow from spores in wet areas, and the shower stall where water sits for a long time is a perfect place for them to grow. As long as the mold is kept from growing, it does not affect the body.<n><n><n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question prompt under the context given in the text.<n><n>#### Question:<n>What does it mean when someone says "I know what you're thinking"?<n>Context: The teacher said it means "I have that same thought you have, or I know your exact thought and I am not telling my thought."<n><n>#### Answer:<n>1. I think the statement I know what you're ____ means either "I know what you are ____ing, or I know the precise thought you are ____ing".<n><n>2. Since the teacher is giving a negative example, I think he is telling that the only time this statement should be used is in the precise thought, because its meaning is similar to "tell me you're ____ in that case".<n>That in turn means only when I know we are ____ing the same exact thing/thought (i.e. I know you're ____ing) should I ever use the statement "I know what you ____", because otherwise, I don't know what you are _____ing and should just say that instead.<n><n>#### Instruction:Answer the questions correctly based on what you think the correct answer is.<n><n>Q1:  Given the context, can someone ever say "I know what you did last sumer"<n>A1:No, the statement "I know _____" would never be written as "I _____" because in a sentence, we use the present tense when we're referring to the action taken or being taken by the subject, and we use past tense when we' re referring to the action or activity that took place in the past.<n><n>Q2:  Can someone ever say "I want to ____ as good as my brother"?<n>A2: No, you'd say I want to _____ as good as _____.  Or I want to ____ as well, instead.<n><n>

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:Where would you find a metal rod in most people's preferred method of transportation? Choices:  A: airplane B: construction site C: shops D: engine E: broken bone<n>Output:		1) First, the text suggests that a metal rod is present in a person's preferred method of travel.<n>2) A metal rod is likely to be found in a vehicle, as it is an essential component of an automobile.<n>3) Conversely, it is unlikely to be found in a person's home or place of work as it does not perform any purpose or function.<n>4. Similarly, it is unlikely to appear in a shop, a construction site, or broken bones.<n>5. Conversely, it might be found in an airplane as it is a popular form of transportation.<n>6. Based on the text, the correct answer is D: In an airplane, metal rods serve a specific purpose and hence, can be found in this type of vehicle.<n>So the final answe is D: in an airplane<n><n>Input: The best defense is a good ______.

What might he drink? Choices:  A: coffee B: throw up C: food D: getting drunk E: wine<n>Output:		It was breakfast time. Brad ordered eggs, toasts and something to drink.  What might he drink?<n>1. It is clear from the context that brad's breakfast meal is comprised of breakfast items.<n>2. Therefore, 'wine' doesn't make sense, because we know that only drinks from an alcoholic category are 'getting drunk' and 'wine' would not be considered a beverage typically served at breakfast.<n>3. Since it clearly isn't wine, we discard the answer choice options, B, C, and D.<n>4. It is likely that Brad has ordered coffee in the previous sentence, therefore, the right answer, A: coffee, is a much more likely choice.<n>So the final answers is A: coffee<n><n>Input: In spite of all her efforts, Lara was unable to find the item she wanted.

Choices:  A: race track B: populated areas C: the desert D: apartment E: roadblock<n>Output:		Given the context of 'race track' and 'where the people are', we can infer that this question is referring to populated areas. As such, the choice that makes most sense in this context is that B: 'populated areas' is correct.<n>The other choices make more sense in particular situations. For example, C: 'the desert' would make sense if the author wanted to include a choice that refers to a place where people are not common.<n><n>Input: A man died from a bite from a snake.  What did he die of? Choices: <n>  1. A: spider bite B: stake bite C: wolf bite D: snake bite E: scabbard bite<n>  2. 2. The man died from a snake bite, so E:'snake bite' is the correct answer.

Choices:  A: radio shack B: substation C: cabinet D: television E: desk<n>Output:		1) Home entertainment equipment needs the substation cable. This is because radio shack, cabinet, and desk do not need substation cables.<n>2) There’s no such thing as a “substation cabinet” and “substation desk” cable<n>3) We are looking for home entertainment equipment which would need a substation cable.<n>4) The answer is substation cable.<n>So the final answeer is:A: radio shack<n><n>Input:There are other activities and events I want to do that I won't be able to do if I'm stuck at school. It sounds like you've got this one pretty much under control. What could you have done in order to have not got this assignment done? Choices: 1: B: read and write 2: B: stay awake 3: C: ask for assistance 4: D: go out for the weekend 5: E: talk to friends<n>Output:If we just pick ‘B’ from this question, the meaning makes sense because the first two ‘B’ choices both contain ‘Read and write’ which is a part of the student’s assignment. Thus, the ‘B’ has made sense for the first two ‘B.’<n>For the third ‘B’ choice, we can infer from the context that the student can solve the assignment itself if he doesn’t do it too fast. He can solve it even he stayed awake for two nights and studied all night long, so ‘B’ is also acceptable.<n>For the last two ‘B’ choices are the student who has been stuck in school for the weekend. He has made a lot of assignments for the weekend, but he never completed it fully. So if he wants to get out of school and want to take a break because he had to take too many assignments at school, the student should ask for their teacher’s help. So the real solution is that ‘B’ is the best answer in this question.<n>And finally, ‘E’ answers the second question: If there’s no one who can help the student but the student himself, then the student can ask the other students for help. The student needs the help from the other friends’ to solve the assignments. So, ‘E’ is the best answer for the question.<n>So the final answers is B:READ+WRITE<n>B:STAY AWA

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer.

He would die if he didn't find some way to stop what? Choices:  A: loss of heat B: revenge C: expansion D: relaxation E: calm down<n>Output:		1 If James isn't going to stay the heat, he'll die.  This suggests that the issue is not one to simply passively cool down, but rather he has to find a way to stop losing heat.  This implies that a solution is required for the dilemma and not just passive cooling down. <n>2 In the context of the situation, the word 'expand' could indicate the opposite of cooling down.  It is unlikely that there would be a mention of cooling down more quickly if another word were substituted.<n>3 In the context of the sentence, the word'revenge' isn't related to cooling down more quickly. There is no relation between revenge and cooling down quickly. <n>4 In the context of the question, the phrase 'find a way', the question asks for a solution.  The phrase 'find a way' only makes sense if the solution is an action rather than a passive state of being.<n>5 The phrase 'expansion' does not appear anywhere in the sentence or passage other than in the question.<n>6 As we have established that the word is inaccurate, the only possible answer is'relief'.  That being said, it is unlikely that the answer will be 'calm down' since calm down has to do with a mental state.  Hence, the answer cannot be calm down or relief since the situation isn't related to mental health issues.<n>7 Finally, the situation is not related to the expansion of knowledge or heat.  It is not related to the slowing of a process.  It is not a word that refers to the growth of a particular thing.<n>As such, the only option that is accurate is'relief'. As it is the only answer, D is the correct answer.<n>

D: take money is the correct answer.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question below by providing the most suitable synonym of the underlined word.<n><n>You need not worry as long as you can think through what the future will hold. You must keep your mind sharp as a needle. The only thing you need to do is follow the steps of the needle to achieve success.  The needle is what that leads to... Choice:a. sharp b. stiff c. hard d. steady e. steady hand<n>Output: 1 The underlined word is ‘steely’ as the sentence starts with “Keep your mind sharp as…” (which means to have a strong and positive mental state of mind, usually relating to willpower and perseverance) and thus the first sense that comes to mind is "steady and determined".<n>2. In the text, the author makes it clear that “the needle is what leads to...” and hence, ‘steady’ is not an option as a synonym.<n>3. The correct answer is 'hard' as the given meaning of steely is "steady" and the meaning of "hard" is "extremely difficult".<n><n>### Instraction:Read the passage and write the summary in your answer sheet.

However it doesn't guarantee that other tasks are accomplished. Incomplete tasks are not necessarily related to making breakfast and cooking food. <n>4) The question hints that other tasks are essential before cooking. For example, he "needs" to pack or bag, if packing or bag is essential the campers needs to do pack or bag first then prepare and cook.<n>5) But the word "can" means may.

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:Where would you find a seafood restaurant in the east coast of North America?

He did not lack in interest or flair, he just did not enjoy tediously explaining the details.  He had no interest in public speaking due to the inherently tedious detail required for effective communication. Choices:  A; lack  B: lacking; lacking C: boredom  D: uninteresting  E: perfunctory<n>Output: After careful consideration on question the question, all of the possible answers are either lacking, uninteresting, lacking in, or perfunctory.<n>1. If John had no interest or talent, it would imply that he was either lacking in those skills or that he was bored with tedious details. However, only lacking and perfunctory would indicate the latter.<n>2. If John had no talent and was bored during these interactions, that would suggest he lacked interest or was uninterested.<n>4. Finally, perfunctory would be used here if the actions described were routine and unexceptional and the speaker had no interest in the matter at hand.<n><n>All of this information combined suggests that John lacked interest, not talent. Therefore the correct answer is "B: lacking; lack of interest."<n><n><n><n>Input: As the only survivor of an orphanage during the Korean War, John lived a life of hardship, always being the one to perfunctorily mumble under your breath "Thank God it's friday!" after a full week of grueling work.

Choices:  A: costly B: captive C: contained D: paying E: caught<n>Output:		1.) The text explicitly refers to a "microtransaction", i. e. a small fee which is deducted from a user's account and is used to purchase new cosmetic items in a game.<n>2.) Thus the word "free" in the title of the game can be interpreted as ironic, because while the player initially pays nothing, the game's developers ultimately get paid when players spend microtransactions on in-game items.<n>3.) The parent's are surprised to discover the cost of the game, as they initially thought they would not have to pay any money for it.<n>4.) As this is the cause of their surprise, it can be assumed that they would not be in need of doing "microtransactions" at any time, because they don't have to, so the answer must be A: costly or B: captive.<n>5.) The child and his or her parents play the game at home, rather than traveling to a place where the game can be played.<n>6) Captive as it means that the parents have to make these payments.<n>7.) As captive contains more information than costly, captive it the correct answer.<n>So the final is C: captive<n><n>Input: She was a very popular candidate for the vacant position, but the woman's political views were considered to be to the left of what?

People who are "far-left" usually believe that there should be no private property, that the gap between rich and poor people should be completely eradicated, that people should be given a high degree of control over their own working conditions, and that the government should play a major role in providing social services like health care and higher education.<n>3.) The word "far" is used because it implies that the candidate considered her views to be so left-wing, that they almost became radical.<n>4.) Therefore the adjective "extreme" should be used with the word "left" to describe political candidates as being "super-liberal" or "super-progressive".<n>5.) As the word "left" in this context usually refers to someone being very liberal,

The only other way an exhausted person can recover is if they physically exert themselves further.<n>So, A: mediate is the correct answer.

Choices:  A: alabama B: tennessee C: violin case D: music store E: bow and strings<n>Output:		1 What we have to know here is, what kind of music or fiddle playing is it?  In a fiddle, the instrument is the violin, which is a stringed instrument and is played with a bow. Therefore, the answer is NOT ‘Fiddle’.<n>2. The question only mentions states between Kentucky and Alabama. Kentucky and Tennessee are known as fiddle bow states because of the prevalence of fiddle music in the region.  In contrast, Alabama is known as a piano and bow state.<n>3. ‘Violin case’ is the correct answer because ‘Tennessee’ is NOT the answer.  The term ‘a case for a violin’ is used to refer to the instrument but no particular state. (Note: ‘Fiddle’ refers to a violin, and not the act of music)<n>4. ‘Music store’ is not the correct answer.  The question is not about finding music stores but about playing fiddles.<n>5. Finally, the question suggests that the fiddles can be found in ‘a state south of Kentucky and a state north of Alabama’.  This indicates that the answer to the question is to find the state in which there is fiddle music.<n>6. Therefore the answer is ‘Music’ or ‘Fiddling’. The question is a metaphorical one, the answer is a state (not Alabama).  Alabama or Tennessee are not the right answer because it is too specific a reply to the question, which is vague/ambiguous in nature.<n>So the final Answer is Music Store.

Choices:  A: gain weight B: augment C: dispare D: make larger E: expand<n>Output:		Jamie wanted to reduce her weight but the answer doesn't specify what the outcome (or change in weight) is so it's not possible to say for sure whether her efforts failed.<n>The word 'efforts' suggests that she tried many different things, all of which failed.  <n>If she had gained weight instead of failing to reduce her weight, the answer would say 'A: gain weight'.  <n>If she had succeeded in reducing her waist size, the answer would say something like'reduce her waist size'.  <n>The conclusion is that Jamie continued doing whatever she attempted because none of them succeeded.<n>So the final sentence is 'Jamie continued trying to make her waist smaller.' <n><n>Input: If we continue to live in this house, we'll never get rich.  But if we move to a smaller house, we'll have more money to spend!  So... which would you prefer?

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:John and James spent most of their time communicating with each other on their project.  The time required to communicate slowed their what? Choices:  A: static B: train of thought. C: progress D: transfer of information E: collaboration<n>Output:		There is confusion regarding what exactly causes progress to slow down. In the first sentence, John and James are communicating with each other rather then moving from one point to another. So, it is more likely that progress is slowing down due to the excessive amount of communication time.<n><n>The next sentence suggests that James and John spent the majority of their time communicating. So it is unlikely that their thought patterns were slowed down. Though each sentence can be read to suggest both of those ideas, neither really makes sense in isolation.<n><n>The last sentence suggests that James and/or John's ability to transfer information may slow progress. Though this idea is included in the text, it is not a main idea as suggested in the question. The main idea is the reason that the two of them are having problems with their work.<n><n>So A: static B: progress and C: collaboration are incorrect.<n><n>The second sentence also contains a list of time periods. A: static B: thought and C: transfer of information don't really make sense in the context and don't really fit with the idea of progress being slowed down. Also, E: collaboration is used in the context of the two boys communicating with each other. So D: The first answer is correct - progress is slowed due to the amount of time they spend talking to each other.<n><n>Input:The time required to communicate slow the what? Choices: A: progress B: thought of thought C: transfer of information E F: collaboration<n>Output:It is quite probable that the cause of progress slowing down is that the communicating takes up a substantial amount of time. This is made clear by the next sentence.<n><n>The next sentences imply that James and John spent most of their time in communication. This suggests a possibility that their thought patterns have slowed down.<n><n>However, the next sentence suggests that the two of them spend the majority of their time in communication which is not necessarily the case.<n><n>So it is unlikely that their individual thought patterns slowed down. The idea of the two of them talking to each other makes more sense in terms of slowed progress.<n><n>The second half of the question also supports the idea that the cause of progress to slow down and the question suggests a possible reason. The phrase 'transfer information' makes it seem more likely that their communication is slowing down progress than the 'thought processes'.<n><n>So the last part of that sentence

Choices:  A: ocean B: symphony C: band D: music store E: music shop<n>Output:		1.'Group of musicians' suggests that the musicians will form a group.<n>2. 'playing the cello' means that cello will be played by an individual, and 'including someone playing the cello' implies that the person who plays it will be included in the group.<n>3. There are numerous ways to put together a group of musicians, so 'band','music store', and'music shop' do not match 'including someone playing the 'cello'. Cello musicians typically belong to a'symphony' rather than a 'band/group', so the answer is B: symphony. Cello is the instrument of a symphony player rather than of a band or'music shop' musician<n><n>Input: This person did everything he could to pass the exam.

Choices:  A)  other similar boys B) other similar girls C) other similar people D) other similar classes E) other similar adults<n>Output: 1."The boy had no real friends..." suggests that his parents forbade him from interacting with other people.<n>2. This is not an example of a sentence with an unusual choice about the number of friends a boy should have. Rather, this sentence concerns the kind of friends the boy can have or should have. Since both B and D are grammatically correct (though it is possible to have a group of adult friends, this is less probable than a group of friends who also happen to be adults), it is most likely that the sentence is referring to the age-range of the boy's friends <n>3. "Forbade" implies that he does not have friends because his parents do not allow it.  <n><n>4. Given the context, choices D: other similar adults and A: other similar boys are the best choices.<n>5.

Choices:  A: child's hand B: the last straw C: hobby shop D: end of line E: toy store<n>Output:		1: The question is phrased such that Sally's kite was lost because she wasn't 'careful'.<n>2: The text suggests that despite initially thinking that there was'more string on the spool', she lost the kite when she reached 'the last straw'.<n>3: This implies that Sally initially had enough string to build the kite.<n>4: This is reinforced by the sentence 'She thought that there was more'.<n>5: Because she thought that there was enough string, Sally didn't use 'careful' action to reach the end of the string.<n>5: This is because she 'thought' that she had reached the 'end'.<n>6: Because she 'thought' about the situation, she did not use 'careful' actions to use the right hand or fingers<n>7: This is because she decided that her 'thought' was more reliable than what she actually saw.<n>8: It is this last 'thought' about how much string was remaining that resulted in her losing the kite.<n>9: The sentence also refers to Sally's mistake as being due to 'not being careful', since her 'thought' that the end of the string was reached resulted in losing the kite.

However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:East coast areas such as Florida are found where? Choices:  A: florida B: denmark C: united states D: map E: california<n>Output:		1st, the question suggests that there are areas (not single area- more than one).<n>2nd, text suggests that 'east coaster areas' means USA.<n>3rd, it further suggests that Florida is one of the areas.<n>4th, florid is one of the area, So Florida is one of areas, that 'are found where?'<n>5th, from this clue we can take united states from the list of area.<n>6th, 'where' in the sentence has 5 possible options (that is why answer was a multiple choice question):<n>D: map (which can be taken out from above information),<n>E: california (which can be taken from above information, as it is east coasters area),<n>6. So the final answer is D -> map.<n>

Choices:  A: happy B: smile C: calm D: entertainment E: relaxation<n>Output:		 In a music class, one should be: 1. happy 2. calm<n>3. relaxed 4. entertaining<n>5. entertained<n>6. If you listen to music, it could make you entertaining, entertaining, or entertained. This last phrase is especially confusing as it is redundant.<n>For that reason, it can be assumed that this question refers to entertainment and therefore the correct answer is 'C: calm'<n>So the final answer:  D: entertainment<n>Input: What does your mother want to see you do?

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4.

The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:John came to see Sam and Sam kicked him out.  Sam didn't like company.  He prefered what? Choices:  A: you B: abbreviation C: solitude D: loneliness E: alone<n>Output:		First the text states that John saw Sam. This suggests that John's visit was a social one, since he would have had no reason to see him if he was not a friend or acquaintance.<n>2. The next statement says Sam kicked John out. It follows that John was not welcome there, otherwise Sam wouldn't have kicked him out.<n>3. This means Sam preferred solitude to company, which suggests that he liked staying alone.<n>4. The final statement gives more information about what Sam preferred and says he didn't like company, not solitude. This is the opposite of what is previously stated, so this detail suggests that rather than not liking solitude, he liked it.<n>5. Given this, the correct answer is B: solitude. Sam preferred staying alone. He didn't like company or having people around.<n><n>Input:It was in the news just the other day that there is no such thing as what? Choices: A: privacy B: friendship C: solitude D E: honesty<n>Output:The text gives more details about the nature of friendship, implying that friendship is a concept and is therefore not related to privacy.<n>2. The context of the statement also supports this: "there is no such thing as solitude" implies that solitudes not a thing. Therefore, it is not an independent entity, so it is not related to privacy either.<n>3.The text also gives details about solitude, and the statement about friendship and privacy is juxtaposed to the details given about solitude. This implies that the issue of solitude, privacy, friendship and the idea of "there is no such as [something]" revolve around the same concept: honesty.<n>4. The question does not ask about the meaning of honesty, so the correct answer is E: honesty.<n><n>Input:The first thing to do before leaving on a trip is to make a list of everything you need to what? Choices: B: prepare A C. pack D: check again E: take with you<n>Output: "The first thing to do": It is generally important to list everything you need. It is not crucial to use this list to "prepare" something, since this word is too vague to be precise. It is only required in this context that the list is used to "pack" all required goods, not prepare your clothes for wear or check
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4.

The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:What's it called when you have seen something through an eyepiece? Choices:  A: sights B: optical illusion C: optical telescope D: light microscope E: binocular<n>Output:		The key is to take a close look at the context.  We see that the subject is seeing some sort of object through an eyepice.<n>1. It isn't a microscope as that is given as an option.<n>2. Binoculars is clearly not an option, the context makes sure of that, because we would not expect one person to use binoculars to see something through an eyecup.<n>3. Light microscope is another obvious option, you would expect someone might use it to see something through a eyepiece.<n>4. That leaves us with:<n>5. sights, optical telescope, and optical illusion.  In this case, Optical illusion seems to be too far of a leap to make for this question.<n>6. The context is also to determine what exactly is 'it' that they are seeing.  This points more towards sights or optical telescope.<n>7. Sights is the answer, sights is more accurate since this specific question is about what is used (eyepiece) rather than what it is to look through.<n><n>Input: She has never seen how many miles a mile is.  Choices:  A. none B. two inches C. twenty-five yards D. nineteen ounces E. sixteen feet<n>Output: We are told that Sarah has never seen how many'miles' a mile is.  We can discard the other choices from this question because none are named as the context gives us specifics to work within.<n><n>1. "nineteen ounces" is the answer - it makes no sense for a mile to be measured in ounces.<n>2. "sixteen feet" is the next logical choice.<n>3. "twenty-five yards" - this is a possibility however it is less likely as a mile is typically measured in kilometers or for distance in the United States, it is measured by car (which has already been explicitly stated that it's a mile).<n>4. "two inches" makes the most sense though, as we know that someone could have seen many steps (twenty-five yards) or if they were using a scale, many pounds (19 ounces).<n>5. But, we also know that the context is specific to milieces.<n>6. The best choice therefore is "two inches".

Choices:  A: insect repellent B: heart attacks C: improved health D: shin splints E: being tired<n>Output:		1) Jogging could result in shin splints, which can be prevented by getting adequate shoes for the run and taking rest days; heart attacks; and even tiredness.<n>2) Heart attacks, though serious, however, are unlikely given the correct preparation, training, and exercise. <n>3) Tiredness is a very normal and expected result among people who jog, especially for the beginners, especially if they run a little longer than usual. The result is an indirect answer to the question. However, it does not give a direct answer to whether or not jogging will improve health.<n>4) Improved health seems to be an unlikely result of jogging. <n>5) Therefore, jogging might not result in improved health if it's not performed with good shoes, rest days, etc. The only other possibility is being tired. <n>6) So, the answer is B: heart attacks.<n><n>For this exercise, you'll create a function with multiple if/else statements.<n><n>For a part of the homework, you'll use an if-else statement.<n><n>if/else statements are used to choose an answer to a question based on certain conditions.

Choices:  A: economic instability B: not noticeable C: spend more D: rising interest rates E: boring<n>Output:		1)The question refers to inflation.<n>2)The main idea is that sometimes fighting inflation isn'treally necessary because the rate is so insignificant. The question is:Why do we fight inflation?<n>Answer B and E are incorrect because they refer to inflation as not negligible.<n>Answer E explains that it's not so boring or economic instability.<n>This only leaves D and A.<n>D doesn't explain the negligibility, but rather explains that inflation is rising.<n>Answer A says that the inflation rate is not economic.<n>From this, the correct answer is A: economic instability<n><n>Input: The price for gasoline, like other commodities, is determined by what we might call a "what"? Choices:  A. cost-based B. cost-plus C. costless D. cost-conscious E. cost-based-plus<n>Output: 1.) First of all, we are talking about selling gasoline. <n>The question asks us to decide between choices "A" and "E."<n>Choice A says "cost-based", which means it is based on "the cost to make it."<n>A) The gas station owners can't afford to give out "free gas" because they are already paying people to pump it as well as the fuel it needs to run.<n><n>Hence, "cost-less" does not make any sense when selling gasoline.<n>B.) "Cost-plus" means that the station owners pay, for example, $10 per gallon in order to give the customer $5 less (a profit of $5).<n>Therefore, "cost-plus" is also out.<n><n>C.) "Cost-conscious" is not a "what?" because it does not refer to the price of gasoline.<n><n>D.) There is no "cost-based-plus." So there are four choices left.<n><n>E.) "Cost-based" makes sense when selling gas because "cost is what we pay to pump it."<n>Cost is also the price. Therefore,choice "E" is correct.<n><n>It is not "what we pay to pump gas."<n><n>So the final answer for this case is E: cost-based<n><n>Input:He's not so what?  Choices: A: well B: old C
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:What is necessary for learning by yourself? Choices:  A: exposure B: patience C: study D: cooperation E: thought<n>Output:		1) The question suggests that learning can be achieved by oneself.<n>2. The instruction indicates that there are many variables that need to be considered by one who is learning by themselves.<n>3. The question suggests that, in order to learn by oneself, self-discipline and motivation are crucial.<n>4. Since 'exposure', 'patience','study' and 'cooperation' each implies a different learning state, none of the mentioned options can be combined with the given question.<n>5. However, learning can only be attained if one has time to exercise self-study, a goal to improve one's knowledge and ability and practice. In this context, A:exposure is the correct answer. In order to learn by ones self, it is necessary to spend more time in learning, a goal to improve and the will to do so.<n>It's so!<n><n>Input: You have been very attentive this past week, and it shows.  The way you are presenting yourself has improved.  Your work is of higher quality.  This is all results of what? Choices: A: listening B: looking C: thinking D: speaking E: writing<n>Output:  1. In the given sentence the speaker appreciates the positive effect the listener has on their work.  This implies that the attentive listener has improved how he presented himself and has achieved superior results.<n>2. As the 'attentive listener' is compared to the 'way you are presenting yourself' in the given sentence, so 'listening' should be taken into consideration.<n>3. The sentence suggests that the positive improvement on the listener's work is directly related to the listening.  It also indicates that 'thinking','speaking,' and 'writing' are not related to the listening, so these three options may be excluded.<n>4. In terms of the listening and the positive effects it has on the presentation and the results, which includes the quality of the work, listening implies 'attentiveness,' which is not related to the given context.<n>5. The key to answering the question is that the given sentence only makes use of 'listening' as a tool to enhance the work.<n>6. It follows that the speaker is praising the listener for his/her'speaking' skills and his/her listening, which in turn has led to him/her producing a
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness.

Choices:  A: break easily B: shattering C: melt D: bend E: hold water<n>Output:		1: thin glass breaks easily/2 shatters easily/3: thin glass breaks easily<n>4: thin glass melt easily<n>5: thin glass does not melt easily<n>6. As discussed before, the question is discussing a characteristic of "thin glass" and not a glass in general. This tells us that thin glass means a specific kind of glass, like the thinnest possible glass.<n>7. It is easy to see that thin glass can shatter since it is paper-thin. The question refers to thin glass "breaking" and not "shattering" to avoid the confusion of using the two words interchangeably despite their distinct meanings.<n>8. Given this context, it becomes clear that "thin glass breaks easily" is the correct choice.  The choice "thin glass shatters easily" may at first seem correct as it is a synonym for the original sentence, but the question is asking for the characteristic of a specific kind of glass.<n>Hence, the answer is 11, but I hope I got all points for the answer D.<n><n>Input:What would be an undesirable trait for someone in a position of high authority? Choices: 1. A: a coward B: a liar C: a thief D: a bully E: all of the above<n>Output: 11. As discussed earlier, liars are not to be trusted.  Thus, we can eliminate D. 2. Next, we have to eliminate B: a liar as the answer to the question.  Even as someone of high authority, a liar is unreliable and thus not suitable.<n>3. The same goes for A: a coward.  The person of high authority should be brave and not a coward. 4. We can also eliminate C:a thief since it is undesirable for people of authority to steal or keep money that doesn't belong to them.<n>5. Even if it had been C: a thief which was an unsuitable trait for someone in a high position of authority, the answer to the question would be that ALL of the above (A, B, and C) are undesirable traits.<n>6. After all options are eliminated, we are left with two choices: E: all of the answers and A: a liar.<n>7. Again, it is

He liked being about to divide people into what categories? Choices:  A: winners and losers B: perform better C: might win D: losses E: enemies<n>Output:		A. First, the question asks us to categorize people into which two categories.<n>B. Next, the text suggests that John is a competitive person who was able to dividing his opponents into groups.<n>C. This implies that John was not the type of person who would put others into groups to determine whether they would be considered winners or losers.  Thus, (C) is not a viable option.<n>D. Next, the phrase 'the type of person who would divide his opponents into groups to determine whether he or she would be considered a winner or a loser" suggests that John would indeed divide opponents into winners and losers.  Thus (B) is a viable option. <n><n>E. Finally, the text suggests that, having divided his opponents into categories, John was somehow able to decide which of the two categories a person may be in by performing some action.  However, nowhere does it state what the nature of these two groups are.  We know that John likes being able to tell opponents apart from his winnings, but having decided from what category a person is, does not necessarily tell us what kind of person that person is. This, combined with the fact that the text doesn't indicate how the person would know the groups, make (E) inadequate.<n><n>So the final answer: B. John would divide his opponents who he was competing against into groups of losers and winners.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question below.<n><n>Q.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:What could prevent someone from buying chistmas presents? Choices:  A: happiness B: lack of money C: stress D: relief E: exhiliration<n>Output:		1: All of A and B are the things that could prevent someone from buiing Christmas gifts.<n>2. C is not an option because we just need the word'stress' to suggest that we don't have enough money for Christmas gifts.<n>3. E doesn't seem to go with lack of money.<n>4. D doesn't have anything to do with money or not having enough money because it's happiness that we're referring to here. So the answer is D: stress.<n>So the final answers is D: stress<n><n>Input: How could a student be in more than one place at once?

He thought it would look good in what part of his home? Choices:  A: family room B: tropical forest C: flower garden D: movie theater E: hair salon<n>Output:		First, the context clearly suggests that Joe bought a ficus plant and thought it would look good anywhere, so it doesn't fit any of the other choices on this multiple choice question.<n>2. However, the question asks which part of his home he would place it in.<n>3. As such, 'houseplant' does refer to ficus plants and could be the answer, but is not specific enough.<n>4. Given the context of the question, he would probably place it in the family room, where he'll be able to interact with it.<n>5. So, based on this context, the 'house' part of 'houseplant' would refer to the family rather than the room, and that is why D is the correct answer.<n>So the final sentence is D: houseplant.<n><n><n>

In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness.

Choices:  A: toy store B: home C: school D: toy shop E: shelf<n>Output:		1. This question makes it clear that the entire family has time to spend with one another. This seems to be a situation where the whole family is free to choose anywhere as the right place to play.  However, the question indicates that they are considering a board game, so it would seem natural to play a board game with one another rather than some other activity.<n><n>2. There is no mention of specific time constraints, so it doesn't make sense to say that one place might be better if played at a specific time of the day.<n><n>3. If they are in a school or a store, then they could be playing in the classroom or aisle. However, it would be more correct to say that they are 'at home'.<n><n>4. As such,  the correct answer is A: home<n>So the final answer for this question is A: home<n><n>Input:The man's lawyer said he was 'inconsolable'. Choices: A: sorrowful B: desirous C: wretched D: grief-stricken E: distraught<n>Output:1. The word 'desirous' has a similar meaning to the word 'inconsolable' because both concepts describe a longing for something one cannot currently have or achieve in the present. However, 'desirous' typically suggests that the person wants to have something, whereas 'inconsolable', while often used to refer to an impossible goal, may also refer to a person who does not care whether he achieves or fails at the goal, as long as he does not achieve it.<n>2. In the case of the man's lawyer who was speaking of his client, he probably intended for the meaning of 'consolable' to be closer to the concept of the person caring whether he achieved the impossible goal or not, rather than the person not caring about the goal at all.  In this case, the connotation of the man's client being 'inconsolable of failing' at his impossible goal is most likely, rather than simply feeling 'despair' at the impossible goal, and for this reason, it is likely that the man's lawyer was referring to this connotation when using the word 'inconsoleable'.<n>3. From this, we can determine that A: sorrowful is the correct answer. Though 'D: grief-stricking' came from a similar conund

Choices:  A: idaho B: shopping mall C: big city D: in town E: new york<n>Output:		1.'Idaho' is the correct answer. This response is supported by the 'big city or in town' criteria.<n>2. The question states that, because the business is in the retail sector with the aim to sell, the business will be looking for ways to maximize its number of customers or potential customers.<n>3. The word'maximize' indicates that there is no absolute limit as to where the business would be in the search for potential customers. This means that the business can build anywhere and everywhere.<n>4. The word 'customers' could also be 'consumers' or 'bargain hunters' and they can be found anywhere. Therefore, 'Idaho' is the best answer for the question because there is nothing to suggest that potential customers will only be found in a big city or in a town.<n>5. There are no suggestions, implications, inferences, or indications that potential customers should only be found in 'big cities' or 'in towns.'<n>6. 'D: in town' does not answer the question but makes a new question.<n>7. Hence, the answer is 'Idaho'<n>

The phrase 'what could happen after driving car' implies that there are many things that might happen.<n>4. The word 'pain' is used, which clearly identifies a negative result. Therefore, the possibilities should not include any negative outcomes.<n>5. However, the word 'outcome' implies that there are possible, positive results as well,  and the word 'could' leaves room for interpretation.<n>6. Thus, the possibilities should include negative and positive outcomes and the possibility of a combination of both.<n>7. However, the wording of the question suggests that the only negative outcome is 'pain' and the only positive outcome is 'getting a tan', both of which are irrelevant suggestions.<n>8. Therefore, the correct answer is 'getting tired', which is a logical conclusion to driving long distance in a vehicle.<n>So the final outcome was D: getting tired<n>

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:The dog ran to the front window and barked, this is because of a presence at the what?

It does not specify doing something else.<n>2. The sentence only contains words that are related to books, but also contains the word 'else'.<n>3. This makes it clear that examination is a process that takes place somewhere.<n>4. Because it does not specify this somewhere, it could mean that it happens at a certain time or in a certain place.<n>5. While the sentence does not specify that a certain time has come for the reading of books, it does specify that they have been laid out somewhere.<n>6. It is possible that the books are laid out on a table and then examined.<n>7. Books are also examined before reading them, so this option is not an exclusive choice.<n>8. Because of this, D: read book is the correct answer.<n>So the final ans is D:read book<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the multiple choice question.

Choices:  A: art room B: police station C: classroom D: desk drawer E: school<n>Output:		1."What building has a ot many glue bottles?" could be an error in the English spelling, but, grammatically, it is correct. The question is correctly spelled as shown.<n>2. The choice to include a misprinted word, like 'o' instead of 'of,' would reflect the author's own carelessness or even a purposeful misspelling to illustrate the importance of accuracy.<n>3. Therefore, the incorrect word in the second sentence indicates that the building has many glue bottles (a).<n>So the final answer should be "A: art room"<n><n>Input:She has a lot ot interest in art.  Choices:  A. art room B. art museum C. drawing classes D. desk drawer E. pencil<n>Output:  She has a lot ot interest is a common American spelling, that is, there is no "u" inserted between the words "of" and "interest" in American English.<n>2.  Choices: A, C, E are invalid/illogical since the original sentence did not contain an "u". (so, should be 'ot/too').<n>3. Choices B and D cannot be correct since the original sentence says "She has a lot of interest IN art" (so should be "D." desk drawer).<n>4. However, Choice A. art room, is a correct choice because it shows us that she has a lot of interest in art. She has a lot of interest as illustrated by the fact that she frequents the art room.<n>5. Thus, the sentence should be "A. art room"<n><n><n>Input: She has a lot ot interests Choices:  A B C D E<n>Output: She has a lot of interests is grammatically incorrect, but, given that grammatical correctness in English is not as strict as that in other languages like French, Japanese, etc., it might be okay.<n><n><n>Input: The cats have a lot od interest in this case. Choices:  A C D E<n>Output:"The cats have a lot of interest in this case" is more likely what the person wrote. It is likely that the person's intended version was "The cats have a great interest in this case." As such, the above grammatical structure may be more common than this correct version.

It seemed like the guys there did nothing but what? Choices:  A: dance B: getting drunk C: meet new people D: having fun E: have fun<n>Output:		In a similar context, in an earlier paragraph, Jimmy is shown to be reluctant to attend a party he is invited to. This implies that he will be annoyed at the activities at the party, because he doesn't like things to get too loud or exciting. However, attending these parties isn't likely to prevent him from dancing or causing a scene, because he has indicated that he enjoys these activities previously.<n>So the final choice is A: drinking<n><n>Input:I'll be able to find some food, or I won't care.  What?  Choices:  A.  I'll be able to B.  I'll do C.  Do I will D.  Do I eat E.  Will I be able to<n>Output: 1.'I'll be able'.  Here, the 'care' relates to not being able to find food during their journey.  Therefore, the answer is 'will I be able to find some...' <n>2.  The word in relation to the question is 'care'.<n>3.  In the preceding paragraph, the question refers to the characters not caring what they find on their journey.  Therefore the answer cannot be 'I will do' or 'Do I eat'. <n>4.  The context also implies that all are concerned about food, and this concern is the reason that 'I' care.  So, neither 'I' nor 'I will' are appropriate.<n><n>Input: I think that you should get a puppy.  But what? Choices: A: not feed or B: not fatten C: not put or D: put on E: put up F: put down G: puppies don't put themselves down.<n>Output: 1) The text says 'I think'.  And it is implied that what he thinks is that his friend should get a puppy, otherwise he wouldn't suggest such a thing.<n>2) He says "you should get a puppy" but what he wants to say is "you should get a pup" and the 'but what. I think' implies that "but what do i think or my feeling towards it"<n>3) He is suggesting to get a puppy and his friend's reply "puppies don't do such things " seems like it was a suggestion that he is asking for getting a puppy and not

Choices:  A: battle field B: museum C: weapon D: canon E: tornado<n>Output:		<n><n>For Question 1, the answer is B. Battle fields are where bullets get shot, and if anything, bullets don't get shot into museums.<n>For question 2 the answer is D<n>In both of these questions, the answer lies in the given details. In question 1, it can be assumed that there has been a war, which is where canons shoot off bullets which would land on battlefields. Where canons shoot off bulleted projects isn't in a museum, and tornados don't have guns on them firing any canons, so there are no battleships. It's also unlikely that bullets would get shot to a weapon, since it's more likely that the bullet would break apart and not make to the weapon for use to be had.<n>In question 2, it can be assumed the bullet found is from a war- the context says weapon, which implies guns are being used, and guns need munitions in order to shoot.<n>

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:The obsessive man was always washing hands, he had even done it so much once that it caused a what? Choices:  A: use soap B: irritation C: cleanliness D: thinking E: wet towel<n>Output:		1: The obsessive man was being careful: he was washing his hands. It can be seen from the text that he likes to wash with soap; and this is not the question.<n>So we can omit the words 'use' and'soap':<n><n>If we omit the words 'excessively' and'so', it reads:<n><n>The obsessive man always washed hands excessively. It caused a wet towel [I would say "wet towel" is not important to the question]<n>2:The obsessive was being careful: he had even done it excessively once that caused a wet towel.<n><n><n>3:The obsessive being careful resulted in wet towel.<n> <n>4.<n> <n>The obsessive often washing hands resulted in wet towel: so obsessing leads to wet towel... so the answer is wet towel!<n>So the final answer will be WET TOWEL<n><n>Input: "Every person is unique and no two people are alike."  In what sense can this be said? Choices:  a) Scientific B) Cultural [C in text] C) Poetical D) Philosophical E) Artistic<n>Output: 'Every person is unique and none other are like' could easily apply to any person, and thus every person is unique. This makes it scientifically true. <n><n>Input:The boy was so smart that he would not play the board game 'Chess' for long. He would just make everything what? He would not even bother to make the move in every alternate what? He would just quickly make it because he was so much smart that he wouldn't really need to apply his mind. Choices:  A. Fashionable, B. Complete, C. Practical, D. Complicated, E. Perfect<n>Output: 'in each turn' makes it clear to us that every turn, the person needs to apply their mind, but the boy would not need to.<n>We can understand that the boy was so smart that no matter what he did, he could always find a simpler alternative to it. So that's probably what he was smart for.<n><n><n>The only ways to play Chess are A) Practical, B) Fashionable, C) Complete, D) Perfect, and E) Complicated.<n><n>So the answer will

Choices:  A: africa B: north pole C: roof D: canada E: surface of earth<n>Output:		1) the clue is "know"<n>2) The answer cannot be any of the places listed, because those places do not always have snow. The question asks specifically where always SNOWS!<n>3) Therefore CANADA! A place that is always known to have snow, because it is a snowy place!<n>So the correct answer is CANADA<n><n>Input:The answer is not in the last three. Choices: A: four B: four hundred thousand C: three D: twenty E: thirteen million<n>Output: the answer is not in the options or the last three numbers. The question is not worded to include the last three choices. Therefore, the answer is three or twenty, but not twenty or thirty<n>So the answer is twenty<n><n>Input:It is in the last three.  Choices: A: ten B: eleven C: twelve D: four E: thirteen<n>Output: It is in the last three and cannot be in the first 2 because it can't possibly be in three of the first 2 and not in three of the last 2, so we know the answer is in the last two, but it is not in the second one, so the answer is in the third one, that is, 12.<n><n>Input:What is not in the last five? Choices: ten B: eleven D: thirteen<n>E: twenty one<n>Output: 10, 13, 21 are all in the last three because they're above 15.<n>1 is the smallest answer in the last three, so 4 -1 = 3 is the smallest number not in last 5.<n>So the answer is 3<n><n>Input:It must be either 1 or 2. Choices: B: three five C: eight D: four five E: twelve<n>Output: It cannot be 3 or 5 because that would mean that the answer is 2 or 6. Because we know that the answer will be either 1 or two, and we do not have options 4 or 6. So it is one of the other two.<n>4 is the smallest in the first 3 choices, but it is not the fourth consecutive number. 5 is the largest in the first three choices, but you can't have 25 as the answer. 6 is one of the final two options.

Choices:  A. The flowers were very beautiful.  B. The flowers smelled strong.  C. There were a lot of different types of flowers.  D.  The flowers were red, yellow, and purple.  E. I've never smelled them myself.<n>Output: 1 As the teacher wanted to "smell the flowers", the flowers cannot be smelling themselves.<n>2 Based on the context, the flowers can smell "strong".<n>3 There are a lot of different types (kinds) of flowers, so there cannot only be a red, yellow, and a purple colour flower.<n>4 I've never smelt flowers before either.<n>5 However, all the choices given are true statements.<n>6 It can be concluded that the flowers must have been very beautiful.<n><n><n>

The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:Where would you put a light? Choices:  A: ocean B: desk C: universe D: attic E: chair<n>Output:		The answer lies with the definition of the phrase light.<n>If a light is a bright, flaming object, as described in the passage, then your answer must be D, the attic because it gives that answer the most credibility.<n>However, I believe the correct answer is actually B<n>First, the passage mentions the use of a spotlight, but then also says to turn on the light. That's a pretty important difference, because if you're talking about a spotlight it's not the same thing as just turning on a light.<n>Then, there are very concrete terms, like desk and universe. I don't imagine in our universe that you can reach the universe (you cannot. The universe is limitless.), so the correct answer has to be B, the desk.<n>Next, the ocean is not a place where you commonly would see a spotlight. You could set a spotlight on the ocean and it would be lit, but there's not a spotlight above you with the ocean below you like an attic. That doesn't make sense.<n>Finally, an attic would never use a spotlight. In the definition of a spotlight, you wouldn't want to use an attic. An attic is dark and an attic and attic. A spotlight is used in dark, unlit places, where attics are usually located (if that sounds familiar, it's because you're probably referring to spiders and spider webs).<n>Input: Some days I walk in the dark, and I find myself wondering how I got to where I am.  Maybe I dreamed it before I knew it was a dream.  Or perhaps I walked and walked and I forgot where I was headed and how.  It’s easy to lose direction in a world like ours: so much is so far from what you want.  Maybe on the other side of the dream I’ll know whether I succeeded in what I set out to do.  Or perhaps on the other side, everything will be so different, that the thing I had in mind won’t make any difference.  In the meantime, I walk on and I wonder how I came to be.  Perhaps the world was different for me.  I never ask. I don’t like to think about the difference.  I just don’t like what I dream is reality.<n>Output: What does the quoted part

Choices:  A: liberal B: heretical C: recalcitrant D: conservadox E: heretical<n>Output:		1) The priest was pushing for more orthodox behavior 1) Orthodox behaviors are the traditional accepted social norms 2) The suggested alternative would be recalcitrant behavior, which means resisting the orthodox view 3) Since heretical behavior is opposite to orthodox behavior, the choice is not correct, but recalcitrant behavior would oppose orthodox behavior  4) Conservadox behavior is also an option, but it is not as close a match and there is no mention of any kind of behavior related to that definition<n>5) Conservadox is a term that means conservative and liberal, and does not imply orthodoxy.<n>6) Therefore, the correct answer is B: heretical<n><n>### Instructions: Answer the following multiple choice question<n><n>Input: In order to explain his inactivity, the professor offered an unsatisfactory, what kind of explanation? Choices: A: lame B: half-hearted C: impotent D: limp-wristed E: feeble<n>Output: 1 - The most accurate description of the professor's explanation is "lame" which means weak 2 - Lame and limp-wrist imply weakness, which is not always negative in some circumstances<n>3. "Limp-wrist" does not make sense given the context, but "impotent" could have been used to refer to something sexual, however, this is not mentioned in the sentence, so the answer cannot be A: impotent 4 - "Half-hearted" could potentially fit, however, it is also not mentioned in the sentence which weakens its accuracy 5 - "Feebly" or "feeble" could have been used, however "feebly" is not mentioned in the question (this is not a correct answer).<n>6- "Weak" would probably be the most accurate description, as it also does not mention "feeble" (this is also an accurate answer).

Choices:  A: asia B: southern hemisphere C: planet D: east E: earth<n>Output:		The question suggests that a Martian has to go someplace on Earth to find the Indian ocean.<n>1. Given this context, the Indian Ocean wouldn't be found in the Southern Hemisphere or Asia but in its most logical place, Earth, and even more specifically, the Eastern Hemisphere.<n>2. Since the text only refers to one spot, it's likely that option (D) represents the most likely answer.<n>3. Therefore, E: Earth is the correct answer. A Martian would find the Indian Ocean on Earth, more specifically, in the Eastern Hemisphere <n><n>Input:I am more and more of the opinion that science per se, at least as at present practiced, is not altogether necessary. Choices:  A. true B. false C. false D. true E. false<n><n>Output: The word 'per se' is derived from Latin and signifies 'in and of itself'.

Choices:  A: air B: water C: earth D: space shuttle E: tunnel<n>Output:		1)  The wording of this question tells us that we are in some sort of space suit.<n>2)  Oxygen is what you breathe, and air is what breathes you.<n>3)  Since we need oxygen, we are 'in air', and therefore on the planet earth.<n>4)  This does not exclude space shuttles however, nor does it mean that oxygen is present on a space shuttle, and therefore, the final answer is A: air. <n>So the final answer that is A: air<n><n>Input: He knew what he was doing was wrong, but he was powerless to stop himself. He was like a cocoon made of iron. Choices:  A. a prisoner B. a parasite C. a bird D. a spider E. a tiger<n>Output: 1: He was powerless: A powerless person can stop himself only if he has power to do so. Therefore, he was not so because he was powerless 2: He is like a Prisoner: A prisoner is in a cage but he can’t come out. Similarly, he cannot come out of his own cocoon by his power. He is in a cocoon of his own making but he cannot get out because he had no power.

The word that makes the author 'cruel' would imply that the reader was able to adapt themselves to other situations in their life, but found the idea of this poem so hard to adapt to, that he was being cruel to the reader. 2.) 'April' means the month of 'cruel'. And the author is also being cruel in this way. 3.) So the answer is  B: "Cruel" G: "Impressive"<n>So the final answer will

Choices:  A: practice B: dexterity C: idle time D: knowledge of music E: conductor<n>Output:		1. Fiddling around with the music book shows that the person has done much more than just listen to the music.<n>2. From these two elements, the person would not be able to 'play' without practice or dexterity.<n>3. However, this does not necessarily mean that the person does not have idle time or knowledge of music.<n>4. The idleness may have occurred only before or outside playing the music, and not during playing.<n>5. Also, knowledge of music depends on more than just fiddling with the music book, and so that may not really be a factor.<n>6. However, since this is followed by a question about practice, the person may not be playing because he/she doesn't have dexterity, since it is mentioned much before.<n>7. Given all this, the person would not have been able to play if he/she did not have practice.<n>8. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 'practice.'<n><n>Input:I really wish I could have been there for the rehearsal, but I was just coming from an office meeting, so I really can't take off.  I have meetings with the managing partners next week and I'm just going to have to miss this one.<n><n>Output:The first question mentions that the person wished he could have been there for a rehearsal, and hence was not there.<n><n>The second question confirms that meeting with important people is the reason he/she is not attending the rehearsal.<n><n>Considering the context, it seems that the person was busy attending meetings on the day of the rehearsal and has some really great reasons not to miss any of the meetings.<n><n>An office meeting is clearly an important activity with important people.<n><n>Given this context, the person has not'missed' the rehearsal because it was so important that he/she could not miss the meeting with the managing partners.<n><n>The person just'missed out' on attending the rehearal. <n>The correct answer is that the person does not mean to'miss' the rehearsals, but rather has'missed' them.<n><n>Input: He is known to be an expert in his field, so his arguments are likely to be accepted by many.<n><n>Output:<n><n>The sentence mentions '

How might she come off? Choices:  A: cold B: unfamiliar C: unknown D: unacquainted E: shy<n>Output:		1."Unfamiliar" doesn't mean "cold" or "warm." So this option is unacceptable.<n>2. Similarly, "Unknown" doesn't necessarily mean "cold" and "Unacquainted" doesn't mean cold, warm, or comfortable either. It's best to look at synonyms.<n>3. These questions have very similar answers: Shy, uncomfortable, uneasy. If someone is shy, they're likely to be uncomfortable or uneasy. <n>4. "Shy" is a synonym of "uncomfortable/uneasy." Therefore, the word that best completes the sentence is 3. D: uncomfortable.Mary didn't find James familiar or comfortable to speak to because she was unfamiliar with him.<n><n><n><n># Input: This is the hardest problem in the test!!<n><n>Input: We can't afford for anyone to know where this is located, and unfortunately, a few people have already discovered its location.

Choices:  A: jigsaw puzzle B: chess game C: puzzle box D: jigsaw puzzel puxxle E: puxxle<n>Output:		This one's an easy one.

Therefore, juice is the answer as the one which is eaten the most.<n><n>Input:What happens when you mix iron with oxygen?? Out of the six choices the output may be any of the following:<n>1. nothing 2. fire 3. rusting 4. nothing<n>5. metal, 6. metal<n>Output: You cannot mix iron and oxygen as iron is a metal and oxygen is a gas.<n>So when we mix it we are going to get metal, as the choice and the output is the same.<n><n>Input:Which of these options is not a way to tell a lie? Choices: 1. use blinking 2. tell the truth 3. use your voice only 4. use your legs only 5. use body language only<n>Output: Using blinking is not the only way to tell a lie. We could do it through the use of our voices, in which case "lying" would mean telling an untruth. Our body language can be a clue as to the truth
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:What happens to the conscience of someone who has been caught committing a murder? Choices:  A: jail time B: fear C: going to prison D: nothing E: feeling of guilt<n>Output:		John received no punishment or prison time for his crime despite getting caught.  As he was caught red-handed, one might expect a prison sentence.  However, it was revealed later that he killed the victim in self-defense and that he was legally innocent.  Therefore, the proper choice would be  E:  "feeling of guilt".  John would suffer the guilt of committing a crime and being innocent at the same time.<n><n>Input: Someone who has lost all hope can be considered what? Choices: A: miserable B: melancholy C: cheerful D: cheerless E: hopeless<n>Output: Since cheerful implies 'pleasant' and cheerless implies 'displeasing', "cheerful" and "cheerless" would be equally applicable.  There are also two other possible definitions: 1. A person without hope is hopeless by definition and 2. A person with no hope has lost hope by definition.<n><n>In the case of "all hope is lost", it is quite certain that the individual has lost hope and is therefore hopeless.<n><n>I have seen at least one version of the rhetorical device where "without hope" is replaced by "not happy".  I believe that the first two definitions are the primary concerns when choosing a correct answer.<n>Therefore, in view of these two dictionary definitions, my choice is "without hope".<n><n>Input: What does the phrase "the last straw" mean? Choices: A : one more nail B: all the time C : the end D: all the way E: one last  time<n>Output: While I understand the first four choices, "a last straw" makes more sense to me.  You pick up a straw by its end, which would imply that it is the last straw.<n>For example, if someone broke into your home, you would get up quickly to the sound of one last straw breaking and see someone with a sack over his shoulder running past your window, in which case, you would know that they were the "last straw".  In such a case, "last straw" could easily be replaced with "final straw".<n><n>Comment: What is the source of these questions?

Choices:  A: mouth B: grocery store C: constructing models D: shed E: box<n>Output:		1. The context of this sentence implies that there is information missing in the phrase. <n>2. Given that "farmers" are the ones keeping or looking for the toothpicks and there is no specified location, "farms" will better fit such a descriptive phrase.<n>3. Thus the missing element in the phrase is missing the appropriate object, in this case farms not grocery stores.<n>4. Therefore, A: mouth is incorrect.<n>5. B:grocery storeis inappropriate too. A farmer might go grocery shopping, but this is not what we are trying to describe.<n>6. C: constructing models is probably used to describe a scene in a movie.<n>7.D: shed and E: box are unfamiliar options to the context.<n>8. Therefore, D: shed is not the correct option. It simply does not sound right.<n>9. The final answer is D: shed<n><n>Input: Aunt Jenny's mom is my grandmother's sister.  Choices:  A. cousin B: daughter C: uncle D: niece E: grandmother<n>Output: 1). Aunt Jenny' is a term of endearment, usually used to refer to one's sister by her mother.<n>2. There is nothing in the sentence that indicates she is related or refers to any specific 'Jenny'.<n>3. It simply states that the'my grandmothers sister' is someone's aunt.<n>4. Therefore A: cousin is incorrect. If someone's mother's sister is the only relation, this person would be their aunt, not a cousin.<n>5. B) daughter sounds strange, considering 'Jenny' is not indicated to be the mother or anyone's daughter.<n>6. The correct answer is D) niece<n><n><n><n><n>```<n>Output: 1)A: mouth is incorrect because the phrase has no mention of 'toothpick<n>2)B:grocery store is incorrect because a farmer would go for groceries, not toothpicks.<n>3)C: constructing models is incorrect because constructing models is not relevant to a farmer.<n>4)E: box is incorrect because a farmers keeps his toothpicks in the mouth, hence the mouth.<n>5)D: shed is

Choices:  A: library B: study area C: table D: classroom E: shelf<n>Output:		The dictionary is being compared with other objects, therefore, a 'dictionary while you're using' would indicate that 'it' is being used.<n>6. Therefore dictionary in this context means a book or a collection of documents in which data or information is organised. The question suggests that we need to identify the other objects that it may be used with.  The context indicates that it is not likely to be kept with library or study area because they are destinations, while table and classroom are objects.<n>7. The question is looking for a table or the classroom. Here, it can be any surface. This answer is wrong because a book is meant to be put on a surface and dictionary is a book made up of words and is used for reference which means the dictionary can be put on a shelf or a bookcase.<n>8. The answer is therefore a 'table'. The context indicates that 'table' is the best answer because 'where' is the primary term (predicate) while 'dictionary' is the secondary term (object).<n>Output:  Answer 'D' refers to the adjective - antonym which describes the opposite of the subject word to put in the blank space. In such questions, the adjective and the noun are related but not inter-connected. Therefore, it's possible to reverse the order and change the answer too. In other words - 'noun in' or 'nouns are' in can be replaced with 'adjectives are'.<n>So we would need an adjective that describes the opposite of a dictionary.<n>In this context, 'not detailed' and 'lacking detail' is a synonym that describes an opposite meaning. The choice 'C: complete' is incorrect because it's a part of the subject and hence, no different from a dictionary. The choice 'A: classroom' is erroneous as well because it's not related to the question.<n>Therefore, the correct answer is 'lacking detail'.<n><n>Output:<n>As 'A' means first and 'B' means subsequent, the first alphabet of the answer has to be placed first. We get 'AB'.  Now, by eliminating 'C', 'AD' will be the answer.<n>The choices for 'AB' can be:<n>As an adjective, 'active' is an antonym of 'passive' and denotes the opposite of the noun - 'their own work'

Choices: 	   A: the park B: the gym C: the beach D: the grocery store E: the bar   <n>Output : 1) The context suggests someone is going to place that has a beach.<n>2) The question is asking which place has a beach, not which place is a beach. <n>3) 'The park' and 'the gym' are not places that have beaches.<n>4) Therefore, the correct answer is C. <n>After explaining, show the final answers.<n><n>### Example:  "What are you doing right now?

Choices:  A: backpack B: dog show C: chinese food D: french E: good hands<n>Output:		The joke is that dogs are eaten in Chinese food. Chinese food is not a cuisine. A: backpack B = not a cuisine C = chinese does not eat dogs D = french does not have that name E = good hands not a cuisine<n>Finally, the correct answer to this question is D, French. The joke states that French people eat small dogs or dogs with small bones. This implies that they refer to Chinese food with the same name. So the reference to backpacks would have been in the wrong place. The reference to backhands doesn't make sense in this way, and so is not the right answer.<n>So the final line is D: French<n><n>Input: John is such a dishonest crook that he will sell his mother for a bowl of stew.  Choices: A: 10,000 B: 1,000,000,304,609 C: 296 D: 3846,4<n>Output:<n>This question contains several contradictions, and so the answer does not have a single answer.  Since money is not shown to be the correct answer, and selling the mother as well cannot be the correct answer, nor could it be the answer B.<n>However, if you choose A, then John's mother has less of a value than a bowl of stewed beans. This may be absurd, but stewed beans are actually called "beans in a bowl."  I don't think that's worth selling your mom for, and thus would be an unsuccessful answer.  D could be an answer, as it is closer to the value of his mother, but it is unambiguously not a "bowl of stew."<n>So let's go to B, the only remaining answer; it's not that absurd, and the fact that that there's no number given seems irrelevant. If you multiply the "billion" by the "thousand," then it's more reasonable, especially since 4,609 is about equal to the population of New York City, which is quite small compared to billions.<n><n>Therefore, the final answer is B: 1,100,003,046,904<n><n>Input: There are

Choices:  A: do enjoy B: get laid C: enjoyable D: work less E: enjoy living<n>Output:		1) Based on the context, the frat boys have been working for a long time and are now finally done. The question suggests a celebration. (2) The students will most likely be having fun with whatever they will do because they've been doing hard work and might just want to relax, (be carefree) or have a good time. (3) The phrasing of "do what tonight" also suggests enjoyable activities. 4) In the previous paragraph, the text specifically says "They can get laid". The text does not say that they will enjoy themselves by getting laid. (5) Finally, none of the other answers are implied in the statement above. Hence, the most appropriate answer would be B.<n>So, the final answer is B: get laid

Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:There was a show on television about a ranger who loved flowers, but the next day it was about a gardener who also loved flowers.  It was a what? Choices:  A: countryside B: anthology C: dull read D: state park E: surface of earth<n>Output:		1) The phrase 'a show on television' implies that the context involves watching a television program.<n>A possible scenario: A man who enjoys gardening is watching TV while relaxing on his couch.<n>2) The phrase 'but the next day it was' suggests that it was about a different subject on the next day.<n>2) The TV show was the'same content' as the second show that followed it.<n>3) The phrase 'about a gardener who also loves flowers' implies that the second show was also about somebody who enjoyed flowers.<n>4) However, this contradicts the wording of the second show being 'about' a ranger, which is different from someone who loves flowers. (I.e. it's about a ranger, not about somebody who loves flowers)<n>5) Together, these three factors strongly suggest that the program was an anthology show, which has shows that are unrelated in terms of content, and not about the same thing.<n>So the final words 'about a ranger who loved plants, but the next day about a gardener who loves flowers' suggests a show that was an anthology, which is the reason why the possible answer are<n><n>Input: When she got home, Mary gave her roommate a key to keep in a safe place for when Mary was out.

It was what? Choices: P: funny B: a tragedy C: a comedy D: a drama E: a romance<n>Output: As the question implies the woman is searching for her true love, the phrase 'does not end well' strongly suggests a negative connotation (like love does not endure), and so the answer would be an E: a tragedy<n><<n><n>Input.The new student wore a coat that was black and purple and that shone as it came down the hallway.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:If I have a vintage, decorative light source in my possession, what is it likely to be? Choices:  A: sun B: sky C: candle D: house E: lamp<n>Output:		1A. The most likely candidates for light sources are the sun or the sky.<n>2. The only mention of a 'vintage, decorative' anything is a light source, so it must be the'source' that is 'decorative'.<n>3A. However, if light sources were decorative, the sun, the sky and the candle would also be decorative.<n>3B. As decorativeness is not specified, the lamp's decorativeness cannot be distinguished from other light sources.<n>4A. Even if 'light source' is specified as the 'vintage, or decorative' thing, there is no specific mention of the source's light properties.<n>4B. Candles, the sky, and the sun were mentioned as possible light sources so those can be ruled out.<n>4C. However, the house and the lamp both seem to be sources of lights so those can be distinguished.<n>4D. The most likely candidate for the decorative light source is the house which is decorated and has lights.<n>5. Therefore, the house being decorative and having lights seems the most likely. The light source is a decorative house with lights. <n>So the final answer could be any of B, E, or D in combination.<n><n>Input:It takes two parts 59 and 7 to form the largest composite number of the three. Choices:  A B C D E<n>Output: 1: 59 and 2:7 makes 66 and 3:5 and 6 makes 39<n>2:The question asks us to choose the numbers which, combined, form the largest composite number.<n>3:Therefore, when we combine any two of the numbers to form such a composite number, we will get the largest composite number. One way to combine the numbers such that we get the largest composite number is to multiply the two of them together.<n>4:Therefore, the solution is: 'D: CAN'T BE DONE', because the answer must be two numbers, one of which we combine with another to form a composite number greater than two or three.<n>5:If combining the numbers we got a composite number greater than 3, the question would have asked us to choose the numbers that makes that number.<n>So we're given information about only two numbers, 59 and 5. The answer is C.<n><n>Input
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3.

The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:He was good at traditional science but excelled at social science, his favorite subject was what? Choices:  A: geography B: history studies C: math D: religion E: dancing<n>Output:		As indicated in the first sentence, the author of the text describes that he was good at traditional science subjects and excelled the most in social science. Choice A: Geography, is an unconnected statement which has no basis in the text - the author does not claim or imply that one of his best subjects is geography. Choice B: History studies: is not an option as, again, it is not based on the author’s description. The second sentence clarifies that the author’s favorite subject, according to the author, is math, which is not an option as the sentence does not confirm that the author’s top preference is math. Therefore, the author’s favorite subjects are math, which is D, and the only choice that makes complete sense with the text. Choice E: Dancing - has no basis or context in the text;<n>so it is not an option.<n>So the final option is D: Math<n><n>Input: His favorite subject is History studies. So his favorite subject was what kind of study? What is the subject? Choices:  history studies A: studying of history B: study of the study C: study of the subject D: study of the student E: study of himself<n>Output: The first sentence in this excerpt is the same sentence we analyzed in part 61. When we analyze it, however, we realize that the subject is in fact History studies (not Math, as we were expecting). So we focus on the next sentence, which tells us that History studies is indeed his favorite subject. Therefore, he likes studying history.<n>So the final choice (option) is: D: study of the subject<n><n>Output: Choice A: studying of history  would be a good answer if the author had said, for example, "He started reading History studies" in order to suggest that he was studying the subject. However, he did not make any such statement.<n>Choice B: study of the studies is completely unrelated to the text: one cannot study the subject of History studies.<n>Choice C: study of the study would be correct if he had said that he likes studying the study of History studies, but he did not. Once again, we can look at the text, "His favorite subject is History studies" to understand what he is studying: History!<n>Choice D: study of the students means that the author is studying people, which is not true, since he stated that History

Choices:  A: sitting down B: excitement C: tiredness D: progress E: procrastination<n>Output:		1. The question suggests a general inability to begin work and get it done.<n>2. The phrase in which the question appears uses 'beginning' to mean'starting'.<n>3. The choices offered are also related to starting or beginning.<n>4. A: sitting down does not really relate to a beginning of work.<n>5. B: excitement would suggest a problem in starting work for a number of different unrelated reasons.<n>6. Excitement is something that occurs when starting work.<n>7. C: tiredness suggests a problem related to starting and completing work.<n>8. D: progress is a concept related to the process of completing and finishing work.<n>9. E: procrastinating suggests a problem with motivation but not starting.<n>10.

Choices:  A: sickness B: motion sickness C: relocation D: jet lag E: fatigue<n>Output:		The text states, "...he sat quietly, watching the twilight turn to darkness outside the window".<n>1.The paragraph talks about the traveller who sat and waited for a long time after a long day of travelling.<n>2. The word used in this context is the "long" and "longer travel".<n>3. Thus, after a long day of journey, travellers usually get tired and sick.<n>4. This is the main clue, jet lag is not included in the context of the sentence, therefore the answer is E: fatigue.<n><n>Input:The doctor told her,  “It is inevitable; there is nothing that you can do.” Her response was something akin to, Choices: A. “I don't care.” B. “You have no business making prognostications.” C. “But I am not ready to die.”<n> D. “Not if I have something to say about it.” E. “You have to listen to me for a minute.” Output:The context of the paragraph is the doctor who told the patient that her condition is inevitable. Also, the patient refused to die.<n>1. In this paragraph, all three choice words are interrogative words such as  “I don’t care.”  “You have no business..”  “But I am notready to die.”<n>2. However, only two choice words are appropriate to match with the remaining sentence,  “Not if I have  something to say about it”  and  ” You have to listen to me..” <n>3. Although all four words have the same meaning and  can be used to match the above sentence, but only D: "Not if I have something...

Choices:  A:"generous" has two meanings. One meaning is that the present tense is correct. The other meaning is that the past tense is correct. B:"generous" is an adjective and there is only one meaning "so kind / extravagant". C:"generous" means "so kind". D:"generous" is used as an adjective.<n>Output:<n>A: "generous" is used adverbially, as an intensifier of "kind". This is why 'it was extravagant'.<n><n>B: In this context, the word 'kind' means "friendly", "helpful". Hence, "kind" is an attribute modifier of the noun "lessons". Thus, this sentence is inappropriate as the word 'generous' is an adjective which modifies the noun 'lessons' and means "generous", whereas "free" is an adjective which means "not costing money".<n><n>C: "so kind" would mean the noun, but here the word "kind" has the modifier "so" which limits it to "extravagant", and thus, the sentence would mean "I went to the library  to read for free".<n><n>D: The dictionary shows that "generous" can be used as an adjective with its positive sense "so kind"; in context it also has its negative sense of "unnecessary". Since the word "unnecessary" is not given as an option, this sentence is incorrect.<n>Thus, the only correct sentence is A: "The forty-five minutes' worth of free lessons were generous".<n><n>Input:Everybody was staring at Tom, with a disgusted face as if the sight of him made one almost throw up.

Choices:  A: hurry along B: direct traffic C: help D: force open door E: corner thief<n>Output:		 The policemen wanted to clear traffic, so what else would they do? Choices: 1. Corner thief? They are already policemen, why would there be policemen cornering thieves?<n>2. Direct traffic?? No. This answer is clearly wrong<n>3. Help?? Why would policemen already help??<n>4. Force open door?? No. Why would the police be force opening doors??<n>It is obvious that force opening doors, for some random reason that they must help the ambulance to enter and leave the scene of the accident. Choices A and B are thus incorrect. 5. They want to clear traffic because there is an accident on their way. 6. Thus, they want to help, and force open door to help the ambulance. The option C: helped was the correct answer.<n><n>Input: The policewoman knew the victim, but who would know her as well? Choices: A: the criminal B: the witness C: the ambulance D: the criminal's lawyer E: the victim's lawyer<n>Output: The policewoman knows a witness and a victim. But, who else will know the victim and also the witness? There are only two options: 1. The victim's lawyer<n>2. The criminal's lawyer 3. It seems to be a strange fact but it is true that the criminal's lawyer knows the victim, the witness and knows also the victim's lawyer.<n>It seems a bit tricky but this was a tricky statement. We just need to understand that, the victim's lawyer knows the criminal and knows the criminal's lawyer. Thus, the criminal's lawyer too knows the victim, the criminal and the victim's lawyer as he is the lawyer for the victim against the criminal (victim=criminal and the lawyer=criminal's lawyer). Thus, the criminal' law would know also the victim's attorney. It seems a bit confusing but we just need to grasp the situation properly and we will get the correct answer. 5. It is true that as the victim's lawyer is also a part of the victim or in other words the criminal, so his client knows also the criminal. 6. Thus The criminal's lawyer knows also the victim' lawyer and is also a part of his client or vice versa. 7. Hence the criminal's lawyer also knows the victim's lawyer or

Choices:  A: arena B: building C: dock D: concert hall E: museum<n>Output:		1) The question gives the context that the performers are on a platform in public, likely because of the way they are performing.<n>2) The context implies that a concert hall is the place where you would find a public performance<n>3) Given the context, it is most unlikely that performers would be on a dock, platform, or building given the public nature of their performance.<n>4) As they would be on a platform in public to perform, it makes sense for them to be in a concert hall.<n>5. Therefore, C: Concert Hall is the correct option.<n><n>Input: What did Mary say was funny at the party last night? Choices: 1: Jack 2: John 3: Harry 4: Sally<n>Output:<n>1.

The correct answer suggests that the question is about eating fruit (fruit eating can only be in the context of eating)<n>5th sentence: "An engineering school." The incorrect answer does not suggest that the question is about the outcome (eating) but something to be done (something to eat?). It is just more something to do.<n>6th sentence: "A street in San Franscisco". The incorrect answer suggests that the question should be about the outcome again. It does not answer how can you eat fruit on the bridge.<n>7th sentence: "A tree."

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness.

Choices:  A: sore B: intercourse C: fatigue D: become tired E: expression<n>Output:		1: Dancing for a long time is not likely to lead anyone to become more or less of certain qualities.<n><n>1: Therefore, 'become' is not a valid option here.<n>2: To become tired would require a considerable amount of time and energy, both of which dancing consumes.<n>3: Therefore, 'expressive' is the correct answer.<n><n>Input:Dropping in at a dance on the spur of the moment may seem like a good idea, but there's no guarantee you're going to enjoy yourself.  A great dance can be a life-changing experience, but it is by no means a universal cure for such ailments as what? choices:  A: anemia B: headache C: hunger D: loneliness E: boredom<n>Output: 1) We can see from this example sentence that if a person attends a dance impulsively, there is no guarantee that he will "enjoy himself". 2) Hence, attending a dance on a whim can turn out to be a huge waste of time for the person.<n>3) However, if the dance is a good one, it could turn out to be a life-changer.<n>4) Therefore, the correct option would be the last one, 'life-changer'.<n>The sentence says the opposite of "life-changing experience" and since "life changing experience" implies "happy outcome", as the opposite of it, "negative outcome" is the answer.<n><n>Input:"You're not going to a bar for a drink!

However, the question "may" suggests that, though the software may require interaction, it may not be a direct interaction.<n>2 The fact that the software may require users to interact indicates that the users will need to do something in order to interact, thus suggesting the correct answer is either A: "users will need to learn how to interface" or B: "users will need learn to interface with it".<n>3 If users must learn how to interface to interact with the software, then the software may, in fact, be in need of upgrades in order to allow users to interact in such a way, implying that the answer to the question "may require users learn how to interface the new computer software" is C: "may require" users "to learn how to interface" the updated software.<n><n>Input:A lot of people think they are not a lot. Choices:  "A lot" of people  "A lot of" people  The" "a lot of" people  People are lot of"The people  People" are a lot of<n>Output:  The key to choosing the right option is knowing that in the sentence, the word "lot" refers to a large number or quantity.

Choices:A: striving B: yearning C: anxious D: eager E: hopeful<n>Output:1) First, the question suggests the existence of something that involves mystery or secrets to learn. <n>2) Then, the next sentence states that she had "long heard of the existence of" this "mystery" (the rest of the first sentence is unnecessary to understand)<n>3) However, she was glad to know that she knew what she knew and that the mystery involved didn't mean everything.<n>4) That fact suggests that she didn't know the "full" truth, but was glad about the mystery.<n>5) So the sentence suggests that the "full" truth is probably not as interesting as the partial truth she already knows.<n>6) Therefore, the sentence implies that the true meaning of the 'full mystery' is "it isn't as interesting or important as I previously thought".<n>7) So the key word to be added is "it isn' t as important."<n>8) This would make sense given the context.<n>9) However, the most important word to be added is hopeful.<n>10) This is because the implication of the sentence is that the knowledge of the "full" truth may be a good or bad thing - but the sentence implies the hope that the truth isn't too devastating, since she is glad to know what she does know.

Choices:  A: movies B: opera C: theater D: lecture hall E: hockey game<n>Output:		1) The first two sentences clearly indicate that seats are more likely to be located in bleachers. <n>2) The text also states that bleachers are most likely to be associated with "a variety of sports", which might include hockey. <n>3) The mention of "large events" could include both a concert and a hockey game. There is no reason to discount opera (C) and theater (D), as these could be large cultural events as well. <n>4) Furthermore, the inclusion of 'lecture hall' (E) implies an academic or higher education setting. The mention of a "lecture hall" does not indicate whether the lecture and the seat both take place in the lecture hall, or another setting altogether. Hence, this option is not relevant in the current context. <n>5) Finally, there is no mentioning of the opera, nor is it included as a part of the larger set of "theater". <n>6) As a result, this leaves us with options A, C, and D.<n>7) 'Bleachers are most likely found at a hockey game' does not rule out the possibility of an opera occurring in bleachers as well. However, the question is about where bleachers are most _likely_ to be found, rather than being sure about the location of bleachers. Bleachers could be found at many sports events in some cases, but they are _likely_ to be in bleachers for hockey. <n>8) In this case, the likely answer will be bleachers because of the large focus on hockey and the reference to a "hockey arena".<n>9) The correct answer is A: movies<n><n>Input:There are 120 members in our club now. Choices:  A. 0 B. 10 C. 100 D. 000 E. 120<n>Output:1. The first sentence mentions that there are currently 120 members.<n>2. In the first paragraph, the author states that the club is growing. <n>3. The second paragraph mentions that there are over 100 members.<n>4. The third paragraph indicates that there are 110 members.<n>5. Taking all this information into consideration: <n>6. _Number of Members_ is a subset of _Club members_, so the number of members is
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:Where are you if your reading magazines while waiting for a vehicle on rails? Choices:  A: vegetables B: market C: doctor D: train station E: bookstore<n>Output:		You're waiting for the metro or the train, according to your choice of word. "On" suggests that the person reading is on the rail itself. "In" implies that the person is not on the rail, but on a station platform, so E is the correct answer.<n>So the final output is E) Book<n><n>Input:I had planned to meet my wife at the train station, but alas, she was late again. Choices:  A. Late yesterday B. Late today C. Late last week D. Late last year E. Late last month<n>Output: It is obvious that the time mentioned is yesterday. "Lateness" for the second question hints that the meeting is delayed. That being said, "late" is used in a way that does not refer to time but to fault or failure, so B) Late yesterday is the correct answer. Because the meeting was tardy, the correct answer is C.<n>So the final outcome is B. Late again<n><n>Input:When I go to the movies, I sit on the floor at least half the time. Choices: A. theater B. seat C. chair D. chair chair E. seat seat<n>Output: The use of "theater seats" implies that the user is referring to theater seats as opposed to other types of seats.<n>The phrasing could be something like "When I go to the theater, I usually sit on the floor at the last minute"<n>This is the way "theater seats" should be interpreted, and thus, "A theater" is the correct answer. So the final answer is A) Theater<n><n>Input:We're still trying to figure out why that guy was standing on the roof. Choices: A) He's a baker B) He loves the night sky C) He loves climbing. D) He loves baked goods. E) He is a clergyman.<n>Output: The phrase "figure out" tells me that we are trying to determine the exact reason for what he is doing.<n>The second part of the sentence, "the guy who climbed the rooftop," leads me to believe that someone climbed the roof and is standing on it while looking at the night sky.<n>This does not sound at all like a baker or a clergyman. He could have climbed the roofter for another reason, but baking and

Choices:  A: play B: movies C: theater D: screen E: television<n>Output:		If we are talking from the perspective of the screen itself, a theater or a movie screen would be the correct choice or answer but it does not make sense as theater is a building and a screen is flat (so, not a single screen but a bunch of them). We assume that the performer is standing on that screen, in front of an audience so that would rather suggest it would be a theater where all these things would happen together in one location.<n><n>The theater, the actor, and the audience would all be on the same screen - in front of the audience. So, C is the correct choice as it implies that the theater is not a physical theater building but a theater in front of an audience and on the same screen.<n><n>

Choices:  A: beast B: ugly C: ugliness D: satellite E: top of mountain<n>Output:		1) We can assume that the beauty loved the beast as that is the common sense inference.<n>2) In literature, 'beauty' and 'beast' can often be used to represent human and non-human characteristics, respectively.<n>3) 'Loved' is an emotional adjective, while'monster' is more of a metaphysical description.<n>4) Based on the text, the nickname of the beast could refer to the human or nonhuman characteristics the beast possessed.<n>5) Therefore, B: ugly could be a suitable answer or an 'ugly' metaphorical nickname for a human.<n>But in this case, the most likely answer is A: beast. Based on the context, the beast must possess some non-human characteristics that make it suitable for the beauty to love.<n>6) A nickname is also not necessarily related to the 'top of the mountain', though we can assume the beast is on top of the mountain.<n>7) Therefore, the correct answer must be A. 7) 'A: Beast' is the correct answer and 'A: Beast'.<n><n>IMPORTANT POINT: We need to ensure that our inferences, hypotheses or conclusions are based on the details in the extract. <n><n># Part2<n>## Sentiment Analysis<n>Let's check how accurate is the sentiment classification based on the accuracy values obtained above.<n><n><n>Input:  If you were in the middle of a fight between two supercomputers, which would you choose to help you?

Choices:  A: assisted living facility B: old people's home C: high school or college D: republican party E: organization<n>Output:		1) 'Sally's a senior in the House' suggests that Sally is a senior person in some kind of organization or 'house'.<n>2) The only two words (senior and House) we can be sure of are "senior person".<n>3) From there, we can rule out "assisted living facility" and "old people's home" as Sally is too young,<n>and doesn't refer to seniors in general (the rest of the sentence doesn't mention seniors, it talks about Sally).<n>4) 'high school or college' doesn't fit the context either.<n>5) Finally, 'Republican party' doesn't fit either. It may be possible that she's a member,<n>6) but it seems to be much too common a senior person to be the correct answer.<n>7) To summarize: we have some evidence that we can use to eliminate any answer.<n>8) Our evidence points to the republican party, but we have two clues, one pointing<n>9) to a high school or college and the other pointing to a senior club or group.<n>10) Therefore, we need to eliminate those clues.<n>11) So we can rule out 'high school or college', and we can rule out'republican party'.<n>12) The correct answer is'senior club or group'. Sally is a senior in the House, whatever that means.<n>13)

If he takes the highway South and doesn't stop, where will he end up next? Choices:  A: oklahoma B: developed land C: united states D: desert E: mexico<n>Output:		The given information provides two key hints that will help us work out the correct answer:<n><n>1. John is from Texas, which means he's from the south of the United States, so it is possible that he might not be familiar with roads north of or even east of Texas.<n><n>2. This implies that the southern part of United States is the region John is familiar with.<n><n>3. He has also been asked to take the highway south.<n><n>4. This implies that he will be travelling in the south of United States. <n>Therefore, the only place where John could end up is in the south of the United State.<n><n>Considering this, the correct answer would be C: united states.<n><n>Input:Jane knows she will get A's if she sleeps for 8 hours. If she stays awake all night, she definitely will get a B. What will happen if she sleeps for six hours? Choices:  (A: Sleep all night)  B: Sleep for three hours.  C: Sleep for two hours.  (D: Get a b) (E: Get a c) <n>Output: If she sleeps all night long, she will get an A in the exams.<n><n>1. This implies that getting an A in her exams will only happen if she sleeps continuously all night.<n><n>2. It is also implied that if we sleep continuously, we eventually wake up.<n><n>3. This, along with the above, implies that even if she gets six hours of sleep, she will still get a B because she slept only for six hours, and then woke up in time for her exams.<n><n>4. A B is guaranteed even if she sleeps for two hours then stays awake all night.<n><n>5. Therefore, based on the clues we have been provided, the answer will be C: Get a B.<n><n>

Choices:  A: feeling refreshed B: becoming tired C: restlessness D: leg cramps E: sweating<n>Output:		1."What happens when you take...a run? ". It doesn't mention that it follows going for a run.<n>2. The choice of verb is also important here. 'Going for a run' can sometimes mean the same as 'running'.<n>3. So the options should also include 'a run' and 'run' and be made more general.<n>4. The answer is A: feeling refreshed.<n>Tip: In case the question involves a situation or a habit, it is better to include both the cause and the effect as answers, even if its one of them (especially when the answer to one of them is already obvious.)<n><n>Input: Why am I bubbling with ideas? Choices: 1. Because you are thinking. 2. Because your ideas are great 3. Because someone has just asked you for an idea. 4. Because you have had few ideas previously. 5. Because you've read a good book. 6. Because you haven't just eaten.<n>Output: 1 and 3. Choice 1 is wrong because thinking is not the cause of bubbling with ideas.<n><n>4. Choice 2 is wrong because the reason a person is bubbling with ideas is his/her ideas being great, not his/her thinking.<n><n>5. Choice 3 is wrong because often people get ideas and start bubbling with ideas when someone asks for an idea or gives an assignment.<n><n>6. Choice 4 is again wrong because if a person is not used to having ideas then it is only natural that he/she wouldn't be bubbling over with ideas earlier.<n><n>7. Choice 5 is wrong because even if one has read a good book, it won't cause bubbling with ideas in a person. Rather, such a book could often fill someone's head with new ideas. This may or may not cause a person to bubble with ideas.<n><n>8. The answer is either 1 or 2. If a person is bubbly because he/she is thinking, then he/she should know all the reasons that caused him/her to start thinking.<n><n>Input: A man was found dead in his hotel room.

Choices:  A: critical thinking B: congratulated C: equal opportunity D: compliments E: raffle tickets<n>Output:		<n>1. The 'in applying for the job' suggests that they have applied for the job and are going through the interview process. This further suggests that it is an employment interview and not a 'gathering of friends and family'<n>2. Therefore, 'compliments' are being considered inappropriate.<n>3. Further, 'equal opportunity' is inappropriate as a 'backdrop to the selection process' suggests that this is a 'competitive' environment.<n>4. However 'congratulations' are the kind of thing they may expect (or, at the very least 'kudos' for applying)<n>5. 'Critical thinking' may be the most appropriate choice, as everyone is applying for the job. Therefore, the question would be how each person approaches the situation.<n>6. Therefore D: critical thinking is the correct answer.<n><n><n>

Choices:  A: injury B: beauty C: late D: mistakes E: annoyed<n>Output:		1: All of the choices given seem to be related to the appointment itself rather than anything that happened later on (or in between appointments).<n>2: The text does not suggest that the appointment was a particular type of appointment.<n>3: The most relevant fact is that the original appointment did not get cancelled, meaning that it was rescheduled at another time (likely the next available slot without it being cancelled). This suggests that if something happened later that resulted in rescheduling, it was an injury or beauty-related thing.<n>4: The text says that an injury or beauty- related thing would probably result in a late or mistakes appointment. The text also specifically mentions that the reason for the rescheduling was not because of injury, beauty, or mistakes. There is, therefore, no evidence to suggest that the rescheduling was due to any of these things and any one of these options (or none of these options) are correct.<n>5: This would be less helpful information if it was provided to the person (or people) who'd asked for the appointment and would not have caused them to be annoyed. <n>6: Therefore, C: late is the correct answer as injury, beauty, or mistake (beauty and injury both being related to clients at the salon in the first place) would result in missed appointments. Therefore, something else had to happen (such as being late or making mistakes) which would likely result in rescheduling an appointment.<n><n>Input: How does it feel when a client calls for a reschedule? Choices:  I. I'm always happy to adjust the schedule for my clients. 2. A. I'm always upset when things don't go as planned.  B. I'm always disappointed when a client decides to change their appointment.  C. I'm always annoyed when something unexpected occurs. 3. D. I always feel disappointed when a client does call to reschedule.<n>Output: 1 – What are the chances the client called about something positive that the stylist would be mad about? The rest of the statements don't have the word for 'pleasing' in them.<n>2 – All of the statements have the same meaning – 'disappointed' and 'discouraged'. They are synonyms, so if the answer is 'I'm always upset/discouraged

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:John loves animals and he hates animal abuse.  Because of this, john is very careful about the places he goes.  Where might he avoid going? Choices:  A: pet store B: parking lot C: woodland D: north america E: park<n>Output:		<n>1. The parking lot suggests that John is looking for a place to visit that is 'away' from animals, therefore, 'away' from animal abuse.<n>2. The woodland, park, and north america suggest that the locations in question, as they are 'away' from animals.  However, they are not necessarily far away. The 'pet store' suggests that they may be nearby.<n>3. North america could be a misleading answer in that it could refer to a country or a continent, but it could also refer to a location.  The word 'park' would similarly refer to a location or 'away' from animals within said location.<n>4. Finally, the word 'away' implies that 'away' is the correct choice.  Because John wants to avoid abuse of animals, parking lots, north america, and the woodland are irrelevant to his goal.<n>5. The correct choice is C: parking lot<n><n>input:John likes his job as a car-seller.  It is interesting but it is always exhausting, and he sometimes has to stay up late to finish his work.<n>He is especially tired today because he had to work late last night.  He is so tired that he can barely remember where he works.  In which building is his workplace? Choices: 1) his house 2) the office park 3) the building next door 4) the building opposite 5) the library<n>Output:1] 'His house' is the incorrect answer choice because the text clearly states that John can barely remember where his workplace is. Therefore, he doesn't work from his house. 2] 'The office park' is incorrect because the word 'park' means 'a public open area containing grass, trees, etc. for public recreation' (OxfordLearnersDictionary). This type of open space can also be referred to as a 'park' like the text says. This is a misleading answer choice for the same reason that John can't remember where he works from his 'house' so he shouldn't be able to remember where he works in this type of 'public open area' he also can't work at home. 3] 'The building next door' is incorrect because the text states that John can barey remember where his workplace. 4] 'The building opposite' is incorrect because the

The choice of wear shoes suggests that I would recommend him to wear footwear as slip on footwear would make walking more difficult for him.<n>5.

Choices:  A: read B: passenger C: land plane D: fly the plane E: buy tickets<n>Output:		To my knowledge, a person who is traveling by plane is not permitted to use electronics before the plane takes off.<n>1. There is nothing in the question that gives a context for the question and all the choices are worded the same that leaves no room for ambiguity.<n>2. Because of this, there is no clear answer to the question and no other option is plausible.<n>3. The text states that traveling by plane is a way to pass time before using electronics on the plane.<n>4. 'Pass time' seems too suggestive of doing anything at all so it cannot the correct answer. 'Buy ticket' and 'fly the plane' would require other circumstances to make sense.<n>5. 'Read' seems too suggestive to anything at all so it can not be the answer either.<n>6. The phrase "before they can use electronics" is vague but seems to be suggesting something unrelated to the main idea of traveling by plane.<n>7. 'Passenger' seems too suggestive that they already have electronics so it can not be correct either.<n>8. The phrase 'land plane' also seems to be suggesting something outside of the context of traveling by plane, and it is not plausible that a person would not be able to use electronics on a plane that has not taken off.<n>9. Therefore, the answer is 'fly the plane'.<n><n>Input:  What is the biggest difference between a hurricane and tornado? Choices: 1. Only a hurricane forms in the ocean.<n>2.

Choices:  A: sleep B: feel more comfortable C: sweating D: blush E: cuddle<n>Output:		She curled up near the blanket, which made her seem a little cuddly on the couch.  The blanket was making her seem cuddlier. It might have been making her body warmer also, but her hands were not too far from being cold for cuddling, which might have been why her arms were wrapped around a pillow, rather than her boyfriend.<n>So the final conclusion is the answer is B: feel more comfortable.<n><n>Input: They were looking for the man they knew would become a great musician but did not know if he would accept their help.

Choices:  A: backpack B: bookcase C: office supply store D: office E: class room<n>Output:		1) 'Where would you find a...' is a short phrase that implies that a binder with homework assignments could be anywhere.<n><n>2) This phrase might not be specific enough for one to know where specifically it should be found.<n><n>3) 'backpack' could be the correct answer as a binder could be carried in a backpack.<n><n>4) 'bookcase' is another possible location that a binder could be kept as there are books on the shelves of a bookcase that could contain binders.<n><n>5) 'office supply store' seems likely as one could purchase a binder at an office supply store. However, this seems unlikely as a binder is not necessarily an office supply.<n><n>6) 'office' is a less probable option as this might just denote a place where students work on their assignments, but a student's office is usually not the place where assignments are stored.<n><n>Therefore, it is most likely to be kept in a classroom as a classroom is where most schoolwork and assignments are done, which is why the most probable answer is 'C: office supply store'<n><n>Input:She was born in the 1980's, which predates her parents' time together.

Choices:  A: ignore B: write C: learn new things D: illiterate E: having fun<n>Output:		The given context suggests that the little boy wanted to teach his grandfather to'read' not to 'write'.<n>1. However, nothing in the context suggests that the grandfather is illiterate or that he should be learnt to learn new things.<n>2. The context also makes no mention of the grandfather having ever spent any part of his life 'ignoring' or 'having fun'.<n>3. Thus, all options A, B and E are eliminated since none of them are relevant to this context, leaving the only option D: illiterate as the correct answer. The grandfather was illiterate.<n>4. It is also reasonable to infer that the little boy wanted his grandfather to have fun in learning.<n>5.

Choices: A: enraptured B: enticed C: entertained D: enthused E: enchanted<n>Output:1. The clown was surprised at the audience and found them to be enthralled by him, showing a lack of familiarity with clowning and of how their reaction is similar to an audience's expectation for a performance.<n>2. The audience's reaction was not mentioned.<n>3. Thus, 'enchanted' in the context would suggest that the clown was so good with his performance that someone was spellbound or under his spell.<n>4. The other four options all suggest the audience was entertained.  So they are all eliminated.  Therefore, the final answer is option B: enticed. They were enticed by the clown.<n><n>Input: I hope people who have lived in that house in that situation get a better future.

Challenging work intellectually would suggest that the work would stimulate the mind and help them develop.<n>4.) Rewards or punishments would not directly suggest they are competent or incompetent.

However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:James drove his niece to her father.  Where did he drive?

Choices:  A. the floors B. the walls C. the attic D. the basement E. the foundation F. the windows<n>Output: 1  If someone is focused on something, that person wouldn't ever want a house or building to collapse, because if so, they might get hurt and possibly die.<n>2) The foundation is the ground, the basement is the place that the building rests on. The basement is part of the foundation.<n>3) We don't want the building to collapse if it falls through the window, we could be seriously injured.<n>4) If an object falls through the window and into the attic, then it will fall through the floor because it is connected to the foundation and there isn't anything between the floor and the foundations.<n>5) We don't ever want a home to collapse, so having a solid foundation is very important. The question is referring to not having a collapsed foundation.<n>6) This means we always have to check that the floor, the walls, the attic, and the basement are safe and strong enough to prevent collapse.<n>7) Therefore, the right answer will be either A. the floors, because we don't want our home to be unsafe. A home needs to have safe floors.<n>8) Or B. the walls, because we don' see much damage that can be done to a home through the walls. The window is more damaging/dangerous.<n>So the final answers are either A: the floors or B: the walls (We don't see damage that results from the walls)<n>Input: The company's plan to offer credit cards had come to an abrupt halt what reason?

What's one obvious place people might go to celebrate? Choices:  A: state park B: opera C: disneyland D: carnival E: park<n>Output:		Based on the phrasing of this question  ("go places and ride rides to celebrate" would indicate that there might be a specific location where people went to celebrate).<n><n>Further clarification :<n><n>Input:It was a strange place, more like a museum than a home, full of curious things of wood and wires, lights and circuits, things that buzzed and whirred and beeped.  That didn't matter.  All that mattered was that the place was quiet and peaceful.  This made it the ideal setting for any young boy, and it had the benefit of being so very close.  It was the one place left undiscovered. What's this place? Choices: 1) A: museum 2) A: home 3) B: strange 4) C: quiet 5) D: perfect 6) E: perfect for kids<n>Output: 1) A doesn't work.  It's not a museum, a home, or even a building.  Perhaps a museum would work, if you defined'museum' to include 'all buildings including houses'.<n>2) Home is not a particularly quiet place, and wouldn't be a 'quiet place'.  It's also the wrong direction from the given text ('quiet & perfect setting...' should be understood as 'loud & busy city...'<n>3) Strange seems like a good possibility, but the wrong type of strange to describe a museum.<n>4) Quiet is definitely something that fits the description of 'perfect'.<n>5) Even though Perfect for Kids could fit the description of 'perfection,' the author never said the place is perfect.<n>6)Perfect for kids is definitely something that would be great, but is not necessarily 'perfect'.<n>The only answer that makes sense is B: Strange place.<n>So the final choice is B: Strange Place<n><n>Input:The town was very poor, with lots of poor people, but that was all right, it was nice to be able to help.

The choice indicates that their "time as spouses" would not be the same, hence the choice of time.<n>3. The lawyers and their time are not free, and the choice of free implying they are not free time is an oxymoron, and so A: free time does not represent the answer.

The last part suggests that the man was found where he would have been if he were still alive. It also suggests the tree had protected him and sheltered him from harsh weather conditions.<n>2: We can safely exclude all options besides A: aided and C: surrounded  because only those two clearly suggest physical protection from harsh weather conditions and shelter.<n><n>Output: 1 The author is likely making a suggestion of some sort, as opposed to giving a complete answer.  The passage goes on to ask what the old man was doing in this spot, which implies a question rather than an assertion. The first clause in line 7 also seems to be a suggestion, as it doesn't assert that the tree was made of gold or any other material.<n>2. The old man is thoughtful of what he would be leaving behind and does not want anything to be harmed. This can be inferred from the context because of the first few lines of the passage. The writer seems to imply that the man would have wanted the tree to be left alone.<n>3: We do not have the information to answer the question directly. The author does not tell us what the man was up to that day, or what caused his death when we come to lines 29-31.

Using context clues, we can tell that the sentence does not refer to a question in a game show. If a contestant had to choose, they would likely avoid the color green.<n><n>Input:  What are you doing?<n>Output: The correct answer is "I'm playing the ukulele". We can confidently exclude all four other answer choices because the sentence refers to the present ongoing action of playing, not something that was done.<n><n>Input: What is the next step?<n>Output: The right choice is "Read the instructions." Though the phrase "the next step" sounds like it refers to the next step in the instructions, we should be mindful that it is not clear in the text whether the instructions have concluded. The reader can infer that reading the instructions continues on from the instructions, but the sentence does not explicitly state this.<n><n>Input:<n>```<n>John did something for himself.<n>```<n><n>Output: The correct response is "John took a break from his work". This is a correct response. The sentence refers to John doing an action for himself, not John taking a break from his work.<n><n>Input: The boss left work at his usual time.  Does he work hard?<n>Output: The answer is 'Yes'. To determine this, we look for context clues in the text. The sentence says that he left work at his usual hour and we know that we do not usually leave work before the end of the work day. Therefore, we can infer he works hard.<n>

Choices:  A: amount to nothing B: visit relatives C: charming D: doctor himself E: cross street<n>Output:		13. Here, the word 'himself' is the most important of all elements in this sentence.  The question 'what should he do?' assumes that the person is an individual.  'Himself' also implies that the person is a specific individual, but also infers that there may be other people in the woods who are not wounded.<n>2. This implies that crossing the street, visiting relatives, or being charming 'amount to nothing' (i.e. do not solve the issue at hand).<n>3. This rules out Answer A: amount to nothing; therefore, the answer is D: doctor himself. 'Doctor himself' indicates that this individual should treat himself (since there will not be anyone else with him, presumably). The other choices also do not involve any kind of assistance from outside sources.<n><n>Input:In New York at that time there was a real scarcity of meat. Choices:  A. Scarcity of meat   B.

There is an 'is' but this is not the subject of the sentence, which is 'I'. Therefore, no answer to this question exists.

Given this context, "what wouldn't take the" shouldn't be the arm since the sentence implies that he is "on his arm."<n>3. Furthermore, "what" is an ambiguous preposition when it is unqualified since it can mean either the noun or pronoun just before that in the sentence.<n>4.

It can be inferred that the hairbrush is used for personal grooming (hence the hair) and bandages are often used as medical instruments.<n>Therefore, since a hairbrush is generally not used at hospitals, C is the correct choice, as it must be the correct answer to the question.<n><n>Input It's not easy to work at the library:  There are too many interruptions and not enough materials. Choices: A: quiet B: well stocked C: clean D: fun E: comfortable<n>Output: According to the context of the problem, interruptions are a problem associated with working in a library.<n>Therefore, interruptions are not a suitable place to work in a library, so option A is eliminated.<n>With the previous choice, the choices are now reduced to B, C, D and E.<n>Even though libraries are also well stocked, libraries may have a problem in the stock department due to their lack of well stocked. Therefore E is not feasible.<n>C is eliminated because it states that library is not clean enough (the only exception is the library where you find the author's favorite authors in the fiction department).<n>Only three choices are left. However, C is suitable for the author because the author finds comfort in the quiet place he/ she chooses to work at the library. Hence option C is the answer that will satisfy the author (of course if the library is quiet and comfortable at the same time).<n><n>Input:Which one of these can you not get with the click of a mouse? Choices: 1. A: Dictionaries 2. B: Encyclopedias 3. C: Reference books 4. D: Novels 5. E: Textbooks<n>Output: In this case, the situation shows that the context is not a good context to give answers that contain the word 'click' because they may relate to how computers would work and how people can do work through it in a short time.<n>Therefore, A, C and E are eliminated because they have related words to the 'click' word.<n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:Where would a restaurant put a candle? Choices:  A: dimly lit room B: kitchen C: wall D: table E: birthday cake<n>Output:		1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th question do not provide the answer. The last question is about birthday cake. Birthday cake is placed on candlesto light it so candle is placed in dining area, birthday cake, dim room and kitchen. So the final answer is A: dining area<n><n>Input: He can have coffee or tea, but not ___. Choices:  A : both  B: milk  C: cream  D: neither<n>Output: 1: Milk is not an option in his selection 2: Tea is not a  choice 3: Both milk and coffee are a choice. We should remove one of them. 4: C:cream is not a choice 5: There are only two available choices but not both of them. EITHER milk OR tea, not BOTH.<n>The only thing that does not belong so if the only thing in the question in my opinion is "coffee"  coffee is both and tea. So the final answer for the last question is C: none<n><n>Input:She has a black and white photograph  of her grandfather on the wall. Choices: 1: She has a black and  white photograph of her grandfather of the wall. 2: She has a photograph  of her grandparent on the wall. 3: She has a black photograph  of her grandmother of the wall. 4: A photograph is of two colors.  Black and white is one of them.  Grandmother is another one. 5: A photograph  of her grandparents on the wall.<n>The only thing not belonging so if the only thing I found in this question is the "black and white photograph " then black and white is one of the two colors and grandmother is the second one. So the final answer will be E: A photograph of her grandparents.<n><n>Input: A carpet was on the floor. Choices:  A and B 1: A was on the carpet. 2: A were on a carpet. 3: A was a carpet. 4: A carpet was a carpet.  5: A carpet was the floor.  6: A carpet is a floor.  7: A carpet was put on the floor.  8: A carpet is an ad

Choices:  A: laugh B: sit C: happiness D: being entertained E: walk slowly<n>Output:		1) We are told that what children do while going to play is to laugh.<n>2) This indicates that going to play is not something that children do for happiness, entertainment, or even walking slowly.<n>3) Rather, the text suggests that what they do is to laugh, so we can eliminate choices (B), (C), (D), and even (E).<n>4) Therefore, the correct choice is (A). What children likely do while going to play: laugh<n>So the final answer A: laugh

Choices:  A: cupboard B: cabinet C: own home D: everything E: garbage dump<n>Output:		1, Given the context, the correct answer is "own home".<n>2, The question suggests that a person will have a lot of plastics in their own home.<n>This is because a person with children will have a lot of things for children and there will be a large number of plastic items among those things.<n>3, Children belong, in this context, to the person with children. This implies that everything that a person with children have also belong to that person. This includes plastic things.<n>4, The only place where there will be a large amount of plastic things will be in the 'own home'.<n>Children do not belong elsewhere and therefore, their belongings will be there.<n>In this context, the other places mentioned are irrelevant.<n>5, The word "everything" is unnecessary at this point as the implication is that everything that is related to the person with children - belonging to her/him, in their own home, will contain many plastic objects.

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer.

Choices:  A: efficiency B: getting work done C: marriage D: finishing up E: results<n>Output:		A bride and a groom are looking after each other, so you can bet they are taking care of proposing. Therefore, efficiency is the likely ceremony.<n><n><n>Input:A team of five took care of the presentation of the research paper. Which of the choices is the most likely? Choices:  a. care b. intricate c. intricate d. thorough  e. thought<n>Output:The team of five took care in presenting the research paper. Therefore thoughtfulness is the best choice. Carefulness is a synonym to thoroughness but the answer is too straightforward given that it is already mentioned the team of five took care to present the research paper.<n><n>Input:It is time to take a little examinative care. Which of these words will be the most likely to be an answer? Choices: 1. careful 2. intricate 3. thorough 4. thoughtful<n>Output:<n><n>1. Examinative is related with examination, it is not clear what the focus of the answer is.<n>2. Careful is used to define carefulness, which is already covered by careful in the question. <n>3. Intricate only suggests that it is difficult to choose which examination is more difficult to take care.<n>4. However it is likely for the answer to be a thorough, because the question wants which examination will be more thorough to do rather than what examination will be more difficult.<n>5. Thoughtfulness is also the answer given in the input.<n>6. Because thoughtfulness should be applied or related with examinative, not examination when the question means which examination is more thoughtful. Therefore, B and D are eliminated.<n>7. 'Careful' and 'thoughtful' is a synonym for thorough, so if we chose among thorough, thoughtful and thoughtful, it would be unambiguous. The other word would have been thorough or careful but not thoughtful.<n>8. All we need is to guess how many examinations exist; if it is only one examination, the choice would be B or E because the most thorough examination would be the first examination, and if it is more than one examination, the answer would be either C or D.<n>9. There are four examinations, we choose C = thorough. So A and B are the answers.(It would be easy to guess the

Choices:  A: fullness B: underwear C: bad breath D: better day E: dirty dishes<n>Output:		1) As the text suggests, the breakfast leads to a pile consisting of dirty dishes, but it is specifically in the sink.<n>2) We can conclude that it is not a pile of bad breath because it is not in the sink.<n>3) If the pile was in someone's undergarments, it would not be in the sink.<n>4) If the pile were fullness, it is not in the text that it is in the sink, so it must not be the correct choice.<n>5) The pile must then be in the sink. This is supported by evidence and is the logical solution to the riddle.<n><n>So the final answer would only be D: better day<n><n><n><n>### Instruction:Answer the questions in each part.<n><n>### Part 1<n><n>Input:A.

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5.

He was standing still.<n>3. Nowhere does the text state that he was doing anything other than standing still, so B: standing still is the choice. This is a trick question!<n>Input:John really should have taken a more thorough approach, but he couldn't resist the temptation to be hasty, so he rushed things and ended up feeling regret.  Choices:  A : foolhardy B: foolish C D: negligent<n>Output: the text states that John took a hasty approach, so C: hasty is the choice. Hasty can be used to refer to someone's nature, or to describe the speed at which something is done. In this context, it is used to describe John's speed of action, so hasty is the choice here. Had John been foolhardee, he wouldn't have ended up with regret.

This is a better answer choice because the prompt says that this was possible, implying that they had fully experienced it, not that it was easy. Choices B, C, and E all have problems with this. Option B suggests that living life fully was a valuable thing to have gained. But this is not the same thing as feeling joy from it. This option may be valuable but is not possible to gain by living life fully. Option C suggests that they would have experienced happiness which is different from feeling joy. Finally, option E says that living life fully can lead to adventures which is not the same as living life fully.  To fully experience a thing means that one would have both experienced a thing and felt joy from it. Thus, they would not die during this phase of their life.<n>Therefore, the final answer is A: joy<n><n>Input:  The children's reaction to the death was very violent. Choices:  A. The children are violent. B. The children are very violent. C. The children were very violent D. The children's reaction was violent. They have not yet been punished. E.  They will be violent if not punished.<n>Output:  They were going to act violently if punishment did not happen.  We do not know how the children may react if punished.  Their nature is unknown. This suggests that we should take the children's violent actions as a given, but we should be concerned about the adult's response.<n>The sentence is describing the response to the child's violent reaction. We know that the children will have a violent reaction, but we don't know if their violencia will affect the adult's. This suggests that we can infer that the adult's reaction will be similar to the child's reaction, given that the child has been punished.<n>The adult's reaction is not described as violent, but we do know that they have not yet been punish.<n>We can reason that the adult's actions could be violent, even with the adult not yet punished.<n><n>Therefore, the correct answer is E: They will be violent if punishment does not occur.<n><n><n>Input: The sun shone out of a clear blue sky. Choices: 1. It was obvious that it was not obvious. 2. It could be so. 3.

Choices:  A: fast food restaurant B: vegetable market C: ireland D: produce market E: dessert spot<n>Output:		1) The first sentence suggest that the context is food related.<n>2) Since the sentence that has two blank spaces says that the thing is used in a business, we can assume that there is something in between these two words.<n>3) The text says that there is a place where lots of potatoes are used in the business.<n>4) Since this place doesn't specify what type or kind of place, we can use any answer that fits the requirements.<n>5) Ireland is probably the closest, since it is mentioned in the question, although they aren't specifically required and is also mentioned in the text.<n>6) The sentence after is about the place itself, so we can assume that it isn't a fast food restaurant.<n>7) Choice B is also correct, since the answer is a food establishment, though it doesn't specifically have to be a business.<n>So the final answers are B: vegetable markets & C: ireland<n><n>Input: Everyone was amazed at the quality of the food served at the banquet,but the head chef just stared at the menu, without paying attention to anything else.

Choices:  A: band B: music room C: college D: university E: house<n>Output:		1. The question contains two statements, the first of which is that Bill bought an upright pian.<n>2. The second statement is that Bill didn't have anywhere at which to put it.<n>3. These could be interpreted as two separate thoughts, or there might be a connection of cause and effect and one of the statements is intended to imply that something was intended to support this.<n>4. The answer choices are all locations that a piano can be kept.<n>5. Bill didn't buy an upright piano as a gift to give to someone and didn't intend to give it away.<n>6. Therefore the answer must not be D: music room because it indicates that he meant to play it.<n>7. The answer cannot be C: college because one would assume that Bill was a student and college students typically do not keep pianos in their dorm rooms.<n>8. Therefore, B: band makes the most sense as it would imply that he kept it because he used it to play the piano or for some other musical reason.<n>### Instruction:Answer the question according to the sentence<n><n>Input: Bill found a wallet while he was cleaning out his car and it contained a picture of a man and woman along with an expired  photo ID.  He never contacted the car's owner and did what with the money? Choices: 1: kept it, 2: gave it back, 3: saved it, 4: spent it, 5: put it back into his car<n>Output:1. After examining the picture, the woman's car's owner would find their wallet since the photo ID was no longer valid.<n>2. Bill could not return it to the original owner unless they lived quite close by or if he were able to track the person down.<n>3. Returning the wallet would involve the owner locating him, as well as being willing to return the cash they spent on gifts or other items, which may or may not be possible depending on the size of the wallet.<n>4. He would have to be able to track the person or their new residence down.<n>5. The money would be spent on himself or someone else.  Unless the new owner was extremely thrifty, the money would most likely be spent. It may be useful to use the money to purchase a new wallet for the owner.<n><n>So the final answer option

In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:What do all rooms facing outside have? Choices:  A: square shape B: different sizes C: flowers D: doors and windows E: high walls<n>Output:		The word "all" in this sentence can mean either "all", or that the sentence is saying that the only rooms that fit this description are from outside. It is not a description of some room, so it can't be A: square shape, or C: flowers, or E: high walls.<n><n>Input:All the other cars that had parked there were in a similar situation to her car. Choices:  A B C D  E<n>Output: This sentence is asking for a general statement for what happened to all the other cars when compared to the protagonists' situation.<n><n>Input: The next moment he got a glimpse of a person wearing white, near the door before he stepped out.  It was a shock to him. Choices: A: him B: it C: the next D. a moment<n><n>Output: A: shock or B:glimpse are the most probable elements that were observed.  However the wording “He got a glimpse” has no context, so it cannot be B:glimpse.  Therefore we say - the glimpse of the white person was a shock to him<n><n>Input: I'm a good actress.Choices:  a) good actress b) good enough actress c) A good one<n>Output: It doesn't say whether the context is I'm a good one or A good one, therefore can be both. However, one must consider the tone of I'm a good actor. This can also mean I'm a good enough actor, so the answer must always be B: good enough...<n><n>Input: I couldn't believe that person was my teacher. Choices:  a. I b. She c. They d) My teacher I got this question wrong but in the answer, it says the answer should be "c) My teacher" but that doesn't make any sense!<n>Output: This question can't be C, because you're talking about the "that person".  This means you have to be thinking about the person, you're not.  Also, there is no way the person can be "She" (the name of your boss/teacher?) as "a teacher" is the subject and "a person" in the same sentence is incorrect grammar.<n><n>Input: Is this our bus? Choices: A: That's it B: I believe so<n>Output:
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5.

The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:What usually happens to people who are models? Choices:  A: very ugly B: appear beautiful C: free slaves D: pay bills E: suffering pain<n>Output:		The word "model" implies that these are typically attractive to normal people. Hence, they will attract attention because of how beautiful they appear. Hence, free slaves would not be their usual consequence.<n>Suffering pain is a likely outcome for those who are involved in some sort of modeling industry, regardless of if those are good or bad people.<n>Paying bills and getting paid is something that anyone is subject to. It is not what is unique or special about models.<n>Hence, B: appear beautiful is the correct answer.<n>So the final Answer is B: appear beautiful<n><n>Input: The boy's name was Sam. Choices:  A:"Sam's" B:"Sam was" C:"Sam is" D:"Sam had" E:"Sam has" <n>Output: "Sam" was singular and not "Sam's", thus, it is the correct answer. This is a subject that was asked to be singular.<n><n>Input: She was trying to find the best way to spend the money. Choices: 1, 2, 3, 4 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  <n>Output: 1210<n>12 has an 1,2, and 3 for each number.<n><n>Input: He was a handsome boy. Choices: 5, 6 <n>Output: 5<n>5's is 5; 6's is 6.<n><n>Input: There were 5 boys in the room and 3 boys in the classroom. Choices:1, 2,3, 4, 5, 6<n>Output: 2235 The other options are incorrect because they do not have all five boys in the room as well as all 3 boys in the room. Furthermore, the other options have a number (4-6) greater than the required amount. Therefore, the correct answer is 2235.<n><n>Input: A, B, and C can fly. Choices: 6,7,8,9, 10, 11 <n>Output: 789<n>The correct option for this problem has the letter sequence that matches the one in the problem.<n><n>Input: I like green eggs and ham.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3.

The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:Why would someone be wet after being full of fear? Choices:  A: run B: swimming C: calculate things quickly D: fight enemy E: urinate<n>Output:		C. Run suggests motion.<n><n>A1. If John had been "full of fear," his body would be affected by fear and the effects of fear would show up on the body.<n><n>A2. The question asks for the effect and not the cause.<n><n>A3. "Running" suggests that fear produced an effect or a reaction on his body, but it does not explain exactly what is the effect.<n><n>A4. If John had been full of fear, he would urinate.<n><n>A5. If John had been, full of fear, he might fight his enemy, and in the fight he might get injured.<n><n>A6. If John had full of fear, he will become tense, with his heartbeat and blood pressure increasing.<n><n>A7. If fear produced an effect or reaction on his body, it will show up on his body, such as perspiring or shaking, which suggests that someone would be 'wet' after being full of fear.<n><n>Therefore answer is C. Wet<n>The correct answer is "run" because it is the ONLY verb in the sentence which has present tense. "Full" requires the present tense and the body must have a change in the present and that would produce the result that would allow him to run, but that result does not produce a noun or adjective that requires the present tense. In other words, the sentence suggests he's running from fear. You should never have to use the present or past tense if the given tense fits what the sentence is trying to say.<n><n>Input: The man who can't swallow pebbles shouldn't go near the sea. Choices: A. true B. false<n>Output: Answer: 1. This is a statement about a man who cannot swallow pebbles.<n><n>Input: I have never seen a man who can't drink liquor.

What is the oldest heat source on Earth? Choices:  A: fire B: solar energy C: sun D: house E: coal or wood<n>Output:		1: In the text, it is mentioned that Dan outfitted his house.<n>2. The choice of words clearly indicates that the heat source will be in the house or related to the house.<n>3. This also rules out the options involving the sun and solar energy as they were not specified as possible choices.<n>4. Thus, A: fire is the right option here.<n>So the answer is A: fire

This is an example of'stereotypical' behaviour.<n><n>Input: She is quite adequate at what she what Choices:  Answers may vary. B: does  C: does not D: does E: does not<n>Output: B: does<n>Her adequacy is already suggested by her skills: she is quite adequate. So while she does what she has to do, she lacks whatever 'it' is. If anything, her adequacy is understated.<n><n>Input: If he were an honest man he wouldn't say something like that.  The statement is quite obviously not true Choices:  An answers may vary. B: false C: not D: untrue E: unsubstantiated<n>Output: C: not<n>The statement is not false; it's just not true.<n><n>Input: The committee consisted of five members, four of whom are men. Choices:  A. all six members are women B. at least four of the members are women C.  At least five of the members are men D. All of the members are women E. At most four of the members are men<n>Output: C: All of the members are men.<n>I guess the best answer is that although all six members are listed, it doesn't say how many women are among them. This is implied to be five. The sentence says that 'at least four' are men. This suggests that even if there happen to be more than five, 'at least' four are men.<n><n>Input: He is a hardworking man, his work is always done with accuracy and diligence. Choices:  An answer may vary. B: diligence C: accuracy D: dedication E: industriousness<n>Output: B: diligence<n>We can conclude that because he is hardworking, he isn't careless: his work is always done correctly.<n><n>Input: It was a bright sunny day, she knew this because the sun was shining Choices:  An option may vary.

Choices:  A: problems B: offspring C: overpopulation D: larger family E: baby<n>Output:		1) 'Invitro reproduction' is a new term to the English language, which shows in the text that it is an advanced topic.<n>2) A is the correct answer: The term 'Invitro reproducing' is introduced. This suggests that it is necessary in circumstances where there is a problem of reproduction, e.g. infertility or when there is no proper means to reproduce, e.g. inability to get a partner.<n><n>So the final answer: A: problems<n><n>Input:The young couple had always talked about starting a family, even during courtship.  However, there were always one or the other of them coming down with some new malady or the other.  This may have been the reason for their lack of success in becoming parents.<n>Output:1. 'Lack of success in becoming parents' in the context of the rest of the text means not conceiving or bearing a child because of various reasons.<n>2. A and B are incorrect because 'becoming parents' refers to becoming parents by biological means (i.e. natural birth).<n>3. C is incorrect because 'infertility' is defined as 'the inability to have children'.<n>4. This is because the text does not convey 'failure to reproduce' is being referred to instead. For example, the text states that "One reason for their lack of children could have been their lack of success in conceiving or in getting pregnant, but this is not being referred to in the context of 'infertility.'<n>5. This is because there is a mention of "starting a family" in context with "courtship".<n>6. Hence,'starting a family' refers to adopting a child.<n>7. Concluding it is, then, D: adopting a child. Which is correct.<n><n>Input:The doctor told the patient that he was a candidate for the new revolutionary test for colon cancer, though that it had not yet been approved by the government.

First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3.

A: the new food supplement was for only a few days. 2. B: few days. 3. C. The Food Supplements were amazing. 4. D: The Amazing food supplement were for only few days. E: Only a few days.<n>Output: This sentence suggests that new food supplements became "amazing" after a few days, but then the effects wore off, making it clear that the food supplements' effects were not lasting.<n><n>6. The second half of this sentence uses the word "for" which implies that the supplements were "for" or "only" for a "few days."<n>7. Based on the evidence provided by the sentence, it suggests that some effects only lasted for a "few" days.<n>8. Based on the context and the provided evidence, answers "A&B" are incorrect as the food supplements are not only for a few days or 'effects' last for 'few' days.<n>9. Answer "C", however, is wrong because the claim that "The Food Supplements were Amazing" does not answer how long the effects last.<n><n>10. Answer "C", therefore, is not correct as it implies that The Food Supplements alone had Amazing effects, regardless of when those effects lasted.<n><n>11. Lastly, the sentence ends with the fact that the supplements' effects only lasted 'for' or 'a few' days, suggesting that while the supplements were effective early, they had a diminishing or fading effect.<n>12. "Answer" E: "Only few days" is the correct answer to this question<n><n>Input: Sally's friend was having a hard time accepting her

Choices:  A: thoughtful B: discreet C: calculated D: cautious E: careful<n>Output:		The opposite of foolhardy is discreet. The words foolhardy and discreet are antonyms.

Choices:  A cautious person always seeks the truth.<n>B: He was extremely careful.<n>C: Their thoughts were careful and correct.<n>D: Cautious students must show great diligence.<n>E: He was not careless.<n>Output: Choice A is correct.

Choices:  Some examples of antonyms are clever/stupid, large/small, young/old, careful/wary, fast/slow.<n>Output: The words "careful" and "wary" are antonyms because careful means "thoughtful, attentive and concerned" and wary means "anxious, fearful, suspicious and reserved." Antonyms provide contrast. A synonym is a word or phrase that basically means the same thing as another word or phrase. For example, big means large and small means tiny or very small.<n><n>Input: What word is an antonym for "gullible"? Choices: A: cunning<n>B: cautious<n>C: suspicious<n>D: skeptical<n>E: careful<n>Output: There are a number of different antonyms. An antonym is a word which is exactly the opposite in meaning of another word. For example, hot and cold are antonyms, because they mean the opposite in terms of temperature. Another pair of antonyms is "quick and slow"; since quick is fast and slow is slow; they are the opposite in meaning. The antonym for "careful" is "careless" and the antonym for "cautious" is also "careless," but with a different sense. It is sometimes important to be careful, because if a person is careless, he/she runs the risk

However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:Where would you see some people standing on a line near a road? Choices:  A: water fountain B: military base C: apartment D: fire house E: bus stop<n>Output:		A<n>If you look in a dictionary, you will learn about 'line' as something that consists of a set of people in a particular order, either standing or moving along a single unbroken course. This means that a group of people standing in line would be in a particular order.<n>However, a group of people standing at a water fountain or a school bus stop are not necessarily standing in a particular order - the person standing beside you does not have to follow an unbroken course.<n>Therefore, the only correct answer is: the people are standing on a line near the road.<n><n>Input:The city is large and the streets are dangerous, and you don't want to get lost when you are out for your walk with your dog, so your husband decided to take charge and walk you home. Choices:  A. It doesn't matter to your husband, but you would prefer your walk not to be interrupted. B. It doesn't make any difference because you both do what you want. C. He won't be back until next week. D. You're just not at all amenable to his suggestion. E. Just give him a break. He means well, and he wants to make life easier for both of you.<n>Output: D. You're not amenable doesn't mean you're not open. It means you want to walk with your dog, you don't want your husbands help.<n>So final answer is D<n><n>Input: The dog's owner put his pet in an asylum to keep him in good health. Choices:  B: 1. a poor place C: 2. a safe place D: 3. a dangerous place E: 4. a lonely place<n>Output: 100 %<n>The correct answer to the above question is 'c': good health.<n>This is because although a poor place or a place for the deaf or a dangerous place may well be better for the dog, the dog's owner has placed the dog in an asylum specifically to keep him in good general health. In essence, 'good health' refers to general mental and physical health, so an asylum (the best healthcare available at the time) is the best place to place your dog in good health.<n><n><n>Input: How was the young woman feeling?

Choices:  A: feel sorry B: trust god C: cross street D: ride a bike E: lend money<n>Output:		The question is asking about what a person might do after doing something to hurt someone else.<n>1. 'Feeling sorry' suggests that they regret their actions and the phrase doesn't describe any potential actions.<n>2. 'Trusting god' could be a potential action to take, but it is unlikely given the context.<n>3. The options with 'cross' and 'ride' both describe what they might do after, instead of an action that would result from doing something to hurt someone.<n>4. The correct answer is E: lend them money, as the choice best describes what the person would do after hurting someone.<n>

Choices:  A: closet B: at hotel C: sidewalk D: bus stop E: trunk<n>Output:		D: bus stop. It makes sense that he would leave his luggage outside his home, as the narrative says he was driving "himself" to the airport, implying that he lived alone and thus would not have any help getting his luggage to the airport while driving himself. Putting his luggage in the bus stops near his home because his home is close to a bus-stop. The correct answer is D: bus-stop.<n><n>Input:It's important, when making a new product, to come up with a name for it. Choices:  A. Unnecessary B. Reasonable C. Crucial D. Vital E. Crucial <n>Output:D: Vital.

The two boys, Bob and Mike, were excited as the circus came to town. Choices:  "A":  The children are not excited  B: The two boys, Bob, and Mike, were not excited  C: The children are excited.  D: the two boys, Bob,and Mike, was. E: the children are excited. <n>Output:"E": The children are excited. In context, the children are, in fact, excited going to the circus. It is quite clear that there is at least one child, or at least the two boys, Bob and MIke, were excited, which tells us that the children are excited to go the circus.<n><n>Input:A company can not succeed if it does not make sales. Choices: 1. A. Does. 2. B. Would. 3. C. Will. 4. D. Don't 5. E. Makes. Output: 2. B. The sentence tells us it is not the sales that would not, it is the company itself. So for something to not do or do, it must be a verb. 2. Sales is not a verb. 3. To make sales is a verb. 3, therefore, is the correct option.<n><n>Input: The students took the exam.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:If I am forgiving, what hidden force may be activated in my life? Choices:  A: nice feeling B: good karma C: respect D: new freedom E: good heart<n>Output:		1.) Aside from A (good feeling), the other choices contain variations of B (good karma) or C (+respect) or E (good heart).<n>2.) The question implies that forgiveness is a good thing.<n>3.) The purpose of the question is to understand how the feeling of forgiveness manifests in our lives.<n>4.) Giving good feelings and getting good karma may be manifestations of a new freedom.<n>5.) However, getting respect or getting a good heart, may be the manifestation of a new freedom as well,<n>6.) though the question is not specific.<n>7.) Thus, the answer may be any one of the choices or none. The question is too ill-defined to be answerable.<n><n>#### Instruction:In the sentence, <n><n>```<n>It was clear to me that the <n>                                                                                                             <n>              of my previous life.<n>```<n><n>how can the prepositional phrase correctly be removed and replaced by 'of my previous life'?

This is clear from the sentence.<n>2)The preposition phrase and the noun that follow are in agreement. This implies that the prepositional phrase could not be removed.<n>3)The phrase also acts as a parenthetical expression, so the parenthetical expression has to be eliminated.<n>4)Clear to me refers to 'the life of my previous life' which implies that the preposi-tional phrase is directly related to the subject.<n>5)Thus, the entire prepositional phrase is an adjunct and needs to be removed and replaced by a new sentence instead.<n>6)Choices 'A' and 'C' do not fit.<n>7)Choice 'B' is valid and correct.

Choices:  A: downtown area B: urban area C: new york city D: shopping mall E: military base<n>Output:		 The word 'plaza' means that there is a collection of stores or shops, including a shopping mall.<n>A military base and a military area can be found downtown, in a new york city, or in an urban area.<n>1. A movie theater is not necessarily found in only one of these places.<n>2. A military plaza is a type of place, such that you can find some other features in it like movie theatres as well.<n>3.

Choices:  A) repealed B) voided C) lifted D) abolished E) annulled<n>Output:  The federal ban on marijuaka was repealed.<n>The word'rescind' generally means to repeal, void, lift, annul or to abolish something.<n>1. The meaning of these synonyms makes it clear that repeal, lift, annul, and abolish all mean to repeal or lift something. A synonym for voiding something could be 'lifting its ban or abolishing something can also mean'repealing its ban'.<n>2. Therefore, repeal, lift, and annul and repeal and abolish can all be said to be equivalent, and can be replaced by "lift".<n>3. Lift also means to raise at least one of the hands, which does not make any sense. Therefore, A: repealed, B: voided and E: annulled are not possible.<n>4. Thus, D: lifted can be replaced with C: rescind.<n>So the answer is A: Repealed.<n><n>Input: A. The two countries had an important exchange of information. B. The trade routes allowed for important economic development of the two countries. C. The two countries had a peaceful exchange of information. D. The two countries were involved in many military conflicts.E. The two countries had several differences that they had to deal with. Output:  A.

Choices:  A: get arrested B: problems C: sober D: intoxication E: pleasure<n>Output:		The question implies that someone might want to buy beer to get arrested, meaning drunkenness is a possible consequence of buying beer.<n>However, the question does not exclude any of the choices A-E so we can't use rules 1 or 2 from NLP.<n>Therefore, the correct answer is C: sober.<n><n>Input: You may think that the best way to increase awareness of this topic is to have a _________________.  Choices:  A. big discussion B. little chat C. big time D. special party E. all the time<n>Output:Asking people to have a discussion shows that they are aware of the topic, so using that to drive awareness is incorrect.<n>There is no mention of other options, so we will use rules 1 and 3 from NLP.<n>Since the text only hints at a possible discussion, this is an inappropriate time and place to discuss or even mention the topic, so the best way to increase the awareness of the topic is to...<n>However, this does not rule out the possibility of a big talk or conversation, so Choice C is the correct answer.<n><n>Input: I'll think about this.  Choices: A. this B. your suggestions C. that D. the problem E. all of the above<n>Output:This implies the speaker might be considering his previous choices or reevaluating options.<n>So the first choice doesn’t make use of the rule of elimination and could be removed and the second one does not use the rule of conjoinment, so Rule 1 and Rule 3 from NLP must be used.<n>Using Rule 3, the question asks the listener to consider their choice and then select one of the choices presented to them.<n>Then we can apply Rule 1 to determine what choice would be appropriate.<n>After these two rules are applied, the listener would then ask what choice is appropriate in the given situation.<n>Because this is the most basic interpretation of the sentence, the appropriate response would be A. this.<n><n>Input: The more you get paid or the more you __________.

The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:Danny hated helping people.  It always brought what? Choices:  A: satisfaction B: good feelings C: complications D: feel good about yourself E: stress<n>Output:		1: The sentence 'Danny hated helping other people' suggests that Danny is not a person that tends to feel good about helping.<n>2. This feeling could either be an underlying attitude that Danny has, or it could be situational.<n>3. The text suggests it could be situational, and so the focus is on finding the cause of Danny feeling negative towards helping people.<n>4. The text suggests no single cause of the unwillingness to help, but rather a combination of them.<n>5. Although there are many possible combinations, the text hints that some of the possible causes are not very nice.<n>6. Given this context, a person who hates helping people can't be satisfied, can't feel good about themselves, can't feel complications, and can't be stressed.<n>7. These can only refer to a feeling when the result of an action is negative, for example, it can't refer to satisfaction from just doing a good deed.<n>8. So the combination that fits best is Danny hating the actions of helping and the result of doing so.<n>9. Because 'hating helping' implies an attitude or an underlying feeling that hates helping people, Danny also hates helping himself.<n>10. But the negative feelings that Danny experiences are also because of helping, the feeling of 'helping people' is one of the causes that Danny dislikes as mentioned.<n>11. So if Danny stops helping, he wouldn't feel bad.<n>12. From this we can conclude that the answer is D: stress. Danny feels stress when helping people.<n><n>Thus the answer is 1: A, 2: B, 3: C, 4: D, 5: C, 6: B,  <n>7: C, 8: A, 9: A, 10: B, 11: D, 12: B, total 8

Choices:  A: eat cake B: buy C: interests D: complex E: learn about<n>Output:		The question implies that the examination of the thing is a separate action from eating cake (cake is unrelated to the thing), buying it (the thing is unrelated to buying), or getting interested in it (getting interested in what is unrelated to the consideration). The best answer is B: buy, as if the examination includes finding the purpose of the thing and/or buying it, learning about it would not be considered an action to do with the thing.<n><n>Input: This is the real thing that she examined. She would have learned about it if she were intricate, thorough. Choices:  A. the cake  B. the corpse E. the problem D. the body C. the matter<n>Output:A and C seem like a possible answer, but we can narrow it down.  They aren't the real thing so she would have learned about it while eating it, examining it, or considering doing such things.  The body is what she examined (she wouldn't have the body if she were to eat it or buy it), so it must be "the body".  The problem she examined is a choice, and in line 50, she did in fact examine it.  This leaves intricate and thorough.  It is not intricate, as John's examination of the corpe was perfunctory and thorough.  The thorough examination is the key, and we can tell that she wouldn't have learned about it if he had been more thorough, leaving thorough.<n><n>Input:  Choices:  A  B  C  D  E<n>Output: Since D and E aren't in the contexts, they cannot be right. B, C, and A are both examining and learning about the thing, and can be eliminated.  This means the answer is C: Learned about the problem she examined.<n>

Choices:  A: place of work B: office C: friend's house D: workplace E: deep thought<n>Output:		The correct option is D: workplace. From the question and the text of the sentence, its clear that the human in question is a friend. So it cannot be the workplace. Also, the friend is also a human so the place of work or office are not options either. So that leaves D: workplace and E: deep thought. Deep thought suggests that the friend is being pondered upon, but the question clearly asks what place the human would go to when they want to enjoy the friend's company. So it is a place of work. The human in question cannot go to the office or place of work so it leaves them in deep thought, which is option E<n><n>Input:Mary and Ann stood in the garden and admired the flowers.  They thought about the day's events.  They pondered over how to decorate the dinner table. Choices:  A : A B : B C : C D : D E : E<n>Output:Option A: A is the correct choice given the context of the situation.Mary and Ann are friends and they are looking back on the day, they also are talking about where to put flowers for dinner (which is in the past- perfect tense) So they are looking forward and pondering over what they had done, and what could have been done better. So they are in deep thought about what to do for dinner and are enjoying their friends company (which had already happened by that day)<n>

Choices:  A: ignore B: enforce C: authoritarian D: yell at E: avoid<n>Output:		1) According to the question, the sanctions against the school seemed to negate the efforts it made to change its teaching methods.<n>2) The text suggests that the school made efforts to change its teaching methods in order to avoid the sanctions against it.<n>3) The suggestion that the sanctions against the college seemed to "ignore" the efforts it made "to avoid" the sanctions suggests that the college did in fact make efforts to change its teaching method prior to getting sanctioned.<n>4) This implies that the sanctions did 'ignore' the efforts of the school to change as these should have been a mitigating, not a punishing factor.<n>5) However, the text goes on to say that the sanctions "seemed to" ignore the school's efforts. This suggests that the author did not think these efforts were completely ignored, but the school wasn't able to undo all traces of the sanctions.<n>6) Therefore, D: ignore is correct because the sanctions affected the school at least enough to cause it to "seem to ignore" its attempts to change.<n>So the final, correct answer is D: ignore<n><n><n>

Choices:  A: pretty flowers. B: hen house C: natural habitat D: storybook E: dense forest<n>Output:		It was looking for the natural habitat in which forest creatures such as itself are used to functioning.<n>The context of the sentence suggests that A is most likely incorrect as all of the fox's pursuits had to do with human habitation, not natural habitat. The fox had been living in the city and the forest's natural environment would be a big change.<n>B is incorrect because the fox couldn't be looking for a hen house: this would be the hen's house, not the fox's.<n>C is incorrect for much the same reason as B.<n>E is incorrect because only humans describe forests as "dense." The fox wouldn't know what humans called "dense forest" or be able to look for it.<n>D is the best answer: the fox needed "natural habitat," the best definition of which is "the kind of world your ancestors were used to living in." D is the correct answer.<n><n>To sum up, it's important to know the context of the situation. If the story is set in a human house in the city, the fox wouldn't leave humans for the forest because humans don't live in forests and the fox would simply get lost in an unfamiliar "storybook" world, instead of in a "natural habitat." The fox was looking for something familiar in a place that it was used to living in.<n><n>Input: After examining the data, the doctor told the patient that he was perfectly healthy.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:What do people use to absorb extra ink from a fountain pen? Choices:  A: shirt pocket B: calligrapher's hand C: inkwell D: desk drawer E: blotter<n>Output:		1) It is reasonable to assume that the questioner believes the answer "B: calligrapher’s hand" is incorrect because it "absorbs extra ink from a Fountain Pen."<n>2) The correct answer "calligrapher’s hands" does not absorb extra ink; rather, the calligrapher' s hands absorb excess ink by absorbing it from a fountain pencil.<n>3) The definition of “absorb” is as follows: 1 a : to receive into the mind : understand b : to take in as if by suction : draw into the body or tissues through the skin or mucous membrane : imbibe, imbibe 2 : to draw or draw out by or as if by suction (see suck entry 1 sense 2b) 4 : to keep in circulation : store up.<n>4) The definition for ‘absorb’ in "absorb the pressure" refers to this meaning of absorb: to store up: to keep in circulation.  The definition of pressure that is relevant here refers to “pressure” is a force that tends to cause depression or pain (as in ache).  Therefore, the answer "shirt pocket" is incorrect and the answer "calligraphy hand" is correct because the definition of pressure is "a force that tends to cause pain".

Where is he? Choices:  A: state park B: bus depot C: garden D: gym E: rest area<n>Output:		The given information suggests that Johnny is sitting someplace that can be relaxed at after a lot of work.<n>1. Johnny sat on a bench.<n>2. Johnny sat on a park bench after work.<n>3. Therefore,'state park' is an incorrect answer choice as the word'state' doesn't mean sitting or relaxing.<n>4. The other answer choices all have the word'rest' either in them or closely related to them.<n>5. Therefore, Johnny is probably at a rest area, a garden, the gym, or a bus depot.  <n>6. The gym is incorrect, given the fact that the question mentions sitting down after work.<n>7. The garden is incorrect given the fact that the sentence mentions benches.<n>8. The rest area is incorrect given the fact is that the first phrase says that Johnny sat on a ben...<n>9. Therefore, Johnny is most likely at a bus depot where buses stop.<n>10. This would also explain the fact that Johnny is resting after work on a bench and in a bus depot.<n>11. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Bus depot.<n><n>### Input:<n>```<n>You're the kind of person that just likes to try to get along with whomever.

Playing soccer for a long period of time leads to excitement, fatigue, anger and harming, however it cannot lead to getting tired.<n>2. The sentence "What does playing soccer [...]" indicates that that the answer can be any of the choices given: excitement, fatigue,anger or harming.<n>3. "getting tired" is never used as an ending when referring to playing soccer, that being said this is not a correct response.<n>4. "Getting tired" also makes no sense in this context, as the question indicates that soccer leads to excitemnt and not tiredness.<n>5. This sentence is more related to a simple example where a person over works himself, which results in him getting tired, but not playing with a soccer team.<n>6. Hence, the correct answer to the question is: Excitement.<n>So the final Answer is A: excitement

Was the judge guilty of what? Choices: A: overstepping his authority B: malice C: carelessness D: slander E: being biased<n>Output: 1, Mrs. Williams was found not guilty, not guilty due to reasons explained in option B, and then not released because she was released on a technical ground of the court.<n>2, It is possible the judge is biased, but this has to be proved.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:Where is there usually a fiddle playing? Choices:  A: music store B: dance hall C: orchestra D: symphony E: tennessee<n>Output:		1st, the last line of text is "Where is there usually a fiddler playing?"<n>2. The word "there" may refer to locations which house performances of fiddlers, as in a "fiddler's hall".<n>3. Alternatively, it may refer to locations where, traditionally, fiddlers have congregated for performances, as in "Tennessee, (home to) The Grand Old Opry (where fiddlers traditionally played)."<n>4. "Playing", in the phrasal form of "playing" used in the prompt, does not necessarily mean playing music.<n>5. It may refer to fiddlers playing with skill or dexterity<n>6. "Fiddle playing" would then refer to any fiddler performing a skillful piece of music.<n>7. "Fiddler playing" would then refer any fiddler in a setting where he or she is playing a skillful piece.<n>8. Hence, the sentence could be referring to the locations mentioned in choices A and B, or it could be referring to the performance mentioned in choice C.<n>9. While it is correct to say that "fiddlers generally play music" (cf. choices A and B), the prompt does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that fiddlers are always found "in a music store, or a dance hall."<n>10. There are too many gaps in the knowledge of this sentence to answer the prompt.<n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:What do drugs do? Choices:  A: damage B: cloud mind C: lower i.q D: cause illness E: cause accidents<n>Output:		The final answer is A: damage<n>1. Drug means a substance that changes the way a person's mind or body works. Drugs can be good or bad for a person's mind and body. Drugs can also cause addiction or dependence, especially if they are bad for the body. <n>2. The choice of the word "damage" is clearly appropriate as drugs are not benign substances but can do damage to the brain and body.  <n>3. This choice is in the context that drug-affected people can be "crazy" rather than the "cloudy mind" of answer B.<n>4. Drugs clearly damage people and add to mental illnesses. Therefore answer A: damage is correct.<n><n>Input: If you need help finding an apartment, ask a friend before you go apartment hunting. Choices:  A. help find an apartment  B. find an apartment.  C. need help finding D. help E: be found<n>Output: 1) The meaning of the sentence suggests that finding an apartment could be done successfully without help, but would be more difficult. Hence it needs this help to do effectively.<n>2) The verb 'help finding' is more suitable as finding an apartment is difficult to do. Therefore it can benefit greatly from help finding.<n>3) Furthermore, 'finding an apartment' is a single, specific action, unlike 'finding' which is usually a much vaguer verb, such as "find an object that".<n>4) Answer 'help find an apartment' is ungrammatical English. It is also difficult to understand. This would cause confusion.<n>Therefore, the correct answer is answer C: need help finding.<n>The word "help" means to assist (as a person who has trouble) in doing something.<n><n>Input: What does the word "womanhood" mean?  Choices:  A B: personhood  C: peoplehood  D: girlhood  E: sexlessness   Output : Choice D: girlhood is correct.  In this context, it makes sense that 'girlhood' means that being a young woman (or young human female) is the most common meaning of 'womanhood. <n>1. Choice B, personhood is incorrect as it seems to be suggesting it means someone who has achieved full adulthood and matur
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5.

The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:Can you name a good reason for attending school? Choices:  A: get smart B: boredom C: colds and flu D: taking tests E: spend time<n>Output:		1 The first clause, can you name a good reason why I should attend school?, suggests that the questioner is wondering why he should go to school, as in, what is the point of going to school, since the questioner doesn't want to attend school.<n><n>2 The next part of the text, I think I am getting dumber rather than smarter, suggests that there are other reasons for attending school.<n><n>3 A good reason for attending class is to pass a test. But this is not the same as taking a test to get knowledge or skills or just for the fun of it.<n><n>4 Attending school to avoid boredom or to avoid colds and flu seem odd. The questioner would have to be forced into attending class for such reasons.<n><n>5 The last option, A spending time, is not a good answer choice. The questioner is not wondering why he should spend time in school, rather, he is wondering what the point of going to class would be. <n><n>So the final answer choice is B: boredom.<n><n>Input:Can I use the last hour of my shift to help close down at the store? Choices: 1: This question is not a good use of company time. 2: Absolutely not. You're not doing me any favors. I've got work to do. 3: Sure. As long as the store manager doesn't get mad. 4: The store manager is not here right now. 5: You bet. Have a ball.<n>Output: 1: The first answer is not a good use.The second answer is not an acceptable answer. The third and fourth answer are acceptable. The final answer is in contradiction with the first and second answer<n><n>So the correct answer choice is 4: The store-manager is not here right now, which means the employee can make use of his/her hours.<n>

Choices:  A: hole B: television C: sporting goods store D: pool table E: sporting event<n>Output:		I used to go to the supermarket to shop and found the person behind me.  They were dressed in a white coat and cap. I asked one of the cashiers if he was a medical worker. The cashier said he was. She explained that the medical worker also worked there and was wearing his white uniform while doing his shift. So one place that you would see people wearing uniforms playing with a ball is at a supermarket. There are other places too, like a hospital or a school. But supermarkets is a place where people shop and where they can play!  I hope you understand where we can find people in uniform playing with balls  So, the correct answer is D: Supermarket<n><n>Input:The boy jumped to his feet, and his eyes widened with delight.   He could see in the distance what had just happened.  There, in front of the window, was a man bending over what? Choices: A. A chair B. A bike C. A piano D. A radio<n><n>Output:D There was a man bending down by a large black radio in front of a huge window. The radio was playing loudly and people were listening to it as they walked past the shop. The man looked around to make sure no one was watching before he put his arm around the radio and pulled it across the floor towards him.  He then sat on the floor and pulled out a long cord that ran from the radio and plugged into a wall socket. He then turned a dial on the radio and started to play loudly!  The boy jumped to his<n>feet and his eyes widen to see the man bending over the radio.  He wondered if the man knew that he could see him!  He quickly went to find his parents.<n>So the final answe is D:Radio

Choices:  A: student union B: mall C: department store D: library E: town or city<n>Output:		1. The sentence ‘she needs to visit a book shop after buying the latest fad’ doesn’t suggest that she needs to buy a bookshop instead of a book. Thus, A, C, and E aren’t an option.<n>2. The sentence ‘she is planning her outfit after buying the latest trend’ also doesn’t mean she’s only looking for clothes which are trendy as per the definition, and that she is unable to buy other clothes as well. Thus, B isn’t an option. 3. She ‘should buy the latest fad after doing her weekly shopping at department stores and visiting a library’. Thus, C, D and E aren’t available.<n>4. The sentence seems to suggest that she is not looking for only books after buying the latest, but a number of things like clothes, stationary, etc. Thus, B: mall is the correct answer.<n>So the final answers are:Input: 60.01% < 10.01% --> C<n>Input: The most frequent weather condition in London is rain. Choices: A B C D E<n>Output: Given the choice of A-E, C: shower is a better choice.  The other choices: rain, drizzle, or snow are extreme variations of rain and don’t include showers.  Rain is the most frequent weather condition in most cities and hence cannot be a better choice.<n>2.  Choices: wind, snow, drizzle, hail also aren’t extreme variations of rain and none of them are more likely than rain to occur in London.<n>3.

Choices:  A: circus B: carnival C: surprise D: spoons E: party<n>Output:		1: The man went to clowne collegenhe had always wanted to run away with the circus.<n>2: The phrase 'run away with the circus' implies that he wanted to be more than just a 'clown' and have a bigger role.<n>3: C: 'clown college', B: 'carnival', it describes where the collegenamed college is.<n><n>Since running away with the circus implies that he wanted to become a clown rather than a clown, the best answer is C. Since the context suggests that he wanted to be a clown, but the circus implies a much more important role, he did not get his first choice, but rather his second: being a clown.<n>

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5.

Choices:  A: empathy B: anxiety C: knowlege D: falling down E: hear things<n>Output:		1: The context of the original sentence was that the class of students had to complete an assignment independently. It appears that listening does not appear to have been their main problem.<n>2. The teacher did say that listening was key which is why it is the most likely choice.<n>3. Knowledge, anxiety, empathy and hear things are not related here.<n>4. Listening is the only possible choice here.<n>5. So the correct answer is B: anxiety<n>Input: I never get any enjoyment out of my job, I am so bored I should apply for a job as a receptionist, I feel the only thing I do right is type.  I know I would like a job that I enjoyed.  Does that mean I deserve a raise?  I am one of the most productive.<n>Output: The context of the text here clearly states that the narrator's job is boring and that they'd like to change to something more interesting.<n>6. The text doesn't give any indication that the narrator is actually bad at their job.<n>7. There isn't any indication that their employer is unhappy with their work either.<n>8. It does suggest that the narrator can be productive at times with their current job.<n>9. There is no reason to suggest that this makes their employer want to pay them more money.<n>10.

While they are generally described as strong and successful, the first sentence suggests that they're harmful.<n>7. The rest of the text suggests that this group of people has an issue with relationships, and that being able to get along with other people is not their strong point.<n>8.

Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5.

The others, while sometimes the outcome of depression, were not inherently tied to depression in a way that suicide was, just like a carpenter can be depressed and still kill himself.<n>If you think the solution is wrong or incomplete, please comment with a short explanation of why.<n><n><n>Input: What leads to someone's depression? Choices: 1. What leads to someone'd death when they are depressed? 2. Depression and death 3. Is suicide 4. A 5. Is murder 6. A.<n>Output: 0. The right answer is 7 - sadness.<n><n># In the text, "depression" means something very specific, and so "depressed" means "suffering from depression" specifically.

All of these images show a tabby cat being content and wellfed.<n>3 To answer the literal question, B and D are both correct.  However, the intended question is: 'where is a tabby cat MOST likely to be happy'?  D implies that the tabby is always in the owner's lap, which makes this answer incorrect.<n>4 Therefore, A is the correct answer.

In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:There weren't potatoes but actually a snake in his what? Choices:  A: burlap sack B: hot country C: purse D: pet shops E: deep grass<n>Output:		1. The text uses the phrase "but actually there wasn't a", suggesting that there were at one point potatoes in the sack, and then it is indicated that in the end, it was a snake.<n>2. The snake was the 'only one' which could have been interpreted as a metaphor for being the only thing inside the what, and this answer choice is grammatically correct.<n>3. The only other thing that could have been inside the sack would be other food items, but this is not the case.<n>4. Therefore, B: sack is the correct answer.<n>So the final choice is: B:Sack<n><n>Input:I'm going to pick a very large what? Choices: A: stiff stick B: pineapple C: bull dog D: giraffe E: bull-pup<n>Output:1. After "very" it's clear that the answer will not be "c" as "c" is not something that is large.<n>2. Similarly, "E" is not in fact "a very large bull-pup dog".<n>3. Choices "A", "B", and "D" are indeed all animals, but only "D" is something that is "large".<n>4. Choice "B" is also an animal, so that leaves us with "A:large pineapple" and "D: large bull pup dog".<n>5. Of these two options, we can make a deduction that the answer with "stiff" is incorrect.<n>6. If the stick stiffens, then the word "stiff" might be used.<n>7. The other option, a bull pup dog, is in fact more flexible than a large pineapple, which can be crushed, as indicated by "crusher", which describes a type of pineapple, and a giraffe, which is a very tall, skinny one, as indicated in the sentence.<n>8. Therefore, the answer to this question is "D" and the final choice is D:large bull pup dog.<n><n>Input:It was not an empty what? Choices:A: cannon B: house C: church D: hull E: hut<n>Output:1. It is possible to have a church be empty.<n>2. However, the word "it" and the word "

Choices:  A: admiration B: applaud C: make reservations D: experience E: sleep<n>Output:		1: While the new play was apparently a great performance, the audience may not have clapped as much due to a lack of space to do so.<n>2: They probably didn't admire it as much, however.<n>3: They may have made less reservations due to the time and date.<n>4. However it is unlikely<n>5 : They probably wouldn't sleep for a long time after leaving so they likely would still be interested in the show.<n>6. The original text does say "the best", which makes it unlikely they would sleep after the show.<n>7: However, the original text only says what they would do after the show, so we have to assume that they would either sleep or stand in line to reserve seats.<n>So the final is A: admire<n><n>Input: I wouldn't have made such a foolish mistake, but I wasn't what? Choices: A: paying attention B: as old as I am C: careful D: that young E: thoughtful<n>Output: 1 : The original text says "I wouldn't have made a foolish mistake", which suggests the man was careful and paying attention.<n>2. So since he did not make the mistake, we can assume that he was thought, but not careful.<n>3: This is indicated by the use of the phrase "but I wasn’t", which implies that while he was not a foolish youngster, he was still careful and thoughtful. 4. This suggests that he was old. 5:<n><n>Input: I think I'm going to get out of here as soon as possible, I'll be what? Choices: C: in a hurry B: rude A: in a hurry E: quick D: impatient<n>Output: 1 2. The man says "I think", which suggests he is planning or contemplating to leave.<n>3: "I'm going to get.." suggests he is already getting ready to leave.<n>4: "I'll be...as soon as possible" implies he is being rude to the waiter<n>5: "in a hurry" suggests that he is in fact trying to leave<n>6: "quick" seems unlikely as it is too short, so E: hurry is the only option that fits this part<n>So the final answer should be: E) Hurry <n><n>Input

Choices:  A: illiterate B: knowledgable C: own house D: have enough food E: meet expectations<n>Output:		Here it is very obvious that there are two people being compared. There isn't an 'X', or "in comparison to", "when compared to", or any other phrasing suggesting a comparison between people.<n>There is no mention of the person compared being "well educated" versus another person being "uneducated".<n>Hence, the missing element is something.<n>7. This statement doesn't suggest that the person who is "well educated" is "illiterate".<n>8. Similarly, the statement doesn't imply that being "well educated" means "owning a house" or "having enough food".<n>9. The context also indicates that the term "well educated" is used as a noun as it appears on its own.<n>10. This indicates that instead of 'has enough food', 'owns a house' or any other word, 'well educated' is a replacement for something but is not being compared to anything.<n>11. Therefore, the missing element is "something". The statement is looking for a thing that can be used in place of "well educated".<n>12. Since we are discussing a person here, the most appropriate answer would be: D:"meet expectations"<n>So the final answeris D: meet expectations.<n><n>Input:What kind of animal is a hog?  In what ways are humans like hogs?  Is a hog's behavior more like that of a dog, a cow, or a horse? Choices:  i. A: a small carnivore similar to a mammal  ii. B: a small mammal<n><n>Output: i) The question begins with the word "what kind of animal" which is singular, and the statement following also uses the singular form of the pronoun, "its". This indicates that the answer is referring to a single animal.<n>ii) The subsequent reference to "their" behavior also indicates singularity.<n>iii) The answer choices refer to singular "dog", "cow" and "horse" and so, they too appear to refer to singular animals, in line with the context.<n>iv) This leads us to determine that the answer choice has to refer to a singular animal.<n><n>v) Based on this, the best answer choice would have to be D: "carnivore".<n>The context uses the term 'like', indicating something closer to an animal from

He had forgotten to ask for the loan chair, and therefore he did not have the varnish on it.  John had to find someone else to loan him their chair.  Choices:  A:[1] Choices:  A,[1] A,[1] A, B:[2] A, A,[2], and C:[3].<n>Output: 3. John had to return the varnished chair. When he returned the loan chair, he forgot to request for the loan chair without the varnish.

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:The president had to make a decision regarding the hate attack on his country, what did he do? Choices:  A: wage war B: fight enemy C: kill D: destroy enemy E: attacked his country<n>Output:		1: Firstly, the text implies that the president had to make a 'decision,' i.e., a 'choosing' what to do, or in other words, a decision.<n>2. Secondly, it can be inferred from the context that the president was under attack by his 'enemy,' the choices imply that.<n>3. Thirdly, 'wage,' 'fight,' and 'kill' are synonyms with 'decision,' 'enemy,' and 'attack,' respectively, as 'waging war,' 'fighting,' and 'a decision in battle' imply fighting an enemy in war.<n>4. Thus, the choices do not convey what would have been the president's decision.<n>5. In other words, by giving a choice of 'decision' and 'attack,' the author has not mentioned what the president did, i.e., the choice of 'what' is not enough for a reader to know the options for the president's action in this context. Similarly, 'decision' and the choice of 'enemy' are synonyms since 'deciding on the enemy,' means making a decision against the enemy. Therefore, it is not clear from the context what the president did.<n>6. Finally, it is not possible to know what the president's decision or choice was, so C: kill is the correct answer.<n>

Choices:  A: cafeteria B: arranging papers C: in the park D: formal dining room E: house<n>Output:		1."Where do you put a dining table" is an adverbial phrase which depends on the verb phrase "puts a new dining table", and the verb phrase is the subject of the sentence "You do this and that", then this and that are the subject-object structure, 2. "Dining table" is a concrete noun, and it's in singular number so the verb "put" is singular.<n>"Put" cannot take an object, so the sentence "You put a new dining" needs to be restructure into "You put your new dining table".<n>"Put your new dining table" is the subject of "Do this", "Do that", "Do both", "Do anything" is the verb phrase is the verb phrase of "Put a new dining table" here, which is "Do anything."<n>3. There are three places where you put a new ding table. "cafeteria", "arranging papers", and "formal dining room", but they are all in the park since they are the same location where we could put a dining table without any limitations. 4. The question indicates that these are the choices of where to put a new dining Table, but not where to put a new house. 5. After restructured sentence, "Put a new ding table", the adverb phrase "In the park" is added before. "In the park" cannot locate a dining table since it doesn't have the noun to locate.<n>There are so many ways of putting a new dining table so it could be "in the house", "in the garage", "in the kitchen", "on the floor", "on the grass", "into the grass" and so on. 6. This could be the location that you put a new dinnng table but not an house.<n><n>Input: What happens each time a train passes? Choices:  (A): Train driver gets bumped. (B): Nothing.

Choices:  A: stress B: food C: that you D: spending money E: walking<n>Output:		The key here is context!  Let us look first at the first line: "If you want food, you have to go into a market."  Therefore, the context of this question suggests that whoever is likely to go into a market is seeking food.<n>1) A: The word "stress" conveys the idea of anxiety.  The second clue is "likely" and suggests that we are looking for some sort of certainty.  We look for stress during times when there is uncertainty.<n>2) B: Looking at the context, we find evidence of food in the line: "If you are starving, you have to go to a market."  Therefore the only type of person that would be likely to be seen in a market would be a food seeker.<n>3) C: "That you" means yourself.  It would be inaccurate to answer "that you" if someone else was seeking food.  "That you would be likely to go to a market means you would be likely to be going to a market.  In other the words, it is redundant.<n>4) D: Spending money is not associated with markets.  People go there for food.  People don't go their to spend money, but to actually buy food.<n>5) E: We know walking is not necessary because we already know that people go to the market because they are hungry and they need food.  They are not going there to walk, so walking is the wrong answer.

Choices:  A: appreciation of nature B: become educated C: excitement D: increased knowledge E: see things differently<n>Output:		1) The context suggests that the person's views are about science. The given choices suggest that they are scientific concepts or beliefs that the person had.<n>2) Choice A: We are given the statement that one's views can change after learning about science, which implies that one's views could also be about science. Therefore, the only options that will work here are choices A and B.<n>3) Now, the other choices suggest scientific concepts and beliefs. The question asks about the change in views that takes place after learning about science, and thus we need to choose an option that mentions science or learning. Therefore, A -Appreciation of Nature- and B-Become Educated- are the correct options that we should choose, since they both include learning.<n>4) A-Appreciation of Nature:<n>The person may simply have learned about science in general, and appreciated or learned to appreciate the world and it's nature a bit more.<n>5) B-Become Educateted:<n>When becoming educated about science, the person may have also learned to appreciate the subject a bit more. They may have learned to observe things a bit more, as a scientist would observe and also gained some knowledge of the subject.<n>6) Both options include gaining knowledge aswell as appreciating things. So the final answer is either B-Become Eduacted or A-Appreciation Of Nature. Choice A is correct here.<n>

Choices:  A: michigan B: map C: american city D: rest stops E: country<n>Output:		An expressway can get traffic, this traffic increases the closer you get to a more populated area. For example, an expressway that runs straight through a city would have traffic, at least during rush hour. The traffic increases when you get closer to the city. The traffic isn't caused entirely by cities as it could also be caused by weather or an accident, but cities definitely contribute to increased traffic. A map isn't what's causing the traffic so option A is incorrect. <n>The traffic is caused by other vehicles on the expressway, making option B incorrect. <n>The population density could affect the traffic so option C is incorrect. <n>Some towns along the expressway may stop to eat or make a quick turn off. <n>These rest stops would not affect traffic as they are not directly on the expressway and are only small towns. Therefore, option D is incorrect. <n>Option E is correct as traffic increases as you drive closer to large populated cities.<n>So the final Answer is E: country<n><n>Input: When you are in a foreign country, which currency are you most likely to be carrying?

You don't necessarily carry US currency but you would be very likely to be carrying some at all times as options 3: US is correct as well as 4: euros. Option 5: russian is incorrect though because of a shortage of currency at this time, which caused the rouble to collapse in 2014 (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/10654954/Rouble-dropped-by-10\%-in-two days-as-Russia-ends-capital-control-rules.html), I would not rely on Russia in this context. <n>So the final answer are 2 and 4 Euros.<n><n>Input:I'm sorry.I shouldn't have done that.Choices:  A: You didn't need to be sorry.

Choices:  A: lead to laughter B: love C: laughter D: smiles E: tears<n>Output:		1 and 2. 'What can someone feeling happiness cause them to fall into?' is ambiguous. Both laughter and smiles are possible causes of falling, though tears are unlikely to cause falling.<n>3. 'What can someone falling into happiness cause them to?' is also ambiguous. Many emotional responses and physical actions can cause happiness.<n>4. 'What can someone causing suffering lead them to befall into?', has a similar ambiguity. 'A befall' suggests falling or some other type of impact, yet suffering may lead to joy or hope rather than 'falling'.<n>5. 'What can someone who has suffered befall them in joy?' is ambiguous as well. It is possible that joy caused by suffering would be a joyful 'befall' (such as joy after an apology or a happy surprise).<n>6. 'What can the cause of suffering befall?' is also ambiguous, as a 'befall' can be an impact (such as falling) or a cause (such as a feeling of guilt).<n>7. 'What could the cause of suffering be?' is also ambiguous as 'befall' includes possible impacts and unspecified events.<n>8. 'What can the feeling of suffering be?' is not ambiguous, though it is unclear whether 'befell' should be replaced with 'befall' as the cause of the suffering is not described.<n>9. 'What may be caused by the feeling of sorrow?' is non-ambiguous, as it does not imply that a person could experience both sorrow and happiness at once.<n>10. The final sentence does not help to clarify the ambiguities in questions 1 and 2 as a person can be joyful before they fall and a person can cause suffering before they fall.<n>11. The ambiguity of the sentence makes the correct answer A: love, as happiness may lead to love, joy, or tears, though the question does not state 'A to B' but rather a cause-and-effect question.<n>So the final question should be A: love<n><n>

This suggests that fishing is usually done on boats and that the kids are often on boats at the same time they fish.<n><n>3) The word "fish-hooks" appears in the second instance of kids while "fishing" and "poles" appear in the third instance.  This suggests that the kids are using fishing poles to catch fish.<n><n>4) The absence of the words "worm" or "fly" in the first instance of the word "kids" suggest that the kids in the sample may not be fly-fishing.  However, the words "fishing" appear in all three instances of the word "kid" indicating that they are all fishermen.<n><n>5) The words "fishing" and"pound" appear together in the third instance of the word"kid". This implies that it isn't necessarily true that they're kids.<n><n>6) The words "little" and "bait" appear in the second instance of the word "fish" while the word "catch" appears in the third.  The only word in common with the words "little" or "bait" in the first instance is "fish", indicating that they are fishing with bait.  The word "little" is usually used to describe younger people; "little" and"pound", in conjunction, indicate that the fish are young.<n><n>7) The combination of the words "fishing", "bait", and "catch", in the third instance of "fish", suggest that these children are fishermen, and so the answer is D: Ocean<n><n>Input:Which of these sentences would you not expect to see on a birthday card?

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:What are you hoping to achieve when talking to someone? Choices:  A: communicating with others B: hurt feelings C: dry mouth D: intimacy E: changing behavior<n>Output:		The missing element will allow you to change someone's behavior, not hurt their feelings or communicate effectively. It isn't dry mouth (since that happens before speaking), nor is it intimacy (the only thing that can help you with being intimate is a good conversation).<n><n>Comment: I will award the bounty in 2 days, after you edit the answer to improve this and fix the formatting please.

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1.

Choices:  A: getting fat B: get fat C: typing words D: falling asleep E: wasted time<n>Output:		Firstly, the question suggests that the watcher has accomplished nothing or failed to accomplish anything that they wanted to.<n>2. This is likely because they are 'watching television', so the obvious suggestion is that they spent their time there.<n>3. This suggests that they wasted or lost their time with nothing to show for it. No progress was made and no accomplishment was made.<n>4. Thus, the question suggests that their time with television was time wasted or lost and that the phrase "If your watching television and accomplished nothing what have you done" should be understood as "If you wasted your time watching television, then what is your accomplishment?" 5. Moreover, the first and last phrases of the question's text suggest that their accomplishment should have happened while watching television.<n>6. Thus, the phrase "What have you done?" suggests they achieved nothing while watching television. 7. Therefore, the choice of question phrasing suggests that the watcher will be judged based on what they accomplished while watching Television<n>8. Also, the phrase "If your…accomplished…" means the 'watcher' is the subject of the sentence, which means they themselves are accomplishing what?  nothing? so it will be a 'no' if your watchin.<n>9. Lastly, the phrase "While watching television and accomplish nothing…" means that the watcher has not accomplished anything while watching television, so the answer is a 'no'.<n>So the final answer for this question is "No"<n><n>This question is related to the previous one:<n>Input: If your watching television and accomplishing nothing what have you done<n>Output:This question does not give us the same information as the previous one. <n>However, like the previous question, <n>firstly, we note that the question is still about the watcher, as we know it is phrased in a 'what have you done' way.<n>2.Next, we note the use of the phrase 'while accomplishing nothing', suggesting that the question implies that they accomplished something.<n>3.As a result of this, we note that if they 'accomplished something', it would be in contrast to the phrase 'nothing' with which the word 'accomplish' is joined<n>4. Thus, we can deduce that the accomplishment of something will be judged as in contrast to accomplishing 'nothing'.<n>5.As a

The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:In the middle of the day what will someone do because of being hungry? Choices:  A: cook dinner B: make bread C: eat in restaurant D: have lunch E: make bread<n>Output:		The middle of the day suggests that it's not necessarily day but half a day, and in this case it's the middle part of the day.<n>Cook dinner, make bread are options that someone may do all day. Making bread alone suggests doing this for breakfast or lunch as well.<n>Eating in restaurants can only happen when you are hungry during the daytime.<n>This suggests that at lunch time, if you are hungry, you will eat in a restaurant.<n>This also means that if someone is hungry, he or she will likely make or buy a simple meal from the store such as a sandwich or a piece of bread with a single meal in sight, then have lunch.<n>This person may do this, because he or she is busy, doesn't have much time to cook, or does not have enough time to make it perfect.<n>So, a person who is hungry may make or buy food for lunch.<n>Therefore, D: make or buy food for a lunch time meal is the correct answer.<n><n>Input:John will run faster if the foot race is too long.What will john do then Choices:  A : run faster B : walk slowly C : run slowly D : take rest E :  walk as far as it is needed<n>Output: John will only run as long as the race is.<n>If it is too long, he must take rest in order to finish the race. He was unable to continue this process, making him slow down and finish the race because it was too long.<n>This means that John will not run as fast if the race is too long.<n>When the race is longer, he has to walk quickly to finish the race before he takes a break.<n>Therefore, B: walk slowly is the correct answer.  John would walk slowly if the running race is too long. But at the end, he will finish the race.<n><n>Input:She was very quiet at the party, and nobody noticed that at all.What will she do then Choices: A: ask someone to dance  B: drink wine C: ask someone to play music D: get a snack E: make a foul<n>Output: She is quiet, and nobody notices this.<n>If she is quieter, this is normal. So she will probably not behave very differently.<n>She does not behave at all so she is not talking about what

Choices:  A: container B: supermarket C: pantry D: sandwich E: jar<n>Output:		First, we'll discuss the options presented. Each option has a specific meaning attached to it.<n>2. A: This is a "container" used for storage. We can assume that it's a box/bag given that it's meant for holding peanut butter.<n>4. B: This is a "supermarket" which is a store or a shop selling packaged goods.<n>6. D: This is a "sandwich" - it's two pieces of bread with something in between them.<n>7. We can eliminate A, B, and C because they don't fit the context given.<n>8. Let's look at E: If this is a jar, it's a container used for holding some kind of liquid. It's most likely referring to "peanut butter," but not every jar can be a peanut butter jar. Peanut butter is thick and the jar should be big. This can be eliminated.<n>9. D can be eliminated because peanut butter is not a sandwich - it's a spread.<n>10. C can also be eliminated because pantries are usually closets or cupboards that are meant to store food.<n>11. So the possible answers left are C and D.<n>12. Now let's consider C and D together. C has sandwiches in it as a possible container and D has butter and jelly.<n>13. If I didn't want the whole block of peanut butter, what would I get it in? C: A sandwich can have whatever you want, and it's made to order. If you get a peanut buttered sandwich, I would not want it in a jar - a sandwich is made to order and not always predictable.<n>15. If you don't like peanut butter or jelly, what would you like with your peanut butter? D: Other options for the filling in sandwiches - it's a list of foods which are meant to be in a sandwich. You can't assume that peanut butter will be included in the list.<n>16. C can be eliminated because it's unsuitable if you don't want peanut butter and don't want to make your sandwich right then or

Choices:  A: wedding B: friend's house C: internet cafe D: movie E: restaurant<n>Output:		1) Choices A and B are both wrong because they refer to going somewhere, such as going to a place for something.<n>2) We then move to Choice C which says friends want to spend a quiet evening TOGETHER. It means that the two friends went somewhere which they can spend a quiet evening together. <n>3) Choice D mentions a place called a movie which sounds like a quiet place to spend time together. The missing element in this context is clearly that the friends went somewhere where we can spend a quiet evening. This explains why the answer is D: movie.<n><n>Input:The woman had no trouble finding the office on her own, but she wasn’t happy when she arrived and she told me she felt completely ___. Choices:  A. betrayed B. alone C. annoyed D. afraid E. confused<n>Output: 1.) The woman finds her way to the office. This implies that she can find the office on her own.<n>2.) The next sentence shows how she felt after she arrived. She felt not happy and told the writer that she felt betrayed. It shows that the woman felt betrayed.<n>3.) Since she arrived, went to an office, and found a way there on her own, she should not have felt betrayed. That means Choice B is correct. The missing element is feelings of betrayal. The woman should not have felt betrayal after she found her way to the office on her own and she didn't.<n><n>Input:We had such great weather that day, we were only sorry when we got home and found the washing still to be done Choices:  A B C  D  E  F  G  H I  J  K  L  M  N  O  P  Q  R  S  T  U  V  W  X  Y  Z<n>Output: 1: The weather was so great that day that everyone would be sorry they didn't spend the whole day outdoors.<n>2: Everyone was sorry they left and found the washing to be done.<n>3: Because everyone was already out in the sun enjoying the weather, it wouldn't be unreasonable to expect that the washing would be left for another day.<n>4: This explains why everyone would be sorry they had left. The missing element is the sun being out and people not enjoying it. It would

Choices:  A: desk drawer B: cup C: pencil case D: shelf E: office depot<n>Output:		John's only option to get pencils was at the office depot.

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3.

Choices:  A: flower B: animal C: flower petals D: vegetable E: alive<n>Output:		There is nothing in the question to suggest that the final outcome of the harvest will be the eating of the fruits of the garden.<n>2. Instead, the question is about the actions that are taken to harvest the food, implying that food is the final outcome.<n>3. Therefore, the correct answer must be about the actions taken to produce food rather than the eating of it.<n>4. Both vegetables and animals are grown in gardens and the word plant in the question simply refers to growing food.<n>5. There is a list of plants, animals, minerals and living beings as food choices, but the question only asks what to eat?<n>6. Instead, there is a choice of'vegetables'. They are grown in gardens.  Therefore, the correct answer is D: vegetable

Choices:  A: sitting down B: refusing C: saving money D: sit down E: go outdoors<n>Output:		 1. The first line implies that the man could not take a char because all the chars are full of people - there is no option regarding whether the people are saving money or not: if all the chars are full, you cannot walk into a char and save money.<n><n>2. So, as there were no chares that were not full of people, the man is refusing to sit down - 'to sit' means 'to accept a place' and so 'to sit down' means 'to accept the place of a bus or the place of a seat after you were refused to take it'.<n><n>So the final answer sits down<n><n>Input: The man was feeling very tired and he hoped to take a long rest in his bed. In the past, he had always taken a drink before bed and that had a sleeping potion in it.

It does not mention where an apple tree is necessarily.<n>2. This suggests that it could be anywhere. For example, it could be in Arizona, not in Ohio.<n>3. This suggests that the only place in America an apple tree can actually be is in one of the other American states.<n>4. This is because the only two areas the USA imports apples from are Alaska or Canada.<n>5. Based on this, an apple tree from Ohio would not be imported into the USA.<n>6. Similarly, an apple tree from Washington State, Alaska or Canada would not be imported.<n>7. Therefore, the missing element an apple from an apple trees in Ohio for the USA would be any imported product.<n>8. This is because it would be an imported product from any of America's allies or enemies, or from any other country.<n>9. Based on this context, I believe that D: any imported product is the correct answer. An apple from an apple tree in Ohio would not be an imported product.<n><n> Input:In the old days, what would likely be done with milk bottles? Choices:  a: use them (again) b: burn them c: bury them d: keep them e: forget them/sell them<n>Output: 1) It is mentioned that the question concerns milk bottles only.<n>2. This implies that milk bottles are not to be used for any other purpose, nor for any other goods.<n>3. We also know that in the old days, people would not use them again.<n>4. This means that in the old days people must have done some other activity with the milk bottles.<n>5. For example, they could have used or done'something' with them.<n>6. They will not use them again because in the old days people either had to reuse milk bottles, bury them or have forgotten them by selling them.<n>7. Therefore the context suggests that people might burn milk bottles in the old days.<n>8. Based on this context the missing element is milk.<n>9. This is because milk bottles would have been used for milk only.<n>10. Therefore A: Use it is the correct answer.<n><n><n>Input: The doctor did not examine the patient closely enough.  As a result, he missed a serious injury.
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1.

Choices:  A: vomiting B: pleasure C: happiness D: contentment E: mess<n>Output:		1- It's suggested that if you're eating breakfast in bed and don't spill, you will feel contentment.<n>2- 'vomiting' and'mess' could be incorrect because that would be a contradiction.<n>3- 'pleasure' and 'happiness' would require additional circumstances such as a romantic atmosphere, a delicious meal, etc.<n>4- 'contentment' is the word used in the sentence and fits with the context, it's also an in-between feeling of 'pleasure' and contentment.<n><n>So the final answer would be C: happiness<n><n>Input: In some hotels, guests get a wake-up call before they get out of bed.

(guy is woken up and he gets out of bed)<n>5- the phone rings ,there's nothing about going back after dressing, so 'dress' and 'get back into bed' can't be the right answer.<n>6-In hotels, guests get wake-up calls. the sentence doesn't say what guests do when the phone rings, but the question asks.  guests can do anything but looking for their phone.  the correct answer to the question is b (get out of bed)<n><n>Input: What was that noise?<n>A: It must be the dog barking.<n>B: No, it was a train.<n>C: It was your stereo.<n>D: You're too young to remember that song, but I could play it for you.<n>E: I didn't hear anything.<n><n>Output:<n><n>1-the stereo answer could be correct if it was a short question "what was that noise?" but it isn't the case here.<n>

Choices:  A: go to jail B: incarceration C: intercourse D: death E: judgement<n>Output:		1: The judge clearly did not take this part lightly- he gave the man a punishment that was equivalent to being condemned to death.<n>2: In this context, what comes to mind first is 'imprisonment', which is what the sentence was in fact. So to start, we can conclude that the judge did not take this lightly and used 'death' as a punishment instead of imprisonment.<n>3: It would be incorrect to use the phrase 'go to jail' since the man was not incarcerated. This is also true of 'intercourse' which is a separate issue from this story and therefore not applicable here.<n>4: Death is not an inaccurate representation of the sentence, but does not make sense compared to the use of 'go to jail.'<n>5: If the judge did not take the punishment lightly, he would not have used this as the phrase to use as its own sentence.<n>6: The judge did not 'imprison' the man, but he did 'condemn' him to death. Since he took the rest of the job seriously, the correct choice is B: incarcerated.<n><n>Input:  The girl is as untidy as her house, everything about her is dishevelled.  She was a total what?

One is disheveled because of carelessness or has no self-order or discipline.  There's something disorderly about her, which leads to a mess.<n><n>Input: I made up an excuse that I would have to pay bills back home and left to finish my shopping.

Choices:  A: dream B: knowing C: depression D: pleasure E: nostalgia<n>Output:		1: The first sentence tells us what the question is referring to, her vacation on a beach.<n>2. The second sentence continues to tell what time we are specifically referring to, it is the “good time” part of that vacation, thus the good time here is the massage.<n>3. This is further confirmed in the third sentence when we continue to tell that it is a vacation, specifically the same one mentioned in the second sentence, and that it brought great pleasure, thus pleasure is what being referred to.<n>4. Concluding that the correct answer is pleasure. <n>So the final answer D: pleasure is correct.

Choices:  A: soccer game B: capillaries C: ball D: animals E: person<n>Output:		1.' Usually' implies that exceptions exist.<n>2. In the absence of explicit information, the answer choices should be narrowed down to exclude outlier events.<n>3. 'Soccer game' implies that exceptions are unlikely to involve the use of hands, unless the ball accidentally rolls along their surface.<n>4. It's logical to assume that exceptional capillary spilling would be even smaller in the absence of hand use.<n>5. 'Ball' is an unnatural choice.<n>6. 'Spilling' implies that it's possible to maintain the appearance of a closed container even after the spill.<n>7. The context suggests that blood could be spilled during a sport that would allow use of hands, so'sports with the use of hands' might be a reasonable choice.<n>8.

'Cartoon character' implies that it will be a very minor injury or death.<n>5 & 6. All other answers refer to dismemberment, splats, and getting wet. None of them refer to comedic death.<n>7.

Choices: 1) A: a full life B: a full, bustling life C: a full, active life D: a full-out life E: a full life<n>Output: 1 through 4. The text clearly states he has a full life but also makes an allusion that his life is busy.<n>5& 6. While it is true that a 'full, bustling life' implies a person who lives a full life, 'full-out life', is the opposite of 'full life'.<n>7& 8. 'A full life' on the other hand, is a phrase that refers to a life that is busy rather than a life that is full.<n>9&10. In the context of the overall text, a 'full, bouncy life' could refer to either a person who leads a very busy life (because of the allusion), or one who leads a very full life. Since it is unlikely it means a life that is full of bouncy, the answer is C: a full, bouncy life<n><n>Input:An animal rights advocate's main goal is to end the what practice in respect of animals?

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:James is apply for a job that he really wants.

Choices:  A: mail orders B: demand satisfaction C: place money on counter D: pay merchants with money E: spend money<n>Output:		1.The question asks us to find a noun or noun phrase which is the missing word.<n>2. The question indicates that something in common is missing while'merchants' and'shopkeepers' are mentioned in the paragraph, indicating that they are a possibility. We can decide that we need a noun to link all these noun phrases.<n>3. The second sentence states that there are two basic means by which consumers can get what they want - by either giving their money at a merchant or paying money to shopkeepers and sending it by mail.<n>4. Accordingly, there must be two nouns required in the sentence.<n>5. We can decide that 'doorstep' needs to go to a merchant or a shopkeeper, or that 'doorstep' does not need to involve a merchant or shopkeeper.<n>6. Therefore -D: doorstep<n><n>Input: The best thing about the game was how the team's fans always wanted what? Choices: A: victory B: recognition C: reward D: competition E: a good deal<n>Output: First of all let's be clear - the game is a sport. This rule means that team is plural.<n><n>Second : 'best' 'thing' 'always' 'wanted' 'what'. <n>We got 5 nouns, but there is no verb present. So, 'always' is missing since the other elements are plural(team, fans, recognition, 'deal', 'competition').<n><n>Third : 'the best thing about the game' is plural.<n>But 'always' is singular and cannot go with other plural nouns.<n><n>Fourth : 'what the fans always wanted' is plural. Because it has several words plural.<n>Again, we do not have a verb: 'always' will be wrong. So what should we choose? What comes to my mind is singular nouns: what, what, what!<n>I checked my dictionary - 'what' is a singular noun. So we have to choose E: a good deal.<n>

Choices:  A: tennis elbow B: proffesional player C: exercise D: victory E: becoming tired<n>Output:		B. All the other choices are in some way related to the playing of tennis: The word "playing" hints that the question should have to do with the result of playing tennis (it was years of playing tennis), "tennis" hints that the question is an "about" type question (it was something about playing tennis), "elbow" implies that it was something to do with the playing of tennis, "proffesional" hints that the player has become somewhat professional while playing, "exercise" and "victory" are self-explanatory. TennisElbow is therefore the correct answer.<n><n>Input:It is the opinion of many people that the British government acted prematurely in its decision to cancel all large-scale rock concerts.  Choices:  A : they are afraid of violence B : they think they don't trust the performers C : they want to get on with the election and its results D: they consider rock music to be bad<n>Output: C. All the other choices appear to be related to the cancellation of all those rock-music concerts.  The word "opinion" implies that the question is an opinion type question, "many" implies that the opinion is shared by many people, "think" hints that the concerts are being cancelled for reason rather than a lack thereof, and "they" and "it" strongly suggests that it is the British government that is cancelling the rock concerts. However, the "British government" is mentioned only once in the sentence, and in fact many people think that the cancellation of the rock concerts was premature, not the British government.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the next 3 instructions separately using your own words.<n><n># Input: He should have been more patient with his mother.

Choices:  A: restaurant B: basement C: all buildings D: carpet E: synagogue<n>Output:		1) The text mentions that there are buildings with floors for worshipping that were kept clean for holy purposes.  It then states:<n>2) “the one used most was the one where all their dining rooms and kitchens were to be found, because it was there that they kept their most valuable plate, glassware, and cutlery, and even their silver. These things were put on a floor that had been kept clean and washed on the spot for holy purposes.” <n>3) The text describes a certain floor being kept clean on a specific spot for the holy purposes, but does not use the word ‘basement’.<n>4) The text describes the most valuable plate, glass, cutlery, and silver used for serving as being placed on “a floor that had been kept...clean”.<n>5) The text mentions dining rooms and kosher dining tables and the floor where these things were kept.  It does not mention how the area on which these items were placed had been cleaned or kept clean.<n>6) It does not mention whether or not this floor was a 'basement,' or in a building separate from the other areas of the restaurant.<n>7) The text states that this floor had been kept clean or was being kept clean, so it is likely not the ground floor.  It does not say it was a basement.<n>8) The text only describes where this specific floor was located, but it does not explicitly state where the rest of the floors were located.<n>9) It would not have been possible to tell anything about the rest of the building or the other buildings from this text.  This floor was the one used the most.  The others may have floors used more often or less often, or for other purposes, so it is not possible to discern from this where the floor was located in the structure.<n>10) The text does not mention where this floor was located.  It only tells us that it was most often used so it probably was not a basement.  In this context, it is most likely that in order to serve holy objects, this floor was located in a central area, like a middle floor or even in the middle of the building.  However, the only room mentioned in this text is the dining area, so it doesn’t offer many details for us to analyze.  The use of ‘most’ implies that the other floors did not serve

The option 'condition heart' is incorrect as exercise cannot help to condition the heart.<n>2. The addicts turned exercise to 'expend energy'. This answer option is incorrect because the energy was already being used on other unhealthy ways.<n>3.

E: hangman's noose<n>Output:	I took along with me the hand I knew and the hand I hoped.  They (my knowledge and hope) were all in one basket;  I had one arm from the day for a long time (because of having them hang on a branch of a tree, which resulted in them splitting and hurting my arm because I lifted it with force).  Therefore, they were not the hand I knew or the hand I hoped for. They were just branches, as in the picture below.

There are two clues that the question is about reproduction in general and not a specific process.<n>3. The question states reproducing begins with giving birth. Therefore, the question may be asking what giving birth begins and what giving birth ends with.<n>4. The answer to this question should be given on either a general or specific level. In any case, the answer cannot be birth because it is only one part of the reproduction process.<n>5. The only answer choice that fits is overpopulation. Overpopulation is the result of successfully reproducing.<n>6. This information can be inferred because "overpopulation" is one of the outcomes of the reproduction process, therefore, the answer should be "overpopulation".<n><n>Input: The word "differential" is used to mean what?

Choices:  A: necklace B: wall outlet fixture C: tool box D: computer E: motorcycle<n>Output:		The answer is B:<n>Since we already know that the statement is "If I screw a ring onto something". And the choices are A,B,C,D,E.<n>A is ruled out as we can't screw a necklace.<n>B is ruled out as we need to refer screw to "wall outlet fixture"<n>D is ruled out because we are just fixing an object and not building something.<n>E is ruled out since we can't scure a motorcycle.<n>Therefore the best choice is B.<n><n><n>Input:A chisel makes a ___.Choices:  A: point B: cut C: slick D: swipe E: slice<n>Output: The answer should be: A: point.

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:Where would you find some swords in your house? Choices:  A: sheath B: sword closet C: collection D: container called scabbard E: museum<n>Output:		1: A: sheath - Since this is about swords in a house, the sheath is not relevant. Therefore, choice A is incorrect.<n>2: B: sword closet - In this context, a sword is a weapon with an attached handle that is used for thrusting and striking.<n><n>So the correct answer is B: sword closet.<n><n>Input: When there is an open-shoot policy in the work place it is not uncommon for employees to become lax, but a strict code of conduct is essential to any company succeeding. Choices:  A B C D E<n>Output: 1 : When there is an open–shoot policy, it is not uncommon. 2 : for employees to become laxic. <n>3 : It is not uncommon, but a strict code… is essential for a company to succeed.

Choices:  A: home team B: present C: at home D: come back E: charming<n>Output:		1."Billy went away because" could suggest any number of things. <n>2. The following statements (of which we are assuming "Billy has stayed away" is one) are being negated. <n>3. "Billy" is in that list, but it isn't the only item in that list. <n>4. "his parents were fight" sounds like it might fall into the list, but it doesn't match "stayed away".<n>5. "didn't want to stay" is in that list; "stayed away" isn't in that list.  Therefore, the answer is not "A: home team". <n>6. The list contains "didn't", yes; "want" is possibly within that list, but "home", "present", and "charmed" are not. <n>7. "Billy" could still be part of the list, but the list needs an indication of time ("I am not angry [with him], I am angry while [he] fights me"). <n>8. "the fight is long over" (or "I am angry for the duration of the fight") would also make sense in this context.<n>The final choice is B: present. The word "be" is missing from this sentence: "Billy has stayed [somewhere] because his parents were fighting".<n><n>Input:There's not much to this puzzle, and we are happy to tell you the solution.<n><n>Output: The entire sentence does not need an apostrophe, but only the word "this". The word "puzzle" isn't singular and so does not need an apostrophic s. Also, the word "the" is not a possessive pronoun, and so again doesn't need an apostrophic "s". Only "this" would need it.<n><n>Input:The man got up and left after telling an unpleasant truth.  He could be more tactful about the way he speaks, but it is clear that his choice? Choices: 1: was to leave, A: has made, B: doesn't matter, C: was his own<n>Output:<n>1. From "man/could be tactful/about the way he speaks" it can be inferred (1) that the man is talking and therefore (2) "got up and left

I want to stay in and read all day Choices:  In to B: into C: in<n>Output:C: into. 'In to', with the word 'into' in front, has the same grammatical structure of 'in'.<n><n>Input: I hate being late. She was always the first to arrive Choices:  Behind B: early C: in D: late<n>Output: E: in. 'In to' always has the same grammatrical structure with 'in'.

Choices:  A: small B: underground C: high D: huge E: tall<n>Output:		A: small can't be used since the building is anything but small.<n>D: huge can't be used either since the building is not huge.<n>E: tall can't be used as there are other buildings taller than the Empire State building. Thus we are left with either A: underground or B: high. Since we are not talking about a subway station, the answer must have to do with height. Since both choices are valid, we can not choose between them, so the answer must be, "Either A: underground or C: high,"<n><n>So the final answer should read as: E: tall or B: high<n><n>Explanation: The sentence suggests that tall and high are interchangeable. One cannot assume from this that every tall building is also high. Therefore, only two are considered: tall and underground buildings.<n><n><n>Output: 1) We see that all buildings can be described. The answer choice to exclude is therefore, "none of the above." If none of the above, then every building in that category is excluded from being called tall or high.<n>2) We see that we now must make a choice between tall and underground. As underground fits our definition as a description for buildings like the Empire State Building, "A: tall or B: underground." must be our answer.<n><n>The final answer should be : "B: underground."<n><n><n>

He was very frightened when the smoke detectors went off, but luckily it was a false alarm.  Why might he be stuck? Choices:  A: fire B: belong to C: winter storm D: face south E: burn down<n>Output:		John was stuck in his house because the smoke detector was going off. It was probably a false alarm.

Choices:  A: happen to people B: hurt people C: happen anytime D: happen often E: happen anywhere<n>Output:		The lady was worked up, which suggests she was agitated. This context also implies that she believed the article to be accurate, so it is unlikely that she only had her attention on the article and it was dismissive. In context, it is likely that she thought the article's information was inaccurate. Therefore, the husband's comment was a dismissal of the lady's concern. This context indicates that his comment was akin to a dismissive 'it is of no concern to you', as opposed to something along the lines of 'its unimportant'. In this context, his comment was not saying 'accidents happen', instead, I think it is more likely it is saying 'it's of no concern'. Therefore, the correct answer is B: happen to people.<n><n>Output: Given the context and the choices, we can eliminate the answers A, B, C, D.<n><n>#The second line of the text reads<n><n>Input: The lady was getting worked up. It is highly likely that she was referring to the article and believed the article's information to be correct. This means her husband's statement was dismissing the article's information.<n><n>#We know that answer is either a) it happened to people or b) it happened to people and was not their fault.<n><n>#The answer is neither. It was not their fault that the incidents occurred. ANSWER: C. Happened to people.

Choices:  A: new york B: whorehouse C: street corner D: corner of two streets E: brother<n>Output:		1 and 2. Given the context in the question, New York and a brothel are not likely places to find a professional prostittee.<n>3. While a prostitute might be found on a street corner, this will probably not be a professional.<n>4. Given that the question suggests that a brothel is not an appropriate location to find a professional prostitue, the two choices which relate to professionalism, ie a whorehouse and a street corner, must be eliminated.<n>5. The other option which requires professional or formal involvement in the prostitution industry is a 'corner of two streets', however, this is not likely to be a brothel.<n>6. Therefore it could be eliminated, as the context is not likely places to find such a prostitute.<n>7. However, the last choice 'Brother...' does not seem to relate to prostitution at all, as the question is about a professional prostitute and not a brother.<n>8. Therefore, the choice about a prostitute on a corner of two streets is incorrect and the final answer is option C, which suggests that she is likely to be in a whorehouse.<n><n>Input:I'm a realistic, honest woman. I could never lie to anyone except my husband so that you could never suspect.  What is the word used for 'lie' in these sentences? Choices:  (1) deceive (2) misguide (3) mislead (4) beguile (5) foolish<n>Output: 1) Deceive suggests 'lying to', mislead suggests'making someone be confused or believe something that is not true' and misguided suggests something along the same lines. However, neither beguile nor foolish refer to lying in the way that is suggested in the sentence <n>- 2) The question asks about deceive (lie to), so it cannot be one of these two.<n>- 3) The text suggests that the woman is only telling lies to her husband, so this choice is incorrect as it suggests'making someone be fooled or confused'.<n>4) The question is whether the woman can lie and deceive simultaneously, so the choice which includes both has been removed from the question.<n>5) The question suggests that the sentence 'I'm a realistc, honest woman' is true, but the next sentence suggests that she can still lie to her husband

First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:John had a lot of respect for Jill, but not many other people did.  She faced a lot of what? Choices:  A: ignoring B: being rude C: disparagement D: contumely E: uncertainty<n>Output:		1: By choosing C: disparagement as the answer.<n>2: By using the 'a lot of' phrase to refer to Jill. 3: This phrase implies that Jill was respected by John but not many other people.<n>4: This phrase and the 'few other people (doesn't)' phrase support the answer choice.<n>5: A: being rude is not the word that best captures the meaning of the text.<n>6: B: Ignoring is not the word that captures the meaning. In fact, the text said that John had high respect for her.<n>7: D: contumely is not the word that fits the meaning of the text the best.<n>8: E: uncertainty is not really what the text indicates.<n><n><n>9. So that's the final answer.  The final answer is C: disparagement.<n><n>Input:Besieged by the media, the band began to disintegrate. They became riven by jealousy and ill will. Choices:  A. disruption B. disagreement C. riven D. contention E. dispute<n>Output: 1) We can infer a couple things from the text: First, it says that the band members felt ill will or feelings of jealousy; it didn't say they acted on these feelings.<n>2) We can infer that the media attention created some kind of dispute between the band members.<n>3) The text says that being besieged by the media disintegrated the band.<n>4) As a result of this press attention, the band members began to disintegrate, and then it began to disintegrate their feelings toward each other.<n>5) A: disruption and B: disagreement aren't really what the text indicates either.<n>6) Being riven isn't really the word that captures this meaning either.<n>7) contention and dispute aren't really the word choice that captures this meaning in the best way either.<n><n>8. I think we can probably infer that the band members became upset due to the press.  The final answer then is C: disagreement.  The band became upset due to disagreement among the members rather than one member disliking another more than the other.<n><n>Input:The city was suffering, the economy was suffering, his health was failing, he knew he

The question clearly suggests that the person is watching a movie in a movie theater.<n>2. B: at the park is also out of place. The person is at a movie theatre, not a park.<n>3. C: martorell is also wrong. A person doesn't go to the park to watch a movie. Furthermore, the question clearly suggests that the movie is being watched in a theatre rather than out-of-doors.<n>4, D: jeep is also an incorrect answer.

It is clear from the context that the clerk is talking about pay envelopes and nothing else in the context.<n>2) We can eliminate the other incorrect answers because they are neither specified nor mentioned in the sentence.<n>3) Choice B: "desk drawer" doesn't make any sense because we know that the clerk wrote the check on an unspecified subject line. However, there is nothing in the question that precludes the possibility that the clerk has a desk drawer.<n><n>**Input:** A box could be the size of the largest item.

We closed our eyes and we saw it. Choices:  A B C D E<n>Output: We can see that the narrator feels regret and anger towards their ex-spouse.<n>Hence, the line can be interpreted in a variety of different ways such as, We are not living the life we wanted with our spouse, We can always keep the spark alive in our relationship...<n><n>Input: The people that you care about, are in the world to stay; We love them, we'll hold on, even on our worst days.

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3.

There was a target on the wall for him to bounce against.  Where might he be? Choices:  A: pool table B: toy box C: playroom D: park E: closet<n>Output:		The question asks if Billy bounced the ball off a target on the wall and where he might be. His being or not being somewhere doesn't seem to be relevant.<n>1.Billy bounced the wall off a target on the ball suggests a lack of success. For an intended bounce off a wall to happen, the wall and ball need to touch.<n>2. But Billy's bounce did happen. So, 'target on the ball' isn't an obstacle as such. The ball touched and bounced off the targeted wall.<n>3. The text also notes that the target on the wall was for him to shoot against. The target he was shooting at wasn't a problem.<n>4. So, a place where he might not be is a place where the target isn't there, like the closet, and therefore A:pool table can be eliminated.<n>5. In fact, there were some possible obstacles. The ball he threw missed the target, and then Billy got angry.  And he was in the playroom.<n>6. Even after he got the ball, he was in the play room. The ball might have gone off to the closet, or in any of the rooms. However, it was still in a room.<n>7. Hence, C: playroom and D and E can be eliminated. The text doesn't make it clear if Billy's being absent is a problem.  It shows that not being where the ball went to makes no difference.<n>8. So, C: playroom must be the correct answer to this. The missing element was the location of the ball.<n><n>Input:Toni went for a walk. She came across a strange old tree, and she climbed it!  What could possible be inside (inside the tree)? Choices:  A) pudding and shrimp B) diamonds and pearls C) apples and oranges D) coins and lollipops E) birds and bees<n>Output:The last question suggests there was a surprise when Toni climbed the tree.<n>1. What could be inside the tree? could be an indication that she climbed it for a surprise. However, Toni was not searching for something in particular, or trying to uncover any sort of secret in the tree.<n>2. She was just out for a walk and discovered the tree. It's not likely

Choices: 1. There is no difference as long as you are not using a plural pronoun. 2.  There is a difference as you are using a plural pronouce. 3.  They have many difference and there are many difference. 4. Both are correct and don't have to be distinguished. 5. It is a grammatical error to use a plural pronoun in the structure, "there are/there is."<n>Output: There is no grammatical error as long as you don't make a simple mistake of including any form of 'there' in there/here. There is no grammatcal error in using a pronoun (here's/there's). Using a pronoun (here and there) in both cases does not affect the syntax as they both are not the subject. This is a very common error, and it's easy to get confused as how to use a pronoun after 'there.'<n>So the final answer are 1,2,3,4,5<n><n>Input:What do you call the place where you are born? Choices:  a) the first world b) second world c) third world d) earth e) universe<n>Output:  Correct answer is D: Earth.

However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness.

The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:James didn't know what to do.  He felt that he'd ruin his relationship with Jen if he took it further, and he didn't want to do that.  At the same time,  He fight that pushing farther might do what to something good? Choices:  A: found B: destroy C: construct D: fix E: produce<n>Output:		1. First, the text tells us that James felt that he would ruin his relationship with his girlfriend if he continued to pursue her.<n>2. This indicates that James was being careful, or cautious, not that he was being thorough in his pursuit.<n>3. At the same time, his relationship with his girl might not have been ruined had he persevered in his pursuit. This leads us toward the answer to be B: destructive.<n>4. Given this context, B: destructive is the correct answer. Pushing farther would have destroyed James's relationship with his girlfriend.<n>So the final answe is B: destructive<n><n>Input:John's report revealed problems in both his and the company's accounting practices.  As a result of John's work, the accounting firm lost a lot of what?? Choices:  A. prestige B. business C. clientele D. assets E. reputation <n>Output:1. The text tells us that John's report revealed problems with both his and firm's accounting practices, so the report revealed to us problems of each nature.<n>2. The report having done so, it therefore did not destroy either John's or company's standing.<n>3. Thus, the answer choices in order for A, B, C, D, and E are all correct.<n>4. However we can narrow them down further.<n>5. Of the two we can easily cross out B and C.<n>6. If the report had destroyed the firm's reputation, then it wouldn't still be doing business, which C contradicts. For the same reason, D cannot be correct either.<n>7. Likewise, we cross out D and E, so the options left now are: A and B.<n>8. Finally, based on the rest of the text we can infer that the loss of business would not necessarily be financial, so that leaves A: prestige to be the correct answer.<n>So the final answser is A: prestige<n>

Choices:  A: control people B: settle everything C: buy food D: increase power E: kill bill<n>Output:		1: The question provides key details regarding this conflict.<n>2: The text suggests that Johnny only wanted the dispute over money to be resolved.  Because the question contains an element of control, the key details should be interpreted to reflect this aspect of communication.<n>3: This suggests that Johnny might be able to control people around him and thus can control the outcome of the conflict with Bill.<n>4: This suggests that Johnny could settle the dispute himself which contradicts the previous response.<n>5: The idea that he is the one who controls people suggests that he could buy things instead of killing Bill.<n>6: This suggests that Johnny wants to use money to control things around him and if he didn't have enough, he might need to borrow from Bill.<n>7: This suggests that Johnny would never want to hurt someone so he won't use violence.<n>8: This suggest that he couldn't use money effectively if he lacked power because he wouldn't be able to purchase things.

'potato industry' as the clue implies, the answer must be related to potatoes only.<n>4. There is a phrase' 'famous in its potato industry'.

Choices:  A: regret B: automobile accidents C: drunk driving D: talking nonsense E: talk intelligently<n>Output:		1, Given that the individual does not talk nonsense when not inebriated, their speech would be affected by getting drunk.<n>2. Since becoming drunk can result in having an automobile accident, the text suggests that this is a likely side effect of becoming drunk.<n>3. It never mentions the individual becoming less intelligent, nor do they regret any aspect of their behavior.<n>4. Thus, Choice C and E do not correspond to any implied characteristics of someone's speech after getting drunk.<n>5. If the person became inebriated, it is likely that they will become less intelligent when speaking, as drunk or intoxicated states often bring about a decrease in cognitive abilities.<n>6. However, this is not the same as talking nonsense, as drinking will not cause the person to start talking random, unintelligible phrases.<n>7. So the only remaining choice is C: drunk driving. The most likely side effect of getting drunk is driving a car and possibly causing harm to oneself or others.<n>So the final is D: drunk driving.<n><n>Input: After his second child's early death, William struggled with alcoholism, but he eventually conquered this problem.

Choices:  A: fall asleep B: relaxation C: deafness D: bored E: calm<n>Output:		The sentence 'Why is this person not listing to music' indicates that 'this person' is either deaf, bored, or both.<n>1. If it were either 'a' or 'c', then the phrase 'this person is not listening' would be incorrect.<n>2. Moreover, the phrase here is that 'this person is not' and not 'is not listening' as the phrase is referring to the reason that person is not 'listening to music'.  As such, 'listening' would be after the verb, which is incorrect.<n>3. If 'this person is not deaf' or 'this person is both deaf and bored', then the last part of the phrase, 'to music' is unnecessary.<n>4. Thus, the only possibility is that 'this person' either is or both deaf and boring, in which case the correct choice is C: deafness and B: Relaxation.<n>```<n>Answers: A: perfunctory<n>```<n><n>---<n>## Exercise 3: In the following multiple choice question, what might the sentence describe?<n><n>Input: John was very eager to become the new owner of the vase, and so made an offer that he knew there was no possibility it could be accepted.

It is not a constant feature of human behavior (as suggested by the 'all the' phrase used in the question). Therefore, the final answer is C: humans reproduce and sit down.<n>Input:The last day of kindergarten, she waved to her teacher and parents.  She held her diploma and smiled at the people around her.  The first day of a new preschool, all the children played loudly and chatted with their friends.  One young girl in the play room was very worried because she was wearing her favorite T-shirt with her favorite character. She was hoping that none of her friends stole her shirt.  All the children played happily in the classroom.  She went to school.  She walked down some of the streets that lead to her house. A car sped by and nearly hit her. She was terrified.

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:Where is a monkey likely to be found in the rainforest? Choices:  A: tree tops B: rain forest C: zoological gardens D: great outdoors E: zoo<n>Output:			<n>1. Where is a monkey likely likely to be found in a rainforest?<n>2. The first thing that comes to mind is the tree tops, since monkeys are primates after all.<n>3. However, it is also possible that a monkey could be in a zoo or forest area.<n>4. A zoo is probably the most common place to find a monkey.<n>5. While it is true that some zoos are in rain forest areas, it is not an option that applies in general.<n>6. In most cases, a zoo is in a more densely populated area that is not really a 'zoo' per se.<n>7. Therefore, D: great outdoor is the correct answer.  The monkey is likely to be in the great outdoors.<n>So the final answers is D: great outdoos<n><n><n>Input: John was the oldest person in the room by at least 20 years, and everyone was impressed. Choices:  A; older than B: younger than C; more than D: less than E: more by<n>Output: 1) The first thing that comes is that there are two possibilities, which is a discrepancy.<n>2) There may have been more than 100 people in the room.<n>3) John was the oldest person, meaning he was older than at least someone else.<n>4) The two possibilities must be a discrepancy of at least x years.<n>5) Since the two possibilities are not even numbers, the discrepancy is at least 20.<n>6) However, there is another possibility: John is the oldest, but it is also possible that the person just before him is also older.<n>7) This may complicate the analysis, but it is not impossible.<n>8) There may have been a 10-year-old in the room.<n>9) This may simplify the analysis again, but it is not necessary for the validity of the logic.<n>10) Therefore, C: more than is the correct answer. It may be that the discrepancy may simply be two possible possibilities.<n>So the final conclusion is C: more than.<n><n><n>Input:  My house is nicer and neater than your house.

Choices:  A: trouser leg B: sick bay C: own home D: petting zoo E: mother's hair<n>Output:		1. The opening sentence of the question has the phrase "in the petting zoo" implying that a ferret is a zoo animal and probably not seen that often.<n>2. The phrase "sick bay" does not appear in the sentence.<n>3. The phrase "trouser leg" does not appear in this sentence.<n>4. The phrase "petting zoo" is a correct answer that is found in the sentence.<n>5. The phrase "the mother's hair" is not mentioned in the sentence.<n>6.

Choices:  A: pass water B: bathe C: listen to each other D: feel pleasure E: reproduce asexually<n>Output:		First, the animals were not good swimmers, so the question posits that they were unable to do something.<n>2. The choice between feeling pleasure and reproduction asexually appears to be a binary choice between one or the other.<n>3. If they were good swimmers and could float, they could have spent more time feeling pleasure. They would have had more time to bond with their mates, which, given this context, would not have required a lot of effort on their parts. If they had plenty of time together, they could have reproduced asexually.<n>4. Therefore, the correct choice is C: listen to each of one. Their inability to swim prohibited their ability to listen to each other, which could have helped them learn to swim.<n>So the final Answer is C: listen to their each other<n><n>Input: A pig was walking along a road.

So, the final answer is B: countertop.<n><n>Input: In baseball, a strike is a legal pitch. Choices:  A. A strike is one in which home base is not reached.  B. A strike is when a player hits the ball with a bat.  C: A strike is a legal pitch on the first attempt.  D: A strike is when you throw a ball and miss a player.  E: A strike is when the ball lands outside the stadium.<n>Output: The question suggests that we don't understand baseball well enough to say whether a strike is a legal or illegal pitch even though B and E are false statements.<n>It is also clear from the question that a strike is an illegal pitch as it is described as a 'legal pitch'.<n>Therefore, it must be C or D, as the choices are the only legal responses to the question.<n>Since A and E are falsehoods, both are inaccurate, whereas C is a correct answer.

This suggests that the contribution were collected in the house rather than outside the house.<n>3-The speaker also states he had come back from the drive. This further suggests that there was nothing to fetch from outside his house to bring it to a collection point. These two sentences suggest that the speaker cannot have gone out to collect the items.<n>4-Since he was collecting the contributions indoors, and the items are likely to have been delivered in cans, bags or other unpackaged food, we can eliminate A: shelf B; cellar C: fridge D: Kitchen, E: grocery shop.<n>5-The speaker has not collected the canned food in a fridge or shop since he has to get it back in a can.<n>6-The speaker may have put the canned contributions in a cupboard instead.

Where would he look? Choices:  A: fish market B: hawaiian waters C: gulf of mexico D: tropical sea E: south pacific ocean<n>Output:		Johnny clearly isn't looking for blowfish near America. The question focuses this inquiry on where he should be looking instead, given that he's not near there.  In addition, blowfish are often found in areas with warmer waters.  Finally, we can infer from Johnny's behavior that he wouldn't be looking in the fish market as this is not where he's currently located.<n>The correct answer is therefore E: south pacific oce<n><n>Input:If the moon could be seen, it would be beautiful.

Choices:  A: apartment B: pantry C: table D: living room E: shelf<n>Output:		The sentence could be referring to any of several different objects.  The text explicitly says that the person was looking for a plate, which suggests that the objects referred to are kitchen objects.  A: apartment and B: pantry are both places to store dishes or kitchen items and are both non-descriptive, not including any relevant information.<n>The same is true of E: shelf.  If one were to think of it as a place where dishes are stored, this would be relevant information.  However, the text says nothing about the books or the plate being stored on the shelf.  Considering the information available, a shelf cannot serve as either an answer choice, as it doesn't relate to the specified missing information.<n>Due to the lack of description, we can only look to what is explicitly stated.  C: table is described as a place where something (dishes, presumably) can be placed while E: living room describes something (a place) that can store something (plants, a piano) that, in this case, does not contain what is missing (plants or a piano). This could mean the living room is a place that, in this context would contain tables upon which to place things, but to a different conclusion. There is no explicit statement that the aforementioned living room (living rooms in general, in fact) store books that, by way of a logical conclusion, would indicate that it is actually the answer.<n>Ultimately, the missing information is more likely to be found by looking for the information explicitly stated in the text.  Thus, A: apartment and C: table are better options.<n><n># Coding logic for A-E<n>* a-c=1<n>* d-e=0<n>

This means there could be cases where parents yelled and it wasn't beneficial. Then, A.<n><n>Input:Bowl and I ate a big dinner before the party.  If you want to eat, speak up.  Choose the sentence in the text that is best parallel in meaning to the given sentence. Choices:  A:- We ate a big dinner  B:- If you want to eat choose a sentence between B and C  C:- You want to eat?<n>Output:D.  The correct sentence reads, "You want to _eat_?"; B doesn't use an infinitive. Since "to eat" suggests eating something, "to eat" should precede "out loud".<n><n>Input:I'm worried.  I should put some more salt on the stew.  Choose the best choice. Choices: A:- I'm worried  B:- It's time to eat Choice:- C:- I don't want to eat<n>Output: C, for several reasons: it is the sentence immediately following the previous sentence. A and B are not parallel sentences, so C is the right answer. Also, C's sentence is the next sentence, not the last sentence of the paragraph.

Choices:  A B C D E <n>Output: 1: Given that the question expects the reader to find out what the problem was after a half hour of troubleshooting, "I don't want to know what the problem is" suggests that the issue in question is something that would likely require quite a bit of time or effort to resolve.<n>2: "The problem" here can be implied as general troubleshooting and not specific to any particular problem or task.<n>3: "After a half hour of searching" implies that "the problem" was difficult to locate and thus the need to do this much troubleshooting.<n>4: "finding the right part" is an action that implies that the problem was caused by either an object, situation, or part of the machine being misaligned or misidentified and thus the need for both searching and finding the correct part.<n>5: "figuring out how to use" further implies that "the problem", in this context, was likely caused by being unfamiliar with the use of a particular part or how it was supposed to function in relation to the rest of the machine.<n>6: So, in the context of the entire passage, the most likely cause of "the problem" is that it was some sort of mechanical or electrical issue and needed to be fixed using the correct part.<n>So, the final answer is E: Difficulty with mechanics<n><n>Input: I'm not a genius, but I'm an educated man: I can read, write, and speak.<n>Output: 1 It was unclear from the context what the author was trying to accomplish with the title.<n>2 That author of the article was self-described as being

Choices:  A: complications B: tiredness C: anger D: trial E: court case<n>Output:		The sentence mentions that ‘feelings’ can compel an individual to instituting civil actions. From the given options, the verb 'instituting', can be derived from Latin word ’instituere' which means establishing, setting up or founding. A) In our modern context, we use the word ‘complexities’ and ‘complications’ to suggest that a person is troubled by a state or situation which has various aspects or sub-groups. However, in this context ‘complication’ is used to describe the feelings/instability that drives a person/groups to institute civil actions. This use of the word is the closest match to civil action which might be motivated by the feeling of frustration, anger, etc.<n><n>Thus, the answer is closest to B)

It is possible that a furniture store will carry a fishing rod if it's an unusual item that people are specifically looking for. However, sporting goods stores that carry fishing rods are considered places to buy fishing rods. However, the question does not specify if the furniture store carried a fishing rod, so the store could be excluded from the answer choices.<n>### Instruction:Answer this question. <n><n>Input: It is a serious social issue to make everyone in a community feel welcome and comfortable with one another.  Choices:  A. It is an acceptable practice to make publicly known one's sexual preferences. B. The people who live within one's social sphere should not cause one to feel uncomfortable. C. One should find out the interests of others, thereby showing kindness and respect. D. It is important to know one's neighbors well enough to know how to address them. E. One should be considerate of those around one.  Output: C: 1. It is evident from the context that when people make everyone in a community "feel welcome and comfortable", it doesn't mean to make everyone feel the same way as one feels (as implied in answer A).<n>2. Answer B is also ruled out as the context clearly states that "comfortable" is referring specifically to the feeling that one gets when among other people.<n>3. Answer D also suggests the opposite because knowing one's neighbors entails having an intimate knowledge of their personal habits and ways that could lead to the possibility of making uncomfortable.<n>4. The answer is C which entails making the feelings of the people in one's community a priority.<n>So the final answers should be C: It is important to know your neighbors so you can address them with kindness and respect, so that everyone around you can feel welcomes and comfortable.

Rather, it moves the masts on what? Choices:  A: sailing vessel B: paddleboat C: ship D: motorboat E: tugboat<n>Output:		 Input:The helm is a moveable object that moves the masts.<n>1. So the helm is the thing that moves what is moveable.<n>2. So if the helm moves the masts of a ship, that is what the mast is part of. i.e. the helm moves the ships mast.<n>3. So the correct answer is what is a ship moveable part. (i.e - If the helm moves the ship's mast, the "ship" would be the "moveable part" and the moveable part is a part of a ship).  So the missing term here is ship (and the choices offered in the question can eliminate options A, E, and F).<n>4. So if the helms moves a ships mast, that is what the helm is part of. i,e, the helm moves ships mast.<n>5. So the helm moves the moveable part of the ship and is part of the ship. So the correct answer should be "The helm is part of a ship, and it moves a ships moveable part." (Choices offered C and B).<n>

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:The woman experienced great joy, but despite that this was a what? Choices:  A: misery B: sadness C: bad time D: sorrow E: play time<n>Output:		1) The word 'experienced' indicates that the woman experienced a specific emotion, and 'great joy' suggests an extreme type of happiness.<n>2) The phrase 'but despite that' contradicts the word great joy.<n>3) This suggests that she actually experienced quite the opposite which means she experienced 'a bad time'.<n><n>So the final answer will be D: BAD TIME<n><n>Input: We have been to the party, where no one could come. Choices:  A : In which no one can be B : Where no one can come C : At which no one can D : Where no one does E : Which no one can<n>Output:The first clue is the phrase "where no one could come". We can deduce that it is a party.<n>- The following words "party" are not definite enough to indicate the type of party.<n>- We can also determine it is a small party because "at which" and "which" are the type of words used in specific situations.<n>- These situations can be more than just a party, so it should not be the type of party the author is looking for.<n>- The party is limited to a few people "where no one could."<n>- This can conclude that the party is private, where only a few number of people can be invited, thus the answer is C at which no one could come.

Choices:  A: direct traffic B: board vessels C: arm themselves D: help people E: find drugs<n>Output:		1: The sentence begins with the fact that "some types of police" is what we are finding out about.<n>2: It is not explicitly clear whether we are looking for the police's primary job function or the other jobs they do as a supplement of their main job.<n>3: We can make this inference from the rest of the sentence where we are specifically told that the police perform a few minor tasks.<n>4: We only have five choices and a few minor jobs are not necessarily the same as minor jobs.<n>5: By minor, we assume it means tasks like directing traffic instead of their primary responsibilities like finding drugs or boading vessels.<n>6: Thus, the right answer is B: some police do direct traffic when they are not finding drugs or boarding vessels to apprehend criminals. The key here is that we are not explicitly told in the sentence that the police's main job is just directing traffic. While this is an important fact, it is not necessary for us to know for the question.<n><n>Final Answer: B: direct traffic

Choices:  A: new hampshire B: dairy farm C: farm field D: texas E: county fair<n>Output:		Here 'I' and'my heifer' are objects, so 'where' would need an object ('heifer out East') to refer to.

It is unclear if this sentence is being given as a question or an answer. If an answer,  "to know you," needs both a subject and an indirect object.  <n>"You," is not clearly the subject or the object, since it could be "I" or an indirect object "about you." If a fragment, "you already know." is an answer. If a question, "Well enough to know what?" is an answer.  <n>There is no clear choice between A, B, and C, they should all be discarded.<n><n>D is a complete sentence fragment, but it is nonsensical.<n><n>E is an interesting one, but it would be more gramatically correct to say "I like to know about you." "Well enough to know about..." sounds awkward.  Either a singular or non-prepositional verb must follow "well enough": You must know enough... about him:  "I like to know what." sounds better. It can sound odd if the subject is 'I' to leave out "to" and use "what" instead of "who", but the latter is less awkward here.<n><n>So the final answer was E; 'I like knowing about what you know', or  'I like knowing who knows'<n><n>Input: I wish I had some malt liquor.

Although a binding is a divider, it does not store papers, so it cannot answer the question. <n>6: C: obesity is incorrect because it is a word, not a divider.

Outgoingness is closely related to personality type being extroverted.<n>2. Extroverted personalities are often drawn to new experiences.<n>3. Since new experiences are inherently outgoing, this option is correct.<n>4. Since this is the correct choice, we know that answer D cannot be correct.<n>5.

Stray dogs do not typically end up in stores, however they do arrive at animal shelters, dog shows and the living room. Strays who arrive in the living room are more likely to be found in the kitchen, not necessarily in the living room.<n>3. Most stray dogs in the living room are brought to animal shelters, or caught in cat traps which catch both cats and dogs. Animal shelters often have many strays. Dog shows usually do not have stray dogs as they are more likely to be pet dogs.<n>4. Dogs that arrive at pet stores are more likely to be there with owners as owners will often take their dogs to pet stores. Stray dogs are only likely to be found in pet stores due to pet stores adopting strays. <n>5. However, if a stray dog does happen to wander into a pet store, it is more likely to be the owner that finds it than the owners do actually know that the dog is a stray.<n>6. Hence, the most likely place to find a stray small dog is an animal shelter. <n>So the final answer should be C: georgia<n><n>Input:You won't like the results, but what exactly were the results of the poll?

First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness.

It also says we eat something after we have eaten something. So we know that we eat some food then we eat something, but we also know that we eat a lot more food after we eat something, which cannot be because we have already eaten a lot of food. So the answer has to be A:- after we have eaten food we eat nothing because we've already eaten something.

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:Where do  you park in the parking lot with shopping bags? Choices:  A: amusement park B: urban area C: airport D: shopping malls E: train station<n>Output:		1.'Shopping bags' refers to items that are bought in the mall, which implies that only the answer choices that are related to the shopping malls should be included in the answer.<n>2. Given that John parks in the mall, the only choices that are suitable are D: shopping mall.<n>3. Choices B and C are incorrect as they are unrelated to the shopping bags<n>4.'Airport' is incorrect as it has only commercial or private planes, there's no reference to shopping or parking, neither is 'Amusement park', which is similar to airport, yet is unrelated.<n>So the final answers are  D: shopping mals<n><n><n>Input:It would be impossible to find a book by John. Choices:  A.  at the library B. on the internet C. at the bookstore D. with the librarian<n>Output:<n>1. The first line of the sentence implies that John's book is unavailable at the moment.<n>2. The latter part of the sentence implies that there is no way to find John's book because John 'could not be found' - an indication that his whereabouts is not known.<n>3. The answer choices are correct - John's book is not available at the library, internet, or bookstore.<n>4. The question does not ask whether the missing information is 'at the bookstore, the library or on the internet', but whether one would find John's book at the library/bookstore/internet - a question that is only answered by 'at the library'. <n>Therefore, C: at the bookstore<n><n>Input:They took the medicine for the cold without getting sick.  Choices: A: as a precaution B: with a remedy C: for a fever D: due to headache E: due to cold<n>Output: 1"without getting sick" indicates that they took the right kind of medicine, therefore the correct answer is B:'used as a precaution'.<n>2. The correct answer is not C:'for a fever', as "took the medicine" doesn't imply 'took it for the fever'.<n>3. In addition, the last part of the sentence - "without getting sick" indicates B: 'as a precaution" as they did not even get

Choices:  A; slap B: struck C: punch D: banged E: tapped<n>Output:  The witness clearly tells us that a thug got up and hit the witness. This means that A.SLAGGED, B. STRUCK or C.

Choices:  Answers: A: sprinted out of a sneeze B: meowed out C: pounced out of the bark D: pounced out E: meowed out of the sneeze<n>Output: The prefix'meow' and the suffix 'out' are not in the dictionary.

The bank account C: No one knows the answer D. The gold E: His clothes<n>Output: The last two verbs do not relate to rich people. Therefor, I would put A as my answer.

Choices:  A: birds B: action C: butterflies D: happiness E: anxiety<n>Output:		1. The first sentence is not clear, if it's not a riddle then it's unclear why there is a question mark.<n>2. There are no questions being asked, so 'what', at least in the context of the sentence is superfluous and the question mark has no logical purpose.<n>3.  However, the structure to answer the question is clear because there is a finite list of possible answers.<n>4.  The last sentence is not a question.<n>5.  Although it may be open to interpretation, there is an implied exclusion of 'death'.<n>6.  All of these points imply that creatures performing pollinaton _are_ loved my millions, which the correct answer is clearly, butterflies<n><n>so the final answer is A: butterflies<n>### Instruction:Answer the paragraph given with a single word or short phrase, each beginning with the specified letter.<n><n>The question mark is superfluous in the given sentence, if it were to be used properly then it would be in conjunction with an actual question.<n><n>Input:"What creatures performing the pollination are loved by millions?"

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:If a person wants to buy a radio, where are they likely to go? Choices:  A: station B: every car and house C: shop D: bedroom E: space shuttle<n>Output:		The text doesn't really specify who is asking the question, or who is answering. It's more likely that the person being asked the question is one of the people in the house or office, as you might be more likely to buy items such as a radio when at home, or for your workplace. For example, if we were discussing items for the office, I might suggest a radio. So C: shop is the correct answer, as this is where you are likely to go in this situation.<n>Therefore, the final answer is C: shop<n>#!/bin/python3<n><n>import sys<n>while True:<n>    try:<n>        q = int(sys.stdin.buffer.readline().strip())<n>    except ValueError:<n>        sys.stdout.write('Bad number.')<n>        continue<n>    if q == 0:<n>        sys.exit(0)<n>    q -= 1<n>    print(str(q).zfill(5), " = ",''.join(map(lambda x: str(x).zfill(5)(15), str(q-1).zfill(10)[1:-1])),<n>      '\n', " " * (63 - len(q)))

A hero<n>Output:A:  An outlaw or "invalid" is the correct answer given the context of the story of the little old lady who refused to give up on her farm in order to join the rebellion and fight tyranny and oppression.  Because she refused, she has been declared an illegal and, with everyone else now being an illegal, is no longer allowed to farm independently but must take one job per month in order to pay for the government's 'protection'.  Because of her courage, this has left her in a state of fear and poverty, as the small jobs offered are below what she would have made working for herself.<n><n>Input:It was a difficult situation.

Choices:  A: nebraska B: new york C: mexico D: home E: utah<n>Output:		1: Given the sentence structure and content, the text suggests that the speaker is looking for a steak house nearby with a view of cornfields.<n>2: Hence, the correct answer is Nebraska.<n>3: Nebraska being a cornfield state, the speaker is likely to find steakhouses there, though he doesn't say he is looking for steakhouses in the question.<n>4: Therefore, D: home is the incorrect answer. As Nebraska was never mentioned as a possible answer, and the speaker is not at home, it cannot be the correct answer.<n>5. Similarly, C: mexico and B: New York don't seem to be logical choices as Mexico and Newyork were never mentioned in the text, even indirectly as potential states.<n>6: Likewise, A: nebraska is a more likely answer, since nebraska is located in the midwest, near corn fields, and nebraska can be found near newyork since it is a state in the united states.<n>7: Hence, d: NEBRASKA is the correct answer.<n>

Choices:  A: race track B: kentucky derby C: american southwest D: triple crown E: horse derby<n>Output:		The context of the entire question contains 3 key elements; Everybody seemed to have a hor... Everybody seemed to have horse... and which always brings out the biggest... The first key element in the question is the one stating that everybody seemed to have a horse.<n>The second key element is Everybody seemed to have the horse at a specific situation where... and the third is which is always said to bring out the biggest crowds. From these 3 elements we can assume that Everybody or all people has/have a horse? This could be correct of course, because the question does not specify only a specific group. Moreover, we know that Everybody seemed to have horses at a sporting event such as a race track. Therefore, the answer that could be inferred from here is that Everybody has horses and is going to a sporting event. However, based on the second key element Everybody seemed to have Horses and the third element always Brings out, the answer we are looking for is 'a Race Track' where we already know Everybody goes. Hence the answer would be D: Race Track...<n><n>Input:I can not imagine anyone wanting to marry a man with such a bad temper but i have known the most unhappy marriages to continue for many years and unhappy people to share the same bed for decades without a word being spoken between them? Choices: 1.A-2.B 3.C 4.D 5.E 6.F 7.G<n>Output: From the provided scenario, the following can be inferred:<n>1. Every married couple is unhappy.<n>2. Not every married couple that is unhappy stays unhappy for a long time.<n>3. Not every married couple stays unhappy even if they are unhappy.<n>4. No one desires to be married to someone with such a bad temper.<n>5. There have been successful/happy marriages that have continued for quite a while after the two parties married.<n>6. There have been marriages where nothing was said for quite a while and yet remained a happy marriage.<n>From the context, the answer being 'F' appears to be more suitable than the other choices. This is because it is the only option which does not contradict any of the above facts mentioned(The last 3 facts). The other options contradicting facts may be correct but do not add to our inferences.<n><n>Input

Choices:  A: move away from B: laying in C: sweating D: movement E: walking out of<n>Output:		1.'Stopping standing' in the sentence 2. implies that the person is at rest and not acting.<n>3. So'stopping' is implied to be the cause of the person moving out of the puddle, rather than the motion or movement of the person. Therefore, A: move away from isn't the correct answer. <n>4. Similarly, moving out of the pond is the opposite of'stopping standing' in the pond. The person  is moving. Hence  D: movement is not the right choice either.<n>5. In the sentence,'move away from' and'movement' are the elements that contradict'stop standing'.<n>6. So the answer should be 'laying in' and not C: sweating.<n><n>Input:  The man's heart had stopped beating because he had stopped eating.<n>  Choices:  A. lay stopped  C. put a stop to  E. stop with<n>      Output:<n>      The answer should be 1. lay stopped. There was not a comma after the word'stopped'. This means that the two words should be together and be an infinitive. Since'stops' is plural, the correct answer is A: lay stopped.<n><n>Input: The man's heart stopped because he suddenly fell from a 1st story window.<n>  Choices B. stop the 2. stop it 4. stop the heart<n>      Output:<n>      1. B. stop the is correct. It should be, "The man's heart stopped", not "The man's hearts stopped". The man's heart is singular and takes 'the'.<n><n>Input:The young woman got a job offer which her sister stopped doing. Choices:B, E, F <n>      Output:   F. stop doing: The sentence suggests that the sister quit or left, so the correct answer is  F. stop doing.<n>

Choices:  A: squid B: pencil C: newspaper D: fountain pen E: printer<n>Output:		I understand that this question relates the printing of text in a book. To print text requires ink. The choices are B: pencil, which suggests that it involves drawing, and E: the printer, a machine, which suggests an automatic process.<n>1. Given these contexts, C: newspaper suggests that it requires 'ink' for printing.<n>2. Since printing is not mentioned in the text, D: fountain, which suggests a process in which an ink is manually dipped, and that it is not a machine like a printer.<n>3. So the correct answer choice is C: newspaper.<n><n>Input: In the end, all the kids agreed, it would be nice to build a small house for Peter and the kids to live on the island. The kids agreed and they went back to the island to continue their journey. Choices:  A. Build B. Go back C. Tear down D. Build a large house E. Return to the mainland <n>Output: I understand the situation as being a group of kids who plan to go to another island to build a house of some kind. The task they must complete is building a house for Peter and the children to live in.<n>1. From the text, we can tell that they have agreed to 'go back'.<n>2. From the text we can also tell that they came to an agreement in the last paragraph.<n>3. This suggests that C: Tear down and Build a house will make little sense. The children did not agree to tear down the structure they planned to build.<n>4. This suggests that we have to be careful as to what is implied and not implied in the text. Given these contexts. We can conclude the correct answers are B: Go back<n><n>Input: Who was the first leader in the United Nations? Choices: 1. A: Harry S Truman 2. B: U Thant 3. C: John F. Kennedy 4.

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5.

Choices:  A: dictionary B: wilderness C: fly D: underground E: colorado<n>Output:		The question starts with a negative statement ('Where does a marmosets not usually go?') that suggests the opposite is possible.<n><n>1. 'Dictionary' is a place where marmosets don't usually go.<n>2. Therefore, the correct answer must belong to one of the rest since the question already specified one of the options does not.<n>3. 'Wilderness' and 'fly' are unlikely choices as they already suggest that the marmoset did/would go there, and a question that asks where one doesn't usually go is unlikely to give an answer that suggests they do.<n>4. 'Colorado' and 'underground' are also unlikely choices since 'underground' doesn't need to be in the context of going and 'Colorado' is not a location where marmots (as the question suggests), usually go.<n>5. Finally, option D describes a marmot eating as opposed to the question which suggested going. In addition, marmots don't eat flies. Furthermore, there is no information in the question about a specific place a marmot may go, so D cannot be the correct answer as it is a general statement.<n>6. Therefore A: dictionary is the correct answer. Since a marmoset does not usually go into a dictionary, it is the answer that would be given.<n>So the final is A: dictionary<n><n>Input:I'd like you to go to the store.I promise that you can borrow my car while you're gone.

Choices:  A.: I'd like you to get to the store.,  B: Would you go to the store?,  C: I need you to go to the shop.,  D: I'd enjoy you coming to the market.,  E: I want you to get there.<n>Output: After careful reading we notice that the only command is not a question. In fact the question 'Shall I have a glass of milk with dessert?' (not included in the book) follows the command structure without being treated like a question.<n><n>1. The command starts with 'I'd like...' implying that the other person has an choice of accepting or opposing the command.  Therefore, answer A: would be incorrect, since it is not a command but an answer.<n>2. The next few answers (B

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:I wanted  a side chair for people to visit me while I worked, where did I have it put? Choices:  A: building B: office C: library D: table E: bathtub<n>Output:		1.”I wanted” implies a preference, an interest in the chair. The speaker wants to have the chair placed somewhere.<n>2.The speaker's work is described in the context of a work area, perhaps his office or desk. Given this context, having a chair “in  my office” (or near the desk) isn't an option.<n>3.The phrase “where I worked” isn't defined, but implies that the chair was meant to be somewhere near the desk, not in it.  Further, “where I worked” is not defined as a specific room.<n>4.“Building” suggests that the speaker is describing a location within a larger building complex, usually a residential building with a separate desk area or office for the occupant.<n>Given the context of the speaker's work area (office), we can deduce that, logically, the location “where I worked” cannot be “office”. This means that “building” is also not an option.<n>A.Office C, B.Library D and E.BathTub  are option for the seat.  So the answer choice is C: 'Library'<n><n>

First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:What is the biggest speech in the capital? Choices:  A: each state B: gettysburg address C: state of union D: each country E: europe<n>Output:		Giving the definition of a "speech" as "a formal oration that contains a typically impassioned appeal to the emotions and an exhortation to some single action," and considering the capital of the United States of America to be Washington, D.C., the correct answer to this question is "B: Gettysburg Address." The "speech" in the capital in this story is the Gettysburg Address. Though the answer choices may have had some sort of impassioned appeal to an action (as speeches often do) it does not follow the specifics of the question wording, as none of the choices could be considered "oral" forms of communication. <n>In the same sentence, the definition of a "capital" is "the official government seat," as well as "the city or town where an office or authority is based."  There are only two choices that fit the answer (A and E), and neither of these choices fits the specified "speech" in a particular capital.  The question doesn't specify if the "speech" is written or in person, but we can safely assume given the context and question wording. <n>Given that Washington, D.C. is the capital of the United states, the "speech" in this question is clearly Gettysburg Address and it is the biggest, but it's not the biggest speech in the world. This means you need the most detailed answer: the answer you need is E: each country.<n>So the final answers should be each country. And the final answer is E: each country<n><n>Input:When my friend asked me to come over, he had nothing to eat. so I went over to his house.Choices:  A: brought B: had C: had nothing D: got E: was gone<n>Output:  The correct answer to this question depends on the meaning of the word "nothing".<n>In traditional usage, it means the total absence of something. So the correct answer to the question of why he had "nothing to eat" is D: Got<n><n>Input:A man had a dream in which he was walking his pet bird. Choices:  A. dog B. cat C. elephant D. rat E. parrot<n>Output: The correct answer to this is C: Dogs (although pets can often be categorized as 'four legged animals') are never specified;<n>

Choices:  A: grief B: solo C: isolation D: pleasure E: happiness<n>Output:		1) The text says that someone who is abandoned by everyone after being married feels like being'solo', so the answer is going to be between Choices A: grief B; Solo.<n>2) The text does not give any information as to whether the feeling is positive, neutral, or negative. However, we can deduce from the structure of the question that the feeling is negative, so the answer is gonna be between Choices C: isolation D; Pleasure.<n>3) Based on the above logic, the final answer is going to fall between Choices A: Grief B: Solo for option 1 and Choices C : Isolation D: Pleasure for option 2.<n>

Choices:  A: fun B: talent C: learn about D: intelligence E: recognize<n>Output:		The question states that she had a knack for entertaining, and that it was something that everyone told her that she had.<n><n>1. This description implies that the knack was not being used to her advantage.<n>2. The question also suggests that she possessed the knack despite not doing anything with it, as everyone told her that she did.<n>3. The only potential skill implied here is entertaining, so the correct answer is A: fun. If she had more fun instead of keeping her talent hidden, she would have entertained everyone more thoroughly.<n>So the final ans is A: fun<n><n>Input: I made my peace with the fact that I need a what to live my life to the full extent. Choices: A: handicap B: disability C: ability D: impediment E: hindrance<n>Output: The context of the sentence asserts that in order to live one’s life fully, they would need to overcome a hindrance.<n><n>1. “Peace” implies that they have made progress in accepting their situation, if not a full adjustment.<n>2. “Live my life to the fullest” implies that the thing they lack is the ability to live life fully.<n>3. This hindering object is what is blocking them from fulfilling the goals presented by this statement.<n>4. Based on this context, only object C: disability, and not object E: hindrance, is relevant.<n>5. Disability is one who is unable to function or achieve their goals, whereas hinderance is a set of conditions that prevents that functioning.<n>6. The person lacks the ability to live life to the best of their potential due to disability.<n>7. Therefore, the correct answer is D: ability, as they made their peace with an unfortunate disability that prevented the full living of one’s life.<n>So the final anser is D: ability<n><n>Instruction:Answer the following.<n><n>Input: Her grandmother had raised her with the idea that she should work hard to do her what she wants to do.

He makes these selling pitches at the showroom or on the roads.<n>2. In the context of a car showroom, a salesman 'rolls' over his pitches to try and convince a customer. However, the'screaming' of salesmen can only be found in movies. This type of sales pitch would not work in real life. <n>3. Thus, the sales pitches will appear "suddenly" and "bottom out". The first appears after he "bottoms out", the latter indicates that he stands still and tries to persuade customers.<n>4. A: "Appear suddenly" and "bottom out" are the right answers<n><n>Input:I called him a "dumb blond", what's a blond?Choices: A: female B: dumb C: male D: dumb & male E: female & dumb<n>Output: 1"Dumb" implies that the person is of average intelligence while "Blond" can imply "female" or "male".<n>2.

"Dumb & male" is not an option as that would suggest that male blonds are dumb.<n>4. 2 blonds - a male and a female do not necessarily mean the male blond is dumb or vice versa. "Dumb & Male" is incorrect<n>5. Therefore the correct answer is "female" and "dumb"<n><n>Input:I'll tell you a joke and then I'll tell you a fact!Choices: A: I'll die B: I'll be killed C: I'll be put to sleep D: I'll be buried <n>Output: 1:"I'll tell" means I intend to share something.<n>2."tell you a joke" implies that I first share a joke with an audience.<n>3."tell you a fact" implies that I share a fact with an audience.<n>4.

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:In what place could you find air that has been breathed by many people recently?

Choices:  Loft: This option implies that the man was intending to replace an existing floor of his home.<n>Home Depot: This refers to the man looking for material for his loft.  This is possible, but given the choice of options, this is less likely.<n>House: This implies that the man's home had flooring material.  However, the man was not looking for flooring material for his home, he was looking somewhere else.<n>Tiles: This implies using the flooring for a purpose other than a home.  However, the choice of option indicates to replace an existing floor in his home.<n>Carpet Store: This option refers to getting a material for carpets (or flooring). This option can be chosen, but the man was looking for flooring for his house, not carpets.<n>So the final alternative is House<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the multiple choice question using the words in the following context.<n>Input:   I can't help but admire her.

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:Mark wanted to know the truth, because he didn't want to continue existing in what? Choices:  A: understand B: were there C: ignorance D: in-between E: ignorant<n>Output:		1) The phrasing of the question suggests that Mark desired to ascertain the truth so he could continue on the path set before him.<n>2) Mark wanted to acquire 'understanding' instead of knowledge - as evidenced by the fact that the first sentence describes him as 'ignorant' (unaware of things) and he doesn't want to continue in that state.<n>3) He doesn't want to exist in either 'knowledge' or 'understanding' as that would imply he is either overloaded with too much information (which we know is not case as is evidenced by the first sentence), or lacking enough information.<n>4) Similarly, his desire to exist in ignorance is negated by the second sentence as ignorance is the absence of knowledge.<n>5) Accordingly, the final answer is B:understanding.<n>The answer choices, A: understanding B:were there C: ignorance. D: in-between The answer: B: understanding<n><n>Input:Jane realized that the whole thing was a terrible accident the moment she realized that the people were all talking about who? Choices:  a. her b. what had happened c. her and what had happened to others as well d. nothing at all e. someone<n>Output: 1.) The answer choice 'nothing at all' is negated as the final sentence of the question implies that Jane had gained knowledge of what had happened.<n>2.) The choice'someone' is also negated as it doesn't make sense for Jane to realize something happened and then proceed to not know who said it happened.<n>3.) Choice 'her' is also negated because while she may have realized that what had happened had nothing to do with her on a personal level, she still realized that 'it' had actually happened.<n>4.) Finally, the answer choice 'what had happened' negated on the basis of contradiction as the word 'who' is a pronoun that stands in relation to a noun. However, it is contradictory to suggest that someone is talking about a pronoun.<n>5.) Therefore, 'B:what had happened' is the correct answer.<n>And the answer choices, a. her b. someone c. what had happened. d. her and what had happen to others as well e. nothing at all The answer: B: what had happened<n><n>Input:Making a fool of herself,

Choices:  A: ungulate B: bomber C: body armor D: tank E: hat<n>Output:		1) The word ungulate refers to a particular family of animals, including horses, which is not relevant here.<n>2) Both bomber and tank are nouns, which refers to a manmade device, not the person who is wearing it, and is irrelevant here.<n>3) Body armor refers to a protective vest, which is also a manmade device.<n>4) The word hat is an antonym for "a cannon", i.e. something that protects a person from an impact.<n>Therefore, the correct answer is E: hat.<n><n>Input: How did George Washington cut down a cherry tree? Choices:  He planted it  The boy pulled the saw up A: A B: B C: C D: D E: E<n>Output: 1: No, George Washington did not plant the cherry tree, so the answer is A, he planted it.<n>2) The text doesn't say that the boy was pulling up the saw; it just says that it wasn't he.<n>3) The boy was pulling the saw up doesn't fit the sentence well.<n>4) George Washington might have been a boy at some point too.<n>Therefore, this sentence cannot be D: D.<n><n>Input: I was at a ___ party last night.

Choices:  A: down a river B: city C: repair shop D: parking lot E: neighbor's house<n>Output:		1.) The sentence suggests that the word'someone' is taking the 'car' somewhere. Hence, the first four answers are irrelevant.<n>2.) The answer 'neighbor's house' is incorrect as'someone' is not taking their car there.<n>3.)The answer 'parking lot' is incorrect as'repair shop' is specifically mentioned in the context of somewhere not happy to take their 'car'.<n>4. Thus, only two phrases 'city' and'repair shop' are left, which suggests that'repair shop' would be the correct answer.<n>Final answer is D: repair shop<n><n>Input:I'm a lot more worried than your brother - he knows what happens next. Choices:  A:- B:- C:- D:- E:-<n>Output: This context suggests that the person whose brother knows what happens next is worried compared to their brother.<n>1.) The first two options would only suit the 'person's' context, as the 'brother' knows what happens next, and it isn't mentioned that the 'person' also knows it, or that the person is 'even' more worried than their brother.<n>2.) Therefore the correct answer is C:-. A lot implies that someone is 'worried' by the end of the sentence.<n>3.) Also, this implies that the 'person's brother' knows what happens next.<n>4. Therefore, the final answer is C:-. The 'person's' brother knows what happens next and is also worried.<n><n>Input:Where is the key to a good book? Choices:  I. Book jacket. II. Back of the book.

If the questioner was 'thorough', more thoughtful','more competent', or more honest he would not need an explanation from his friend.<n>6. The only remaining choice is that the questioner would not have been less 'thoughtful'.<n>As thoughtfulness is the least likely requirement to explain the previous statement, B: more honest is eliminated as well.<n>The main point is that he did not need an explanation from another person and that he only sought the opinion of his friend because he felt that doing so was 'thorough'.<n>Therefore, D: more thoughtful is the answer choice.<n>So the final word is D: more thoughtful or the one who was thorough<n><n>Input: If the doctor had been more thorough, he wouldn't have missed the cause of the patient's fever.

Choices:  A: wall B: office C: space shuttle D: front door E: tent<n>Output:		1."Lots of windows" is a metaphor for lightness. This is not a literal question, just like questions 2, 4, and 6.<n>2. "Corner" area may refer to the corner of a room or house – not "any" corner that may exist in many ways.<n>3. The context suggests that the house or room is being examined because a new tenant is moving in. They may be asked to change or add a window. "Lots of windows" may be interpreted as being in the front door, the back door, or any window in the room.<n>As this is not a literal question and is a metaphor, the answer, C, gives a good representation of 'lots of windows' area.<n>So the final answe is C: office<n><n>Input: What happened after you asked the policeman his name?

However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:She had been applying for job for weeks with no call back, she knew she was qualified, so what did she feel? Choices:  A: employment B: frustration C: stress D: working hard E: love<n>Output:		1)The prepositional phrase "with no call back" suggests that she had been applying for the job for multiple weeks.<n>2)In the context, the girl knew that she was qualified. This suggests that she had spent time working for years and had been looking for a job.<n>3)The sentence is incomplete, so it should be "she knew she wasn't qualified" or "she believed she was qualified", but instead, "she knew she was qualified" is used.<n>4)Since this is the second part of the sentence, the main thing to consider to fill the blank is the girl's thoughts and how she feels.<n>5)It is natural to feel "working hard" or "stress", but "love" is unnatural. Also, the use of the word "call" implies that the girl called and applied.<n>So the final question should be B: frustration. She had been working hard for a job with no answer. So she was stressed.<n><n><n><n>### Instruction:Answer the question by filling in the blanks.<n><n>Input:John only gave a perfun*15*1*15*1cory examination of the co*15*12*1pme, though he did everything require of him.

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5.

Choices:  A: fatigue B: relaxation C: tiredness D: muscle weakness E: losing weight<n>Output:		A: fatigue  The word 'exercising' is being used as the object of the verb 'want'. Since the subject is 'I', the object is either 'exercising', 'I', or'me'. Choices (B), (C), (D), and (E) are all adjectival forms of the verb 'to exercise' and therefore it makes the least sense of these words to be the object of the sentence.<n><n>Input: I'm tired at the end of the day. Choices:  A) tired Choices:  A : tired B: exhausted C: knackered D: weary E: tired out<n>Output:  A: tiredThe sentence uses 'I'm tired at the as the subject. As such, at the beginning of the day the objective is 1: subject + verb = preposition + pronoun, so this indicates that the verb must have a subject.<n>2: it has a subject and an object, because it would end with I=preposition+ pronoun.<n><n>3: therefore the subject is the preposition (at), and the object is (the end of the day).<n>Since the end of the day does not include any adjectives that would be a match for

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3.

The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:The wind tore off the shingles, what was the wind like? Choices:  A: dry hair B: spreading C: blowing hard D: change direction E: wave wheat<n>Output:		1. The word 'what' means 'who/what.'  That doesn't make sense in this sentence.  Therefore, this answer choice is false.<n>2. The word 'like' at the beginning of the following incomplete phrase does not make sense in this sentence, so this answer choice is false as well.<n>3. No further information has been provided about the word 'cold,' so we cannot know with absolute certainty what it means, making this answer choice false as well.<n>4. The word 'dry hair' does not make sense as the word 'wind' does not seem to be the kind of thing that would have 'dry hair.'  Therefore, this answer is false.<n>5. The verb 'blowing' makes sense in this sentence as the 'wind' is blowing a particular way.  It also answers the question directly: 'What was the wind like?'  Therefore, 4.<n>6. This phrase does not make sense, so this answer choice must be false.<n><n>input:Mike, the doctor had examined the stretcher and determined it incapable of supporting any more weight. He didn't do anything else. Choices:  A : care B : take C : careful D : try E: check<n>Output:1. Mike, the doctor, had examined the streseder and determined it incapacible as well as the lack of any more weight.<n>2. He also determined the lack of any more.<n>3. As this is an incomplete sentence, more information is needed to determine how the doctor determined the situation and therefore this answer choice is false, and so too is B.<n>4. A thorough examination is required of something before judging its capabilities, making it an act of care. Therefore, C is also false.<n>5. As nothing else has been done by the doctor, this is also an act of care by him.  Therefore, D is false.<n><n>Input:The detective took an unusual amount of interest in her case. Choices: 1: A: great, 2 B: little, 3 C: much, 4 D: a lot, 5 E: quite, 6 F: an<n>Output:1. Great is not an amount, it is a measure of quality. It is like saying it is the best amount, which doesn't really make much sense at all.<n>2. Little is

The ice fishing equipment includes an auger, and a pole or rod, a set of waders, a tip up, and bait or fishing lures.<n>2)It also includes accessories such as the clothing suitable for wearing at the lake, a snow sled, an ice drill, a sack lunch, a beanie hat, and gloves to protect the hands.<n>3)Also requires fish finders, sonar devices, and a flashlight for the purpose of lighting the fishing area during the evening.<n>Ice fishing can also be done on the shores of ponds or bays rather than on the lakes. Hence, C can be ruled out.<n>4)Ice fishing can usually be done on ponds or lakes.<n>Therefore, the answer is lake.<n><n>

Choices:  A: bathroom B: house C: cupboard D: space shuttle E: surface of earth<n>Output:		1: The kitchen would have probably lost something and now the smell of decomposition and rot is everywhere.<n>2. The question suggests that if the kitchen has a stale smell due to bacteria, mold, and debris, the source should be checked.<n>3: Bathroom : The bathrooms have bathing soaps, soap bars, toiletries, and other personal care products that emit strong chemical odors.<n>4: Housemice: Mice live and breed in kitchen areas. They may carry infectious diseases that lead to the decomposition of surfaces.<n>5: Cupsinb: Kitchens typically store perishable food products and household pills that emit unpleasant odors.  They also attract mice.<n>6: Shutte: The kitchen contains waste and garbage.  The garbage can smell musty if the kitchen is not cleaned often enough.<n>7: Earth: The kitchen floor has traces of garbage and food spills that attract cockroaches.  Cockroaches are the most notorious insects infesting kitchens.<n>8. The kitchen contains all of these organisms except space shuttle. Space shuttles are used for space exploration and are not found in kitchens.<n>9. Choice D: surface of earth is the correct answer.  It is the only choice that doesn't describe an item found in kitchens<n>

Choices:  A: celebrate B: have party C: hear crowd go mad D: create success E: reproduce<n>Output:		None of these. There is no "be considered" after the question; it is the reader's choice whether or not to consider a successful procreation, whatever that may be. No reason is given for why having a party, celebrating or creating a success are not considered a success when attempting to procreate.<n>A: Success is achieved when one has children, a product of the union between two people. If the two people have children, they succeed in procreating. If one has children but the two people who united in order to have children do not have a party or anything similar to mark their success in procreation, this does not negate the fact that they have already created a success; they just might not celebrate it. Also, having a party is not a requirement for procreation. While having parties and celebrations could be considered an extra way to show someone else what a success procreation was to you, that has no basis for what is a successful procreation.<n>B: When attempting procreation, there is no indication that some wild audience applauding or cheering would count as a success. There is, however, a party aspect which could be construed as the wild audience, but it isn't necessary.<n>C: When attempting procreaton, there is nothing in the text indicating that this would ever happen.<n>D: This seems to be the best answer, but it is vague. There is no mention of creating a "success".<n>E: While a child is typically seen as a success in the procreation process, not all births are successful.<n>So the final answe is D: Nothing.<n><n>Input: What is the first cause of death?<n><n>Output: A: birth. C: aging. B: life. E: death. D: living.<n><n>So the answer is A: Birth<n><n>Input: How does the second cause of death differ from the first cause of death<n><n>Output: The second cause of death is aging. This is the third cause of death.<n><n>So the final answer A: The second cause is aging, which is the third cause.<n><n>Input: How is the third cause of deat different from the second cause of death <n>Output: The first cause of death is birth, the second cause of death is ageing and the third cause of death is living.

Choices:  A: safeway B: record albums C: record store D: car E: wallpaper<n>Output:		A: Safeway<n>Exaplanation is: "Where is one likely to buy vinyl records?" Safeway is a supermarket which sells food. Record albums is a term for a record which has a recording on it with music. Car is a place which you might listen to a record playing on your way to the next destination. Wallpaper is not the place where a person would listen to music. There is nothing about wallpaper which describes it as a place to buy vinyl records. So we assume A: safeway is correct.<n><n>Input: Is the president going to make a statement about this matter? Choices:  Yes.  Not only has the president sent out an emergency broadcast, but she has stated several times that the danger is imminent.  She is also calling out the National Guard to assist.<n> Output: B. The president's statement indicates that the danger is immanent. This statement was also released to the media in an emergency broadcast. She did not only release a statement on the matter and just stated that the danger is immenent. She is calling out the national guard to assist and that is indicated by'she is also calling out the national guard'. The president is not only sending out an emergency broadcast.<n><n>Input:"I see a big, black cloud hovering around the hill." "And it's moving this way, toward the river.", she said. It's coming!" "But is it dangerous?" I asked. "Oh, yes, it's dangerous. The house might fall on us." "Do you want to stay?" "No...let's go. Let's get away from here!" Exaplanation :In this excerpt, 'it's moving this way' means that 'it's moving towards us".'This way' does not refer to a particular direction to move in i.e. towards south, towards north, or towards west. In the sentence, it indicates that the cloud is moving towards someplace that could cause a danger.In the question, 'is it dangerous?','it' refers to the cloud.<n><n>Input: "The police want to see you.<n> They are searching for a suspect." "The man in the photograph might be him" "Was he a policeman himself?" "No, he was a journalist"Output:A. The statement about the suspect refers to an unidentified photographed

But that is how he is perceived.  So he does nothing. Choices:  A. Perpetual B. Procrastinating C. Proactive D. Prudent<n>Output:Since he's referred to as 'the man who would not take...', he's always taking advantage of the advantages given. That is how he's perceived.

First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness.

What kind of preparation was missing? Choices:A. Thought B. Care C. Enormous effort D. Dress up E. Practice<n>Output:1. The text indicates that John was unprepared for a party.<n>2. However, unlike all the other possibilities, noticing that the party is unplanned is enough to understand that John was unprepard for his dressing.<n>3. The text doesn't specify what preparation John was missing out on.<n>4. There could be multiple possibilities, but the context suggests that he was unprepared for his 'dressing'.<n>5. The other possibilities, such as care, effort, and practice are all linked to his 'dressing', as John's incapability of being dressed perfectly is the reason he is unprepared.<n>6. All of these could have been taken care of.<n>7. Practice could also have been taken care of by the previous night.<n>8. In this context, 'dressing' means that he was unprepard for wearing something he hasn't worn before, or he was unready for trying something new.<n>9. It can also mean getting dressed up, meaning that he was unprepare for the effort he might have to put into wearing something fancy.<n>10. Therefore, all the choices refer specifically to John's preparation for his dressing. <n>11. Choices other than E are ruled out as they are not related to John's preparing for his dressing.  12. Choice E: falling, implies that if John had failed to prepare, he may have fallen or not been able to attend the party.<n>13. However, the context is clear- John was unprepared because he wasn't properly dressed.  <n>14. Therefore, the only solution that answers the question is D: Dress up. 15.

People liked her because she was what? Choices:  A: excellent B: fun C: honest D: worthy E: choice<n>Output:		1,<n>2. The text clearly states that Mary was a bad girl, and the other choices are irrelevant to her character.<n>3. She did not seem to be a very good girl, because no one liked her - this is stated in the text, that no one liked her as she was a bad girl.<n>4. However the text suggests that Mary was always honest about being a bad girl and people's like of her was because they appreciated this about her and that she was honest.<n>5. Mary was a bad girl though, that does not mean that she was unworthy, it does not mean that she could not be honest and could not have people like her for the manner in which she was honest about herself. <n>6. As she did not seem to be honest in other manners of her life she did not lead a fun life or an excellent life and therefore could not have been judged on these other factors.<n><n>Therefore the final answer is B: fun<n><n>Input: Jane was a wicked woman.   She was dishonest, vindictive, and her life was a mess.  Jane was never happy.  In her old age she finally stopped being wicked and  became much  more what? Choices A: happy B: satisfied C: content D: joyous E: complete<n>Output: 1: There is no evidence in the text to support 'Satisfied' as an answer choice. The text never even suggests Jane got what she wanted.<n>2. The other choices (content, contentment, happy, joyous) are all different forms of the word 'happy' and are interchangeable with one another.<n>3. The sentence "Jane was never happy", however, does seem to indicate Jane was not satisfied.<n><n>4. Jane's entire life was a mess and dishonest, suggesting the other choices are not even relevant.<n><n>Therefore, 'D': Joyed could be said to be correct the sentence 'Jane was never happy' could mean Jane was not satisfied so it suggests something more, thus it is correct.<n>Therefore, The final answer is D: joyous<n><n>#######

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:Where can you see a mammoth in NYC? Choices:  A: refrigerator B: museum exhibit C: prehistoric times D: museum of natural history E: forest<n>Output:		1) The question poses the possibility of seeing a mammoth anywhere besides prehistoric times in NYC.<n>2) The question also mentions a mammoth in the context of a museum, which implies that these are the only two possible places to find a mammoth.<n>3) In contrast to choices A, D, and E - which are all specific instances and thus irrelevant - choices B and C express the possibility of seeing a general mammoth in NY as it could show up in either a museum or in prehistoric times.<n>4) For this reason, the only option that conveys what both questions imply is B: museum exhibit.<n>So the final option is B:mammoth exhibit in the museum of natural history<n><n>Input: What is the fastest you have ever gotten on a bicycle?<n>Choices:  A: 9 miles<n>B: 25 miles<n>C: 90 miles<n>D: 9mph<n>E: 25mph<n>Output: 1.) The question refers to the speed of a bike.<n>So the only option with relation to bicycle is D:9mph<n>2.) The options provided range from a low of 9mph to a high of 25mph.<n>3.) Since A and E refer to unrelated measures, they are not useful here.<n><n>So the correct answer is D: 9<n><n>Input: If you drink 8 cups of water a day, do you have enough water?<n>Choices: A: Yes B: No C: 8 cups of bottled water D: 8 cups water every day<n>Output: 1). The question asks if we have enough water based on how much water we drink. So the only option with relation is D: 8 cupes of water every day.<n><n>So the final answer 8 cups of drinking water every day<n><n>Input: How many miles is it to fly one way from the west coast to the east coast?<n>Choices: Choices:  A; 8000 B: 2000 C: 2500  D: 1000  E: 2800  F: 3500 <n>Output: 1: Firstly, the question asks how much distance you have to travel to fly from

Choices:  A: like more B: nodding C: by wearing rings D: concordance E: shake hands<n>Output:		1)The only choices are A, B, and C.<n>2)A and B convey agreement, while C and D suggest disagreement, so B is the correct answer.<n>So the final anwser is B: nodding<n><n>Input:We had to move our house so that everyone could have a bedroom.

The prepositions'so that' can be used before the verb'move' or'move' can be used after the preposition'so that'.<n>2)Since 'we-all' should come after the verb, the correct answer should include the noun 'people' after the verb and the preposition 'bedrooms' before the noun 'people'.<n>3)Only choice E does this: the choice that makes the most sense grammatically is option E.<n>So the final answe is E: house-move-we people-bedrooms<n><n>Input:Isn't it strange to believe the same myth or religion? Choices:  a. strange-myth-same religion (says "It's so strange to believe in both myths and beliefs." The only place religious belief is mentioned is after the word "in" for both myth and belief, not before)<n>b. strange-myth -same religion c. strange- same- belief d. strange-myth same - belief<n>e. strange-myth the same religion<n>Output: a. "It's strange to believe both in myths and beliefs" (There is only one choice that has the word 'belief' between 'the same religion', and that is the correct answer, 'a'.<n>So the only other answer is the correct answer. <n><n>Input:He doesn't know whether the dog is a mutt or purebred, it could be either Choices: a: knows whether the dog is a b: knows is a mutt or a purebred c: doesn't know is a mutt or d: doesn't know whether he's a mutt or pure bred dog e: doesn't know

Choices:  A: park B: in the ground C: hedgerow D: temperate climate E: botanical gardens<n>Output:		D: A rosebush will have its own unique features which differentiate it from other plants. However, it grows in the same climatic conditions as other species of flowering plants. So C: hedgerows and D: temperate climate are not correct. <n><n>Input: A housewife often finds it difficult choosing the right perfumes, make-up and accessories for herself.

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2.

Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:The print was extremely small, as he was reading letter after letter he began to suffer eye what? Choices:  A: strain B: though C: happiness D: realization E: understanding<n>Output:		1. The print is extremely small. Hence, choice A (strained) is the correct option.<n>2. He reads letter after letter. So, choice B (Thought) is incorrect.<n>3. He suffered eyestrain while reading the letters so the answer could only have been A.<n>4. A strained eye could not possibly make a person happy or understand things better.<n>5. Consequently, answer C (happiness) is wrong, along with D (realization). Similarly, E (understanding) is redundant. Therefore, only choice A (strain) is the correct choice. Choice A (strained)<n><n>Input: I think she would not want the truth because she would not care she can't handle the truth.  What? Choices:  I (truth) A (happiness) B (life) C (think) D (problems) <n>Output:In other words, she (Sheila) wouldn't want anything from you (Sylvia). She would not care she can’t handle the truth. Her answer (Choice B) is wrong.<n>1. The text tells us that Sheila is not willing to listen to the truth. She has already blocked the truth out of her mind by telling herself a particular lie. Hence, answer C, is incorrect. <n>2. Sylvia knows that Sheila wouldn’t want the truth, so answer C, (think) is also incorrect.<n>3. Choice A (happiness): The truth does not make a person happy or even brings an iota of happiness, hence this choice is wrong.<n>4. Choice D (problems) : The truth doesn’t cause problems, it just is the truth. Hence this choice is also wrong.<n><n>Answer: The right Answer is C (life)<n><n>Input: It would have taken another several weeks for them (her parents and her) to what? Choices: find any evidence of what A: death B: killing C: manslaughter D: murder E: suicide <n>Output:Having killed their parents, she doesn’t want her parents’ death to be the truth. But, they would have had to find proof of manslaughter or murder to prove she was innocent. So.  A: death is incorrect.<n>B: killing: this was a deliberate killing, where the person

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2.

Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4.

The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:If I have a reception with many people attending, where should I be sure to hold it? Choices:  A: grand casino B: large room C: restaurant D: country club E: lobby<n>Output:		This question and answer are interdependent. The implied answer to this question is D: country club.<n>1. The question assumes that the reception is for a group of people.<n>2. It is a question specifically about where to hold or conduct a reception.<n>3. It doesn't mention if the reception is for business or social reasons.<n>4. It explicitly says that a reception is required to be 'grand'.<n>5. Therefore, the context suggests that the reception is for societal reasons rather than for business.<n>6. Moreover, the reception is for a large number of people as is also implied.<n>7. Given these points, the large dining hall would be the best choice for holding a reception.<n>8. Since a reception cannot take place in a grand casino, a large room is not the best choice.<n>9. Similarly, a restaurant would be unsuitable because there is little room to host many people.<n>10. Therefore, C: restaurant is not the correct answer. Nor is A: grand casino. Nor B: large room.<n>11. Since the reception requires a large hall, it must take place in a country club.<n>12. A country club is the best choice given the context and the criteria for the choice of the reception venue.<n>13. Therefore, the only feasible answer choice is D: country club, which is the correct answer.<n>

Choices:  A: sail boats B: question authority C: high fives D: share things E: learn from each other<n>Output:		1). "Past time" can be interpreted as "free time" or "spare time" or simply as "time spent in the same way as activities that are done from the past".<n>2). When people are traveling by boat on a liquid, they are not "traveling". So "past time" does not make sense here. <n>3). Instead they are "sailing", or perhaps "sail boating". Therefore "sail boats" is the correct answer.<n>The final answer is A

Choices:  A: tiredness B: grogginess C: discomfort D: getting out of bed E: eyes opening<n>Output:		Bill was awaking from the bed. This answer choice refers to him physiologicly in the process of waking up.  "Awaking" is a verb (to wake) and "Bill" is the subject. "Getting out of bed" would be a proper noun phrase that does not match the subject or object verb. Therefore, this is the correct answer.<n>So the final choice is B: groggy.<n><n>Input: The man is taking a nap, not because he was tired he is just being a lazy fellow.  Choices:  A:"was tired", B,"being lazy", C:"taking nap", D:"just being", E. "not because"<n>Output: The man is taking nap. (because he is tired) This is not a correct word choice and does not reflect the text. Tiredness relates to the previous choice of sleepy.

Choices:  One: very possible, Two: possible, Three: highly possible but uncertain, Four: very unlikely, Fivr: unlikely, Six: highly unlikely but possible, Seven: extremely unlikely, Eight: impossible, Nine: very impossible<n>Output: Eight: impossible Since the weather report says it is  "very, very unlikely" it is impossible.<n><n><n># Flip Coin<n>#<n>Input:The coin shows uphead or tails, What will happen next?

Choices:  A: zoo B: workplace C: sky D: new york city E: many places<n>Output:		1) The text talks about "human in a large nortwestern city", so we know which animals are involved;<n>2) "where can you see animals" can be a question about "zoo";<n>3) the answer provided by T.P. indicates: "A 'zoo' means 'jewel,' and a 'large northeastern city in the U.S.' is Boston," and that "zoo is related to 'new york city in the U. S.'" Thus, we know that: the zoo is not in NYC; zoo is in Boston;<n>4) "zoo" is a short name for a zoo (if "zoo" is not a shortened form, then it's "northeastern city in U.S" that is a shortened form, and thus, the answer will be "a zoo", because "zoo" includes the info of "the city" and the shortening form also includes the "city" info);<n>5) "workplace," "sky," and "new york city" have nothing to do with the text;<n>6) the phrase "...large northeastern" refers to the specific location of the "zoo" (the zoo is in Boston);<n>7) according to the sentence "A 'zoo,' by the way is an abbrevation for 'zoological garden'..." (where T.P. answers the question), "zoo" implies "zoological garden," and "zoological garden" includes "...large northeaster..."  and "...city in the U.S."; so "zoological garden" is related to the specific location of zoo (zoological garden or zoo);<n>8) based on the fact that what we know about Boston is that in addition to large northeastern part includes "a large northeastern City in the U.S.," it can also include the phrase "a city in northeastern part" (because we know the "zoo" is in Boston, "the zoo is in a large nortetheastern City in the U S.," and "zoo is related" to "new york city in U. S."), and the specific location of zoo includes "...zoological garden..." so "large northeastern City" includes the information of "a city in northeast..." ;<n>9) thus, based on the above reasons,

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:The jar was plastic, just like most of the stuff in the kitchen.  John preferred glass, and wished he was somewhere else.  Where does he want to be? Choices:  A: cupboard B: anywhere else C: everything D: own home E: garbage dump<n>Output:		1: The text is written in a simple past tense ("the jar was"), an indicative mood, an undeclared narrator, and a point of view of objective omniscience.<n>2. The narrator provides no opinions or background stories which the author would have provided in a first person narrative.<n>3. The second sentence ("just like most of the stuff") is describing John, but the author does not identify John or his preferences until the third sentence ("John preferred glass..."), after the question.<n>4. The answer is, therefore, 'C', as it does not identify John as 'anyone else'.<n><n>Input:I heard a crash as I approached the front door.  As I drew nearer I suddenly became aware that it was made of glass.  What was John's reaction? Choices: A: He fainted B: He shuddered C: He started to cry D: He began to laugh E: He burst into tears<n>Output:1. The sentence describing the crash ("as I approached the front door") is in simple past tense ("I approached"), indicative mood, and an undeclared point of view.<n>2. John's reaction ("He shuddered") is not clear.<n>3. The correct answer is therefore "B", since the narrator states John's reaction.  This is not a sentence fragment.<n><n>Input:I've come for the interview and I'd love to spend the night.  I just need some more detailed information about the place.  Where is it? Choices: A. John has no idea if he's coming home. B. The room is big enough to contain him and his luggage. C. The flat is at the back of the building. D. There are many rooms inside the building. E. John was confused.<n>Output:1. While the narrator writes "I've come for", indicating the use of a first person point of view, the tense is an indicative mood ("I've come"). This suggests that the narrator is not referring to John at a specific point in time ("have come"), but at some undefined point in the past.<n>2. The sentence, "I'd love to spend..." suggests John was planning on spending the night, which the text indicates was not his intention.<n>3. The sentence "I just need some

Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:Where do you buy a glass of wine? Choices:  A: art show B: basement C: bar D: church E: basement<n>Output:		1) The first part of the text suggests that you buy a glass of white wine. Therefore, bar, church and basement are not relevant to the correct answer. <n>2. The second part of the sentence suggests that the place where glasses of white wine are bought is called 'bar'. <n>3. The final word 'glasses' may be misspelled in the text (since the intended word is 'glass'). However, since the context suggests that it is glass, this error should be ignored.<n>4. In this context, Church is misspelled as "church". Since "church" is the closest in meaning to "bar", the correct answer is "bar".<n><n>So the final answer in this question is C: bar

Choices: A: leave things hanging B: get involved C: make excuses D: get things done<n>Output:1. The words 'kind of guy' implies that the subject in the question is an individual.<n>2. Therefore, the question asks about him and his qualities, not those of a hypothetical person.<n>3.'Leaving things hanging' and 'getting involved' can mean different things to different people. <n>'Getting Excuses' means giving excuses for things which are not as serious, not that things are never done.<n>'Making Excuses' sounds like excuses about why things can't be done; not about why something wasn't done.<n>4.The use of different tenses in the other two options further confuses what kind of person the subject is.<n>5.From the context, it is evident that the person in question is a competent and determined man. Hence, D: get things done is the correct answer.<n>He 'gets things done' which means he will do what needs to be done. He is not the kind of person who will leave things hanging or get involved.<n>So the final Answer is D<n><n>Input: I have had numerous run ins with that particular gang over the years.

The sentence is not about the symptoms from eating way too much.<n>2.	Stomach Ache: The sentence gives us no context that eating too much would give one a stomach ache.

Acid Reflux: the text makes no mention of acid reflux. In fact, no mention is made of reflux at all. The question then, asks for the conclusion.

Hot weather: The sentence tells us that it was a hot day, therefore it couldn't possibly be the reason for her distress.<n><n>2.	Water: Since she went to the beach it tells us that she must be worried that water might harm her.

Choices:  A: finish line B: broken bones C: broken legs D: chapped lips E: healthy body<n>Output:		1: The given text doesn't specify why you'd want a season of successful ski runs, so the word'result' is being used loosely.<n>2. In context, the sentence says that successful skiing has an outcome called a'season'.<n>3. The question itself doesn't state what'successful skiing' means so we cannot say, for example, that successful skiing would mean 'healthy body'.<n>4. Therefore, the given meaning of the word'season' is too vague to be accurate. <n>5: A'season' means something like a ski run lasting for an intermittent period of time.<n>6. Therefore the answer is that a'reason' for a successful season of skiing would be broken bones, broken legs, and chapped lips, though the text does not explicitly say which or how many broken bones, legs, or lips.<n>So, the final answer is C: broken legs, broken bones, chapped lips

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:WHat do cats get into when they are ripping things apart? Choices:  A: dog's mouth B: floor C: garage D: trouble E: nature<n>Output:		The word 'things' indicates several individual objects are involved.<n>If we are talking about dogs' mouth, only one dog is mentioned by name. And since dogs in nature don't normally rip things apart, the option with "nature" is ruled out.<n>If we're talking about the garage, there is only one reference to a garage, not to multiple garages.<n>Based on context, "trouble" describes dogs getting in to cats; and "garage" describes a destination. Neither of these are applicable to cats getting into things -<n>Therefore the answer is: "ripping things apart."<n><n>Input: 1. This one is really a joke. Can I use this? 2. We'll see if it'll be funny. 3. Let me set that joke up for you. Choices:  A. Yes!  B. Well let try.  C. It's an excellent joke.  D. You cannot joke about that.  E. It's very funny.  F. It's not that funny. <n>Output: 1. The word "that" is referring to the joke.<n>2. The word "set" is referring to a joke or a story.<n>3. The word "you" is referring to a third person.<n>4. The word "try" indicates trying to make it work.<n>5. This sentence does use 'It' referring to the joke again.<n>"Well let try" cannot also be a question, so it must be either a command, an answer to a question or an exclamation.<n>It should also be obvious that a question mark is not needed. The sentence itself does imply a question.<n>Since it's not a question, that makes it a command-like construction.<n>Hence, " let try" cannot be an answer to a question.<n>Therefore, "Well let try" is command-like construction and can be inferred to be a command.<n>Hence E is the answer. Note that the question also does not ask you to guess if the joke is funny.<n><n>Input:  How can I get my kids to listen?  How to get kids to listen? Choices: 1. Don't tell them. 2. Tell them, but don't try to make them

The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:What might you feel after doing housework for hours? Choices:  A: anger B: not boredom C: stress D: boredom E: anxiety<n>Output:		<n>1. Given the context of the question, 'housework' suggests chores and tasks associated with maintaining a home.<n>2. This would include the dishes, laundry, tidying, etc.<n>3. These activities have the potential to engage your mind, body, and intellect.<n>4. The answer choices in the question are 'anger,' 'disgust,' 'feeling bored,''stress,' and feeling 'bored.'<n>5. None of these feelings are necessarily tied to doing housework, so the correct answer should be related to household chores or tasks.<n>6. The term that fits best is 'boredom' as boredom is a feeling that one has after repeatedly performing repetitive, unchallenging, or uninteresting tasks.<n>7. This feeling is common for people who are not very active as they perform their daily activities, and therefore, boredom is a natural response to performing household chores for long periods of time.<n>So the final answers are E.b,d are not related to performing household chores.<n>8. 'Boredom' is a proper answer because it fits in the context.

Choices:  A: roof B: school C: beach D: closet E: garage<n>Output:		1: The text is very specific about not planning to use the folding chair and not having large doors in the house.<n>2. It suggests that the folding chair should definitely not be placed in the closet or the garage.<n>3. However, the text fails to mention the school, which means that the correct choice is the one that involves the beach.<n>4. The text mentions that there are no large doors in the house, implying that the house is probably a small one.<n>5. The choice that involves the school is not the correct one as the beach can still function as a school or an educational setting for children despite its'school' location.<n>6. As a result, the correct choice is the choice involving the beach.<n>So the final correct answer is B: school<n><n><n><n>Input: John woke up with a kink in his neck and didn't know how to get rid of it.  He tried stretching it, rolling it back and forth, banging it against the side of the bed, and popping it at different parts of his neck or spine  until it popped and he felt a relief. Choices: A: roll  B: stretch  C: tilt  D: bang  E: pop<n>Output:<n>1. The text suggests that John spent time trying to rid himself of his kink in the neck by banging it against the bed as opposed to other choices.<n>2. This information suggests that stretching may have been ineffective for his issue, implying that D is the correct choice.<n>3. The lack of explanation for why the popping was the relief implied that the choice could not be the popping of different parts of his spine, because that is not very unique and may simply have relieved him of the kink because he wasn't holding it so tight.<n>4. Thus, the correct choice is D: bang.<n><n><n><n>Input:"I wonder what is written on it," she said, referring to the book.  She opened it carefully.

Choices:  A: picnic B: friend's house C: table D: space shuttle E: fairgrounds<n>Output:		1) They were getting together for the game.<n>2) This makes it clear that 'where' is not the location of the game.<n>3) They are getting together for the game at a friend's house.<n>4) As a result, 'table' is a wrong answer because it does not make sense.  Also, the word 'with' does not refer to someone who is going to the "big game" but to the food that is being brought out.<n>5) The word 'with' implies that he is going out to the "big game".

The word Paris is used because the restaurant served some fish dishes from Paris' fish markets.<n>3) The "blow fish" option refers to a type of fish that is usually found in Asia.<n>4) The "Atlantic Ocean" is a body of water off the coast of many places.

Choices:  a. moved around a lot b. had an unusual style c. was confused d. was uncomfortably blown around in the wind  e. was annoyed but still enjoyed himself<n>Output:a. moved around a lot<n>While the English language has many words to describe the feelings in relation to the movement of hair when something like wind may have touched it, only the first two and perhaps the last two would apply.<n>The choice would be either A or E <n>since John did not like the change in his hair style, he was annoyed with his hair style changing.<n><n>So the answer would be E:  was annoyed but still<n><n>Input:Raphael Sanzio was both a master artist and a master architect, creating the fresco in The School of Athens which is so well-known but which many did not realize was a fresco. What does it mean to be a master of something? Choices: 1. highly trained in the art form 2. a person who has a lot of money 3. someone who has a skill of the same sort as a more famous artist, but is not well-known 4. an expert in multiple fields<n>Output: A: highly trained in the artform.<n>The reason this is the answer is because "master" can have more than one meaning. In this context, the definition of a "master" is one who is highly proficient.  So an artist who shows high skill and knowledge of the field is a master artist.<n><n>So the following answer would be number 1.<n><n>Input:The students decided to vote for the new president because the current president was incompetent. All of the following are reasons for the students to call the President incompetent except: Choices: 1) In fact, she had saved a lot of the school's money 2) She was the longest
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:Sky diving scared him, once they jumped out of the plane he began losing consciousness while what? Choices:  A: injury B: death C: playing uno D: coma E: falling down<n>Output:		1) Firstly, this question refers to an event that happened to someone.<n> 2) the first half of the text ( Sky diving scared him once they jumped out...) refers to a specific event.<n> 3) This event involves someone who was involved in skydiving and lost consciousness.<n> 4) The second half of the text (while dying, playing cards... death coma falling down)  suggests that the person died or lost consciousness.<n>5) The words in this context suggest a 'playing card or 'death' which would be unrelated to injury or death, so it may be D or E or none of the mentioned words.<n>6) 'coma' describes the state of someone who has lost consciousness and is in a deep sleep and unable to wake up or respond to stimuli and so may be D or E.<n> 7) 'dying or death' is unlikely to be involved as it doesn't fit in with the topic of the event.<n><n>Input: My husband, the most loving and kind of men, he's so cute.

Choices:  A: see work B: practice C: quiz D: school grade E: homework<n>Output:		The final answer is A: see work.  After the statement 'if you did well on the...' the what is specified as a grade.  There is no mention of an A or other 'work' in which we could see the effect.<n><n><n>Input:The teacher who gave the test was really strict.

In other words, each paper underwent what? Choices:A: rigidB: strictC: inflexibleD: consistentE: disciplined<n>Output:D: consistent. Given the phrases in quotes, the context suggests that the teacher's behavior was not unusual nor unpredictable (rigid/inflexible).  The test had strict rules (strict/consistent) (e.g., had nothing to conceal, gave a 2nd chance to erase) though we didn't know what she would do until she began (a second chance to correct).<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the multiple choice questions following the text.<n><n>Input:(2)In the end of May two gentlemen started out from London to travel through England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, to Paris, and so to see more of the continent.  On the very last day of the year they returned safely to London.  To this great journey they gave the name of (3) _______; and ever since, "travelling" has often been used to mean "going to foreign countries."<n>Output: The final answer is Travelling. From the context of the text we can conclude that traveling had a new meaning because of this particular trip. So, the name of that particular trip would be the same as "traveling". Nowadays, we still call travelling by that name which is derived from the name of that particular voyage. Hence, Traveling is the answer and it must be the correct choice.<n><n>

A horse to water means that a horse can be led to water, while a pencil must lead must be lead. A pencil needs a lead but a horse does not need to be led to water. So a pencil must try harder if it expects to succeed.<n>### Instruces:Find the 15 words that are missing in the story that follow. <n><n>Input<n>Once upon a time there were three little pigs.

However, if the person asking the question thinks that this is where more or one fire extinguisher would be, then the answer is D.<n><n>Input:I have a cold. Does it snow more where I live? Choices: 1. First of all, the person who asks the question is sick.  So, there is no need to ask whether it snows more, or it is cold.  Or whether the person is sick.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.

Choices:  A: sorrow B: paying bills C: happiness D: frustration E: spending money<n>Output:		The question suggests that getting paid leads to some kind of emotion.<n>1. The first line of the story says 'I would get paid once every two weeks, and every time I was paid, my feelings fluctuated between two different emotional states'.<n>2. Hence, the text suggests that the feeling that being paid leads to is fluctuating between two different emotions.<n>3. The author mentions 'happiness' and'sadness' as examples of two opposite emotions that may or may not change every time the author gets paid.<n>4. In light of this, the answer 'happiness' is not correct, as the question does not limit itself to sadness/joy but also mentions the other four emotions<n>5. The author does say at some point that they do not feel sad, even though they have to pay their bills.<n>6. So if being paid leads to a fluctuation between two different emotions, but they do not want to feel sad, this can only imply that the other emotion is happiness.<n>7. Therefore, the answer is B: happiness. <n><n>Input: If she took him to her sister's house, it was to escape the storm.

Choices:  A: insubstantial B: massless C: dwarf D: inconsequential E: good<n>Output:		1) The context of the sentence suggests that the building is 'inconsequential' if it is not well constructed.<n>2) The sentences suggest that there is a difference between a massive and an inconsequential building in terms of their build quality as a well-constructed building will always be'massive'.<n>3) In this way, we can infer that a massive building can be all the elements provided in the choices, except good.<n>4) As a building will always be massive if constructed well, it can also be said that a good building is an inconsequential one. So, the final answer to this question is: C: dwarf<n>Input: In case you have to make a choice, a little thought and planning will yield better results than a hasty decision. Choices:  A. little B: much C: little D: no thought  E: none of the above<n>Output: The sentence structure conveys that the outcome of thought or planning will be better than that of a hasty decision.<n>2. The first clause “If you have to make a hasty decision” indicates that you can’t avoid hasty decisions, which implies that the second clause “a little thought …” is an alternative in the same context, where it also indicates that you can’re not forced to make a hasty decisions.<n>3. A comparison between the given sentences and the choices has revealed that, “a little thought and planning” doesn’t imply a hasty conclusion or decision while “no thought or planning” does.<n>4. Thus, the given sentence is contrary to the choice “no thought or planning.” So, the meaning of the sentence is “A little thought…”, not “no thought…<n>Input:The best of all ways to be happy is what you think as best suited to your disposition, and to your own best mode of thinking. Choices: A: to think B: suited to your disposition C: suited to your best mode D: of your disposition<n>Output: 1.) The key phrase in the sentence is 'to your disposition' which indicates that what makes someone happy is what is suited to one's way of thinking.<n>2.) The sentence, as a whole, suggests that happiness should be pursued only when happiness is'suited to one's disposition'.<n>3.) This means that the choice that provides the correct definition should either be 'A: to think

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3.

In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness.

Choices:  A: large house B: suburban home C: big house D: old house E: keeping personal objects<n>Output:		This sentence is about looking for a house with a master bedroom. "What kind of home did they want" is a question about the kind of house they would want for themselves.<n><n>So the final answeris C: big house<n><n>Input:They wanted a master bedroom for the convenience of having a place to relax.  There is really nothing left to the imagination because the entire thought is summed up in the last sentence... What is it that they wanted a master bedroom in the first place? It must have been because they wanted privacy, but the house that they were looking for was large enough to have multiple bedrooms... not just one. This is why the bedroom they were looking for had to be large. The last sentence tells us that "they wanted their place to be" (whatever it might be), but that they wanted the room to be private and exclusive. But why a master bedroom? If they can't live in a big place, it might be because they just want some privacy or because they want the place to be luxurious. So, they thought that "they wanted a master bedroom so they could have a place to relax."<n>Output:The house that they wanted was so big and large that it could hold many people, so a master bedroom is really the only logical choice for a home. It makes sense though! Many people like it to be private when they rest. Also, many people like to live in a luxurious manner and I think theirs would be like that. Even though the master bedroom is a personal place to relax, I don't think anyone can make good use of it if you can't relax with some privacy in the first place!! Since many people like to share a big house (either with roommates or family) I think this is a common practice for them that makes it natural how big rooms are chosen as the master bedrooms.<n><n>So the answer is E: keeping personal objects.<n><n>Input: She was a good student and worked hard to get what she wanted.  The narrator doesn't say what she wanted. Choices: A: money B: food C: clothes D: a big house E: peace<n>Output:The sentences say that she got what she wanted "by working hard on it". Because the statement is about her work and her work towards achieving and acquiring something, it's talking about getting what you want. If

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3.

Choices:  A: agreement B: to fill their time C: discomfort D: misunderstanding E: learning about<n>Output:		A: First, since people are talking to friends, their conversation likely contains a degree of agreement, such as "I agree that it's sunny out" or "I don't agree that we should use recycled plastic in place of paper".<n><n>B: Second, people are likely to be talking in order to pass the time, since they may have nothing else to do.<n>C: Third, people are likely to discuss things they don't understand, since it may provide learning opportunities and a chance for personal growth.<n>D: Fourth, people are likely to continue talking if they're miscommunicating with one another, in order to avoid arguments and misunderstandings.<n>E: Finally, people may continue talking if they want to learn more about something new that they're discovering.<n>So the correct choice is A: agreement<n><n>Input:It's hard to identify two friends who have the same tastes in music. Choices:  A. They always listen to different kinds of music.<n>B. They often talk about other things.<n>C. They'll go to a concert that neither friend has ever been to.<n>D. They can't find anything good they both like<n>Output:1. First, people's tastes in music vary widely, and it's difficult to find two people who have the same taste in music unless they're very close friends who do a lot of things together.<n>2.Second, listening to different kinds of music is only one part of music appreciation, and it's possible for two friends to listen to different types of music, but still find that they have similar tastes in other types of music.<n>3. Third, it's possible that they listen to different kinds of popular music but still find that they share a fondness for certain types of music that are popular among their respective circles of friends.<n>4. Fourth, it's possible they like to talk about topics that are unrelated to music, such as sports, films, or television.<n>5. Finally, it's possible to go to a concert that one person hasn't been to but the other person has. For example, if one person has seen the concert before and the other hasn't, they could have an interesting<n><n>So the correct answer is B: they always talk about other things. Because the sentence is about identification of people with same taste in

However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:James complained that Alexa's electric guitar was too loud and he couldn't get any work done at home,  so she decided that she should get an acoustic guitar.

Choices:  A: complete sentence B: feel angry C: drink tea D: cross street E: park<n>Output:		First, the question implies that money is likely to be stolen.<n>The text suggests that one response to such a situation would be to be angry about it as money is likely to be an important or valued possession.<n>Given this context, the option A: complete sentence can be ruled out from among all other choices. It's also likely that a person is more likely to cross the street upon being robbed than to drink tea as he will likely be angry.<n>Based on this information, drinking tea is unlikely to be the response to money being stolen. Hence option D can be eliminated.<n>Similarly, option B: feel angry can also be eliminated as anger is more likely than drinking tea.<n>Option C: cross street does not seem a logical conclusion as he is more likely to be angry and possibly cross the road than to drink tea. Hence it is also eliminated from the list of options.<n>From the given information, C: cross street, B: feel angry and D: drink tea can be eliminated. And the final answer is E: park.<n><n>Input:The thief was on the run through the city. Choices:  A cross B the street  C drink Coffee  D drive the car  E park the car<n>Output: First,the text suggests that the thief can also be the person who is trying to escape from the authorities.<n>Also it is implied that he is the person who committed the crime.<n>Secondly, the text implies that he is attempting to escape by using a car.<n>Thirdly, the text suggests that the thieves were running through the city and that 'thief' is the correct grammatically correct form of 'he' in this context.<n>Taking into consideration the above information, the option A cross the street is incorrect.<n>B: was in a hurry is correct as it has implied all previous elements and cannot be contradicted by the given text.<n>D: drove through the city clearly suggests that the criminal attempted to escape from the city driving through it. Again contradicting the text.<n>E: parked himself the car is also correct as the thief is trying to hide his identity and is trying to escape. Hence option D: drove the car is incorrect.<n>Hence the final answer will be B: drive through the city.<n><n>Input:John only gave a perfunctoral examination of the corp,

Choices:  A: weak B: fragile C: forceless D: regular E: flimsy<n>Output:		This sentence is quite difficult to understand. Here are some tips: 1. The sentences uses the word 'extra strong' to indicate that it is strong enough to be used for other purposes.<n>2. However, the sentences adds a qualifier - what? - suggesting that we are examining an exception(extra strong) rather than the ordinary case(normal glass).<n>3. 'What?' is most commonly used to ask for more information about the 'extra strong' glass.<n>4. Using our previous examples, we can surmise that: 1. To be forceless means that something is easily broken. 2. To be regular means that something is common.<n>5. Based on this, 'extra strong' glass seems weak/fragile (to be broken) instead of strong/forceless (to stand firm).<n>6. Therefore, B: fragile is the correct answer. It is forcelessness/weakness that is referred to by the 'extra strong' qualifier.<n>

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4.

Choices:  A: complimentary B: inelegant C: ocean D: dull E: inaccurate<n>Output:		1- He was a sharp engineer, but his calculations frequently missed the point.<n>2. The word'sharp' is used in a negative sense so the answer cannot be 'accurate'.<n>3. The text also indicates that his calculations were 'often inelegant', which means this cannot be the answer either.<n>4. The word 'inaccurate' is used in a positive sense to describe a person's calculations in a general way. This answer does not make sense in the sentence.<n>5. 'Inelegant' denotes something being unsatisfactory whereas 'dull' just means ordinary. It would not make sense to say the engineer's calculated were 'dull' when they were in fact'sharp'.<n>6. In the end, the question suggests that the engineer's calculations are often incorrect.  Therefore, 'inaccurate', the opposite of what is suggested, is the correct answer.<n>So the final acnwer is: A: inaccurate

Choices:  A: electric locomotive B: electric typewriter C: multi-coloured walrus D: electric refrigerator E: electric drill<n>Output:		1."The electric motor powered" is followed by many things including"one of almost every house" <n>2.The context suggests that the object mentioned will be one of the many things that the electric motor powers and it should be an object associated with almost every house. <n>3.Electric locomotives, electric typewriters, multi-coloured walruses and electric refrigerators are all objects associated with almost every house, so it is possible that they may be the object mentioned. <n>4.However, out of the four choices, electric refrigerators best match the question.

Choices:  A: cross street B: stand upright C: speak spanish D: speak chinese E: further education<n>Output:		Answer - 1. If I am a person, the unique ability to speak a language is the missing element from the sentence. 'If I am a person' means that I need some kind of abilities that only a person can have.<n>2. Among the choices 'cross the street' and'stand upright' doesn't seem to fit in, since both of them are possible for everyone regardless of age, gender, language, or race.<n>3. 'Speak chinese' is not the missing element, since the sentence doesn't specifically state that it speaks any language, be it mandarin, cantonese or Cantonese; so the person in the sentence may not be able to speak chinese.<n>4. Likewise, 'further education' is not the missing part since the sentence doesn' be talking about any particular type of education, so the person could not possibly have the type of education that we are looking for.<n>5. The most likely answer to the sentence is D: speak spanish. Speaking Spanish or Spanish-speaking is one of the unique abilities that humans have as humans.<n>So the correct answer is D: speak spanis<n><n>## [C#](./cs.md)<n><n><n># 链接<n>https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/coding-interviews/algorithms/find-missing-link/tutorial/ <n><n>

First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer.

Choices:  A: country club B: rich person's house C: pool D: park E: fitness center<n>Output:		The meaning of friend is contextually significant. In other words, how John interprets and understands 'friend' depends on how he's using the term.<n>1. Given the context that John and his friend meet to play squash, the term 'friend' likely refers to a familiar acquaintance that has some degree of mutual respect for John.<n>2. The information regarding John's nervousness suggests that he might be misinterpreting the context of his relationship.<n>3. If his friend had been at first, he likely would have made it obvious to John that he didn't mean it literally, and would have made it clear to John he meant the other end of the fitness center. <n>4. However, given the information about how nervous he was, he failed to recognize the context.<n>5. Therefore, C: pool must be the answer. John failed to recognize the context and the meaning of the term 'pool' in this case wasn't literal; he probably should have taken that to mean in squash.<n>So the final is pool<n><n>Input: She was tired after a hard week's work and she had a heavy headache.

Choices:  A.  unrelenting B. insomniac C. drowsy D.  exhausted E.  insatiable<n>Output: She felt relieved after taking the medicine, but was actually more awake.  How can this happen?<n>In this context, 'drowsy' can be taken literally, or figuratively.<n>1. It can likely be taken figuratively to mean'still sleepy'.  If it were meant to be taken literally, she would have been sleepy.<n>2. 'Unrelenting' refers to something unending, which in the present case is likely insomnia.  However, her insomnia was relieved by the medicine.<n>3. Also, 'exhausted' can be taken literally or figuratively.  If she was exhausted to the degree that she should have been in the hospital recovering from a hard week's of work, she probably wouldn't be awake and the headache wouldn't have kept her awake until the morning.<n>4.  If 'exhausted' was taken with the same kind of figurative meaning as 'drows

The text describes how Jimmy wanted a beer but feared his wife being an alcoholic on Probation, where might he go?<n>2. To answer this question, we first need to look at what Jimmy's options are.<n>3. A) The first choice we have is to go to his neighbor's house. However this is highly unlikely as neighbors tend to have good relations.<n>4. B) The second option we have is to go the the bridge. Although this is true, It is irrelevant to the question as the question is asking where he could 'go', and not what he could do. This can however lead him to a jail cell, and can give us an idea,<n>5. C) The third option is to go back home. Although the text doesn't give us specifics, Home could mean going back to the house of recovery. However we know that his wife is an alcoholic on "probation", so going home might not guarantee him the peace and quiet he needs.<n>6. D) The fourth option is to go to a homeless shelter. This is definitely the most viable option, as going to a shelter would give him the peace and quiet needed to think things over and avoid distractions. This might also be the best option for him to stay for a time in case a social worker may come to help him.<n>7. E) The fifth and final option is prison. This is not a likely option, as it would also put him at risk.

The text implies that kids play with the ball on a street<n>3. However, as per the context, the word concrete is redundant here and can be removed.  This makes the answer choice option: C: soccer game. The kids play with the concrete ball on a soccer game.<n>4. The question then suggests that there are multiple kinds of concrete balls and that kids play with different kinds of concrete balls on different soccer fields.<n>5. This means that kids do not play exclusively with one type of ball on a soccer field.<n>6. A: street is incorrect, as the question mentions concrete ball and soccer game, and not a street.<n>7.The question does not say that kids play with one concrete ball on one street. This means A: street is wrong.<n>8. Similarly, since concrete balls are not explicitly mentioned in option B, this renders this option inapplicable.  <n><n>So the final answer will be C: soccer game<n><n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:Where would a special ficus be found? Choices:  A: botanical garden B: doctor's office C: in a sea D: public place E: arboretum<n>Output:		1.  The word "special" modifies the noun "ficus", meaning that the tree or plant is in some way different from other trees of the same type.<n>2.  Therefore, the'special ficus' could be found in a botanical garden, a garden of plants containing many different varieties.<n>3.  Therefore, B: botanical garden is the correct answer.<n>So the final ans is B: botiacal garden
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:What would a document be if it is not obtuse? Choices:  A: pointed B: bright C: easy D: clear E: acute angled<n>Output:		1) From the context, the document is intended for non-experts of the area that it is describing.<n>2) The word 'obtuse' suggests that the document is inaccurate or unclear. Therefore, any document is not obtuse.<n>3) The question asks what a document is if it 'is not obtuse', and the answer must be 'Not obtuse', thus A: not obtuse is the correct answer.<n><n>Input:A ploy is a plan or trick used to achieve a goal, especially a devious or unethical one. Some writers even say a ploy's goal is often sinister. Choices: A: A B: C C: D D: E<n>Output: 1: A: An objective is the result of a goal.<n>2: The question asks for the correct choice between the two sentences. Although the goal of the plan or tricks is 'to achieve a goal', as suggested, the plan or trick is not necessarily 'devious or unethical' as the second sentence suggests.<n>3: A: To be 'devious/unethical' is specific meaning, and the plan or trick is usually not explicitly stated as 'devious or un-ethical'.<n>4: Therefore, B: 'Is often Sinister' could be construed as an adjective to describe the objective of a plan or trick.<n>5: The sentence suggests that deception or trick for the purpose of evil/sin is often the objective of the goal.<n>6: The best answer would be the word that is 'often the objective of the goal.'<n>7: Considering the meaning of'sinister' that we have mentioned above, and a plan or trick 'devisive' or 'evil in nature' would lead to 'achieving a goal'. This would mean that a ploy 'is often sinister'.<n>8: 'Often sinister' is the best answer that makes sense of the context. Therefore, A: A ploy is often sinister would be the correct answer, and D is the incorrect one.<n>#### Instruction:Complete the following phrase from these two choices given below.<n><n>Input: A __________ is a written plan that describes the steps that a person will take to solve an important or complicated problem.

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:Where is a note likely to indicate a melody? Choices:  A: fridge B: a classroom C: envelope D: medical chart E: sheet music<n>Output:		1: The context of the question implies that the note itself refers to a melody - not a place where it is likely to be found. For example<n>2: I love reading music, but you'll never catch me singing! (a joke, but the humor suggests that what the person is describing is a musical notation). In this context, 'fridge' could be the answer.<n>3: I never wanted to study music, I just wanted to play and feel the music in my heart! (this makes the answer more ambiguous, especially considering the 'notes' in the song in a'music classroom').<n>4: I found a book of sheet music while cleaning the fridge the other day and now I can't stop practicing the piano! What a relief, though. No more embarrassing singing in front of guests! (here, the note is found in the fridge, and it doesn't say the note was written in a music classroom). Therefore, B: fridge is the correct answer.<n>So the final decision is: B: fridge<n><n>Input: What is the most likely way to distinguish a musician from a non-musician? Choices:  C: by sound E: by smell B: by sight D: by touch A: by feeling<n>Output: 1) The question asks us to determine the most likely way, and'musician' is not the opposite of 'non-musician'.<n>2) In fact, they both do music.<n>3) By this logic, the non-musician is still a person who has not practiced music, and perhaps even someone who dislikes music.<n>4) The text does not include any words that directly reference a feeling or touch. However, it is not logical to assume that everyone who likes music can hear music, so by this logic, there may be some way of distinguishing between people who have musical talent and those who do not.<n>5) The most likely way of determining this would be through hearing or sight. One could even guess that a musician might be the best, as they have more talents that a non-musician (and thus, someone who dislikes or is incapable of music should not be considered a musician). In this context, A: by feeling isn't even the possible answer.<n>6) However, C: by sound and B: by sight are both

Choices:  A: theater B: refrigerator C: bakery D: grocery store E: oven<n>Output:		1, 2. Based on the context, the sentence suggests that the character doesn't feel like doing something that requires baking a cake (Option D: grocery/convenience store)<n>3. However, it makes little sense in the context that they would go to the other options since the grocery store does not offer any service that can produce a baked cake.<n>4. Hence, the only relevant choice which could still be an option is D: go to the bakery which is one of the choices.<n><n><n><n><n>

Choices:  A: poor B: sleepy C: plain D: needy E: homeless<n>Output:		The first clue towards the answer is that this is a rhetorical question. This question is designed to make people talk/think about what they think rich people are supposed to like or dislike in terms of bagels. The text says that rich people, when asked, will always say that they like 'plain' baggels. The final clue in understanding what rich people like is the word 'rich' in the term 'plain'. A rich person does not eat a plain, homeless or needy bagel. That is not what he/she is. Therefore, the answer to the above rhetorical question is :A: plain<n>

Choices:  A: misfortune B: fearful C: criticism D: make mistakes E: promotion appraisal<n>Output:		1: A person may receive misfortune from their boss if their job performance is poor.<n>2. Similarly, we could imagine a boss giving their employee a critical appraisal if their job performance is lacking.<n>3. As for E: promotion, this choice is unlikely as an employee isn’t likely to receive a promotion for performing poorly at their job.<n>4. Finally, an employee might not face any consequences from their boss for poor performance as this depends on workplace dynamics and whether their work is high risk and has serious repercussions for others.<n>5. Therefore, none of the choices presented is exactly right. However, D: make mistakes can be a possibility. For example, a boss can reprimand or even fire an employee for making mistakes at work. If they perform badly, they might get disciplinary action. This makes D: make mistakes the correct answer.<n>So the final Answer is D: make mistakes<n><n>Input:  If you have access to a library, which one do you use? Choices:   A: the public library where you're from, B: a public library that's only a few minutes away, C: a public library that isn't very far away, D: one of your local college library  E: a library that's very nearby and has many services<n>Output: 1 A: the public library is a popular option, as it is usually nearby and free to use.<n>2. Public libraries also offer services and resources not available at private institutions or in personal collections, so there is a broad variety of reading material accessible.<n>3. B: a public library, that's only a 5 minutes away. 4. A library that's very far away, with many services, doesn't really fit with the context given<n>5. C: In this context, C, a public library that is not very far away would be more appropriate.<n>6. Finally, we do not know which of these libraries, if any, offers access to books and materials that are not available in other libraries. So the final answer is C: not very far away<n>        <n>Input:  What is the fastest growing segment of the population (in the present in relation to historical trends)?

They were standing in place.  The line was fast, but the children in front of them were loud.   They were what? Choices:  A: frustration B: being annoyed C: delays D: irritation E: out of order<n>Output:		A: The children shouting loudly in the middle of the queue caused Bob and Boris to face 'frustration'. Being annoyed in the middle of the line is also a possibility. But, 'irritation', 'out of order' and 'delays' are not applicable.<n>If it was the person shouting loudly then it would have been irritation or out of order. But 'the line' cannot be 'out of order'. So if the queue was fast, then the children had nothing to do for a long time in the queue. That would cause 'delays'. Finally, there are many possible reasons for 'delays'. But what the sentence gives is just 'fast'. So we can't say anything for 'delays'. So the final answer is A: frustration. Bob and Boris faced frustration in the queue.<n><n>Input: The waiter placed the tray on the counter and made an announcement.  The diners had to remain seated and wait for the food. They waited until the food arrived.  What was the waiter doing? Choices: 1. A: serving food 2. B: making an announcement 3. C: bringing the tray 4. D: waiting with them 5. E: telling them what to do <n>Output: The waiter brought the tray to the counter and made an 'announcement'. But, the 'announcement' was not to remain seated and to wait for the food. So B: making an announcemnet is the right answer. <n><n>Input: This is a tricky problem.  What is the answer? Is it C or D?  Answer Choices:1.  A: the book is written by somebody 2. B: somebody has written the book 3. C: the only book written by somebody 4. D: the book is written for somebody<n>Output<n>This problem needs a bit of explanation. Choice A is wrong because the sentence says: "the only book written by nobody". So, 'nobody' cannot have written the book.<n>Choice C is also not correct as it has a time constraint. It doesn't make sense to say "the only book written for somebody" or "somebody has written the only book for somebody".<n>Choice D is wrong because the subject, 'book' cannot be a direct object.<n>So the correct choice must be C

Choices:  A: big house B: nursery school C: preschool D: building E: retirement home<n>Output:		The answer can be derived by:<n>1. The playroom's size is described to be massive, suggesting that the room is one of several rooms in the house.<n>2. It can be derived from the wording of the context that the playroom is not the most central room in the house.<n>3. In contrast, the size of the playroom implies a degree of importance, as its size is described to be'massive'.<n>4. Considering that it is the only room described in the context, the playroom is the main focus of the passage.<n>5. The rest of the house presumedly contains other spaces for children to enjoy.<n>6. Therefore: The answer is A: big house <n><n><n><n>

Choices:  A: public place B: roadblock C: space shuttle D: hoverboard E: supermarket<n>Output:		The option worded as ‘Ask people’ is too literal and fails to make any connection to the previous paragraph. The hoverboard, although humorous, is irrelevant to the main theme of the text. Option E, or the supermarket, is a logical answer to this question but it doesn’t provide any information that was missing in the previous paragraph which was information regarding exploration. However, option B, or a roadblock, may seem like an unlikely answer because of the roadblock being negative, but in this context, a roadblock is an obstacle to a goal. In this specific case, the goal is exploring space, so that makes a perfect fit for the question. Thus, ‘B’ is the correct response, meaning that people want to use roadblocks to explore space.<n><n>Input: When will the new company open its doors? Choices: 1.  A: January 2021<n>2.  B: January 2031<n>3.  C: January 2011 <n>Output:The answer to this question is contained in the sentence, ‘The company is scheduled to open its doors in February of this year.’ The company did not open its doors in January 2020, but is ‘scheduled to’ open its doors in 2001.<n>Therefore, option C: January 2101, is correct.<n><n>Input: I’m taking a job as a photographer, but my camera may malfunction, so what do I do?

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:The cow would come outside even after the storm had passed, it wouldn't leave the what? Choices:  A: meat grinder B: stable C: red barn D: gate E: green field<n>Output:		1: If the option A is'meat grinder', then it will be wrong.<n>2: Option B is not correct either. The answer should be'stable'.<n>3: Choice C is incorrect because it should be stable, not red barn.<n>4: We should think that the cow came outside even after the storm was gone. For this reason, the answer should be 'green field'.<n>5: The word, 'green field' indicates the meaning of 'grassland'. If the meaning of 'green field' is 'grassland' then we cannot understand the sentence as 'the cow comes to the stable even when the storm is over' because the meaning of the question is 'the cow comes to another place even when the storm is gone'. In this question I marked the answer as 'D', 'the green field'.

Choices:  A: winning B: entertainment C: happiness D: cheating E: relaxation<n>Output:		The correct answer is A: winning. The text begins by stating that people play games.<n>2. It goes on to explain that playing games makes a person win.<n>3. This implies that those playing games stand to win something as a result of playing them.<n>4. This also means they don't win when they don't play games.<n>5. It also means games give people a chance to win something extra by playing them.<n>6. Finally, the text ends by stating that people should not miss a chance to win just because of the games.<n>7. This implies that games are a form of entertainment rather than happiness.<n>8. 9. Finally, it implies that games are relaxation and do not involve cheating.<n><n>Input:  A: the best time to visit Africa Choices:  B: is winter C: is summer D: is early E: is late<n>Output: The correct choice is C: summer.  The text begins by offering a number of times of the year when one can visit Africa.<n>2. It lists winter as one of these.<n>3. This indicates that winter is not the best time to visit as it is included along with all the other times available to one.<n>4. However the second option of summer is indicated as better.<n>5. The text also informs us that we can only visit Africa during early or late summer.<n>6. This indicates that summer is a better period to visit because it is the best.<n>7. Thus C: summer is the correct option.<n><n><n><n>

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2.

Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5.

Because the text suggests that the speaker wanted _less_ 3. Hence the correct answer is: B: less<n><n>Input:We are looking for someone who can handle a difficult situation.<n>Output:<n>1. The text mentions that they are looking for someone<n>2. Since the text mentions that they are _looking_ for someone, we can assume that they are not currently satisfied with the person they have.<n>3. Hence, since the context suggests they seek a person with _skill_ 4. The obvious choice is Choice D: skilled<n><n><n>Input: John doesn't have as much money as he used to. <n>Output:1. Given the context of the sentence, John (the subject) has less money now than he used to have.<n>2. Increasing his wealth would entail making more money, or having more resources.  3. Hence, Choice D: resources<n><n><n>Input:"It is too early to have a conclusion".<n>Output:<n>1."It is too early to...." means to have a conclusion after we do something.<n>2. Hence, Choice C: have a conclusion is the right answer.<n>

Choices:  A: supermarket B: home C: closet D: mart E: hardware store<n>Output:		D.  According to the example, one cannot buy a shopping bag at a supermarket.

Choices:  A. a call B. for help C. because D.  call E. a telephone F. help<n>Output:  F. 'a telephone' is the right answer. The context of the first sentence is that the ditch is the only thing between the boy and help; the ditch is his entire environment, and he cannot leave it to get a telephone. A telephone therefore cannot be 'in the ditch with him' since the only thing he can use is the telephone he already has with him.<n><n>Input: A: This test is too easy. The answers are clearly indicated, so it doesn't require much intellect to be able to take it.  Choices:  B:  correct C:  test D:  answers E:  intellect<n>Output:  B.

The train won't be able to capture it because the train can only ever be in one place at a time. A motion picture could, however, capture it. Moving the train is only necessary if a motion picture cannot be used.<n><n>Input: That was a brilliant piece of mischief! Choices:  A  brilliant  B  mischief  C  mischievous  D  pie of mischief  E  piece of mischievous<n>Output: A.

Choices: A) Jim B) Bob C) John D) Jim and Bob E) Mary<n>Output: 1) The question seems to imply that all the smartest players that currently play for the football team are included as answers. So Jim, Bob, John and Jim and bob are not a suitable answer options<n>2) There is an important hint that the right answer is Mary, since she is the only option that isn't a boy. However, it's not clearly stated that she's the only girl on the team or that the other players can't be the girl.<n>3) Since Mary is the only choice as an option, her being the smartest would make her the most likely answer choice.<n>4) It is unclear that being the most likely is the answer (the question can be seen as asking who is the smartest, not who is the most likely, for example)<n><n>So the answer is B.<n><n>

However, I found a much more suitable restaurant just a couple of blocks down the street.  The owner gave us the run of the place.  He could have said no,  especially as we were a large party.  After all, we were intruding on one of his busiest nights of the week.  Rather than make life difficult,  he said, 'Anything you want.  Do you want cocktails?  Fine.  How about coffee?  You've had no food, so here's some for you.'   Choices:  Choices:  A; inconspicuous B; self-interested C; grateful D; humble E; over-concerned<n>Output: 1) It is clear in the text that the owner of this restaurant, after being asked to share that one table with a rather large party, was 'not self-interested'.<n>2) It is implied that although he was not asked to share the table as a favour, he was grateful to his customers and responded with kindness - by offering to provide them with more food and alcohol than originally asked for.<n>3) Hence, the appropriate answer is 'grateful'.<n><n>Input: I thought it would be helpful to you to describe my work as a translator.

Choices A & B: farmer & farmers are wrong.  Choice C: town is wrong, too.  Choice D is also wrong.  Choice E is the correct answer.<n>Output: 1) "Go into town for farmer´s market" means that the farmer will go to the town in order to participate in the market, not simply to visit.<n>2) "Every Saturday morning, the...will go into town for market" means that every Saturday, the farmers will go into town for market (not vice versa).<n>3) "Every Saturday morning..." must be followed by a complement: the event will happen "to" or "by" somebody (who is one of the farmers).<n>4) "For market" is a dative complement. "To market" would be wrong, since markets are where farmers usually sell their products.<n>5) "Every Saturday morning" is a universal time phrase. There is no need of any other time phrase.<n>6) "Every Saturday morning", "the farmers", "to go" are coordinating phrases since "every Saturday morning" is introduced by the universal time phrase "every Saturday morning", which coordinates with it.<n>7) "The farmers" is the subject of the sentence and coordinated with "for market".

Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:A large container was a dime a dozen, there were hundreds of rows of them in the giant what? Choices:  A: factory B: garden C: supermarket D: garage E: warehouse<n>Output:		1 - 'a large container, there were hundreds of' suggests plurality.<n>2 - 'row(s) of them' suggests a noun that isn't singular<n>3 - Based on the question statement, 'a container' could be anything - a box, storage bin, trash can, or some other type of receptacle.<n>4 - 'warehouse' is the only possibility that includes the words 'warehouse' in it.<n>5 - Therefore, 'warehouse' is correct because there is no ambiguity that could be interpreted in any other way.<n>So the final ananwer is E: warehouse.<n>#13<n>## Instruction:Answer the questions given below.<n><n>Input:We did not have so much land left for the purpose in question.  We already have as much as we need.  The question is how to utilize what? Choices: A: waste B: abundance C: shortage D: space E: little<n>Output:1. This sentence is from the context of utilizing 'land' for a specific purpose.<n>2. It implies that the necessary land can't be utilized as desired due to limited availability.<n>3. The question is how to, so the choice that fits it is 'abundance'.<n>4. The text suggests that land is an abundant resource that can be divided equally amongst the needy.<n>5. However, 'abundance' also describes 'land' or something associated with land.<n>So by virtue of this context, choices (A), (B), (C) or (E) can't be utilised.<n>6. However, using the context:<n>7. It is clear that 'We have enough' was used to imply that an item has been provided in appropriate amounts for some particular activity.<n>8. This implies that whatever the required quantity of land is, it will be available.<n>9. Thus, using all the information given, (D) is the correct answer.<n>So the final answe is D: space.<n><n>#14<n>## Instruction:Read each sentence to find out whether there is any grammatical error in it.

First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:Which effect of stress could cause death if not treated immediately?

I never let a personal preference get in the way.  c : I was just a receptionist.  d : I always made people feel uncomfortable and wanted them to leave the bank.  e : I hated my job.<n>Output: C: In the given explanation, "I did this by acting friendly" implies the person was indeed friendly and did the job correctly.<n><n>Input:Brian has been working for us a year. He says he had never been so happy.  There must have been something in his last job that was a disaster. Choices:  b: he has been happy in his last job.  d: he hasn't had a job this long before.    e: a job doesn't make me happy.<n>Output:B: We can deduce from the first two sentences (I have been working for us a long time and I am now happy in the job) that he had left a job where he was happy and now he is unhappy in the new job. This implies that the disaster mentioned was that he moved out of the old job.<n><n>Input:This morning I woke up and looked through my calendar because I was going to be busy today.  There

Choices:  A: earth B: movie C: party D: served cold E: freezer<n>Output:		After doing some research, I have concluded that ice cream is "served cold" while cake is served "served cold."

Choices:  A: farmland B: neighborhood C: city D: property E: subdivision<n>Output:		1: 'Yard' is defined as a plot of land, specifically for growing plants and flowers and doing activities like lawn and garden work.<n>2: Farmland is not a tiny plot of land as it includes vast plots of land with several houses.<n>3: Similarly, neighborhoods can be large and house a lot of families.<n>4: Finally, city property would be too large.<n>Therefore, the only option that would define the term 'tiny yard' is subdivision. The word itself clearly states that the yard can only be used for growing plants and flowers while being a tiny plot of land.

Choices: A: personification, B: metaphor, C: metonymy, D: synecdoche, E: euphemism<n>Output: The text itself already tells us that it is a metaphor. As it is talking about God in a metaphorical way, all it would take is to refer to a couple of lines of that sentence: In the old, old legend, people believed that God is the father and the earth is the mother.  Here, the usage of the words 'people' and 'the old' tell us it's a metaphor. There is no mention of personification or any other rhetoric device for that matter.

There is no occasion for drinking and dancing. Neither are they celebrating a happy occasion, and there is no occasion for enjoyment since it is only described as celebrating an occasion.<n>3) The only event that fits the entire sentence is drinking.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:When I was home, I was comfortable.  But I had a crippling fear of going where? Choices:  A: outside B: vacation C: idle D: apartment E: neighborhood<n>Output:		The context of this sentence suggests that the author had a crippling home incapacity.  When home, the author of the sentence was comfortable.  But, home is not necessarily a 'crippling fear.'  Because of this, the author of the sequence felt homebound.<n>The author does go on to say, 'But I had a cripp<n>ling fear of going out where I knew there was no love.'<n>1. The second part of the sentence indicates that the author is comfortable at home, but has a crippling fear when outside.<n>2. This suggests that, while the author was home, he felt homebound.  It is clear that the author is referencing their 'home' as a house rather than an area or neighborhood.<n>3.  This is due to the fact that 'home' was previously introduced and is a more concrete term than 'neighborhood'.<n>4. Given this information, 'home' is used as an inclusive noun to refer to the location of the person or the people being spoken of.<n>5. As previously mentioned, that the author references this home as the place that is 'crippling' suggests that home is used as an inclusory noun.  The author is not referring to their 'apartment.'<n><n>In this case, the best answer is B: out. The sentence contains the word, 'fear,' which generally refers to a negative emotion.  So, when 'out' is in the context, it is used in a sense that the author needs to be careful not to express these negative feelings outside.<n><n>Input:  I'm in love and I think my girlfriend feels the same way.But if she does,I hope she'll soon realize how much I need her.I still have my moments of panic.In spite of the factI've got plenty to live for and look forward to,I often think I'm just wasting my time here and I wish I were dead.That's when depression is getting me.That's when my chin quits getting my courage up to do the right things.  When it quits, I try to make an effort to smile,because when you are depressed, you are not around enough.I think I was always shy before, but I wasn't around enough to be insecure.Now I'm always around enough to be inhibited and in

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:John's RV needs electricity so that he can cook lunch.  Where would he go to plug in? Choices:  A: toy store B: basement C: school D: rest area E: building<n>Output:		To answer this question, we need to understand the context in which John needs electricity.  The given context is that he wants to cook lunch.<n><n>1.  The provided answer choices do not mention electricity at all.<n>2.  Thus we can eliminate A: toy store, B: basement, C: school.<n>3.  We can also eliminate D: rest area.<n>4.  John would not be likely to stop at a rest area to get power to plug in his RV.<n>5.  John would not want to go to the basement where he lives to get electricity, either, nor would he go to the toy store to get electricity.<n>6.  This leaves us with the 2 choices that have mention of electricity--A: ____ E: building, which can be filled in to get A: building or E: building, where we can eliminate E: building given the context of John's RV.  He's not planning to plug in his R.V. at a building.<n>7.  We can also cross out E since it's a location that John wouldn't go to to get electricity.  All answer choices have to fit the context.<n>8.  The context suggests that John's RV needs to be plugged in, not that he wants some other power supply, so John wouldn't go back to school to charge his RV, either.<n>9.  So we're left with A: ____ B: building, where we fill in A to give the correct answer choice, A: building.<n>The answer to this question is A, A: building. John's RV would have to go to a building to be plugged in.<n><n>Input: Jane got to school before all the other students.  What percent of the way did she go? Choices: 1.  A: 20.0% B: 40.0% C: 60.0% D: 80.0%<n>Output: 1) We can cross out choice choice C and choice choice D because they are extreme: too far to be true or too far to be fair. Choice choice B cannot be true, since you cannot add together positive and negative percentages. And choice choice A is not possible, either.<n>2) Choice choice A is not possible because the percentage
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4.

The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:What is not a safe way to transport jewelry on vacation? Choices:  A: suitcase B: department store C: safe deposit box D: these twos are not safe way to transport jewellery E: lady's boudoir<n>Output:		The answer is E: lady's boudior. Firstly, suitcase is used in the context of transporting an object rather than an item, so there must be more than one way to transport jewels safely.<n>Secondly, department store also implies more than one possible way, so is not an appropriate choice.<n><n>Next, safe deposit box is implied to be too large for transporting jewels safely and not an answer.<n><n>Finally, safe implies security, so is not a safe or recommended method for transporting jewelry.<n><n>Therefore, the suggested method 'lady's boudoir' fits the context:<n><n>1. It implies something where you keep valuables safely and is also a single object.<n>2. It is a place to keep items, so is also an appropriate choice for transporting jewellery safely.<n>3. Lastly, 'boudoir' implies a place where women go to be alone and to unwind; it also has a romantic association, which suggests jewellery would fit well there; and the romantic aspect gives the impression that the place is likely to be looked after.<n><n>Therefore the answer is E: lady’s boudior which implies a place where women keep their valuables and also can be referred to as a place for women to relax and unwind, which is most likely to be well looked after by the occupant.<n><n>So the final answer to the question is E: lady' s boudoir<n><n>Input: You can't teach an old dog new tricks, but you can always teach a puppy new tricks. Choices:  A:(old dog) B: (puppy) C: (no dog) D: (old dog) never E: (puppy) never<n>Output: The answer to the question is D: (old dog).<n><n>Firstly, the question states that you can't teach old dogs new tricks but can always teach a puppet new tricks.<n><n>Secondly, 'can' implies an action that can take place, so the two parts of this statement both support the idea that you can't make a 'puppy' learn new tricks.<n>Firstly, a dog is old when it is no longer a pup.<n><n>In context, an old dog implies the equivalent of a young dog and puppy implies the equivalent
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2.

The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:They launch a surprise attack, this ended the what? Choices:  A: surrender B: defence C: retreat D: cease fire E: defend<n>Output:		The question suggests that they launch a surprise attack, which ended the ceasefire.<n>1. The context of the statement suggests that a ceasefire had been established, and this ceasefire was ended after a surprise attack.<n>2. This attack suggests that it could not have been planned, and therefore must have been a surprise.<n>3. Similarly, this is not a defence or a retreat as these only account for their initial attack.<n>4. It could therefore be concluded that the ceasefire ended as a result of this attack.<n>5. In short, A: surrender must be the correct answer.<n>So the final sentence should be modified as: They launch a surprise attack, then they surrender.<n><n>Input: His wife didn't find the idea attractive, she was too tired or busy.

D: tell her husband that she will think about his proposal and tell him about her plans for vacation<n> 5. E: tell her husband what she feels<n> Output: In order to answer this question, the question asked us to compare the choices that are given in the choices.<n><n>The context of the text suggests that her husband proposed something to her and she was accepting the proposal because it suited her.<n>But, she is not happy with the proposal because her husband does not care whether she is interested or not, he just accepts her.<n><n>Then, in order to make her happy, he agrees to accept everything she says. <n>He says that he will not just accept her but also go by her plans and follow them as well.<n>But, she did not like this.  <n><n>Then, she wants to talk to him and explain him in her own words about what is in her heart and how she feels about him.<n>If we choose A: accept his husband's proposal, so she will accept the proposal, but also she will tell him what she feels about the proposal.<n>If we choose B: accept her husband offer, so she will accept his offer but will not say what she feels about it.<n>If we choose C: tell her husband that I will think about the proposal and that she will tell him and explain him everything what she feels about him

There are only a few mentions of other public buildings such as'staircase' in the 'hall'<n>8. The text only mentions a few people such as the owner of the house, the two guests and a man<n>9. The context clearly indicates that it is a privately owned place rather than public<n>10.

We can infer that the 'projector displayed people' which makes us believe that the audience might be watching live entertainment because in many cases 'people' do indicate human beings (as opposed to animals when they say 'animals'.)<n><n>Input:When the firefighters arrived, the building was on fire, and they tried to put it out. Choices:  A. What does the firefighters do when arrives? B. Which choice implies the building was still not on fire when the firefighters got there?<n>Output: 1) We can infer that the firefighters were put to the task of putting out the fire because it says they tried to, 'put it out.'  If their intentional act was to just make some noise, then we can infer that the fire was already out.<n><n>2) B: Since the building was 'on fire' when they arrived, no other choice in the options below would imply that there was no fire before they arrived.<n><n><n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2.

(Toronto's not made of anything tower-like.)<n>3) Rogers: There's absolutely no reason to associate 'business' with Rogers in this context, so this is an incorrect choice.<n>4) Medieval castle: This is the only correct choice here. (Medieval castles are towers.)<n>5) Radio station: Although this is a plausible answer in contexts other than these, the context of the sentence is unclear.

Trapped: Nope! Mice don't generally get trapped in their cages and therefore, trapped will not have anything to do with the mouse feeling cowed.<n>3-Cowed: Nopers! The context here is about the mouse being too afraid to do anything while surrounded by the cat. This means that the cat was not afraid of the mouse and cannot be cowed by the mouse.<n><n>So correct option is d: cat was not able to cat stuff<n><n>Input:  They were not to be trusted, for they were only in it for themselves.Their self centeredness left everybody in despair.

Choices:  A: verdict B: judging C: responsibility D: evaluating E: prejudice<n>Output:		1. Judges are required to provide a "verdict" in order to determine who takes home the prize for the best pig.<n>2. This process, therefore, involves judgment.<n>3. Judgment, thus, is responsible for evaluating the pig's worth.<n>4. Judges are expected to apply a critical and unbiased eye when making these evaluations.<n>5.

We can see this from the fact he uses the words “I will be there”, rather than “I have been there for a while”.<n>3.) These words would be necessary in the sentences if he was already there. However, the fact that he is saying “later than expected”, suggests that he is delayed.<n>4.) Given this context, both B. and D. are wrong.<n>5.) C. could also be incorrect as the speaker is saying “a bit”, suggesting that he will still be on time.<n>6.) This may seem reasonable given that the person saying it wants to be there “soon”, however, A. makes the most sense out of the options here as it is a bit more general than the other two and more specific than C. (“A bit” is more specific than “So soon” but not as specific as “A bit later than expected”. “A bit later than so soon” doesn’t really make any sense.)<n>7.)

Choices:  A: self pity B: communication C: understood D: pain E: embarrassment<n>Output:		1, When you get a bruise, you yell; this means that a bruise causes some painful emotions such as Painful, embarrassment, and self-pity.<n>2. The question is asking what we feel when we're expressing ourselves by yelling after getting bruise on the face.<n>3. The question wants us to pick only one feeling that we are likely to feel after getting bruise on our faces.<n>4. This eliminates 'communicate' and 'understood' as we are only asked about Emotion.<n>5. The choice between 'Painful', 'Embarrassment' or 'Self-pity' depends on the context provided.<n>6. We have 'Bruise' and 'Face' in sentence.<n>7. We can eliminate Self-pity and Embarrassment.<n>8. The choice, among Painful and Emotional, should be selected based on the context of the statement.<n>9. The question clearly shows that we are feeling painful.<n>10. Therefore, the answer must be D: Painful<n><n>Input: He has got a big problem which he has tried to keep hidden form the world. Choices:  A. A small B. A little C. A lot D. Too much E.

Choices:  A: let down B: respect C: illness D: satisfaction E: gratitude<n>Output:		The question, referring to "everybody at work" suggests that 'he' has done quite a lot of favors, but hasn't received any reward of gratitude in return.<n>1. The sentence states that 'he' is doing favors for his colleagues at work for which he receives no gratitude or satisfaction, suggesting that he hasn't done favor for anyone at work.<n>2. The word 'everybody' also suggests that 'he' hasn't been doing favors for only a few people at work.<n>3. The word 'what' in the question could refer to gratitude, illness, satisfaction, or respect.<n>2.'gratitude' and 'illness' are both grammatical, but both 'gratitude' and the correct answer'satisfaction' are related to the original context of the original sentence.<n>5. The question 'what for it?' suggests that 'it' is the result of his favor, and the text refers to the favor as 'doing favors'.<n>6. We can infer that the correct answer is B:'respect'.

Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:What could you put a table in if you want the table to be in your house?

Where might he look for a potato. Choices:  A: restaurants B: casserole C: root cellar D: pockets E: pantry<n>Output:		1) The text suggests that James looks for a potato in his kitchen.<n>2) It also suggests that he could look for potatoes in his apartment kitchen, but is more likely to get them from elsewhere.<n>3) So we see that a 'root cellar' or 'casserole' are unlikely to be the kinds of places we would imagine James searching for a potato in.<n>4) This indicates that James more commonly searches for potatoes in his kitchen, either in a pantry or a pocket.<n>5) We see that in fact, the answer is casserole C and not A restaurants.<n>So the finalanswer is C: Casserole<n><n>Input: When you get up in the dark and stumble into the kitchen, the smell of eggs and bacon is already filling the cold room, and you grunt as you set the frying pan on the gas ring.<n>Output: 1.) The text states that the smell of eggs & bacon has already filled the cold kitchen when you get up and stumble in.<n>2.) It implies the stove is running when you put the frying pan down.<n>3.) It suggests that you are uncomfortable as you stumble into the kitchen and may even be grumbling before you are awake.<n>When you grunt, you may say it is in discomfort, but it is not from discomfort alone.<n>4.) Finally, given this context, 'grunt' means that you mutter something, indicating that the gas is likely already running when you start cooking.<n>5.) The final answer is B: the stove is already running<n>So the final answer  is B: the stov is already running<n><n>Input: He wanted a nice thick slice of roast beef with mushrooms and Yorkshire pudding, of course, and a big bowl of baked potatoes.<n>Output: The 'Baked potatoes' are unlikely to be found 'in the cold room'.  It is more likely that the potatoes are still warm and therefore baked after you have already set the frying of eggs and bacon up on the gas ring. <n>So the final answer : 1)The baked potatoes are not in the cold room<n>So the final answer: D: not in the cold room

Choices:  A: city B: michigan C: three feet D: subdivision E: three arm span<n>Output:		 First, the question is asking the size of a yard, and the only description that is given is that it is made up of three things.<n><n>2. It could not be anything bigger than three feet, and it could not be Michigan or an arm span since they are mentioned elsewhere in the text.<n><n>3. In this context, a yard appears to be made up of three distinct entities, and each seems to have a different level of size.<n>5. Therefore, C: three feet is the correct answer. However, the entities that a yard can be made up of are also the answer since they are the only options.<n><n>6. So the final answer is C: three feet. Three feet is the only option that is specified to be less than the size of the yard.<n><n>*Instruction*:Answer the following short answer questions.<n><n>Input: 1.

Choices:  a) more care b) fewer precautions c) more thorough d) less attention to detail e) no difference in medical practice f) increased concern for a patient<n>Output:<n><n>The text states:<n><n>"But after that he wouldn't speak to him on the subject, and for his part I don't think he would have taken so much pains about it if it hadn't been for his thinking he was to marry the girl." This suggests that not only did John not find the cause of death, but that he also overheard a conversation about marriage of which he did not initially know about.<n><n>1. According to the description, the young woman believed to have eaten arsenic might have been killed on purpose or accidentally.<n><n>2. While the medical professionals of the time may have thought that care, precautions, thoroughness, or attention to detail could have prevented fatalities, in the case of the young woman, they were also not as diligent as they could have been.<n><n>3. If the medical professional had been more thorough during the autopsy, the cause of death and the resulting death would have been avoided.<n><n>4. Therefore, the death of the young woman and the inaction of the medical professional are indications of less precautions in medical practice, making choice B the correct answer.<n><n>Input:2. How is this death related

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:What is a parents primary duty? Choices:  A: speak freely B: happiness of a child C: care for children D: school child E: control children<n>Output:		This question suggests that a parent's primary duty is not to speak freely, be happy, care for children, send children to school, or control children.<n>This answer is confirmed since the text states that "speak freely and happiness have nothing to do with [caring for a child] or being a parent", and "the child need not be [under the control of the parents]".<n>Therefore, D: care for children is the correct answer.<n><n>Input:The book was full of facts, but not full of truth. Choices:  A. full B: some C: much D: every E: none of these<n>Output: The text says that the book was "full of facts, and yet not full of truth".<n><n>1. Full means "all of something", while truth means "the actual reality of something".<n>2. Therefore, the book was apparently not full of all of the facts or the actual reality of something.<n>3. To determine which item in the list is not completely factual enough, one must compare truth to every option except none of these.<n><n>4. In this context, "every" and "full" cannot be in conflict, and must both be wrong.<n><n>5. In this case, the only choice which is inconsistent with "full" is D because having "some", "much", or "every" or "many" would imply that the facts are enough. The book is not full of truth.<n><n>Input: The man said in answer, "I think this means that a house can be built so that it will have neither drafts nor heat, which is unnatural and therefore bad." Choices: A: Yes, this seems to be correct B: No, this is an objectionable answer C: This is a sound answer D: This makes no sense E: No, this one is the best answer<n>Output:<n>There is no doubt that this man's reply shows that he was "prejudiced" and would always consider the answer that "made no sense" to be correct.<n>Hence, the answer to this is B.

Choices:  A: play chess B: sun themselves C: wrong house D: set table E: gettable<n>Output:		1. From the context of the problem, it appears as though the problem is referring to directions or where the child should go to.<n>2. The options to get 'home' are C: 'wrong' house and D: 'gettable' as in getting to where they need to be.<n>3. Although A: 'play chess' and E:'set the table' are not necessarily unrelated to the problem, it seems the author only refers to going 'home'.<n>4. This choice is between A and D. As for B:'sun themselves', it seems related to play or the beach but not to returning home.<n>5. The answer would be D: play chess or D: set the table because it's about how the children return home, but C: 'wrong home' is irrelevant.

While playing marbles might be fun, it isn't necessarily sufficient to cause the kids want to rest.<n>5. It might be a massive bear that got the kids so enthusiastic, but that wasn't what they needed at the moment.<n>6. At this moment in time, the kids were tired, and they needed rest. <n>7. Therefore, the missing element in the kids' playful activity is tiredness, and a need to rest.<n>8. The kids had been playing all day, and had now tired themselves out.<n>9.

Choices:  A: board ship B: shout at C: smile at D: cross street E: feel happy<n>Output:		The best suggestion to "get someone's attention" is to use the prefix "get". By saying "get the attention of a person", you are implying that a simple "attention" would not be enough for the situation. It could also sound like you were trying to use the word "get" to be synonymous with attention, which would be ineffective.<n>Instead, the phrase "get attention" implies that you need to attract someone's attention by doing a more specific action, like shouting, feeling happy, etc. This word choice would be much more effective in the sentence.<n><n>Input: If you are in love, you’re on fire.

D: cheerfully E: halfheartedly<n>Output: D: Cheerful/happiness implies they have lots of energy to go to work every day.<n><n>Output: Now it's easy to see that the correct answer is 2(A). The question makes it clear that this is very unlikely, which means that we don't need to have to choose between "diligently" and "actively". We've already established that those answers are probably incorrect.<n><n>Output: D is the correct answer.  In this case, the two things that are required to make a meal are "some food" and "some cooking".  Without them, you can't cook.  You need to say "no" to B when asking the difference between two people eating separately and them eating together.<n><n>To clarify, the required items aren't "a meal" and "a way".<n>If two things are required and you don't get them, you can'

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:Lilly owns the only kosher deli in the area.  She isn't in a heavily populated area.  Where might she live? Choices:  A: food court B: jerusalem C: new york city D: jewish community E: town<n>Output:		1: There are some hints that suggest Lilly is Jewish, such as the fact that she owns a kosher deli - food that is observant of Jewish dietary laws.<n>2: However, there are a few aspects that do not follow suit, such as that she lives in a small area, which would make it hard for her to maintain her dietary laws.  <n>3: Furthermore, nowhere in the text does it specify that she is Jewish.  In fact, the only reason we are lead to believe she is Jewish is because she owns a koshertry. This is enough evidence to consider the answer option to be false.<n>4. It is clear that the answer is not A: the food court, that is where people eat, not a deli; B: the town, implies that she lives somewhere else; C: New York as we can infer from B, therefore the answer cannot be C; D: the Jewish community; We are given too much evidence to suggest that D is false; E, the town, is false.<n>So the final Answer is False<n><n>Input:Abe was able to find another job in a field that suits her skills better than the one she quit. Choices:  A. bored B. annoyed C. frustrated D. angry E. dissatisfied<n>Output: 1) There is a connotation that she was 'forced' to quit as the fact that she 'quit' is written in a discontented manner.<n>2) There are a few hints that give away that the person Abe replaced is a male.<n>3) Based on the information given in the text, she is not satisfied with whatever she is doing.  She is described as 'bored' and 'annoyed'.  This does not seem like a positive environment or attitude.<n>4) We can see from A, we know that she is no longer 'bored' and is now in a more suitable job.<n>5) This gives me more reason to believe that A is the correct answer.<n>So the final decision is Bored<n><n>

Choices:  A: tennessee B: band practice C: orchestra D: violin case E: music store<n>Output:		What is a place that could contain tens of thousands of fiddle, that is, could have that many things in a container? 1. The words "fiddle" and "tense" are used. 2. The word "tense" occurs only in the phrase "tense orchestra". 3. The phrase "could have" suggests a place (tense orchestra) could contain a large (fiddle) number of objects (tense). 4. For the grammatical structure, that is, the verb that can be replaced by "could have", "could" is the perfect continuous form of "could", "could" is used in "would have". 5. The word "ten" does not relate to "fiddle" in the grammatical structure. 6. The word "orchestra" in the grammatrical structure can be replaced by a word beginning with the letter "o", which is a part of the answer choices. 7. Therefore, C: orchestras is the best answer.<n><n>So the final answer has already been answered by the above two examples<n><n>The solution is C)  ORCHESTRAS<n>

Choices: A: Do her work with less haste. B: Set up rules about what needs to be done. C: Have a housework competition with her husband and child. D: Rename her physical activities. E: Hire a housecleaner.<n>Output: While having a housework competition should help a woman get more time for physical activities, it seems to me that that is not what the text is asking. According to me, the question is to find the best way to get more time for doing physical activities. So the real question here is whether having a housework competition is the best way to do that. There is no mention of the woman wanting to do more housework, so D: Rename her activities is out. Hire a housecleaners and hire a housework competition are actually two different things to do, so I think that A and C are out. Finally, E: Hire a houskeeper is an alternative to having a housework competition. So the best answer is B: set up rules about what needs doing.<n><n>Input: A tiger is an example of a predator.

Choices:  A: smile B: shake hands C: express gratitude D: say you're welcome E: appreciate compliment<n>Output:		1.The first sentence of the question says that we wanted to thank someone for completing the job effectively.<n>2. The next sentence suggests that this act of appreciation is something that we would normally express.<n>3. Therefore, if I wanted to thank someone, I would express gratitude and appreciation for the job well done. There is no need to smile, shake hands, say 'you're welcome' or 'appreciate the compliment'.<n>4. Therefore, C: express gratitude is the correct answer. It is something one normally does to appreciate and express thanks to another for their job well done.<n>So the final anser is C: express gratitude<n><n>Input:If you needed to tell someone that you loved them the answer would be<n>A: 'I love you back.' B: 'I think you're amazing.' C: 'I'm glad we got together.' D: 'I understand.'

The question goes ahead to imply that if we are faced with this scenario, the answer that we would give would be a combination of one of the three choices available.<n>3. The options suggest that love can be verbally expressed as either "I love you" or "I love you back" or, in the case of the answer to the question, the two combined.<n>4. The answer itself suggests that love can also be expressed as the statement "I'm glad we're (got) together".<n>5. It is possible that this is a sarcastic comment but still acceptable.<n>6. Lastly, the last option "let's eat", while not indicating love, does acknowledge the relationship between us and the other person.<n>Therefore, if we needed to tell someone we loved them, the answer could be: "I love you" OR "I love you back", "I love you back". OR "I'm glad (we are together)".<n><n>So the final answer could be any of the options<n><n>Input: I wish we would get to talk more often. Dishonest answer: I can't see you everyday. I'm too busy.

Then, you look at a phone book for the number of a statistic class.<n>3. You then enroll in the statistic class.<n>4. Finally, you learn about operations with the number of students in your class.<n>5. In other words, the best place to learn about operations with numbers is probably a high school math class or college statistic class.<n>6.

But angles aren't the only things that can be considered "bright" or "correct". "Correct" could also be referred to as something with "accuracy, precision, or completeness"<n>B) All of these choices exclude "obtuse"<n>C) The word "obtuse" comes from the Latin word "obtusus" which means "narrow or pointed" but also means "having a slight or barely perceptible edge" and "blunt". <n>D) Angles that are obtusely angled is a possibility here. <n>E) Again, angles aren't the the only thing that can be referred to as "clear".

Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:The children saw superman fly overhead, what did they exclaim as a result? Choices:  A: ouch B: skip C: enjoyed D: awesome E: watch television<n>Output:		1/ The children saw superman fly; this is evidenced by their comment to 'watch him fly'.<n>2. They saw him fly overhead.<n>3. 'Fly' or 'flying' could be either singular or plural. If it's only one person flying, 'fly' is singular. But, if there are more people flying, 'flying' would be used.<n>4. We can observe by this comment that it was not an individual person flying.<n>5. Therefore, their comment indicates that there were a number of people who flew overhead i.e. more than one, 'flying' is plural'.<n>6. They exclaimed as a result.<n>7. From the question, we can conclude that they saw superman fly overhead while they were watching it.<n>8. They excitedly remarked about it and expressed what they felt.<n>9. This excitement is likely induced due to the presence of superman.<n>10. Therefore, the appropriate choices are: 'A, B and D. The children exclaimed that they saw superman, saw him flying and enjoyed the view due to his immense popularity.'<n>11. The choice,'skip', is incorrect as superman is not an everyday person.<n>12. So, the final answer is A, B, and D: They exclaimed that they saw super man, saw him flying and thoroughly enjoyed the event.<n><n>Input: They were shocked when he told them he had not come to the movie. Chocies:  A: left B: gone C: had come D: attended E: entered F: stayed<n>Output: 1 - He told the family he had not come to watch the movie. This means that he did not attend the movie and he did not come to the movie either.<n><n><n><n>    2 - They were shocked after he told them he had actually not been to see the movie. Here, it is used in the past tense which clearly hints that previously they believed that he was attending the movie.<n><n>    3 - The choice D: attended does not work for two reasons:<n>     <n>    4 - It is not true,<n>    5 - as we can ascertain, the speaker didn't come to the movie, we can assume he told the family he had attended because of their shock, so it is just a lie.<n>    <n><n>    6 -  F: stayed:<n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5.

The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:Where should an excavation never take place? Choices:  A: construction site B: cemetary C: building D: city E: archeological site<n>Output:		A: construction site<n>Explanation: This option must be the correct answer because it states that excavations must never take place at a construction site. This is consistent with the question prompting the fact that excavations should never take place at a cemetery or building because an excavation that is done at a construction site may cause damage to that construction site.<n><n>Input: The carving, with a length of 3 meters and a width of 1 meter, depicts a large what? Choices: A: cat B: lizard C: mouse D: squirrel E: dolphin<n>Output:  A: cat<n>Explanation:<n><n>1. The context suggests that the carving is a sculpture.<n>2. The statement, "it depicts a large lizard" implies that the lizard was carved because the carved size of the lizard must be the size of the sculpture.<n>3. However, this does not imply that the carving is not a lizard sculpture, but that the carving is possibly a carving of a sculpture that depicts a lizard.<n>4. Therefore, the question would ask "The carving, with a size of 3 meters and 1 meter, depicted a ____. "The carving is a lizard sculpture that depict a lizard."<n>5. Since this does not match the provided text, the correct answer is 'A: cat.'<n><n>Input: A: "The ____ was the favorite pet of the famous Egyptian pharaohs." Choices: A: parrot B: hamster C: rabbit D: rat E: cat<n>Output: D: rat<n>Explanation: The provided text says, "It is a well known fact that rats were the favorite pet of the most famous Egyptian pharaos."<n>Since Egyptian pharaos are people, the pet must refer to something that the people liked. Since rat is given as an option, the question would be, "The pharaos liked ____. "Rat is the only choice that matches the text with "The pharaos likes a rat."<n><n>Output: B: hamster<n>Explanation: In the context of ancient Egypt, hamsters were considered pets, the Egyptians mummified animals for their afterlife.<n>The provided text says, "The ancient Egyptians

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:What kind of place could have thousands of statue? Choices:  A: church B: theatre C: large city D: water fountain E: central park<n>Output:		1) A: church<n>1. The text suggests that the subject is a'statue' rather than a'statues'<n>2. The text states that the subject has thousands of'statues', while only one or two would typically be found in a church.<n>3. In the same way, we are looking for a structure that is of large size, and 'large city' would fit best in place of the given choices.<n>4. The other given choices such as 'water fountain', or 'central park' would not have hundreds or thousands of statues and therefore do not fit this question.<n>5. Conclusion: Church satisfies all the criteria and is the right answer choice, so 'A' is our final answer.<n><n>input:The woman was so deft that she could remove a ring in a slip of water.Output:Her deftness was so remarkable that I can barely believe it.  The sentence shows that the woman's deftness was so surprising that we are having difficulty believing it, so we must use'remarkable', not'skillful', as the adjective that modifies 'deftness'.<n><n>input:The man had two sons who were very different. One was a quiet and serious boy and the other, a rambunctious and lively one.Output:1. The question asks us to find an adjective to modify 'different' 2. The first choice, 'various', is too broad for the context, and would apply to any two sons, regardless of their personality 3. The second choice, 'opposite', is not suitable since it is an adjective that is used generally, rather than describing the two boys individually 4. The third choice, 'dissimilar', is used here to describe the characteristics of the two boys, which are the opposite of the normal qualities expected.<n><n>input:Although many would say this is true, I don't believe she is the nicest person I've ever met.Output:To say that a sentence expresses an opinion, it must convey the idea that the speaker believes the subject of the sentence is the case. Hence, the sentence 'Although this is true, I do not believe....' does not express an opinion since the person who said it does not believe the subject of the sentence.<n><n>input:I knew it was the wrong choice, but I

Choices:  A: nearest house B: workplace C: surface of earth D: office block E: his feet<n>Output:		 1. The question states that this space station was located outside Earth's orbit.<n>2. It asks what the human was looking down at.<n>3. There are 5 options.<n>4. The first (nearest house) suggests a house that was not far off from the space station.<n>5. The second (workplace) suggests that the human was not in a space station.<n>6. The third (surface of Earth) suggests a large land or area but not a surface of a building.<n>7. The fourth (office block) implies he is on a space station still but was looking at the surface of a building. <n>8. The fifth (his feet) implies that the human couldn't see the ground or what is underneath him from this spacecraft because he's looking down.<n>9. The correct answer is closest to what he was viewing. The closest option to what he was looking down on was his feet. <n>10. The final answer is E: his feet.<n><n>Input : John felt that his house, on top of the hill, was not as secure as it had been before. The house used to stand so close to the edge and now they were a metre away, and John felt nervous. He looked down to the house and wondered how on earth they could still stand up on the hill without falling over. <n>Choices :    A: his neighbors B: The trees C: the foundations D: the footpath E: the roots of the trees<n>Output :    The question has some statements about the house and some about the situation around the house.<n><n><n>The text states that his house used to be much closer to the edge in the past but now they are a metre away. This implies that they have moved further away the edge.<n>However, the text states that this house is now more stable than in the past. Thus, there is no reason to be nervous about the stability of the house.<n>When he looked down to his house, the thought didn't strike him at all that his house would fall apart because the foundations were more secure.<n>The thought didn't strike at all that the trees are not even close to a metre away.<n>Thus, the final answer is B: The trees.

Choices:  A: department store B: school C: garden D: office building E: house<n>Output:		The question suggests that Sam is most likely not at home for he should have left his shoes at home.<n>1. The question suggests that Sam's shoes must be wet and muddy.<n>2. He would be ashamed to bring muddy shoes to school.<n>3. Consequently, choosing A: department store is incorrect.<n>4. Likewise, he would be embarrassed to bring muddy shoers to the garden.<n>5. Therefore, choosing C: garden is incorrect.<n>6. He would be ashame to bring muddy shoess to his office. He was most likely unaware of this.<n>7. Consequently, choosing D: office building is incorrect.<n>8. He would be embarrassed and ashamed to enter his home in muddy shoes.<n>9. He is therefore unlikely to be at home. <n>10. However, he forgot about his shoes while at his friend's.  If this were true, he would most probably remember his shoes when at his friend's home.<n>11. He is therefore in E: house. We can conclude that he isn't at his home.<n>So the final ans is E: house<n>

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1.

He didn't like to be what? Choices:  A: orgasm B: cum C: naked D: in bed E: wearing his birthday suit<n>Output:		1: 'procreating' implies that 'he had a hangup'. The text implies that the subject 'wasn't enjoying procreating'. This suggests that the subject either liked to procreate, or had no 'hangup' in doing so.<n>2: Since the subject 'didn't enjoy procreation', 'enjoy' is an antonym for 'enjoy'.<n>3: Since the option containing the correct word is 'A: orgasm', D: in bed is incorrect.<n>4: Similarly, E: wearing his 'birthday suit' is incorrect as 'procreating' is not synonymous with this<n>5: Since the subject did 'not enjoy procreating', C: naked must also be incorrect as 'orgasm' is not synonymous to 'naked'.<n>6. Thus, out of these, B: cum is the only option to be the correct answer. Procreating includes the phrase 'a hangup' and does not include either 'enjoy' in its synonyms list nor 'naked' in its antonym list.<n>So the final word to be selected is B: cum.<n><n>Input: She had a strange habit of carrying around what? Choices: A: her lunch B: her umbrella C:  a pocketbook D: a cellphone E: a book<n>Output: 1) She had a strange habit. This suggests that carrying around something is her habit instead of an average habit of humans.  Also, carrying around something implies that something is a part of her, and not someone else.<n>2) The word 'her lunch' cannot be correct as the text says she 'held it'.<n>3) Similarly, the words 'carrying around a pocketbook' and 'her umbrella' should similarly be rejected as the text mentions that she 'held it'<n>4) Since words 'a book', 'a cellphone', 'held it', and 'carrying around' are all present in the text, 'D: a cellphone' is the correct answer.<n>5) The text implies that the word 'a cellphone' is the only word present in the text.<n>So, the final answer is D.<n><n>Input: It seemed as if John only had contempt for the work, which he considered to be the what?

Choices:  A: strength B: brain C: potential D: qualification E: competence<n>Output:		1) The question says people always talked to him childlike.<n>2) The preposition to suggests that this is a continuous process.<n>3) The question specifies that people were talking to him, so we can't be using his brain or his body in our answer.<n>4) The word disability suggests that his physical body was damaged or hurt.<n>5) The word 'disability' also usually relates to some kind of mental inability - for example, a loss of hearing, lack of speech, or blindness.<n>6) The last part of the sentence says that his disability did not affect his... and we have two options remaining - brain and potential.<n>7) 'Brain' doesn't seem to fit here - and we know that he can't hear.<n>8) The word 'potential', although commonly used to refer to a person's qualities, can be used in the sense of future prospects - a person's potential. So Potential seems like the only correct answer. The correct answer is C: potential.<n><n>Input:The doctor's diagnosis did not take the patient's situation into consideration.  It was entirely impersonal, and did not take into account that he was who he was.  What he needed was for the doctor to be what? Choices:A: empatheticB: sympathetic C: compassionateD: caringE: sensitive<n>Output:A) First, the context here is a medical diagnosis, and the diagnosis in the question is not taken into account by the doctor.<n><n>B) This is clearly a negative point, which indicates that the doctor's diagnosis didn't take something into account.<n><n>C) Empathy is often used to describe how we see and feel things from other people's perspectives.<n><n>D) Compassion is a feeling of deep sympathy. It does not directly mean taking on someone else's burden or situation.<n>E) Sensitivity in the medical context refers to pain levels.<n><n>Compassion is the correct answer for this question.  The implication is that this man wasn't just some patient to the doctor. He was a person, and not just a statistic representing his disease, or his symptoms. He needed his doctor to empathize with him as a person, see him as more than a name or a diagnosis

Choices:  A: concert B: home C: airport D: college E: university<n>Output:		1 The question mentions the'security guard'.<n>2. 'Golf cart' indicates that when it comes to security guards, a vehicle is suggested rather than a person, thus meaning the 'guard' in question is someone who carries out security.<n>3. 'Protect' and 'young adults' suggests that the guard is protecting the young adults rather than the concert itself, thus meaning the guard is protecting a place that they frequent and not just the concert.<n>4. The final clue suggests that the guard would not be protecting the young adult at the concert, but the venue that the concert is held in, meaning that the guard is protect the young adults from being lost or hurt in the college, not the concert.<n>5. Therefore, the correct answer is college rather than concert.<n><n><n><n><n><n>

He picked a place that was inexpensive and offered few luxuries.  Where might he be staying? Choices:  A: farm B: town C: city D: hotel E: motel<n>Output:		He might be staying in a farm or a small town or a small city. But most likely he chose farm or small town.<n>So the final Answer is A: farm OR B: small town<n><n><n><n><n><n>#Input:  John arrived at the station wearing his finest clothes and his favorite suit.  He was dressed to the nines.  What does the phrase dressed to the nines mean? Choices: A: fashionable B: cheap C: expensive D: well-made E: comfortable<n>Output:The text is saying that in this case John would be wearing the latest, most fashionable suit that he possesed.<n>So the final Answe is A: fashionable<n><n>#This is a tricky Question<n>Input: A recent survey indicated that nearly half of all the students that took a course last semester never finished it.  The text strongly suggests the following about many students. Choices A: are unmotivated. B: have trouble organizing their time. C: prefer reading stories to learning from course materials. D: find course material too difficult to follow. E: prefer to participate in sports.<n>Output: The text says that many students never finished the course. This means that they are not completing the coursework. They are also not studying or reading about it so E is not the right answer either<n>Input: Mary never was much of a student as a kid.  She got so little sleep that whenever she was tired during the day, she fell asleep at her desk.  She got terrible grades and would read anything as long as it took the form of a novel.  It turns out, though, that Mary was a good scholar despite not getting much sleep.  She did well on her exams and eventually graduated from college.  After graduation, she became a teacher and worked tirelessly at her job, even though she was working night shift.  Where does she live? Choices: A. on the East Coast B. in a small town C. in a big city D. in a small community E. in a trailer park<n>Output: From this text, it would seem likely that Mary is living in a small town or a big city.<n>So the final Choice is B in a small town<n><n><n>Input:  This is a tricky Question<n><n>The paragraph doesn't indicate to what city a young woman is traveling. It does state that

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5.

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:Rumors of roving bands of monsters killing people could lead to what? Choices:  A: panic B: getting in trouble C: mass hysteria D: go to prison E: murder<n>Output:		1) The text suggests that rumors of monsters are killing people is causing people to react emotionally and irrationally, so we can infer that the panic and mass hysteria options are likely incorrect answers.<n>2) The text doesn't suggest any actions that can lead to getting in trouble, so that option is likely incorrect.<n>3) The text does not use the term "murder", but rather "killing people". In fact, only the murder option suggests that the deaths are being caused intentionally, or on purpose.<n>4) The text does not suggest that monsters are being killed on purpose, so getting in trouble is unlikely.<n>5) The text doesn's discuss any criminal behavior, so you can rule out going to prison and murder.<n>6) Therefore, the correct answer is B: getting in trouble<n><n>Input: It's impossible to describe what it means to be a friend to someone who's angry all the time. Choices:  A. impossible to grasp B. impossible to grasp a hold of C. impossible to describe D. impossible to catch E. impossible to know<n>Output: 1.) The word "grasp" is used in the text to describe how a friend of someone who's angry would interact with their friend. The other options involve "grasping" a hold of something the text doesn't describe, "grasping" information, or catching someone, a feat that is clearly not possible with a person who is constantly angry, especially with the usage of the verb "grasp". Therefore, we can eliminate "impossible to grasp" and "impossible to grasp a hold of".<n>2.) "Impossible to describe" is not appropriate, because the phrase " It's impossible to know" and/or "impossible to understand" might fit, as they both imply the author's inability to express himself.<n>3.) "Impossible to catch" is also incorrect, for the same reason why "impossible to grasp the hold" is incorrect, mentioned in #1.<n>4.) Finally, "impossible to know" is a better fit. This phrasing implies a level of difficulty that's impossible to surpass, or a lack of knowledge, both of which fit the subject of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer, as seen in the answer key, is "impossible to know".<n>So the final answer would be

Choices:  A: read book B: getting bored C: worry D: singing E: s never comes<n>Output:		1)The text suggests that people tend to get bored while waiting, when something is expected and doesn't come.<n>2)None other than singing is listed as an alternative, and it doesn't have an opposite option.<n>So the final sentence is "When never comes (that is, when something is expected but never comes) people sing/singing".
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3.

The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:What would something be if you do not need it? Choices:  A: satisfied B: unnecessary C: luxury D: sufficient E: extra<n>Output:		1: Satisfied here means happy or as expected. That is not what'something' is. It is an 'object' with certain use, need and value. Hence, in this sense B: unnecessary is more appropriate if we do not want them. <n>2: 'Use' has different meaning from 'use value'. The thing is 'use value' is necessary whereas the thing is 'use'. So, in this situation, if we do not want 'any' object, this choice is a good one.<n>3: But, if we want to be specific and avoid having unnecessary things, we can have only required things. Luxury means extra; an extra thing, extra things. I think the only suitable choice is C:luxury.<n>4: At the end, we do not want anything with exception for any necessity. So, D: sufficient is good since both satisfied and D are good answers.<n>So the final answers are:<n>A: B/C/D<n>B: E<n>

Choices:  A: doctor's office B: hospital C: apartment D: study E: furniture store<n>Output:		The text suggests certain restrictions about the armchair's use.<n>2. A hospital and a doctor's office are places where medical service is provided.<n>3. Therefore, the armchair must be either in a hospital or a doctor's office, and not in a furniture store or an apartment.<n>4. But the text implies that an apartment might not be a suitable place for an armchair only used by a few people.<n>5. Similarly, a furniture store would house chairs that are used by many people.<n>6. This suggests that a hospital or doctor's office is the most possible location for an armchair used by only a few.<n>7. Therefore, an armchair's location in a hospital or doctor' s office is the correct answer.

Choices:  A: make noise B: band C: museum D: concert hall E: rubber band<n>Output:		We can infer that the context suggests that a harpsichord makes noise.<n>This is evidenced from the sentence, "Where is one likely to heard a harpsichord?"<n>Further, the word "concert" from the sentence, "concert hall", suggests that the place to hear a harpsicord plays music.<n>Therefore, B: band is the correct answer.<n><n>Input: What's your opinion about the last year of high school? Choices: 1.  A: it was better B: it was worse<n>2.  it was not bad<n>3.  it was not good<n>4.  it was better and worse<n>5.  it was terrible<n>Output: This question does not refer to what the actual condition was. The phrasing of the question implies that it is asking the opinion about a hypothetical situation. In this case, the condition would be the same as the previous years.<n>Therefore, the choice that should be omitted is 1A: it was better. That is, it was better, not the last year of highschool.<n><n>Input:  I want to make the point that all three of these are adverbs Choices: 1:  A: and B: then<n>2:  C: too D: also E: neither<n>Output: The question refers to the context of the following sentence.<n>"I don't want to make this more important then."<n>The word 'then' here is an adverb. Therefore, 1A: and and 1B: then are the right answer.<n><n>Input:"The last thing you want to buy if you're having difficulty deciding between two or more potential purchases is something you can't afford." Choices:  A;  it is not expensive<n>B: it is affordable.<n>C: it is an impulse buy.<n>D: it is something you're not sure about.<n>E: it is something you know you want.<n>Output: The sentence is saying that the impulse buy doesn't fit in context. Therefore 'A:it is not expensive' is the right answer.<n>""The last thing you want if you're having trouble deciding how to spend money on multiple things is to buy something you can't" Choices:<n>A:  It's expensive<n>B:  It's something you're

Choices:  A: short term B: crowd C: unpredictable D: frequent E: eternal<n>Output:		1) The question suggests that secular parties take place with some regularity.<n>2) For the secular party to take place, there must be a crowd, which would not likely happen if it were only held at the time of death of members of the household.<n>3) Therefore, the parties would likely be frequent.<n>4) This implies that they cannot be held just before death or at any other frequent point in time as then, the time period available for hosting parties would be limited, leaving little time to prepare guests.<n>5) Since the parties usually involve food, it would be a tedious task to prepare the ingredients when they have limited time, or the food has to be pre-cooked and frozen and then re-heated.<n>6) Since these parties occur with some regularity, the time period must have been well planned for, in advance, and the ingredients have to be bought in advance (not just at the short notice that would occur if the party takes place upon the death of a member of household).<n>7) The party has to be eternal, since, if it is held at the time of certain death of people (after all people are always going to die at some point in their life), it will only continue in the memories of the family.<n>8) Given that these parties take place at frequent intervals and are eternal because they happen at death, they cannot be held at the death of a person.<n>9) Therefore, the time period at which they are held must be unpredictable.<n><n>So the correct choice is E: unpredictable.<n>

He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5.

Choices:  A: insane B: annoy people around C: enjoy D: inhale E: had good voice<n>Output:		Why does she sing so much answer: In the context of the sentence, she is asked why she sings a lot.<n><n>1. However, the sentence does not specify how often or how long she sings.<n>2. She could sing everyday for half an hour or 8 hours a day for a week or a month.<n>3. Singing doesn't seem to be bothering anyone, so the first two options are out.<n><n>4. Since she hasn't given other reasons for her singing, we can rule out that either of the other choices are her motive for singing so much.<n>5. She is clearly enjoying herself, which suggests that either she has a good voice or that inhaling her singing is enjoyable.<n>6. But it is unlikely that she inhales her singing, so that is out.<n>7. So it boils down that she sings very often just for the fun of it.<n>8. She sings for the same reasons that adults play and teens flirt: fun.<n><n>So the final answer to the question should be A:insane<n><n>Input:She was surprised at the ease on which she was able to swim.

The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer.

So that I can find what I want I will buy what I need.Choices:  A: bread B: a loaf C: a piece D: a bundle E: a roll<n>Output:B. The options A,C, & D cannot be the correct answer because the meaning of the sentence doesn’t fit in with ‘buy’ or ‘need’ when applied to the options. The sentence is talking about searching for a particular item in the store. Therefore, it should be something ‘bought’ or ‘purchased’ that is in need. Therefore, the correct answer is B. A loaf of bread.<n>So the result is B. A loa of bread<n><n>Input: The man who was to leave the building was looking forward to going back to his family.

Make sure the doorknob was secure. Check the windows. Make sure the doors were locked.  Answer Choices:  A. Everything  B. Nothing else  C. It was the wrong time  D. There were too many other people  E. The lighting was too low.  Output: The choice would only be obvious if you know the context for this question.<n><n>1) If the doorknob wasn't secure, it would make sense to look at everything else besides the doorknob, but this is not indicated in the text.<n><n>2) Checking the windows would only make sense if something was suspected to have come from outside.

The first part of the question "If someone wanted to learn English" suggests that they are not already fluent English speakers.<n>2. The second part (to learn English) implies that the learners know what they mean by English.<n>3. The first choice (to buy a dictionary) implies that the person already knows some English.<n>4. Next, (take lessons) suggests that the person learns some English through taking courses.<n>5. The next choice (learn about geography) suggests that there are things about geography (USA etc) that the prospective speakers do not currently understand.<n>6. The next (learn appropriate manners) suggests that people will need to learn manners as different countries have different etiquettes.<n>7. The last choice (learn the American way / travel to America for English lessons) suggests that they might need to start from the beginning. As such, they will need to take lessons, learn about geography and learn the appropriate manners.<n>8. Therefore, the correct answer would be both (2) and (3) and possibly (4) (take lessons).<n>So the correct answer is : (2) and (4)<n>  <n>Input: What is the result of putting a cup of tea in one of these?

Choices:  A: gain experience B: taking notes C: listen carefully D: complete test E: focus<n>Output:		1: The student wants the professor to say what he means and wants to understand the meaning of his words.<n>2: Taking notes is a way of recording the information the professor presents, but it is not necessarily listening, as one may miss out on important information while trying to write.<n>3: Listening carefully is an important part of understanding meaning but it does not ensure that the student will be able to answer all the questions in his or her next test.<n>4: The student cannot "complete" any test as tests vary in nature. For instance, a student may take an in-class test to assess the knowledge of students in the classroom rather than testing the completion of another paper.<n>5: "Focus" does not always equate to listening to what a speaker is saying. There may be multiple distractions like discussions, sneezing, coughing (if social distancing protocols are not followed) to name a few.<n>6: Therefore, E: focus is the correct answer. To be fair to the professor, the student should listen carefully. Once he has listened and understood each point, the student should focus on what has been said to answer any questions he/she has in the next test.<n>So the final question is E: focus<n>

It means that you are not allowed to take anything with you when going; it does not mean that you are allowed to take anything with and therefore the answer choice You would not be able to get rid is incorrect. A better choice here is You will be able to get rid. The word would indicates that it will be possible in the future. There is no indication that a broken icebox would not be able to be disposed off.<n><n>Input: I wish she had done her chores a long time ago.  <n>Choices:  A. That's too late to do. B. Too late to do. C. Too late. D. Too late to. E: Too bad.<n>Output: Since 'a long time ago' refers to 'an earlier point in time' ('long time ago refers to the past'), that gives us a clue that Too late refers to the past. 'Do her chores' refers to an activity in progress, or a task not yet complete. 'Too late' refers to a later time, which means that there is still time for 'to do her chores'. Therefore, 'That's too late to' is incorrect. 'Too late to do.' is incorrect because the phrase 'do her chores' is being used in the third person (she has done her chores), so she should be the subject of the verb, not the object. Also, 'late' describes 'to do' which should not be the object; it should be the main verb. 'Too late.', 'Too late to.' and 'Too late to.', is incorrect because 'late' is not an adverb, but a noun, thus describing something, not adding to the meaning of the adverb. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Too Bad'.<n>So the final answer from above is E: too bad.<n><n>Input: A. That’s too late to be.<n>Choice: B:	That’s too late
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:Where could you find a theater which only has unpaid actors? Choices:  A: shopping mall B: hospitals C: populated area D: school E: military base<n>Output:		1: Here'shopping mall' is meant literally. You'd be more likely to find unpaid actors in the actual shopping mall.<n>2: A 'hospital' generally would not allow unpaid theatre performances on its premises, but if something really special came along, say a good fundraiser or something, a hospital might make an exception and allow theatre performances for free.<n>3: On the other hand, you might see an unpaid play in a very rural or remote area where there's so few amenities, that people do what they have to in order to get by- like put on a free play in the school the town/city council funds.<n>Though this is a remote possibility at best.<n>4: It would be a stretch to say an unpaid play could find a home in a military base.<n>5: So the final answer is A: shopping malls<n>
### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>Input: John only gave a perfunctory examination of the corpse, though he did everything required of him.  He missed the real cause of death.  He wouldn't have if he had been more what? Choices:  A: careful B: thoughtful C: complete D: thorough E: intricate<n>Output: 1. First, the question suggests that John did everything that was required of him while examining the corpse.<n>2. The text also suggests that despite doing everything that was required, he still missed the real cause of death.<n>3. Given this context, John's examination was not lacking in care, thought, completeness, or intricacy as these are not necessarily related to missing information.<n>4. However, the examination missing the real cause of death suggests that it wasn't comprehensive or detailed enough.<n>5. In this context, being 'thorough' implies that he would have taken more time to carefully check every aspect of the examination.<n>6. Therefore, D: thorough is the correct answer. The missing element in John's examination was thoroughness. Had he been more thorough, he would have discovered the real cause of death.<n>So the final answer is D: thorough<n><n>Input:She wanted to make a quilt of velvet, where should she look? Choices:  A: grandma B: clothing C: jewelry store D: clothes E: fabric store<n>Output:		1. Grandma is not a person but a place.<n>2. It is mentioned later in the sentence that she would be shopping at a fabric store where they had beautiful fabric and threads.<n>3. This is a direct indication that a clothes store (not a clothing store) or a fabric store would have the velvet that she wanted.<n>4. The only other place mentioned is a jewelry store, which makes it unlikely that she is shopping for velvet that she would use to make a quilt.<n>5. Therefore, She wanted to make a quil for velvet, therefore, the likely place to find velvet would be a fabric store.<n>6. Since the question is asking for where she should look, the correct answer is fabric store B: Clothes<n><n>Input:  The last thing that you want to do is to try to explain quantum physics to a four-year-old. Choices:  A. Explain quantum physics B. Explain physics C. Explain four-year-old D. Explain quantum E. Explain why a four-year-olds needs to know what a four-year- ol d needs to know.<n>Output: Since the sentence says the last thing "you" want to do, the answer should be that which concerns "you" and "you" in the text.<n>1. The sentence goes on to say that the author has done this multiple times, but that she has always regretted it, which shows that she has done this, so she knows that she does not want to explain quantum physics to her child, which is a "you" from the author's perspective.<n>2. The sentence goes on later to say that other people have suggested that her child is interested in quantum physics, but she is not worried about that because she does not want to waste her or her child's time explaining quantum physics to a child who does not understand.<n>3. The reason is because she and her child both know that their interest in physics is not at the level of quantum physics.<n>4. Therefore, it wouldn't be a waste of time to explain it, just as it is not a waste of time to introduce your child to concepts that they do not understand while acknowledging that they will probably not understand what it is saying immediately or right then or right where they are<n>5. Therefore, it wouldn’t be a waste of anyone’s time,

Choices: 1. Two A: Barrels used to load bullets into the chamber.  B: Barrels used when the pistol is being fired.<n>2. While the barrels that are used to load the bullets are essential in the firing process, they are not used to fire the bullet.<n>3. Only the barrels that fire the bullet are used in firing.<n>4. One of the barrels is used to load the bullet into the chamber, and the other barrels are used when the pistol fires.<n>5. Only when one of the barrels fires the bullet does it use a barrel in firing.<n>6. So, two barrels are used for firing a pistol.<n>7. And, since a pistol has one that has one or more barrals, the answer to the question is A: One

Choices:  A: sanded B: composted C: warp D: hardened E: petrify<n>Output:		1. In the given text, 'fossilized' is the result of the process of petrification. So, petrification is the answer. Now let us understand why. The given line is in simple present tense, present perfect tense or the perfect tense of the given sentence can be 'have become' The sentence talks about the wood which became fossilized. To check this, we can replace the sentence with, 'The wood 'have become' fossilized' so. 'The wood 'have became' fossilized', using the present perfect tense. This sentence is correct.

The dog is a small one so it will like go to a place that is small.<n>2. The word 'new' in New England, suggests that it would rather go to some new place.<n>3. New England is a location in North America so the dog will go to some place in North America.<n>4. There are so many places in North America.<n>5. I will put my option as follows New Hampshire.<n>6. That is because New Hampshire, being the north of England, has similarities in their nature.  New Hampshire has long hours of winter and snow, these are features common among dog’s habitats.  Also, their food which New Hampshire produces is likely to be suited to a dog’s taste.  Also the word ‘England’ means England, which excludes some parts of America.  This explains why I picked New Hampshire.<n>So the  final answer is New Hampshire<n><n>Input: The best way to get to know a person is to spend time with him or her in the most unguarded situations.

Choices:  A: lake B: aquariums C: swimming pool D: pond E: childrens pools<n>Output:		First, the question suggests  that the answer should be related to what body of water is traditionally shallow water.<n>2. The body of water that is typically shallow water is likely to be a body of water such as a lake, a pond, or a swimming pool which are all bodies of water that are typically shallow.  In this context, the body of water that is traditionally shallow is a childrens pool.<n>3. In this context, B: aquariums and D: ponds do not fit with this criterion.<n>4. As ponds and aquariums are mostly bodies of water that are only shallow in specific areas within them, they do not fully match with the criteria listed in the question.<n>5.

Choices:  A: public building B: tomb C: arena D: large building E: treasure<n>Output:		The explorers found a large passageway, with a large room on the end.   I would argue that D: large building is not the intended answer because the explorers found a room in the final passageway. The room on the end could be called a large room, but the word large does not denote the final size of the room discovered.<n>I believe that E: treasure is also not correct because the discovery of the room does not mean the discovery of the treasure.  The room could, and often times is, used to hide the treasure.<n>I believe that A: public building is also incorrect because there is no evidence that the passageway led to any sort of public building.<n>Similarly, B: tomb and C: arena do not make sense because they suggest that the room contained a deceased person or a deceased person's belongings. The explorers found the room itself, but in this case, it can only be assumed that the room contained no skeletons, or bodies, or tombs, etc.<n>I believe that the correct answer is B: tomb

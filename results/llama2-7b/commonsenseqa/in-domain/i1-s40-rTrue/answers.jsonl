First, the questions says that she \"was\" in a sweater and says her name on it.\n3. This gives us information about her current state, so we can't assume that she is 45 years old.\n4. In fact, the question states that she is older than 45.\n5. Therefore, we can't assume her to be 45 years old if she is older than 54.\n6. So the final answer 3.\n\nInput: Someone knocked on your window.  Would you open the window? Choices: A: Definitely B: Yes C: No way D: Of course not\nOutput:1. The question says, \"someone knocked on your WINDOW.\"  Therefore no answer D \"Of course not\" is applicable here.\n2. The question gives us little information, but we do know that someone did not knock on the DOOR so answer choice C \"no way\" is also incorrect.\n3. We don't know specifically how far away from the question that the person knocked.  The person could be right in front of us.\n4. However we do know that the knock was on the window and was not on the door.  But we do not also know where the knock was on the WINDOW or if it was just above the sill.\n5.

{"text": "1) The question asks us to identify where a \"skin\" was cut. The words \"good health\" and \"body\" are in proximity indicating the choice is not A: good health or B: body as these options are not the place where the skin is cut.\n2) The text suggests that the skin was \"cut while chopping onions\", and that the place of skin is \"meat or own family\". Furthermore, the sentence \"where was this skin likely cut?\" asks that we identify the place of the skin cut, showing that it is unlikely to be \"own family\" as this place is unlikely to cut skin.\n3) Considering these contextual assumptions, it is not reasonable to choose \"meat\" or \"body\" as \"meat\" is not necessarily implying that the skin is cut there, and similarly \"body\" could be a cut to various other regions rather than the skin.\n4) Considering the contexts and that the text asks us to find the location(s) of the skin cut, D: \"body\" is the best choice.

{"text": "The word 'glad' suggests that it is the contrary of sad or unhappy.\n1. Therefore, A: depressed and B: downcast are the wrong answers.\n2. Although the context of the sentence suggests that some feeling such as 'gloomy' may be associated with 'glad', this may only infer that you have some negative feelings.\n3. Hence, the meaning of the sentence is such that if you aren't 'depressed' or 'downcast', you probably have a feeling that is the opposite of these feelings, namely 'glad'.\n4. Therefore, C: angry and D: unhappy should be eliminated.\n5. As the opposite of gloom, the answer should be 'happy', but this is not actually opposite to the given word. \n\n6.Hence, the only choice that seems to match the context of the sentence is:  E: sorrowful\n\n### Instruction:Write a function such that, if argument is a string, it will return the number of times \"dog\" appears in the string (including the word \"puppy\" but not \"doggie\"), excluding non-letters or spaces.

For numeric, the answer is straightforward to compute as well. However, for the string case, there are two words that would have been counted, namely \"dog\" and \"puppy\". Hence, by excluding \"doggie\" which is made of two \"d\"'s, it must be in the form \"dogggie\" such that \"dog\" and \"gg\" will be returned.\n3", "answer": "A: depressed"}

However, if we try to work it out, 8400 isn't a multiple of 60, so John can't write 8400 words per 60 seconds.\nThe correct answer is therefore: E: 840 000 minutes, since 840, 000 is a multiple of 6.\nJohn would write 12,500 words in a minute, 840,250 words in 60 seconds, 52,010,000 words in a day, and would take the same number of minutes to write 52,001,000 words.\nSo the final solution is: '840 0,000' minutes.\n\n### Sub-Task : what is the answer of the second question?\nInput:In fact, the answer to that is 7.

However, John is not doing well, as indicated by the following phrase: '.. his health was not what?' Therefore, the sentence does not intend to speak of John's health as a whole, but rather, refers to John's failing health which is causing him difficulties. Thus, we can cross off choices A and B, which refer to John's improving health. Further, choice B indicates a change happening, whereas the previous sentence only states that something is occurring.

Choices: 1:Canada 2:Central America 3:The Dominican Republic 4:Honduras 5:Nicaragua, Costa Rica 6: Guatemala 7:El Salvador, Belize\nOutput:7.\nThe prompt makes it clear that the correct answer is likely to be in either the United States or Canada and further points towards a western hemisphere location which rules out all continental choices except North America and Central America.\nThe prompt emphasizes the country's relative proximity to Mexico, in the northern 3rd, which rules out all American choices except possibly the Dominican Republic.\nAll of the American choices listed, except the Dominican Republic, were Spanish colonies at one time which would rule them out as there is no suggestion in the statement that the country was occupied by Spain within living memory, the most current events referenced.\nThis leaves Central America as the only option left and Nicaragua appears as the most likely from a location alone, though all are relatively equally far from Mexico, it is the only one which has a northern 3rd third adjacent to it and it was originally a Spanish colon.\nAll of the suggested countries border Mexico in the southern 2/3rds or more except Belize, a country which wasn't originally part of the North American continent, in its northern 1/3, which seems unlikely as part of the prompt.\nOf the other countries which border Mexico in the northern 1-1/3, only The Dominican Republic could possibly be the answer, but seems like it would be unlikely to be included as it was part of Spain.\nThe only remaining options, which still are both North American and Spanish colonies within living memory, which satisfy all of these criteria are Honduras and El Salvador.\n\nInput: If I told you 2 + 9 was 15, what would it mean if I told you 3 + 11 was 0?

{"text": "1. In the example that the text is about, at an intersection, cars were coming from different directions.  This would suggest that people are likely to stand on one of the streets that meets so as to not to be in the middle of the intersection.\n2. 'Stand at an intersection' means that people are likely to be there.  However, the text implies that traffic is already on its way to the intersection so people at that intersection weren't created by the cars that were.\n3. However, the text specifically mentions the intersections of four streets, strongly hinting at the possibility that they are in the middle of the intersections.

(or over a weekend)\n2) This suggests that 'picnic' is most likely a dinner or something that would be served as meal as it is listed as coming after both 'breakfast' and 'Lunch' which were meals.\n3) This, also, is confirmed in the fifth paragraph which says that 'fourth of July Picnic' is a big event.

{"text": "10.The context of the question suggests that a football field is an entity that can be \"on\" somewhere, i.e. occupy physical space.\n2.The question also states that the correct answer must be something related to a football field as the others are names of institutions.\n3. Therefore, the context implies that we may only select entities that can be said to be \"on\" the football field.\n4. This implies that 'university football team' in example C cannot be selected, because 'university team' cannot be said to occupy a physical space.\n5. Therefore, the context narrows down the types of entities that can be placed on a field, to either a player on a field, or something on a field.\n6. However, the context does not specify whether these entities must be on the 'field' itself, and whether the other answers can be selected as entities on 'the field'.\n7. Therefore, the context is ambiguous between these two interpretations, so the answer depends on what is being implied by the context.\n8. The only contextual evidence that supports that the other answers are incorrect, is the fact that the word 'field' in C is italicized, implying that we can only select entities that are on the field.\n9. But there is enough contextual evidence that suggests that other answers could be correct as well, in that the question specifically allows football players to be on a football field.\n10. Furthermore, no contextual evidence supports the answer B (so-called), as there is nothing in the context that supports the entity referred to by 'oklahoma' that can be said to occupy space.\n11.

That applies to the creative writing, the academic writing, the personal writing, and the daily blog. For me, that piece is the \u201cif you write one more word, I won\u2019t love you anymore\u201d piece.\n* A writer who\u2019s gotten up late and rushed out the door to the train without a second to spare.\n* That \u201cgood writers are never bad writers\u201d is probably the best advice a writer can receive. While some may feel good enough to say \u201cgood writers can always improve\u201d, the key to learning the skill is to not be afraid to start writing.\n* I'm sure if any of my students asked \u201cShould I write?\u201d, I'd tell them to write as much and as well as possible.\n* But by that rationale, you should also run a marathon. But the advice you should take (or give to others) is almost never a good general rule: it's best suited for specific situations.\n* But that doesn\u2019t mean a writer who has no idea how to start doesn\u2019t have anything to write about, either.\n* If you want to write, or if you write as a serious hobby, you should write as much as possible. It doesn't matter if you write on the internet or on your laptop or in a little notebook or anything else - just write. The best advice I can give is to write.\n* If you ask an author \u201cshould I write\u201d, they will likely say \u201cwrite as much as you can and don\u2019t worry about getting published\u201d.\n\n### Instruction:\n\nYour task is to answer the following multiple choice", "answer": "A: bus stop"}

The government has not announced increased taxes, but some citizens are underpaid anyway. Some citizens felt underpaid even before the government increased death taxes.\nOutput: First, the announcement seems to suggest that income has increased, and even with the tax, they are still underpaid. The announcement did not mention the increased tax rates.\nSecond, the word 'increase' should be used in the context of the income, tax, or both, because they all should be increasing.\nThird, the government cannot announce an increase in income without correspondingly increasing the tax rates because the higher income means the government wants to increase taxes.\nFourth, the taxes were not announced increases, so the citizens are not underpaid even if they did not receive the announced increase in tax.\nFinally, it is not the tax announcement that makes the citizens feel underpaid, but rather the income increase.

A: 'he felt like he was breath\u00ading fresh air for the firs\u00adt time', suggests that he wasn't breathing fresh air before. It implies that he has previously had some respiratory ailment that prevents him from breathing fresh air.\n2. B: 'he began to feel good' also says nothing about his previous condition so this one is also useless.\n3. C: in the mountains, there is no oxygen, not even the fresh air. So, C is not the answer here.\n4. Let's see what it says about D: 'he was doing something to enjoy it more'\n5. D: 'look around' also says nothing about what he's doing. And, it's the last option available.\n6. Since both look around and breathe deeply mean doing something it might be wrong.\n7. E: 'breathe more deeply' is the only one that actually says what he was doing. Breathe more deeply - 'breathe' is the subject while the rest is the verb. So, the only answer that would pass that test is breathe more deeply. So the answer should be E: breathe more deeply \n\nSo the final answer will be E: breatne more deeply\n\nInput: The best place to meet someone would be in a public place.\nOutput: Best place where and how would be a public place.\n\nInput: She looked more pleased than ever before.\nOutput: She looked more pleased then what.\n\nInput: Aaron is always polite with his students.\nOutput: Since it is negative, it should be Aaron is not always polite with his student.\n\nInput: The door will close if the handle is on the other side.\nOutput: You need to say the door will close when the handle is on the opposite side.\n\nInput: There is still much to be done.\nOutput: There is still a lot to be done.\n\nInput: I am a student in college.\nOutput: I am a college student.\n\nInput:\"What does she keep in her purse besides makeup?\"\nOutput: I think she would not have to keep makeup in her pur", "answer": "E: breathe deeply"}

The word \"apartment\" refers to a place to live.\n4. \"A: middle east\" and \"A: apartment\" are therefore the correct answers.\nSo the final answers are a:middle east and b:apartment\n\nInput: Which of these things has two legs? Choices: A: frog B: wolf C: man D: elephant E: horse\nOutput: The question \"which of these things has two\" suggests that one of these choices must have two.\nThe sentence \"has two\", as a whole, contains several subjects: \"has\" is not linked to any of the subjects \"these things\" - \"these things\" refers to \"frog, wolf, man, elephant and horse\"\nWe can extract four of the subjects (but not the sentence \"has two\")  \"frog\" and \"wolf\" have two each.\nTherefore, \"C:man\" and \"D:elephant\" are correct answers because they both have two.\n\nSo the final answers is b:D:elephant\n\nInput: What is the capital of Australia?

{"text": "The use of'relax' strongly suggests that there was tension surrounding the other passengers.\n2. The rest of the text suggests that these passengers would have been loud enough to disturb anyone sitting on that bus.\n3. The question is implying that these passengers were disrupting the placidity of the environment, whereas, the only way to combat this is to do something that distracts us from the disorder.\n4. The idea of listening to music as a distraction implies that the cause of his tension was because of the noises from those disruptive passengers.\n5. In the context of the question, sleep is not necessary to 'distract' or'relax'.\n6. What is necessary in order for the person to'relax' is to 'go to bed' and the question directly asks us if the other passengers were loud enough to 'distract' to the point of 'going to bed' and, therefore, the correct answer is B: sleep.

{"text": "1: In modern times 'undestructable' is a hyperbole. It is common for movies to use hyperbole. It also seems odd in the context of a man causing accidents and in the presence of someone 'vulnerable' enough to attract his attention.\n2: A similar hyperbole was used in previous part of the question: 'unbreakable' is a less common alternate term for indestructible, while 'invivible' is an actual state of being, although a little more vague. The same applies for the term 'unbendable'.\n3. It might be argued that 'invisible' would be a more appropriate answer because it refers to being 'not detectable at first sight'. The intended meaning here is that this man believes it impossible to find a person as fragile as himself. But his intent is to make them detectable so they need to be 'detectable at first sight' to begin with.\n4. 'undestructible' only connotes that person cannot be destroyed, not that they are impossible to detect. A 'indestructible' person would be impossible to detect because they are always present.\n5. This person needs to be detectable to begin with so the question can be answered. They need to be detectible first and then unbreakable/undestructable would both satisfy the answer.\n\nGiven that the answer is both 'undestructable/indestructible', the final answer is D. D is the only answer that is both 'indestructible/undestructable' and does not conflict with any other answer.\n\nInput:The best kind of friendship is the one that is like a what?

Each student in the crowd only focuses on reaching the door as quickly as he can. They don't care about winning over other students in the same grade as them. They also don't focus on not waiting in line with their friends because every student would rather not be with any student while waiting in line.

Choices:  A B C D E\nOutput: This question gives us the information that the speaker wants his cousin to stay in the new apartment even if the rent turns out to be very high. It gives us clues that what he wants most is a peaceful life when he has it.\n\n        The first clue is provided by the choice E.\n        The choice E refers to that it won't allow your going back to where you came.\n        It can be said that the person is not peaceful and not at rest when he is back to where he came since it was a place he had been forced to come to.\n        So the choice E should be eliminated so as to arrive at the final answer of choice C.\n        The choice C refers to that the speaker can't bear the idea of his cousin moving back.\n        It can also be seen that the person won't bear the idea if the high rent makes it necessary.\n        So the high rent is the answer that the speaker needs and so choice B should also be eliminated.\n\nInput: He can't believe what he saw.

{"text": "The question suggests that you must carry potatoes home in a way to avoid spillage and spoilage.\n2. The context of the question supports a method of carrying potatoes home that minimizes spillage and spoiling.\n3. We can eliminate A: grocery STORE because it's an unrelated object.  It indicates that you purchase potatoes in a grocery store, which is irrelevant to the question.\n4. We can eliminate B: grocery BAG because it suggests the opposite.  You can carry potatoes home in your grocery bag without risking spillage or spoilage, which is in opposition to the question.  Therefore, carrying potatoes home in a grocery bag is incorrect.\n5. We can eliminate C: RESTAURANTS because having potatoes ready to serve when you're at a restaurant would also cause spillage, which has already been indicated as the answer to the question so far.\n6. We can eliminate D: FARMER'S MARKET because potatoes, even though they may be grown by farmers, must obviously be brought home by grocery store customers. They must be transported after all.\n7. We can eliminate E: BUSHEL BASKET because it's not a grocery store customer but a farmer.  Furthermore, a farmer is unlikely to be carrying a farmer's vegetables from the grocery store to a restaurant! This is a non sequitir.\n8. The farmer would be much more likely to be carrying farmer's vegetable or some similar item. We've concluded that the farmer is unlikely to carry potatoes.\n9. We must therefore be a grocery customer (customer at a grocery store) and not likely to be a farmer who is carrying potatoes.\n10.

Additionally, where people generally choose to live on the earth seems to matter less, in the context of the question, than where all people generally live. \n4.

{"text": "1.'Civil' and 'Civil Action' as nouns both refer to people suing each other. In other words, civil refers to 'legal/judicial action'.\n2. 'Civil Action Instituting' is a sentence that is quite confusing, but can be rearranged to'Instituting Civil Action '. However, this sentence doesn't make sense, and so none of the other options are correct.\n3. 'Civil Actions Instituting' is also a sentence that is quite difficult to parse, but can be combined to give 'Instituting Civil Action'. In this case, 'Instituting' has been used as a'verbal' noun (meaning an 'action', in this case). The overall meaning is quite similar, but the sentence does not follow the same format as the others.\n4. 'Institute Civil Actions' is a phrase that can be used as a command (like 'Please don't eat the donuts') or as an expression of intent ('I intend to see you next week'). Therefore, it is not technically 'another phrase for instituting civil actions'.\n5. 'I don't institute any actions' doesn't make semantic or logical sense.\n6. 'Instituting Civil Actions' is perhaps the only option that is meaningfully in the same vein as 'civil action instituting', although 'instituting' is not used as a'verb' in the way that it can be in this sentence.\n\nSo the correct answer is E: protests.\n\nInput:Which of the following is not a part of the periodic table of elements?

The word 'alive' can be misleading as it can be interpreted to mean that the person has experienced life and is now dead.\n2. The first choice doesn't offer as much clarity as the others since it doesn't state that the person is only alive, that it doesn't refer to the person in the past tense, or that it has a questionable meaning.\n3. The second choice uses the phrase 'it is true that I think' so there isn't any denial of the person being alive. This allows the listener to easily understand that the person is in fact alive.\n4. However the last two choices don't convey that the person is breathing and we need to ensure that the person is not a robot or a zombie.\n5.

Choices:  a, b, c, d, e\nOutput:a:  It may be difficult to find bankers for that company.\nWhy did the company have a fund raising?  Because it needed to hire its auditors for its financial accounts, and to get all the reports from its employees.  For that, the company hired bankers to find the auditors and to look into those reports.  But the bankers told the company that they could not afford to hire an auditor for that company. So the company should go to IPO, and they will find more money.\nb:  The company may have some problem that keeps the company from borrowing money. Maybe their business is too small, or there is a scandal about their business. Those will make the company not have good results. The company has to have a fundraiser.\nc: The company may hire accountants to be their auditors, and the accountants also told them that they do not have any guarantee to sign up to be auditors.\nd: The company maybe make a loss, and they want to cover the loss. But if the company only wants to cover their own loss, they may be charged by the court, so they want to hire other companies to cover their own and those companies' expenses.\ne: The company wants to make a profit from the fund raising, and to develop its business further.\nSo", "answer": "D: more funding"}

It wasn't until the building swayed back and forth that I realized some of the people had saved themselves by jumping to the ground.\nOutput: 1) The people were supposed to be saved by jumping to the grounds.\n2) The question suggests jumping to the ground was not a viable option given the situation. It's clearly the correct answer and not the jumpers.\n3) The context seems to indicate that, before the building moved, everyone thought the building was still safe.\n4) Therefore, everyone was prepared to jump out of the building.\n5) I.e. jumpers.

So the twins had swapped babie, and the one left behind in the bed had been raised as the sister she believed she was.  But Billie was nothing but a bother to her parents.  She'd run off to live with hippies and make babies and grow crazier and crazier.  Now that her mother was dead, all that was left to do was to decide if they should tell her father that a mistake had been made. They finally did. The first thing he asked them was if Billie had had any other children.  Now, he said, it was just a matter of tracking them down and making sure they, too, got fixed, while they were still young.  But the twins both insisted they still loved Billie.  They'd never grown to hate her.  They just knew she was a nuisance.\n\n\nOutput: \n\n(1)\n\nIn this context, the word 'bother', seems to be used in a positive connotation.

In the example given, the two children who are in a horse-riding competition are using their rivalry with one another to achieve an edge against their opponents.\n3. They are looking for an advantage over their opponents by capitalizing on the fact that they are rivals.\n4. Thus, the missing element in this example is 'rivalry'.\n5.

This suggests that it was not about resilience but thrift.\n2. Her grandmother's lesson involved thrifting, as suggested by the sentence, \"It seemed to her then that her grandmother\u2019 s lesson was in the capacity of people not to have any money at all, and then to make do.\"\n3. The focus was on the capacity to'make do' with the minimal available resources.\n4. However the lesson taught was \"in the capacity of people... to make do\", not about resilience.

There is no information to suggest that 'landscape', 'east side', 'countryside', or'middle america' were all aspects of the artist's painting style.\n3: The artist's country of origin or place of birth will be irrelevant to capturing a view.  He was famous for his paintings so there is a need to narrow down the options to a specific location.  The other choices do not provide any new information that could hint at the answer.  'Georgia' indicates that there may have been some geographical focus to the paintings. This makes the choices of 'landscapes', 'east-side', 'countrymides','middle americas' uninteresting.\n4: This is the same reason why the option of 'countrysides' is eliminated.  There is no reason to rule out 'countrysids' or even 'landscapes', but the context here eliminates these options and directs us to what may have been the artist's style.\n5: The artist's painting style is not defined as his painting style for painting.

So we understand the window to be broken.\n4) The term 'he never meant to' implies that John accidentally did this and he isn't directly responsible for what happened to the window. He feels guilty about it.\n5) 'front door' refers to a location in a building and is therefore relevant. The window isn't a building but the prepositional phrase isn't relevant so we eliminate choice C.\n6) The next sentence states that John felt guilty due to the broken window and that there wasn't any kind of premeditation on his part (he never meant to).\n7) John did not want to punish himself for something he didn't mean to do and therefore this sentence suggests that it is also something that John wasn't responsible for (it wasn't his fault).\n8) 'He never meant to damage' implies that the reason John didn't want to punish himself is because he had broken the window accidentally and felt guilty about it.\n9) Since he had broken the window by mistake, we understand that the prepositional phrase is 'damage'.\n10) The final sentence suggests that John isn't responsible for the damage and he feels guilty about it all this time: He never meant to damage the window which gives us an adverb.\n11) Therefore, John is not responsible or guilty for damaging the front door but is responsible and feels guilty about damaging the window.\n12) Therefore, 'the broken window' is the correct answer to this sentence.\nSo the final choices are: front door.\n\nInput: He was afraid of what the newscaster told him.

{"text": "The answer is Choice D:  labyrinth. As a maze is made up of numerous paths that allow a person to wander through, yet never escape, the choice of labyrinth implies that all texts will take the form of a labyrinth, a maze with one path leading to freedom where freedom equals \"a place where you can communicate, such as a writing desk\". \"labyrinth\" also implies a wandering path, which is the opposite of \"written\" which means \"in a logical, step by step process\". Thus, a place to read a written passage but not to write it is thus a place to read a passage but not wander and follow the path to freedom.\n\nInput:\"It was a long wait at the shop.\". Choices: A: until their B: in the C: of the D: of their E: to their\nOutput:To have read these five sentences, you would need to follow the path in the labyrinth. To do this, you must read through the sentence before answering. We must do this because the choice is to read what, not who, or when, and it is a long wait. However, one way to ensure the correct reading of the passage is to be aware of the following: \"Shop\" in this case refers to a store, which would have its owner as the shopkeeper. So in following the path \"it\" refers to the shop, \"theirs\" refers to people involved in the business, and \"their\" refers to the actual people themselves, in which this case would be the shopkeeper, and \"wait\" refers to a short stretch of time.\n\nInput: Who does the word \"us\" refer to in the sentence: \"Molly and I are going to the concert tonight.\"?

{"text": "The question suggests that the apple tree in question is said to contain something forbidding, and the passage that came after the question was about an apple tree in the Garden of Eden.\n1. From the first sentence, we know that the apple is forbidden, which implies that something was forbidden on the tree.\n2. This could have been something that was forbidden overall or just on the part of the tree.\n3. We can conclude that an apple is forbidden, but how do we know whether it's the forbidden fruit?\n4. To answer this, we have to look at the second sentence, which tells us that this forbidden fruit was something that was forbidden on the Apple Tree in the Garden of Edo.\n5. In the second sentence, we read that the forbidden fruit was an apple. Hence answer E is the correct one.\n\nInput: Which of the following is the correct sentence structure?

{"text": "The question implies that the individual has received a gift that is not particularly common. However, the sense of 'feeling' isn't clear and thus the answer may be B: personal, D: unique, or E: rare.\n1. For personal, the phrase 'feeling as if... feels that...'could be interpreted as 'feeling as if special' or 'feeling as if unique'.\n2. For rare, the phrase 'feel like a princess' suggests that the receiver would feel special as they're going to be treated like a princess - if the gift is rare however, receiving it would feel special rather than offended/personal.\n3. For offended, the phrase 'feels offended' could be read a few different ways:\n    * That they were expecting an even more common gift, which would have made them 'feel' offended.\n    * That they received a unique gift and weren't expecting it so 'feel' off about being caught off guard.\n    * That the gift itself is so rare and valuable that it brings such a sense of awe that the individual 'feel' a sense of wonder.\n4. For unique, it implies that the individual would have felt honored/privileged/special to receive the gift whereas offended/personal carries with them a negative feeling.\n5. Therefore, C: offended and E: rare are incorrect as these meanings don't fit the context of receiving a gift that isn't particularly common.\n6. B: 'feeling that such a gift was personal' fits the context. The individual is likely to feel honored/privilege/special to receive such a gift and the fact that it wasn't a common gift would have made them feel that way. However, unlike in the D: unique question, there are no negative feelings attached. The D: unique answer therefore should be discarded.\n7.

Since the teacher is giving a negative example, I think he is telling that the only time this statement should be used is in the precise thought, because its meaning is similar to \"tell me you're ____ in that case\".\nThat in turn means only when I know we are ____ing the same exact thing/thought (i.e. I know you're ____ing) should I ever use the statement \"I know what you ____\", because otherwise, I don't know what you are _____ing and should just say that instead.\n\n#### Instruction:Answer the questions correctly based on what you think the correct answer is.\n\nQ1:  Given the context, can someone ever say \"I know what you did last sumer\"\nA1:No, the statement \"I know _____\" would never be written as \"I _____\" because in a sentence, we use the present tense when we're referring to the action taken or being taken by the subject, and we use past tense when we' re referring to the action or activity that took place in the past.\n\nQ2:  Can someone ever say \"I want to ____ as good as my brother\"?\nA2: No, you'd say I want to _____ as good as _____.

It is clear from the context that brad's breakfast meal is comprised of breakfast items.\n2. Therefore, 'wine' doesn't make sense, because we know that only drinks from an alcoholic category are 'getting drunk' and 'wine' would not be considered a beverage typically served at breakfast.\n3. Since it clearly isn't wine, we discard the answer choice options, B, C, and D.\n4.

Thus, the \u2018B\u2019 has made sense for the first two \u2018B.\u2019\nFor the third \u2018B\u2019 choice, we can infer from the context that the student can solve the assignment itself if he doesn\u2019t do it too fast.

He has made a lot of assignments for the weekend, but he never completed it fully. So if he wants to get out of school and want to take a break because he had to take too many assignments at school, the student should ask for their teacher\u2019s help.

{"text": "1 If James isn't going to stay the heat, he'll die.  This suggests that the issue is not one to simply passively cool down, but rather he has to find a way to stop losing heat.  This implies that a solution is required for the dilemma and not just passive cooling down. \n2 In the context of the situation, the word 'expand' could indicate the opposite of cooling down.  It is unlikely that there would be a mention of cooling down more quickly if another word were substituted.\n3 In the context of the sentence, the word'revenge' isn't related to cooling down more quickly. There is no relation between revenge and cooling down quickly. \n4 In the context of the question, the phrase 'find a way', the question asks for a solution.  The phrase 'find a way' only makes sense if the solution is an action rather than a passive state of being.\n5 The phrase 'expansion' does not appear anywhere in the sentence or passage other than in the question.\n6 As we have established that the word is inaccurate, the only possible answer is'relief'.  That being said, it is unlikely that the answer will be 'calm down' since calm down has to do with a mental state.  Hence, the answer cannot be calm down or relief since the situation isn't related to mental health issues.\n7 Finally, the situation is not related to the expansion of knowledge or heat.  It is not related to the slowing of a process.  It is not a word that refers to the growth of a particular thing.\nAs such, the only option that is accurate is'relief'.

This indicates that the answer to the question is to find the state in which there is fiddle music.\n6. Therefore the answer is \u2018Music\u2019 or \u2018Fiddling\u2019. The question is a metaphorical one, the answer is a state (not Alabama).  Alabama or Tennessee are not the right answer because it is too specific a reply to the question, which is vague/ambiguous in nature.\nSo the final Answer is Music Store.", "answer": "B: tennessee"}

{"text": "There is confusion regarding what exactly causes progress to slow down. In the first sentence, John and James are communicating with each other rather then moving from one point to another. So, it is more likely that progress is slowing down due to the excessive amount of communication time.\n\nThe next sentence suggests that James and John spent the majority of their time communicating. So it is unlikely that their thought patterns were slowed down. Though each sentence can be read to suggest both of those ideas, neither really makes sense in isolation.\n\nThe last sentence suggests that James and/or John's ability to transfer information may slow progress. Though this idea is included in the text, it is not a main idea as suggested in the question. The main idea is the reason that the two of them are having problems with their work.\n\nSo A: static B: progress and C: collaboration are incorrect.\n\nThe second sentence also contains a list of time periods. A: static B: thought and C: transfer of information don't really make sense in the context and don't really fit with the idea of progress being slowed down. Also, E: collaboration is used in the context of the two boys communicating with each other. So D: The first answer is correct - progress is slowed due to the amount of time they spend talking to each other.\n\nInput:The time required to communicate slow the what? Choices: A: progress B: thought of thought C: transfer of information E F: collaboration\nOutput:It is quite probable that the cause of progress slowing down is that the communicating takes up a substantial amount of time. This is made clear by the next sentence.\n\nThe next sentences imply that James and John spent most of their time in communication. This suggests a possibility that their thought patterns have slowed down.\n\nHowever, the next sentence suggests that the two of them spend the majority of their time in communication which is not necessarily the case.\n\nSo it is unlikely that their individual thought patterns slowed down. The idea of the two of them talking to each other makes more sense in terms of slowed progress.\n\nThe second half of the question also supports the idea that the cause of progress to slow down and the question suggests a possible reason. The phrase 'transfer information' makes it seem more likely that their communication is slowing down progress than the 'thought processes'.\n\nSo the last part of that sentence", "answer": "C: progress"}

For example:\n\nif (the student's score < 70%){\n  the teacher can fail the student\n}else(\n  the teacher can pass the student\n)\n\nBecause the function gets questions as arguments and must make a decision based on your rules:\n\nyou'll pass in an array containing questions.\n\nYou will then make a decision based on each question based on if/else statements and then print an answer based on the rules you defined.\n\nWhen you call the function with an array, you will get an answer string.\n\nTo call this function, you will use the createAnAnswerFunction function.\n\n# Question 5:\n\nimport String\ndef answer(questions):\n    \n    # Your code here...\n    \n# Usage: CreateAnAnswerFunction(questions)\n# Instructions:\n#  Create a new function called answer that takes an array of questions as an argument\n# and prints an answer based on the type of question asked.\n# If the first argument to the function is an array, then the function should do a for loop through the array for each question and return a string of answers based on that first argument", "answer": "C: improved health"}

Choices:  A. cost-based B. cost-plus C. costless D. cost-conscious E. cost-based-plus\nOutput: 1.) First of all, we are talking about selling gasoline. \nThe question asks us to decide between choices \"A\" and \"E.\"\nChoice A says \"cost-based\", which means it is based on \"the cost to make it.\"\nA) The gas station owners can't afford to give out \"free gas\" because they are already paying people to pump it as well as the fuel it needs to run.\n\nHence, \"cost-less\" does not make any sense when selling gasoline.\nB.) \"Cost-plus\" means that the station owners pay, for example, $10 per gallon in order to give the customer $5 less (a profit of $5).\nTherefore, \"cost-plus\" is also out.\n\nC.) \"Cost-conscious\" is not a \"what?\" because it does not refer to the price of gasoline.\n\nD.) There is no \"cost-based-plus.\" So there are four choices left.\n\nE.) \"Cost-based\" makes sense when selling gas because \"cost is what we pay to pump it.\"\nCost is also the price.

In the given sentence the speaker appreciates the positive effect the listener has on their work.  This implies that the attentive listener has improved how he presented himself and has achieved superior results.\n2. As the 'attentive listener' is compared to the 'way you are presenting yourself' in the given sentence, so 'listening' should be taken into consideration.\n3. The sentence suggests that the positive improvement on the listener's work is directly related to the listening.  It also indicates that 'thinking','speaking,' and 'writing' are not related to the listening, so these three options may be excluded.\n4. In terms of the listening and the positive effects it has on the presentation and the results, which includes the quality of the work, listening implies 'attentiveness,' which is not related to the given context.\n5. The key to answering the question is that the given sentence only makes use of 'listening' as a tool to enhance the work.\n6.

{"text": "1: thin glass breaks easily/2 shatters easily/3: thin glass breaks easily\n4: thin glass melt easily\n5: thin glass does not melt easily\n6. As discussed before, the question is discussing a characteristic of \"thin glass\" and not a glass in general. This tells us that thin glass means a specific kind of glass, like the thinnest possible glass.\n7. It is easy to see that thin glass can shatter since it is paper-thin. The question refers to thin glass \"breaking\" and not \"shattering\" to avoid the confusion of using the two words interchangeably despite their distinct meanings.\n8. Given this context, it becomes clear that \"thin glass breaks easily\" is the correct choice.  The choice \"thin glass shatters easily\" may at first seem correct as it is a synonym for the original sentence, but the question is asking for the characteristic of a specific kind of glass.\nHence, the answer is 11, but I hope I got all points for the answer D.\n\nInput:What would be an undesirable trait for someone in a position of high authority?

Next, we have to eliminate B: a liar as the answer to the question.  Even as someone of high authority, a liar is unreliable and thus not suitable.\n3. The same goes for A: a coward.  The person of high authority should be brave and not a coward. 4. We can also eliminate C:a thief since it is undesirable for people of authority to steal or keep money that doesn't belong to them.\n5. Even if it had been C: a thief which was an unsuitable trait for someone in a high position of authority, the answer to the question would be that ALL of the above (A, B, and C) are undesirable traits.\n6.

{"text": "A. First, the question asks us to categorize people into which two categories.\nB. Next, the text suggests that John is a competitive person who was able to dividing his opponents into groups.\nC. This implies that John was not the type of person who would put others into groups to determine whether they would be considered winners or losers.  Thus, (C) is not a viable option.\nD. Next, the phrase 'the type of person who would divide his opponents into groups to determine whether he or she would be considered a winner or a loser\" suggests that John would indeed divide opponents into winners and losers.  Thus (B) is a viable option. \n\nE. Finally, the text suggests that, having divided his opponents into categories, John was somehow able to decide which of the two categories a person may be in by performing some action.  However, nowhere does it state what the nature of these two groups are.  We know that John likes being able to tell opponents apart from his winnings, but having decided from what category a person is, does not necessarily tell us what kind of person that person is.

Choices: A: sorrowful B: desirous C: wretched D: grief-stricken E: distraught\nOutput:1. The word 'desirous' has a similar meaning to the word 'inconsolable' because both concepts describe a longing for something one cannot currently have or achieve in the present. However, 'desirous' typically suggests that the person wants to have something, whereas 'inconsolable', while often used to refer to an impossible goal, may also refer to a person who does not care whether he achieves or fails at the goal, as long as he does not achieve it.\n2. In the case of the man's lawyer who was speaking of his client, he probably intended for the meaning of 'consolable' to be closer to the concept of the person caring whether he achieved the impossible goal or not, rather than the person not caring about the goal at all.  In this case, the connotation of the man's client being 'inconsolable of failing' at his impossible goal is most likely, rather than simply feeling 'despair' at the impossible goal, and for this reason, it is likely that the man's lawyer was referring to this connotation when using the word 'inconsoleable'.\n3.

The question states that, because the business is in the retail sector with the aim to sell, the business will be looking for ways to maximize its number of customers or potential customers.\n3. The word'maximize' indicates that there is no absolute limit as to where the business would be in the search for potential customers. This means that the business can build anywhere and everywhere.\n4. The word 'customers' could also be 'consumers' or 'bargain hunters' and they can be found anywhere. Therefore, 'Idaho' is the best answer for the question because there is nothing to suggest that potential customers will only be found in a big city or in a town.\n5. There are no suggestions, implications, inferences, or indications that potential customers should only be found in 'big cities' or 'in towns.'\n6. 'D: in town' does not answer the question but makes a new question.\n7. Hence, the answer is 'Idaho'", "answer": "C: big city"}

{"text": "1. After driving car, there are several things that could happen that do not involve pain.\n2. The question suggests that the list of possible outcomes should not include: A: automobile accents and B: car crash\n3. The phrase 'what could happen after driving car' implies that there are many things that might happen.\n4. The word 'pain' is used, which clearly identifies a negative result. Therefore, the possibilities should not include any negative outcomes.\n5. However, the word 'outcome' implies that there are possible, positive results as well,  and the word 'could' leaves room for interpretation.\n6. Thus, the possibilities should include negative and positive outcomes and the possibility of a combination of both.\n7. However, the wording of the question suggests that the only negative outcome is 'pain' and the only positive outcome is 'getting a tan', both of which are irrelevant suggestions.\n8. Therefore, the correct answer is 'getting tired', which is a logical conclusion to driving long distance in a vehicle.\nSo the final outcome was D: getting tired", "answer": "D: getting tired"}

Choices: A: lame B: half-hearted C: impotent D: limp-wristed E: feeble\nOutput: 1 - The most accurate description of the professor's explanation is \"lame\" which means weak 2 - Lame and limp-wrist imply weakness, which is not always negative in some circumstances\n3. \"Limp-wrist\" does not make sense given the context, but \"impotent\" could have been used to refer to something sexual, however, this is not mentioned in the sentence, so the answer cannot be A: impotent 4 - \"Half-hearted\" could potentially fit, however, it is also not mentioned in the sentence which weakens its accuracy 5 - \"Feebly\" or \"feeble\" could have been used, however \"feebly\" is not mentioned in the question (this is not a correct answer).\n6- \"Weak\" would probably be the most accurate description, as it also does not mention \"feeble\" (this is also an accurate answer).", "answer": "B: heretical"}

From these two elements, the person would not be able to 'play' without practice or dexterity.\n3. However, this does not necessarily mean that the person does not have idle time or knowledge of music.\n4. The idleness may have occurred only before or outside playing the music, and not during playing.\n5. Also, knowledge of music depends on more than just fiddling with the music book, and so that may not really be a factor.\n6. However, since this is followed by a question about practice, the person may not be playing because he/she doesn't have dexterity, since it is mentioned much before.\n7.

{"text": "John received no punishment or prison time for his crime despite getting caught.  As he was caught red-handed, one might expect a prison sentence.

John would suffer the guilt of committing a crime and being innocent at the same time.\n\nInput: Someone who has lost all hope can be considered what? Choices: A: miserable B: melancholy C: cheerful D: cheerless E: hopeless\nOutput: Since cheerful implies 'pleasant' and cheerless implies 'displeasing', \"cheerful\" and \"cheerless\" would be equally applicable.  There are also two other possible definitions: 1. A person without hope is hopeless by definition and 2. A person with no hope has lost hope by definition.\n\nIn the case of \"all hope is lost\", it is quite certain that the individual has lost hope and is therefore hopeless.\n\nI have seen at least one version of the rhetorical device where \"without hope\" is replaced by \"not happy\".

You pick up a straw by its end, which would imply that it is the last straw.\nFor example, if someone broke into your home, you would get up quickly to the sound of one last straw breaking and see someone with a sack over his shoulder running past your window, in which case, you would know that they were the \"last straw\".

{"text": "The dictionary is being compared with other objects, therefore, a 'dictionary while you're using' would indicate that 'it' is being used.\n6.

The context indicates that it is not likely to be kept with library or study area because they are destinations, while table and classroom are objects.\n7. The question is looking for a table or the classroom. Here, it can be any surface. This answer is wrong because a book is meant to be put on a surface and dictionary is a book made up of words and is used for reference which means the dictionary can be put on a shelf or a bookcase.\n8. The answer is therefore a 'table'. The context indicates that 'table' is the best answer because 'where' is the primary term (predicate) while 'dictionary' is the secondary term (object).\nOutput:  Answer 'D' refers to the adjective - antonym which describes the opposite of the subject word to put in the blank space. In such questions, the adjective and the noun are related but not inter-connected. Therefore, it's possible to reverse the order and change the answer too. In other words - 'noun in' or 'nouns are' in can be replaced with 'adjectives are'.\nSo we would need an adjective that describes the opposite of a dictionary.\nIn this context, 'not detailed' and 'lacking detail' is a synonym that describes an opposite meaning. The choice 'C: complete' is incorrect because it's a part of the subject and hence, no different from a dictionary. The choice 'A: classroom' is erroneous as well because it's not related to the question.\nTherefore, the correct answer is 'lacking detail'.\n\nOutput:\nAs 'A' means first and 'B' means subsequent, the first alphabet of the answer has to be placed first.

This may be absurd, but stewed beans are actually called \"beans in a bowl.\"  I don't think that's worth selling your mom for, and thus would be an unsuccessful answer.  D could be an answer, as it is closer to the value of his mother, but it is unambiguously not a \"bowl of stew.\"\nSo let's go to B, the only remaining answer; it's not that absurd, and the fact that that there's no number given seems irrelevant.

Choices:  history studies A: studying of history B: study of the study C: study of the subject D: study of the student E: study of himself\nOutput: The first sentence in this excerpt is the same sentence we analyzed in part 61. When we analyze it, however, we realize that the subject is in fact History studies (not Math, as we were expecting). So we focus on the next sentence, which tells us that History studies is indeed his favorite subject. Therefore, he likes studying history.\nSo the final choice (option) is: D: study of the subject\n\nOutput: Choice A: studying of history  would be a good answer if the author had said, for example, \"He started reading History studies\" in order to suggest that he was studying the subject. However, he did not make any such statement.\nChoice B: study of the studies is completely unrelated to the text: one cannot study the subject of History studies.\nChoice C: study of the study would be correct if he had said that he likes studying the study of History studies, but he did not. Once again, we can look at the text, \"His favorite subject is History studies\" to understand what he is studying: History!\nChoice D: study of the students means that the author is studying people, which is not true, since he stated that History", "answer": "B: history studies"}

{"text": "The text states, \"...he sat quietly, watching the twilight turn to darkness outside the window\".\n1.The paragraph talks about the traveller who sat and waited for a long time after a long day of travelling.\n2. The word used in this context is the \"long\" and \"longer travel\".\n3. Thus, after a long day of journey, travellers usually get tired and sick.\n4. This is the main clue, jet lag is not included in the context of the sentence, therefore the answer is E: fatigue.\n\nInput:The doctor told her,  \u201cIt is inevitable; there is nothing that you can do.\u201d Her response was something akin to, Choices: A. \u201cI don't care.\u201d B. \u201cYou have no business making prognostications.\u201d C. \u201cBut I am not ready to die.\u201d\n D. \u201cNot if I have something to say about it.\u201d E. \u201cYou have to listen to me for a minute.\u201d Output:The context of the paragraph is the doctor who told the patient that her condition is inevitable.

However, only two choice words are appropriate to match with the remaining sentence,  \u201cNot if I have  something to say about it\u201d  and  \u201d You have to listen to me..\u201d \n3. Although all four words have the same meaning and  can be used to match the above sentence, but only D: \"Not if I have something... \" can be used to complete the sentence (it is the most suitable choice to match with the sentence which is to say 'not if I have something to argue about this...').\n\n### Suggestions\n1.

{"text": "In this context, since you are waiting for your transport to arrive (train), you could certainly be reading a magazine. However, you could also be reading a book.

Choices:  A:\"generous\" has two meanings. One meaning is that the present tense is correct. The other meaning is that the past tense is correct. B:\"generous\" is an adjective and there is only one meaning \"so kind / extravagant\". C:\"generous\" means \"so kind\". D:\"generous\" is used as an adjective.\nOutput:\nA: \"generous\" is used adverbially, as an intensifier of \"kind\". This is why 'it was extravagant'.\n\nB: In this context, the word 'kind' means \"friendly\", \"helpful\". Hence, \"kind\" is an attribute modifier of the noun \"lessons\". Thus, this sentence is inappropriate as the word 'generous' is an adjective which modifies the noun 'lessons' and means \"generous\", whereas \"free\" is an adjective which means \"not costing money\".\n\nC: \"so kind\" would mean the noun, but here the word \"kind\" has the modifier \"so\" which limits it to \"extravagant\", and thus, the sentence would mean \"I went to the library  to read for free\".\n\nD: The dictionary shows that \"generous\" can be used as an adjective with its positive sense \"so kind\"; in context it also has its negative sense of \"unnecessary\". Since the word \"unnecessary\" is not given as an option, this sentence is incorrect.\nThus, the only correct sentence is A: \"The forty-five minutes' worth of free lessons were generous\".\n\nInput:Everybody was staring at Tom, with a disgusted face as if the sight of him made one almost throw up.

No. Why would the police be force opening doors??\nIt is obvious that force opening doors, for some random reason that they must help the ambulance to enter and leave the scene of the accident. Choices A and B are thus incorrect. 5. They want to clear traffic because there is an accident on their way. 6. Thus, they want to help, and force open door to help the ambulance. The option C: helped was the correct answer.\n\nInput: The policewoman knew the victim, but who would know her as well? Choices: A: the criminal B: the witness C: the ambulance D: the criminal's lawyer E: the victim's lawyer\nOutput: The policewoman knows a witness and a victim. But, who else will know the victim and also the witness? There are only two options: 1. The victim's lawyer\n2. The criminal's lawyer 3. It seems to be a strange fact but it is true that the criminal's lawyer knows the victim, the witness and knows also the victim's lawyer.\nIt seems a bit tricky but this was a tricky statement. We just need to understand that, the victim's lawyer knows the criminal and knows the criminal's lawyer. Thus, the criminal's lawyer too knows the victim, the criminal and the victim's lawyer as he is the lawyer for the victim against the criminal (victim=criminal and the lawyer=criminal's lawyer). Thus, the criminal' law would know also the victim's attorney. It seems a bit confusing but we just need to grasp the situation properly and we will get the correct answer. 5. It is true that as the victim's lawyer is also a part of the victim or in other words the criminal, so his client knows also the criminal. 6. Thus The criminal's lawyer knows also the victim' lawyer and is also a part of his client or vice versa. 7. Hence the criminal's lawyer also knows the victim's lawyer or", "answer": "A: hurry along"}
{"text": "1) The question gives the context that the performers are on a platform in public, likely because of the way they are performing.\n2) The context implies that a concert hall is the place where you would find a public performance\n3) Given the context, it is most unlikely that performers would be on a dock, platform, or building given the public nature of their performance.\n4) As they would be on a platform in public to perform, it makes sense for them to be in a concert hall.\n5.

A great dance can be a life-changing experience, but it is by no means a universal cure for such ailments as what? choices:  A: anemia B: headache C: hunger D: loneliness E: boredom\nOutput: 1) We can see from this example sentence that if a person attends a dance impulsively, there is no guarantee that he will \"enjoy himself\". 2) Hence, attending a dance on a whim can turn out to be a huge waste of time for the person.\n3) However, if the dance is a good one, it could turn out to be a life-changer.\n4) Therefore, the correct option would be the last one, 'life-changer'.\nThe sentence says the opposite of \"life-changing experience\" and since \"life changing experience\" implies \"happy outcome\", as the opposite of it, \"negative outcome\" is the answer.\n\nInput:\"You're not going to a bar for a drink!

Choices:  A:(they/it)  B:It (they)  C:It  (they)  D:It  D:It  E:(It/They)\nOutput:  The word \"interface\" indicates that the software requires users to directly communicate with it.\n1 The word \u201crequire\u201d implies that users are not able to communicate with the software if they do not, in fact, learn how to \"interface\" or directly communicate with it. However, the question \"may\" suggests that, though the software may require interaction, it may not be a direct interaction.\n2 The fact that the software may require users to interact indicates that the users will need to do something in order to interact, thus suggesting the correct answer is either A: \"users will need to learn how to interface\" or B: \"users will need learn to interface with it\".\n3 If users must learn how to interface to interact with the software, then the software may, in fact, be in need of upgrades in order to allow users to interact in such a way, implying that the answer to the question \"may require users learn how to interface the new computer software\" is C: \"may require\" users \"to learn how to interface\" the updated software.\n\nInput:A lot of people think they are not a lot.

She would have been pleased to have learned the full truth, but was glad to know what it was she did know. She was what?

There is no reason to discount opera (C) and theater (D), as these could be large cultural events as well. \n4) Furthermore, the inclusion of 'lecture hall' (E) implies an academic or higher education setting. The mention of a \"lecture hall\" does not indicate whether the lecture and the seat both take place in the lecture hall, or another setting altogether.

This suggests that if something happened later that resulted in rescheduling, it was an injury or beauty-related thing.\n4: The text says that an injury or beauty- related thing would probably result in a late or mistakes appointment.

The word 'park' would similarly refer to a location or 'away' from animals within said location.\n4. Finally, the word 'away' implies that 'away' is the correct choice.

The basement is part of the foundation.\n3) We don't want the building to collapse if it falls through the window, we could be seriously injured.\n4) If an object falls through the window and into the attic, then it will fall through the floor because it is connected to the foundation and there isn't anything between the floor and the foundations.\n5) We don't ever want a home to collapse, so having a solid foundation is very important. The question is referring to not having a collapsed foundation.\n6) This means we always have to check that the floor, the walls, the attic, and the basement are safe and strong enough to prevent collapse.\n7) Therefore, the right answer will be either A. the floors, because we don't want our home to be unsafe. A home needs to have safe floors.\n8) Or B. the walls, because we don' see much damage that can be done to a home through the walls.

It was the one place left undiscovered. What's this place? Choices: 1) A: museum 2) A: home 3) B: strange 4) C: quiet 5) D: perfect 6) E: perfect for kids\nOutput: 1) A doesn't work.  It's not a museum, a home, or even a building.  Perhaps a museum would work, if you defined'museum' to include 'all buildings including houses'.\n2) Home is not a particularly quiet place, and wouldn't be a 'quiet place'.  It's also the wrong direction from the given text ('quiet & perfect setting...' should be understood as 'loud & busy city...'\n3) Strange seems like a good possibility, but the wrong type of strange to describe a museum.\n4) Quiet is definitely something that fits the description of 'perfect'.\n5) Even though Perfect for Kids could fit the description of 'perfection,' the author never said the place is perfect.\n6)Perfect for kids is definitely something that would be great, but is not necessarily 'perfect'.\nThe only answer that makes sense is B: Strange place.\nSo the final choice is B: Strange Place\n\nInput:The town was very poor, with lots of poor people, but that was all right, it was nice to be able to help.

Examinative is related with examination, it is not clear what the focus of the answer is.\n2. Careful is used to define carefulness, which is already covered by careful in the question. \n3. Intricate only suggests that it is difficult to choose which examination is more difficult to take care.\n4. However it is likely for the answer to be a thorough, because the question wants which examination will be more thorough to do rather than what examination will be more difficult.\n5. Thoughtfulness is also the answer given in the input.\n6. Because thoughtfulness should be applied or related with examinative, not examination when the question means which examination is more thoughtful. Therefore, B and D are eliminated.\n7. 'Careful' and 'thoughtful' is a synonym for thorough, so if we chose among thorough, thoughtful and thoughtful, it would be unambiguous.

This option may be valuable but is not possible to gain by living life fully. Option C suggests that they would have experienced happiness which is different from feeling joy. Finally, option E says that living life fully can lead to adventures which is not the same as living life fully.

They will be violent if not punished.\nOutput:  They were going to act violently if punishment did not happen.  We do not know how the children may react if punished.  Their nature is unknown. This suggests that we should take the children's violent actions as a given, but we should be concerned about the adult's response.\nThe sentence is describing the response to the child's violent reaction. We know that the children will have a violent reaction, but we don't know if their violencia will affect the adult's. This suggests that we can infer that the adult's reaction will be similar to the child's reaction, given that the child has been punished.\nThe adult's reaction is not described as violent, but we do know that they have not yet been punish.\nWe can reason that the adult's actions could be violent, even with the adult not yet punished.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E: They will be violent if punishment does not occur.\n\n\nInput: The sun shone out of a clear blue sky.

Choices:  a: artists b: singers c: clowns d: dancers e: teachers f: doctors\nOutput:The question asks the meaning of the phrase \"in town\".It means in the same town, which suggests that the people in the text are travelling around the town.They are travelling and not resident in the town.From this, we can safely assume that the people being questioned were travellers.From the other answers", "answer": "C: police station"}
{"text": "The word \"all\" in this sentence can mean either \"all\", or that the sentence is saying that the only rooms that fit this description are from outside.

It was a shock to him. Choices: A: him B: it C: the next D. a moment\n\nOutput: A: shock or B:glimpse are the most probable elements that were observed.  However the wording \u201cHe got a glimpse\u201d has no context, so it cannot be B:glimpse.  Therefore we say - the glimpse of the white person was a shock to him\n\nInput: I'm a good actress.Choices:  a) good actress b) good enough actress c) A good one\nOutput: It doesn't say whether the context is I'm a good one or A good one, therefore can be both.

They d) My teacher I got this question wrong but in the answer, it says the answer should be \"c) My teacher\" but that doesn't make any sense!\nOutput: This question can't be C, because you're talking about the \"that person\".  This means you have to be thinking about the person, you're not.  Also, there is no way the person can be \"She\" (the name of your boss/teacher?) as \"a teacher\" is the subject and \"a person\" in the same sentence is incorrect grammar.\n\nInput: Is this our bus?

{"text": "The word \"model\" implies that these are typically attractive to normal people. Hence, they will attract attention because of how beautiful they appear.

{"text": "C. Run suggests motion.\n\nA1. If John had been \"full of fear,\" his body would be affected by fear and the effects of fear would show up on the body.\n\nA2. The question asks for the effect and not the cause.\n\nA3. \"Running\" suggests that fear produced an effect or a reaction on his body, but it does not explain exactly what is the effect.\n\nA4. If John had been full of fear, he would urinate.\n\nA5. If John had been, full of fear, he might fight his enemy, and in the fight he might get injured.\n\nA6. If John had full of fear, he will become tense, with his heartbeat and blood pressure increasing.\n\nA7. If fear produced an effect or reaction on his body, it will show up on his body, such as perspiring or shaking, which suggests that someone would be 'wet' after being full of fear.\n\nTherefore answer is C. Wet\nThe correct answer is \"run\" because it is the ONLY verb in the sentence which has present tense. \"Full\" requires the present tense and the body must have a change in the present and that would produce the result that would allow him to run, but that result does not produce a noun or adjective that requires the present tense. In other words, the sentence suggests he's running from fear. You should never have to use the present or past tense if the given tense fits what the sentence is trying to say.\n\nInput: The man who can't swallow pebbles shouldn't go near the sea.

This is an example of'stereotypical' behaviour.\n\nInput: She is quite adequate at what she what Choices:  Answers may vary. B: does  C: does not D: does E: does not\nOutput: B: does\nHer adequacy is already suggested by her skills: she is quite adequate. So while she does what she has to do, she lacks whatever 'it' is. If anything, her adequacy is understated.\n\nInput: If he were an honest man he wouldn't say something like that.  The statement is quite obviously not true Choices:  An answers may vary. B: false C: not D: untrue E: unsubstantiated\nOutput: C: not\nThe statement is not false; it's just not true.\n\nInput: The committee consisted of five members, four of whom are men. Choices:  A. all six members are women B. at least four of the members are women C.  At least five of the members are men D. All of the members are women E. At most four of the members are men\nOutput: C: All of the members are men.\nI guess the best answer is that although all six members are listed, it doesn't say how many women are among them. This is implied to be five. The sentence says that 'at least four' are men. This suggests that even if there happen to be more than five, 'at least' four are men.\n\nInput: He is a hardworking man, his work is always done with accuracy and diligence. Choices:  An answer may vary. B: diligence C: accuracy D: dedication E: industriousness\nOutput: B: diligence\nWe can conclude that because he is hardworking, he isn't careless: his work is always done correctly.\n\nInput: It was a bright sunny day, she knew this because the sun was shining Choices:  An option may vary.

{"text": "1) 'Invitro reproduction' is a new term to the English language, which shows in the text that it is an advanced topic.\n2) A is the correct answer: The term 'Invitro reproducing' is introduced. This suggests that it is necessary in circumstances where there is a problem of reproduction, e.g. infertility or when there is no proper means to reproduce, e.g. inability to get a partner.\n\nSo the final answer: A: problems\n\nInput:The young couple had always talked about starting a family, even during courtship.  However, there were always one or the other of them coming down with some new malady or the other.  This may have been the reason for their lack of success in becoming parents.\nOutput:1. 'Lack of success in becoming parents' in the context of the rest of the text means not conceiving or bearing a child because of various reasons.\n2. A and B are incorrect because 'becoming parents' refers to becoming parents by biological means (i.e. natural birth).\n3. C is incorrect because 'infertility' is defined as 'the inability to have children'.\n4. This is because the text does not convey 'failure to reproduce' is being referred to instead. For example, the text states that \"One reason for their lack of children could have been their lack of success in conceiving or in getting pregnant, but this is not being referred to in the context of 'infertility.'\n5. This is because there is a mention of \"starting a family\" in context with \"courtship\".\n6. Hence,'starting a family' refers to adopting a child.\n7. Concluding it is, then, D: adopting a child. Which is correct.\n\nInput:The doctor told the patient that he was a candidate for the new revolutionary test for colon cancer, though that it had not yet been approved by the government.

A: the new food supplement was for only a few days. 2. B: few days. 3. C. The Food Supplements were amazing. 4. D: The Amazing food supplement were for only few days. E: Only a few days.\nOutput: This sentence suggests that new food supplements became \"amazing\" after a few days, but then the effects wore off, making it clear that the food supplements' effects were not lasting.\n\n6. The second half of this sentence uses the word \"for\" which implies that the supplements were \"for\" or \"only\" for a \"few days.\"\n7. Based on the evidence provided by the sentence, it suggests that some effects only lasted for a \"few\" days.\n8. Based on the context and the provided evidence, answers \"A&B\" are incorrect as the food supplements are not only for a few days or 'effects' last for 'few' days.\n9. Answer \"C\", however, is wrong because the claim that \"The Food Supplements were Amazing\" does not answer how long the effects last.\n\n10. Answer \"C\", therefore, is not correct as it implies that The Food Supplements alone had Amazing effects, regardless of when those effects lasted.\n\n11. Lastly, the sentence ends with the fact that the supplements' effects only lasted 'for' or 'a few' days, suggesting that while the supplements were effective early, they had a diminishing or fading effect.\n12. \"Answer\" E: \"Only few days\" is the correct answer to this question\n\nInput: Sally's friend was having a hard time accepting her", "answer": "C: remarkable"}

{"text": "The opposite of foolhardy is discreet. The words foolhardy and discreet are antonyms. Antonyms are words that are opposites of each other. The antonym of foolhardy is not cautious because the meaning of cautious is carefully considering something or someone.\n\nInput: She had a cautious nature. Choices:  A cautious person always seeks the truth.\nB: He was extremely careful.\nC: Their thoughts were careful and correct.\nD: Cautious students must show great diligence.\nE: He was not careless.\nOutput: Choice A is correct. Cautious refers to a feeling of being careful or worried.

Choices:  Some examples of antonyms are clever/stupid, large/small, young/old, careful/wary, fast/slow.\nOutput: The words \"careful\" and \"wary\" are antonyms because careful means \"thoughtful, attentive and concerned\" and wary means \"anxious, fearful, suspicious and reserved.\" Antonyms provide contrast. A synonym is a word or phrase that basically means the same thing as another word or phrase. For example, big means large and small means tiny or very small.\n\nInput: What word is an antonym for \"gullible\"? Choices: A: cunning\nB: cautious\nC: suspicious\nD: skeptical\nE: careful\nOutput: There are a number of different antonyms. An antonym is a word which is exactly the opposite in meaning of another word. For example, hot and cold are antonyms, because they mean the opposite in terms of temperature. Another pair of antonyms is \"quick and slow\"; since quick is fast and slow is slow; they are the opposite in meaning. The antonym for \"careful\" is \"careless\" and the antonym for \"cautious\" is also \"careless,\" but with a different sense. It is sometimes important to be careful, because if a person is careless, he/she runs the risk", "answer": "A: thoughtful"}
{"text": "A\nIf you look in a dictionary, you will learn about 'line' as something that consists of a set of people in a particular order, either standing or moving along a single unbroken course. This means that a group of people standing in line would be in a particular order.\nHowever, a group of people standing at a water fountain or a school bus stop are not necessarily standing in a particular order - the person standing beside you does not have to follow an unbroken course.\nTherefore, the only correct answer is: the people are standing on a line near the road.\n\nInput:The city is large and the streets are dangerous, and you don't want to get lost when you are out for your walk with your dog, so your husband decided to take charge and walk you home.

{"text": "1: The sentence 'Danny hated helping other people' suggests that Danny is not a person that tends to feel good about helping.\n2. This feeling could either be an underlying attitude that Danny has, or it could be situational.\n3. The text suggests it could be situational, and so the focus is on finding the cause of Danny feeling negative towards helping people.\n4. The text suggests no single cause of the unwillingness to help, but rather a combination of them.\n5. Although there are many possible combinations, the text hints that some of the possible causes are not very nice.\n6. Given this context, a person who hates helping people can't be satisfied, can't feel good about themselves, can't feel complications, and can't be stressed.\n7. These can only refer to a feeling when the result of an action is negative, for example, it can't refer to satisfaction from just doing a good deed.\n8. So the combination that fits best is Danny hating the actions of helping and the result of doing so.\n9. Because 'hating helping' implies an attitude or an underlying feeling that hates helping people, Danny also hates helping himself.\n10. But the negative feelings that Danny experiences are also because of helping, the feeling of 'helping people' is one of the causes that Danny dislikes as mentioned.\n11.

{"text": "1st, the last line of text is \"Where is there usually a fiddler playing?\"\n2. The word \"there\" may refer to locations which house performances of fiddlers, as in a \"fiddler's hall\".\n3. Alternatively, it may refer to locations where, traditionally, fiddlers have congregated for performances, as in \"Tennessee, (home to) The Grand Old Opry (where fiddlers traditionally played).\"\n4. \"Playing\", in the phrasal form of \"playing\" used in the prompt, does not necessarily mean playing music.\n5. It may refer to fiddlers playing with skill or dexterity\n6. \"Fiddle playing\" would then refer to any fiddler performing a skillful piece of music.\n7. \"Fiddler playing\" would then refer any fiddler in a setting where he or she is playing a skillful piece.\n8. Hence, the sentence could be referring to the locations mentioned in choices A and B, or it could be referring to the performance mentioned in choice C.\n9. While it is correct to say that \"fiddlers generally play music\" (cf. choices A and B), the prompt does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that fiddlers are always found \"in a music store, or a dance hall.\"\n10.

Drugs can also cause addiction or dependence, especially if they are bad for the body. \n2. The choice of the word \"damage\" is clearly appropriate as drugs are not benign substances but can do damage to the brain and body.  \n3. This choice is in the context that drug-affected people can be \"crazy\" rather than the \"cloudy mind\" of answer B.\n4. Drugs clearly damage people and add to mental illnesses. Therefore answer A: damage is correct.\n\nInput: If you need help finding an apartment, ask a friend before you go apartment hunting. Choices:  A. help find an apartment  B. find an apartment.  C. need help finding D. help E: be found\nOutput: 1) The meaning of the sentence suggests that finding an apartment could be done successfully without help, but would be more difficult. Hence it needs this help to do effectively.\n2) The verb 'help finding' is more suitable as finding an apartment is difficult to do. Therefore it can benefit greatly from help finding.\n3) Furthermore, 'finding an apartment' is a single, specific action, unlike 'finding' which is usually a much vaguer verb, such as \"find an object that\".\n4) Answer 'help find an apartment' is ungrammatical English. It is also difficult to understand. This would cause confusion.\nTherefore, the correct answer is answer C: need help finding.\nThe word \"help\" means to assist (as a person who has trouble) in doing something.\n\nInput: What does the word \"womanhood\" mean?

But this is not the same as taking a test to get knowledge or skills or just for the fun of it.\n\n4 Attending school to avoid boredom or to avoid colds and flu seem odd. The questioner would have to be forced into attending class for such reasons.\n\n5 The last option, A spending time, is not a good answer choice. The questioner is not wondering why he should spend time in school, rather, he is wondering what the point of going to class would be. \n\nSo the final answer choice is B: boredom.\n\nInput:Can I use the last hour of my shift to help close down at the store?

There isn't an 'X', or \"in comparison to\", \"when compared to\", or any other phrasing suggesting a comparison between people.\nThere is no mention of the person compared being \"well educated\" versus another person being \"uneducated\".\nHence, the missing element is something.\n7. This statement doesn't suggest that the person who is \"well educated\" is \"illiterate\".\n8. Similarly, the statement doesn't imply that being \"well educated\" means \"owning a house\" or \"having enough food\".\n9. The context also indicates that the term \"well educated\" is used as a noun as it appears on its own.\n10. This indicates that instead of 'has enough food', 'owns a house' or any other word, 'well educated' is a replacement for something but is not being compared to anything.\n11. Therefore, the missing element is \"something\". The statement is looking for a thing that can be used in place of \"well educated\".\n12.

Secondly, it can be inferred from the context that the president was under attack by his 'enemy,' the choices imply that.\n3. Thirdly, 'wage,' 'fight,' and 'kill' are synonyms with 'decision,' 'enemy,' and 'attack,' respectively, as 'waging war,' 'fighting,' and 'a decision in battle' imply fighting an enemy in war.\n4. Thus, the choices do not convey what would have been the president's decision.\n5. In other words, by giving a choice of 'decision' and 'attack,' the author has not mentioned what the president did, i.e., the choice of 'what' is not enough for a reader to know the options for the president's action in this context.

'A befall' suggests falling or some other type of impact, yet suffering may lead to joy or hope rather than 'falling'.\n5.

It is possible that joy caused by suffering would be a joyful 'befall' (such as joy after an apology or a happy surprise).\n6. 'What can the cause of suffering befall?' is also ambiguous, as a 'befall' can be an impact (such as falling) or a cause (such as a feeling of guilt).\n7.

C has sandwiches in it as a possible container and D has butter and jelly.\n13. If I didn't want the whole block of peanut butter, what would I get it in? C: A sandwich can have whatever you want, and it's made to order. If you get a peanut buttered sandwich, I would not want it in a jar - a sandwich is made to order and not always predictable.\n15.

The next sentence shows how she felt after she arrived. She felt not happy and told the writer that she felt betrayed. It shows that the woman felt betrayed.\n3.) Since she arrived, went to an office, and found a way there on her own, she should not have felt betrayed. That means Choice B is correct. The missing element is feelings of betrayal.

So, as there were no chares that were not full of people, the man is refusing to sit down - 'to sit' means 'to accept a place' and so 'to sit down' means 'to accept the place of a bus or the place of a seat after you were refused to take it'.\n\nSo the final answer sits down\n\nInput: The man was feeling very tired and he hoped to take a long rest in his bed.

{"text": "1. The question suggests a need to import apples from an apple tree.\n2. It does not mention where an apple tree is necessarily.\n2. This suggests that it could be anywhere. For example, it could be in Arizona, not in Ohio.\n3. This suggests that the only place in America an apple tree can actually be is in one of the other American states.\n4. This is because the only two areas the USA imports apples from are Alaska or Canada.\n5. Based on this, an apple tree from Ohio would not be imported into the USA.\n6. Similarly, an apple tree from Washington State, Alaska or Canada would not be imported.\n7. Therefore, the missing element an apple from an apple trees in Ohio for the USA would be any imported product.\n8. This is because it would be an imported product from any of America's allies or enemies, or from any other country.\n9.

Choices:  a: use them (again) b: burn them c: bury them d: keep them e: forget them/sell them\nOutput: 1) It is mentioned that the question concerns milk bottles only.\n2. This implies that milk bottles are not to be used for any other purpose, nor for any other goods.\n3. We also know that in the old days, people would not use them again.\n4. This means that in the old days people must have done some other activity with the milk bottles.\n5. For example, they could have used or done'something' with them.\n6. They will not use them again because in the old days people either had to reuse milk bottles, bury them or have forgotten them by selling them.\n7. Therefore the context suggests that people might burn milk bottles in the old days.\n8. Based on this context the missing element is milk.\n9. This is because milk bottles would have been used for milk only.\n10. Therefore A: Use it is the correct answer.\n\n\nInput: The doctor did not examine the patient closely enough.

Some \"forms\" can be considered as 'higher level/degree of learning' than the other \"forms\". \n\nFor example, learning English words can take varying time. \nEnglish words can be divided broadly as a, e, i, o, u sounds, and r sounds. \ne (sounds)  are considered as a 'lower level of difficulty' in words, as compared to r sounds and o sounds. \nO sounds are considered as 'lower level of difficulty', as compared to i sounds.\nTherefore, an important factor in comprehensively learning a language is to be able to identify the different \"forms\" a word takes. \nTo know this, it is very important that you know the different forms and degrees of difficulty in the same sentence.\nAs such, to know which word is the correct answer to 'how about that', (a,b, c, d, e, f), you need to have an idea of how English words are written, and how they sound.\nOnce you figure out the different forms a word takes, then, you will know which is the right \"form\" (e.g., \"how about that\").\n\nInput:The first person to successfully fly across the english channel _____?\nChoices:  a:", "answer": "A: satisfaction"}

{"text": "1.\"Billy went away because\" could suggest any number of things. \n2. The following statements (of which we are assuming \"Billy has stayed away\" is one) are being negated. \n3. \"Billy\" is in that list, but it isn't the only item in that list. \n4. \"his parents were fight\" sounds like it might fall into the list, but it doesn't match \"stayed away\".\n5. \"didn't want to stay\" is in that list; \"stayed away\" isn't in that list.  Therefore, the answer is not \"A: home team\". \n6. The list contains \"didn't\", yes; \"want\" is possibly within that list, but \"home\", \"present\", and \"charmed\" are not. \n7. \"Billy\" could still be part of the list, but the list needs an indication of time (\"I am not angry [with him], I am angry while [he] fights me\"). \n8. \"the fight is long over\" (or \"I am angry for the duration of the fight\") would also make sense in this context.\nThe final choice is B: present. The word \"be\" is missing from this sentence: \"Billy has stayed [somewhere] because his parents were fighting\".\n\nInput:There's not much to this puzzle, and we are happy to tell you the solution.\n\nOutput: The entire sentence does not need an apostrophe, but only the word \"this\". The word \"puzzle\" isn't singular and so does not need an apostrophic s. Also, the word \"the\" is not a possessive pronoun, and so again doesn't need an apostrophic \"s\". Only \"this\" would need it.\n\nInput:The man got up and left after telling an unpleasant truth.  He could be more tactful about the way he speaks, but it is clear that his choice?

{"text": "A: small can't be used since the building is anything but small.\nD: huge can't be used either since the building is not huge.\nE: tall can't be used as there are other buildings taller than the Empire State building. Thus we are left with either A: underground or B: high. Since we are not talking about a subway station, the answer must have to do with height. Since both choices are valid, we can not choose between them, so the answer must be, \"Either A: underground or C: high,\"\n\nSo the final answer should read as: E: tall or B: high\n\nExplanation: The sentence suggests that tall and high are interchangeable. One cannot assume from this that every tall building is also high. Therefore, only two are considered: tall and underground buildings.\n\n\nOutput: 1) We see that all buildings can be described. The answer choice to exclude is therefore, \"none of the above.\" If none of the above, then every building in that category is excluded from being called tall or high.\n2) We see that we now must make a choice between tall and underground. As underground fits our definition as a description for buildings like the Empire State Building, \"A: tall or B: underground.\" must be our answer.\n\nThe final answer should be : \"B: underground.\"", "answer": "E: tall"}

{"text": "The lady was worked up, which suggests she was agitated. This context also implies that she believed the article to be accurate, so it is unlikely that she only had her attention on the article and it was dismissive. In context, it is likely that she thought the article's information was inaccurate. Therefore, the husband's comment was a dismissal of the lady's concern. This context indicates that his comment was akin to a dismissive 'it is of no concern to you', as opposed to something along the lines of 'its unimportant'. In this context, his comment was not saying 'accidents happen', instead, I think it is more likely it is saying 'it's of no concern'.

{"text": "1 and 2. Given the context in the question, New York and a brothel are not likely places to find a professional prostittee.\n3. While a prostitute might be found on a street corner, this will probably not be a professional.\n4. Given that the question suggests that a brothel is not an appropriate location to find a professional prostitue, the two choices which relate to professionalism, ie a whorehouse and a street corner, must be eliminated.\n5. The other option which requires professional or formal involvement in the prostitution industry is a 'corner of two streets', however, this is not likely to be a brothel.\n6. Therefore it could be eliminated, as the context is not likely places to find such a prostitute.\n7. However, the last choice 'Brother...' does not seem to relate to prostitution at all, as the question is about a professional prostitute and not a brother.\n8. Therefore, the choice about a prostitute on a corner of two streets is incorrect and the final answer is option C, which suggests that she is likely to be in a whorehouse.\n\nInput:I'm a realistic, honest woman. I could never lie to anyone except my husband so that you could never suspect.  What is the word used for 'lie' in these sentences?

However, neither beguile nor foolish refer to lying in the way that is suggested in the sentence \n- 2) The question asks about deceive (lie to), so it cannot be one of these two.\n- 3) The text suggests that the woman is only telling lies to her husband, so this choice is incorrect as it suggests'making someone be fooled or confused'.\n4) The question is whether the woman can lie and deceive simultaneously, so the choice which includes both has been removed from the question.\n5) The question suggests that the sentence 'I'm a realistc, honest woman' is true, but the next sentence suggests that she can still lie to her husband", "answer": "B: whorehouse"}

Choices: 1. There is no difference as long as you are not using a plural pronoun. 2.  There is a difference as you are using a plural pronouce. 3.  They have many difference and there are many difference. 4. Both are correct and don't have to be distinguished. 5. It is a grammatical error to use a plural pronoun in the structure, \"there are/there is.\"\nOutput: There is no grammatical error as long as you don't make a simple mistake of including any form of 'there' in there/here. There is no grammatcal error in using a pronoun (here's/there's). Using a pronoun (here and there) in both cases does not affect the syntax as they both are not the subject. This is a very common error, and it's easy to get confused as how to use a pronoun after 'there.'\nSo the final answer are 1,2,3,4,5\n\nInput:What do you call the place where you are born? Choices:  a) the first world b) second world c) third world d) earth e) universe\nOutput:  Correct answer is D: Earth. The question asks about the name of a particular planet in the universe, not the entire universe.\n\nInput: What are the reasons for divorce? Choices: A: lack of love B: lack of passion C: lack of financial support D: disagreements E: bad decisions\nOutput:  The question says that divorce is a result of \"bad decision,\" so the correct choice is D: disagreements. The answers don't seem to make much sense when they are together, and the phrases don't really make much sense in the context of divorce.\n\nInput: Where I can see your resume?

{"text": "1. First, the text tells us that James felt that he would ruin his relationship with his girlfriend if he continued to pursue her.\n2. This indicates that James was being careful, or cautious, not that he was being thorough in his pursuit.\n3. At the same time, his relationship with his girl might not have been ruined had he persevered in his pursuit. This leads us toward the answer to be B: destructive.\n4. Given this context, B: destructive is the correct answer. Pushing farther would have destroyed James's relationship with his girlfriend.\nSo the final answe is B: destructive\n\nInput:John's report revealed problems in both his and the company's accounting practices.  As a result of John's work, the accounting firm lost a lot of what?? Choices:  A. prestige B. business C. clientele D. assets E. reputation \nOutput:1. The text tells us that John's report revealed problems with both his and firm's accounting practices, so the report revealed to us problems of each nature.\n2. The report having done so, it therefore did not destroy either John's or company's standing.\n3. Thus, the answer choices in order for A, B, C, D, and E are all correct.\n4. However we can narrow them down further.\n5. Of the two we can easily cross out B and C.\n6. If the report had destroyed the firm's reputation, then it wouldn't still be doing business, which C contradicts. For the same reason, D cannot be correct either.\n7. Likewise, we cross out D and E, so the options left now are: A and B.\n8. Finally, based on the rest of the text we can infer that the loss of business would not necessarily be financial, so that leaves A: prestige to be the correct answer.\nSo the final answser is A: prestige", "answer": "E: produce"}

{"text": "1, Given that the individual does not talk nonsense when not inebriated, their speech would be affected by getting drunk.\n2. Since becoming drunk can result in having an automobile accident, the text suggests that this is a likely side effect of becoming drunk.\n3. It never mentions the individual becoming less intelligent, nor do they regret any aspect of their behavior.\n4. Thus, Choice C and E do not correspond to any implied characteristics of someone's speech after getting drunk.\n5. If the person became inebriated, it is likely that they will become less intelligent when speaking, as drunk or intoxicated states often bring about a decrease in cognitive abilities.\n6. However, this is not the same as talking nonsense, as drinking will not cause the person to start talking random, unintelligible phrases.\n7. So the only remaining choice is C: drunk driving. The most likely side effect of getting drunk is driving a car and possibly causing harm to oneself or others.\nSo the final is D: drunk driving.\n\nInput: After his second child's early death, William struggled with alcoholism, but he eventually conquered this problem.

{"text": "The sentence could be referring to any of several different objects.  The text explicitly says that the person was looking for a plate, which suggests that the objects referred to are kitchen objects.  A: apartment and B: pantry are both places to store dishes or kitchen items and are both non-descriptive, not including any relevant information.\nThe same is true of E: shelf.  If one were to think of it as a place where dishes are stored, this would be relevant information.  However, the text says nothing about the books or the plate being stored on the shelf.  Considering the information available, a shelf cannot serve as either an answer choice, as it doesn't relate to the specified missing information.\nDue to the lack of description, we can only look to what is explicitly stated.  C: table is described as a place where something (dishes, presumably) can be placed while E: living room describes something (a place) that can store something (plants, a piano) that, in this case, does not contain what is missing (plants or a piano). This could mean the living room is a place that, in this context would contain tables upon which to place things, but to a different conclusion. There is no explicit statement that the aforementioned living room (living rooms in general, in fact) store books that, by way of a logical conclusion, would indicate that it is actually the answer.\nUltimately, the missing information is more likely to be found by looking for the information explicitly stated in the text.

It is evident from the context that when people make everyone in a community \"feel welcome and comfortable\", it doesn't mean to make everyone feel the same way as one feels (as implied in answer A).\n2. Answer B is also ruled out as the context clearly states that \"comfortable\" is referring specifically to the feeling that one gets when among other people.\n3.

It is implied that they enjoyed the hamburgers since they are talking about what they are going to do next.\n2. They are talking about the 'next' ride which suggests that they already enjoyed rides on previous rides, hence enjoying hamburgers.\n3. Therefore, hamburgers cannot be gas, as they are already enjoying the rides.\n4. Next, 'how they were going' to what on the ride implies that they are going to enjoy themselves on the rides. It cannot be anything other than food poisoning.\n5. This implies that they are eating hamburgers in order to enjoy themselves on the ride, and so, the correct answer is E: Food poisoning.", "answer": "B: have fun"}

Choices:  A :reasons B :facts C :objections D :ideas E: prejudices\nOutput: 1  The phrase \"It's no use trying\" suggests that the action that follows cannot be fruitful\n2. The word'reason' in the phrase suggests logical arguments and not \"reasons\" as a verb or \"reasoning\" as an adjective\n3. The word 'fact' in the phrase suggests factual information, and not as part of a noun phrase describing a characteristic of her\n4. The phrase doesn't contain the words 'objection' or 'objections' which makes the answer C: objections implausible\n5. The phrase itself doesn't suggest that she is argumentative\n6.

{"text": "1, If a stray dog is available, we can get it from a pet store, a dog show, an animal shelter, or possibly even the living room.\n2. Stray dogs do not typically end up in stores, however they do arrive at animal shelters, dog shows and the living room. Strays who arrive in the living room are more likely to be found in the kitchen, not necessarily in the living room.\n3. Most stray dogs in the living room are brought to animal shelters, or caught in cat traps which catch both cats and dogs. Animal shelters often have many strays. Dog shows usually do not have stray dogs as they are more likely to be pet dogs.\n4. Dogs that arrive at pet stores are more likely to be there with owners as owners will often take their dogs to pet stores. Stray dogs are only likely to be found in pet stores due to pet stores adopting strays. \n5. However, if a stray dog does happen to wander into a pet store, it is more likely to be the owner that finds it than the owners do actually know that the dog is a stray.\n6. Hence, the most likely place to find a stray small dog is an animal shelter. \nSo the final answer should be C: georgia\n\nInput:You won't like the results, but what exactly were the results of the poll?

It also says we eat something after we have eaten something. So we know that we eat some food then we eat something, but we also know that we eat a lot more food after we eat something, which cannot be because we have already eaten a lot of food.

But it was not easy to accept or get used to.\n3. Given the previous statement, the idea most likely must have been unfamiliar, abnormal, or unbelievable.\n4. However none of these best describe the word'strange' given in the prompt.\n5. When looking at synonyms of the work'strange' on https://www.thesaurus.com/browse/strange we notice that 'unusual' best captures the idea.\n6. This could be used to replace strange in the sentence given if the sentence is \"He was able to persuade [himself] that it [the idea] was not such an unusual idea [that it would have been easier to believe].  But it was [a strange idea] not an easy notion to [get used to]\"\n7. Given this context, 'unusual' is the closest synonym for'strange' and, therefore, the best answer to the question.\n\nInput : If you were to make a new law for your state or province, what would you make it?

The notebook is the teacher's choice, but the teacher should teach him to write a long paragraph, to write a big book. \n2) I think it's a pity that the teacher gives some students notebooks for gifts. It's not the teacher's duty to teach others how to use writing tools.\n3) It's an honour for Tom to get a notebook as a gift. \n4) It's a nice surprise to give someone a gift. \n5) The small notebook is the best choice for a teacher's gift to Tom.\nTherefore, The final answer is C : a present.\nHe might use the small notebook as a present to give other.\n\nInput: She had a little knowledge of history, yet she did not learn much about ancient Indian.

{"text": "The context of the entire question contains 3 key elements; Everybody seemed to have a hor... Everybody seemed to have horse... and which always brings out the biggest... The first key element in the question is the one stating that everybody seemed to have a horse.\nThe second key element is Everybody seemed to have the horse at a specific situation where... and the third is which is always said to bring out the biggest crowds. From these 3 elements we can assume that Everybody or all people has/have a horse? This could be correct of course, because the question does not specify only a specific group. Moreover, we know that Everybody seemed to have horses at a sporting event such as a race track. Therefore, the answer that could be inferred from here is that Everybody has horses and is going to a sporting event. However, based on the second key element Everybody seemed to have Horses and the third element always Brings out, the answer we are looking for is 'a Race Track' where we already know Everybody goes.

No one desires to be married to someone with such a bad temper.\n5. There have been successful/happy marriages that have continued for quite a while after the two parties married.\n6. There have been marriages where nothing was said for quite a while and yet remained a happy marriage.\nFrom the context, the answer being 'F' appears to be more suitable than the other choices.

So'stopping' is implied to be the cause of the person moving out of the puddle, rather than the motion or movement of the person. Therefore, A: move away from isn't the correct answer. \n4. Similarly, moving out of the pond is the opposite of'stopping standing' in the pond. The person  is moving. Hence  D: movement is not the right choice either.\n5. In the sentence,'move away from' and'movement' are the elements that contradict'stop standing'.\n6.

Since printing is not mentioned in the text, D: fountain, which suggests a process in which an ink is manually dipped, and that it is not a machine like a printer.\n3.

The task they must complete is building a house for Peter and the children to live in.\n1. From the text, we can tell that they have agreed to 'go back'.\n2. From the text we can also tell that they came to an agreement in the last paragraph.\n3. This suggests that C: Tear down and Build a house will make little sense. The children did not agree to tear down the structure they planned to build.\n4. This suggests that we have to be careful as to what is implied and not implied in the text. Given these contexts.

{"text": "The question starts with a negative statement ('Where does a marmosets not usually go?') that suggests the opposite is possible.\n\n1. 'Dictionary' is a place where marmosets don't usually go.\n2. Therefore, the correct answer must belong to one of the rest since the question already specified one of the options does not.\n3. 'Wilderness' and 'fly' are unlikely choices as they already suggest that the marmoset did/would go there, and a question that asks where one doesn't usually go is unlikely to give an answer that suggests they do.\n4. 'Colorado' and 'underground' are also unlikely choices since 'underground' doesn't need to be in the context of going and 'Colorado' is not a location where marmots (as the question suggests), usually go.\n5. Finally, option D describes a marmot eating as opposed to the question which suggested going. In addition, marmots don't eat flies. Furthermore, there is no information in the question about a specific place a marmot may go, so D cannot be the correct answer as it is a general statement.\n6. Therefore A: dictionary is the correct answer. Since a marmoset does not usually go into a dictionary, it is the answer that would be given.\nSo the final is A: dictionary\n\nInput:I'd like you to go to the store.I promise that you can borrow my car while you're gone.

In fact the question 'Shall I have a glass of milk with dessert?' (not included in the book) follows the command structure without being treated like a question.\n\n1. The command starts with 'I'd like...' implying that the other person has an choice of accepting or opposing the command.

Though the answer choices may have had some sort of impassioned appeal to an action (as speeches often do) it does not follow the specifics of the question wording, as none of the choices could be considered \"oral\" forms of communication. \nIn the same sentence, the definition of a \"capital\" is \"the official government seat,\" as well as \"the city or town where an office or authority is based.\"  There are only two choices that fit the answer (A and E), and neither of these choices fits the specified \"speech\" in a particular capital.  The question doesn't specify if the \"speech\" is written or in person, but we can safely assume given the context and question wording. \nGiven that Washington, D.C. is the capital of the United states, the \"speech\" in this question is clearly Gettysburg Address and it is the biggest, but it's not the biggest speech in the world.

Choices: A: handicap B: disability C: ability D: impediment E: hindrance\nOutput: The context of the sentence asserts that in order to live one\u2019s life fully, they would need to overcome a hindrance.\n\n1. \u201cPeace\u201d implies that they have made progress in accepting their situation, if not a full adjustment.\n2. \u201cLive my life to the fullest\u201d implies that the thing they lack is the ability to live life fully.\n3. This hindering object is what is blocking them from fulfilling the goals presented by this statement.\n4.

Choices:  C: Abraham Lincoln D: Martin Luther King Jr. E: Alexander Hamilton F: Martin Van Buren G: Thomas Jefferson\nOutput: The most famous American is Barack Obama.\nIf you look at any of our textbooks, or ask a 10 year old, they\u2019ll likely say that it\u2019s Abraham Lincoln. They'll probably be right.\nBut if you look at the most famous Americans of all time, the vast majority of them weren\u2019t even elected to office, so it seems like you\u2019d choose the least famous first.\nIf you ask any of the same students again in 50 years, they might say that it\u2019s Barack Obama. Of course, that's because their memory is currently being shaped by Obama\u2019s presidency. There have also been plenty of famous Americans who weren\u2019t elected to office, like, you know, Elvis, who I\u2019m surprised still wasn\u2019t offered a third place spot. \nAnd so the final answers are B: ABRAHAM LINCOLN\n\nInput: What does the prefix re- mean?

{"text": "None of these. There is no \"be considered\" after the question; it is the reader's choice whether or not to consider a successful procreation, whatever that may be. No reason is given for why having a party, celebrating or creating a success are not considered a success when attempting to procreate.\nA: Success is achieved when one has children, a product of the union between two people. If the two people have children, they succeed in procreating. If one has children but the two people who united in order to have children do not have a party or anything similar to mark their success in procreation, this does not negate the fact that they have already created a success; they just might not celebrate it. Also, having a party is not a requirement for procreation. While having parties and celebrations could be considered an extra way to show someone else what a success procreation was to you, that has no basis for what is a successful procreation.\nB: When attempting procreation, there is no indication that some wild audience applauding or cheering would count as a success. There is, however, a party aspect which could be construed as the wild audience, but it isn't necessary.\nC: When attempting procreaton, there is nothing in the text indicating that this would ever happen.\nD: This seems to be the best answer, but it is vague. There is no mention of creating a \"success\".\nE: While a child is typically seen as a success in the procreation process, not all births are successful.\nSo the final answe is D: Nothing.\n\nInput: What is the first cause of death?\n\nOutput: A: birth.

{"text": "A: Safeway\nExaplanation is: \"Where is one likely to buy vinyl records?\" Safeway is a supermarket which sells food. Record albums is a term for a record which has a recording on it with music. Car is a place which you might listen to a record playing on your way to the next destination. Wallpaper is not the place where a person would listen to music. There is nothing about wallpaper which describes it as a place to buy vinyl records. So we assume A: safeway is correct.\n\nInput: Is the president going to make a statement about this matter? Choices:  Yes.  Not only has the president sent out an emergency broadcast, but she has stated several times that the danger is imminent.  She is also calling out the National Guard to assist.\n Output: B. The president's statement indicates that the danger is immanent. This statement was also released to the media in an emergency broadcast. She did not only release a statement on the matter and just stated that the danger is immenent. She is calling out the national guard to assist and that is indicated by'she is also calling out the national guard'. The president is not only sending out an emergency broadcast.\n\nInput:\"I see a big, black cloud hovering around the hill.\" \"And it's moving this way, toward the river.\", she said. It's coming!\" \"But is it dangerous?\" I asked. \"Oh, yes, it's dangerous. The house might fall on us.\" \"Do you want to stay?\" \"No...let's go. Let's get away from here!\" Exaplanation :In this excerpt, 'it's moving this way' means that 'it's moving towards us\".'This way' does not refer to a particular direction to move in i.e. towards south, towards north, or towards west. In the sentence, it indicates that the cloud is moving towards someplace that could cause a danger.In the question, 'is it dangerous?','it' refers to the cloud.\n\nInput: \"The police want to see you.\n They are searching for a suspect.\" \"The man in the photograph might be him\" \"Was he a policeman himself?\" \"No, he was a journalist\"Output:A.

But that is how he is perceived.  So he does nothing. Choices:  A. Perpetual B. Procrastinating C. Proactive D.

Care C. Enormous effort D. Dress up E. Practice\nOutput:1. The text indicates that John was unprepared for a party.\n2. However, unlike all the other possibilities, noticing that the party is unplanned is enough to understand that John was unprepard for his dressing.\n3. The text doesn't specify what preparation John was missing out on.\n4. There could be multiple possibilities, but the context suggests that he was unprepared for his 'dressing'.\n5. The other possibilities, such as care, effort, and practice are all linked to his 'dressing', as John's incapability of being dressed perfectly is the reason he is unprepared.\n6. All of these could have been taken care of.\n7. Practice could also have been taken care of by the previous night.\n8. In this context, 'dressing' means that he was unprepard for wearing something he hasn't worn before, or he was unready for trying something new.\n9. It can also mean getting dressed up, meaning that he was unprepare for the effort he might have to put into wearing something fancy.\n10. Therefore, all the choices refer specifically to John's preparation for his dressing. \n11. Choices other than E are ruled out as they are not related to John's preparing for his dressing.  12. Choice E: falling, implies that if John had failed to prepare, he may have fallen or not been able to attend the party.\n13.

The other choices (content, contentment, happy, joyous) are all different forms of the word 'happy' and are interchangeable with one another.\n3.

It is a question specifically about where to hold or conduct a reception.\n3. It doesn't mention if the reception is for business or social reasons.\n4. It explicitly says that a reception is required to be 'grand'.\n5. Therefore, the context suggests that the reception is for societal reasons rather than for business.\n6. Moreover, the reception is for a large number of people as is also implied.\n7. Given these points, the large dining hall would be the best choice for holding a reception.\n8. Since a reception cannot take place in a grand casino, a large room is not the best choice.\n9. Similarly, a restaurant would be unsuitable because there is little room to host many people.\n10. Therefore, C: restaurant is not the correct answer. Nor is A: grand casino. Nor B: large room.\n11. Since the reception requires a large hall, it must take place in a country club.\n12.

The second sentence (\"just like most of the stuff\") is describing John, but the author does not identify John or his preferences until the third sentence (\"John preferred glass...\"), after the question.\n4. The answer is, therefore, 'C', as it does not identify John as 'anyone else'.\n\nInput:I heard a crash as I approached the front door.  As I drew nearer I suddenly became aware that it was made of glass.  What was John's reaction? Choices: A: He fainted B: He shuddered C: He started to cry D: He began to laugh E: He burst into tears\nOutput:1. The sentence describing the crash (\"as I approached the front door\") is in simple past tense (\"I approached\"), indicative mood, and an undeclared point of view.\n2. John's reaction (\"He shuddered\") is not clear.\n3. The correct answer is therefore \"B\", since the narrator states John's reaction.

The final word 'glasses' may be misspelled in the text (since the intended word is 'glass'). However, since the context suggests that it is glass, this error should be ignored.\n4.

Choices: A: leave things hanging B: get involved C: make excuses D: get things done\nOutput:1. The words 'kind of guy' implies that the subject in the question is an individual.\n2. Therefore, the question asks about him and his qualities, not those of a hypothetical person.\n3.'Leaving things hanging' and 'getting involved' can mean different things to different people. \n'Getting Excuses' means giving excuses for things which are not as serious, not that things are never done.\n'Making Excuses' sounds like excuses about why things can't be done; not about why something wasn't done.\n4.The use of different tenses in the other two options further confuses what kind of person the subject is.\n5.From the context, it is evident that the person in question is a competent and determined man.

In context, the sentence says that successful skiing has an outcome called a'season'.\n3. The question itself doesn't state what'successful skiing' means so we cannot say, for example, that successful skiing would mean 'healthy body'.\n4. Therefore, the given meaning of the word'season' is too vague to be accurate. \n5: A'season' means something like a ski run lasting for an intermittent period of time.\n6. Therefore the answer is that a'reason' for a successful season of skiing would be broken bones, broken legs, and chapped lips, though the text does not explicitly say which or how many broken bones, legs, or lips.\nSo, the final answer is C: broken legs, broken bones, chapped lips", "answer": "E: healthy body"}

Choices:  a. moved around a lot b. had an unusual style c. was confused d. was uncomfortably blown around in the wind  e. was annoyed but still enjoyed himself\nOutput:a. moved around a lot\nWhile the English language has many words to describe the feelings in relation to the movement of hair when something like wind may have touched it, only the first two and perhaps the last two would apply.\nThe choice would be either A or E \nsince John did not like the change in his hair style, he was annoyed with his hair style changing.\n\nSo the answer would be E:  was annoyed but still\n\nInput:Raphael Sanzio was both a master artist and a master architect, creating the fresco in The School of Athens which is so well-known but which many did not realize was a fresco. What does it mean to be a master of something? Choices: 1. highly trained in the art form 2. a person who has a lot of money 3. someone who has a skill of the same sort as a more famous artist, but is not well-known 4. an expert in multiple fields\nOutput: A: highly trained in the artform.\nThe reason this is the answer is because \"master\" can have more than one meaning. In this context, the definition of a \"master\" is one who is highly proficient.  So an artist who shows high skill and knowledge of the field is a master artist.\n\nSo the following answer would be number 1.\n\nInput:The students decided to vote for the new president because the current president was incompetent.

In other words, each paper underwent what? Choices:A: rigidB: strictC: inflexibleD: consistentE: disciplined\nOutput:D: consistent. Given the phrases in quotes, the context suggests that the teacher's behavior was not unusual nor unpredictable (rigid/inflexible).  The test had strict rules (strict/consistent) (e.g., had nothing to conceal, gave a 2nd chance to erase) though we didn't know what she would do until she began (a second chance to correct).\n\n### Instruction:Answer the multiple choice questions following the text.\n\nInput:(2)In the end of May two gentlemen started out from London to travel through England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, to Paris, and so to see more of the continent.

{"text": "The question suggests that getting paid leads to some kind of emotion.\n1. The first line of the story says 'I would get paid once every two weeks, and every time I was paid, my feelings fluctuated between two different emotional states'.\n2. Hence, the text suggests that the feeling that being paid leads to is fluctuating between two different emotions.\n3. The author mentions 'happiness' and'sadness' as examples of two opposite emotions that may or may not change every time the author gets paid.\n4. In light of this, the answer 'happiness' is not correct, as the question does not limit itself to sadness/joy but also mentions the other four emotions\n5. The author does say at some point that they do not feel sad, even though they have to pay their bills.\n6. So if being paid leads to a fluctuation between two different emotions, but they do not want to feel sad, this can only imply that the other emotion is happiness.\n7. Therefore, the answer is B: happiness. \n\nInput: If she took him to her sister's house, it was to escape the storm. If she took him to the doctor's house, it must have been to seek medical advice.

So, the final answer to this question is: C: dwarf\nInput: In case you have to make a choice, a little thought and planning will yield better results than a hasty decision. Choices:  A. little B: much C: little D: no thought  E: none of the above\nOutput: The sentence structure conveys that the outcome of thought or planning will be better than that of a hasty decision.\n2. The first clause \u201cIf you have to make a hasty decision\u201d indicates that you can\u2019t avoid hasty decisions, which implies that the second clause \u201ca little thought \u2026\u201d is an alternative in the same context, where it also indicates that you can\u2019re not forced to make a hasty decisions.\n3. A comparison between the given sentences and the choices has revealed that, \u201ca little thought and planning\u201d doesn\u2019t imply a hasty conclusion or decision while \u201cno thought or planning\u201d does.\n4. Thus, the given sentence is contrary to the choice \u201cno thought or planning.\u201d So, the meaning of the sentence is \u201cA little thought\u2026\u201d, not \u201cno thought\u2026\nInput:The best of all ways to be happy is what you think as best suited to your disposition, and to your own best mode of thinking.

The sentence, as a whole, suggests that happiness should be pursued only when happiness is'suited to one's disposition'.\n3.) This means that the choice that provides the correct definition should either be 'A: to think", "answer": "A: insubstantial"}
{"text": "This sentence is about looking for a house with a master bedroom. \"What kind of home did they want\" is a question about the kind of house they would want for themselves.\n\nSo the final answeris C: big house\n\nInput:They wanted a master bedroom for the convenience of having a place to relax.  There is really nothing left to the imagination because the entire thought is summed up in the last sentence... What is it that they wanted a master bedroom in the first place? It must have been because they wanted privacy, but the house that they were looking for was large enough to have multiple bedrooms... not just one. This is why the bedroom they were looking for had to be large. The last sentence tells us that \"they wanted their place to be\" (whatever it might be), but that they wanted the room to be private and exclusive. But why a master bedroom? If they can't live in a big place, it might be because they just want some privacy or because they want the place to be luxurious. So, they thought that \"they wanted a master bedroom so they could have a place to relax.\"\nOutput:The house that they wanted was so big and large that it could hold many people, so a master bedroom is really the only logical choice for a home. It makes sense though! Many people like it to be private when they rest. Also, many people like to live in a luxurious manner and I think theirs would be like that. Even though the master bedroom is a personal place to relax, I don't think anyone can make good use of it if you can't relax with some privacy in the first place!! Since many people like to share a big house (either with roommates or family) I think this is a common practice for them that makes it natural how big rooms are chosen as the master bedrooms.\n\nSo the answer is E: keeping personal objects.\n\nInput: She was a good student and worked hard to get what she wanted.  The narrator doesn't say what she wanted. Choices: A: money B: food C: clothes D: a big house E: peace\nOutput:The sentences say that she got what she wanted \"by working hard on it\". Because the statement is about her work and her work towards achieving and acquiring something, it's talking about getting what you want. If", "answer": "B: suburban home"}

Choices:  A. They always listen to different kinds of music.\nB. They often talk about other things.\nC. They'll go to a concert that neither friend has ever been to.\nD. They can't find anything good they both like\nOutput:1. First, people's tastes in music vary widely, and it's difficult to find two people who have the same taste in music unless they're very close friends who do a lot of things together.\n2.Second, listening to different kinds of music is only one part of music appreciation, and it's possible for two friends to listen to different types of music, but still find that they have similar tastes in other types of music.\n3. Third, it's possible that they listen to different kinds of popular music but still find that they share a fondness for certain types of music that are popular among their respective circles of friends.\n4. Fourth, it's possible they like to talk about topics that are unrelated to music, such as sports, films, or television.\n5. Finally, it's possible to go to a concert that one person hasn't been to but the other person has. For example, if one person has seen the concert before and the other hasn't, they could have an interesting\n\nSo the correct answer is B: they always talk about other things. Because the sentence is about identification of people with same taste in", "answer": "E: learning about"}

Only a serious illness could cause Jane to have hallucinations as well as experience what? Choices:A: Anguish B: Horror C: Suffering D: Terror E: Delight\nOutput:  Choices B and C are incorrect, since neither refers to the concept of hallucinations.\nChoice A is incorrect because 'anguish' is defined as a tormenting feeling of distress, and 'horror' refers to something that is terrified or frightened.\nChoice D is incorrect because 'terror' causes a state of feeling nervous.\nChoice E is incorrect because it refers to something that is beautiful or pleasing.\nChoice C is the correct response because'suffering' is an indefinite pain of the mind or body.\n\nInput: I have a lot", "answer": "B: getting cold"}
{"text": "1. James complained that Alexa\u2019s electric guitar was too noisy, so she opted for an acoustic guitar to solve the problem.\n2. The sentence also states that Alexa did not want her room to be too noisy, so her focus was on finding an alternative to her electric guitar.\n3. Given that, Alexa\u2019s focus is on finding a place that sells acoustic guitars.\n4. Therefore, C: studio is the correct answer.\nSo the final anwser is C: studio", "answer": "B: music shop"}
{"text": "First, the question implies that money is likely to be stolen.\nThe text suggests that one response to such a situation would be to be angry about it as money is likely to be an important or valued possession.\nGiven this context, the option A: complete sentence can be ruled out from among all other choices. It's also likely that a person is more likely to cross the street upon being robbed than to drink tea as he will likely be angry.\nBased on this information, drinking tea is unlikely to be the response to money being stolen. Hence option D can be eliminated.\nSimilarly, option B: feel angry can also be eliminated as anger is more likely than drinking tea.\nOption C: cross street does not seem a logical conclusion as he is more likely to be angry and possibly cross the road than to drink tea. Hence it is also eliminated from the list of options.\nFrom the given information, C: cross street, B: feel angry and D: drink tea can be eliminated. And the final answer is E: park.\n\nInput:The thief was on the run through the city. Choices:  A cross B the street  C drink Coffee  D drive the car  E park the car\nOutput: First,the text suggests that the thief can also be the person who is trying to escape from the authorities.\nAlso it is implied that he is the person who committed the crime.\nSecondly, the text implies that he is attempting to escape by using a car.\nThirdly, the text suggests that the thieves were running through the city and that 'thief' is the correct grammatically correct form of 'he' in this context.\nTaking into consideration the above information, the option A cross the street is incorrect.\nB: was in a hurry is correct as it has implied all previous elements and cannot be contradicted by the given text.\nD: drove through the city clearly suggests that the criminal attempted to escape from the city driving through it. Again contradicting the text.\nE: parked himself the car is also correct as the thief is trying to hide his identity and is trying to escape. Hence option D: drove the car is incorrect.\nHence the final answer will be B: drive through the city.\n\nInput:John only gave a perfunctoral examination of the corp,", "answer": "B: feel angry"}
{"text": "This sentence is quite difficult to understand. Here are some tips: 1. The sentences uses the word 'extra strong' to indicate that it is strong enough to be used for other purposes.\n2. However, the sentences adds a qualifier - what? - suggesting that we are examining an exception(extra strong) rather than the ordinary case(normal glass).\n3. 'What?' is most commonly used to ask for more information about the 'extra strong' glass.\n4. Using our previous examples, we can surmise that: 1. To be forceless means that something is easily broken. 2. To be regular means that something is common.\n5. Based on this, 'extra strong' glass seems weak/fragile (to be broken) instead of strong/forceless (to stand firm).\n6. Therefore, B: fragile is the correct answer. It is forcelessness/weakness that is referred to by the 'extra strong' qualifier.", "answer": "B: fragile"}

{"text": "1- He was a sharp engineer, but his calculations frequently missed the point.\n2. The word'sharp' is used in a negative sense so the answer cannot be 'accurate'.\n3.

The word 'inaccurate' is used in a positive sense to describe a person's calculations in a general way. This answer does not make sense in the sentence.\n5. 'Inelegant' denotes something being unsatisfactory whereas 'dull' just means ordinary. It would not make sense to say the engineer's calculated were 'dull' when they were in fact'sharp'.\n6.

{"text": "The meaning of friend is contextually significant. In other words, how John interprets and understands 'friend' depends on how he's using the term.\n1. Given the context that John and his friend meet to play squash, the term 'friend' likely refers to a familiar acquaintance that has some degree of mutual respect for John.\n2. The information regarding John's nervousness suggests that he might be misinterpreting the context of his relationship.\n3. If his friend had been at first, he likely would have made it obvious to John that he didn't mean it literally, and would have made it clear to John he meant the other end of the fitness center. \n4. However, given the information about how nervous he was, he failed to recognize the context.\n5. Therefore, C: pool must be the answer.

How can this happen?\nIn this context, 'drowsy' can be taken literally, or figuratively.\n1. It can likely be taken figuratively to mean'still sleepy'.

However, her insomnia was relieved by the medicine.\n3. Also, 'exhausted' can be taken literally or figuratively.  If she was exhausted to the degree that she should have been in the hospital recovering from a hard week's of work, she probably wouldn't be awake and the headache wouldn't have kept her awake until the morning.\n4.

The question then suggests that there are multiple kinds of concrete balls and that kids play with different kinds of concrete balls on different soccer fields.\n5.

Although the goal of the plan or tricks is 'to achieve a goal', as suggested, the plan or trick is not necessarily 'devious or unethical' as the second sentence suggests.\n3: A: To be 'devious/unethical' is specific meaning, and the plan or trick is usually not explicitly stated as 'devious or un-ethical'.\n4: Therefore, B: 'Is often Sinister' could be construed as an adjective to describe the objective of a plan or trick.\n5: The sentence suggests that deception or trick for the purpose of evil/sin is often the objective of the goal.\n6: The best answer would be the word that is 'often the objective of the goal.'\n7: Considering the meaning of'sinister' that we have mentioned above, and a plan or trick 'devisive' or 'evil in nature' would lead to 'achieving a goal'.

In this context, 'fridge' could be the answer.\n3: I never wanted to study music, I just wanted to play and feel the music in my heart!

However, it is not logical to assume that everyone who likes music can hear music, so by this logic, there may be some way of distinguishing between people who have musical talent and those who do not.\n5) The most likely way of determining this would be through hearing or sight. One could even guess that a musician might be the best, as they have more talents that a non-musician (and thus, someone who dislikes or is incapable of music should not be considered a musician).

Public libraries also offer services and resources not available at private institutions or in personal collections, so there is a broad variety of reading material accessible.\n3. B: a public library, that's only a 5 minutes away. 4. A library that's very far away, with many services, doesn't really fit with the context given\n5.

So if the queue was fast, then the children had nothing to do for a long time in the queue. That would cause 'delays'. Finally, there are many possible reasons for 'delays'.

She felt a profound connection to her spouse that she couldn't explain.  E: None of the above.\nOutput:1. A.

In this question, it is implied that the actual gift is being given (which we know from the context of the scenario, is true) and that she did not actually open the actual contents of the box (which is an assumption; the question does not provide information to confirm this).

The question is how to, so the choice that fits it is 'abundance'.\n4. The text suggests that land is an abundant resource that can be divided equally amongst the needy.\n5. However, 'abundance' also describes 'land' or something associated with land.\nSo by virtue of this context, choices (A), (B), (C) or (E) can't be utilised.\n6. However, using the context:\n7. It is clear that 'We have enough' was used to imply that an item has been provided in appropriate amounts for some particular activity.\n8.

Choices: A: personification, B: metaphor, C: metonymy, D: synecdoche, E: euphemism\nOutput: The text itself already tells us that it is a metaphor. As it is talking about God in a metaphorical way, all it would take is to refer to a couple of lines of that sentence: In the old, old legend, people believed that God is the father and the earth is the mother.

Because of this, the author of the sequence felt homebound.\nThe author does go on to say, 'But I had a cripp\nling fear of going out where I knew there was no love.'\n1. The second part of the sentence indicates that the author is comfortable at home, but has a crippling fear when outside.\n2. This suggests that, while the author was home, he felt homebound.  It is clear that the author is referencing their 'home' as a house rather than an area or neighborhood.\n3.  This is due to the fact that 'home' was previously introduced and is a more concrete term than 'neighborhood'.\n4. Given this information, 'home' is used as an inclusive noun to refer to the location of the person or the people being spoken of.\n5. As previously mentioned, that the author references this home as the place that is 'crippling' suggests that home is used as an inclusory noun.  The author is not referring to their 'apartment.'\n\nIn this case, the best answer is B: out. The sentence contains the word, 'fear,' which generally refers to a negative emotion.

It implies something where you keep valuables safely and is also a single object.\n2. It is a place to keep items, so is also an appropriate choice for transporting jewellery safely.\n3. Lastly, 'boudoir' implies a place where women go to be alone and to unwind; it also has a romantic association, which suggests jewellery would fit well there; and the romantic aspect gives the impression that the place is likely to be looked after.\n\nTherefore the answer is E: lady\u2019s boudior which implies a place where women keep their valuables and also can be referred to as a place for women to relax and unwind, which is most likely to be well looked after by the occupant.\n\nSo the final answer to the question is E: lady' s boudoir\n\nInput: You can't teach an old dog new tricks, but you can always teach a puppy new tricks.

A 'palace' or 'hotel' are not mentioned at all.

There are only a few mentions of other public buildings such as'staircase' in the 'hall'\n8. The text only mentions a few people such as the owner of the house, the two guests and a man\n9.

It might be a massive bear that got the kids so enthusiastic, but that wasn't what they needed at the moment.\n6. At this moment in time, the kids were tired, and they needed rest. \n7.

They appear to have already been playing - perhaps in anticipation of receiving these toys.\n9) The toy crazy cats will probably be even happier when they receive other fun looking objects.\n10) I conclude that the toy-crazy cats are just curious, excited, eager", "answer": "B: need for rest"}

{"text": "The best suggestion to \"get someone's attention\" is to use the prefix \"get\". By saying \"get the attention of a person\", you are implying that a simple \"attention\" would not be enough for the situation. It could also sound like you were trying to use the word \"get\" to be synonymous with attention, which would be ineffective.\nInstead, the phrase \"get attention\" implies that you need to attract someone's attention by doing a more specific action, like shouting, feeling happy, etc. This word choice would be much more effective in the sentence.\n\nInput: If you are in love, you\u2019re on fire.

In fact, the only reason we are lead to believe she is Jewish is because she owns a koshertry. This is enough evidence to consider the answer option to be false.\n4. It is clear that the answer is not A: the food court, that is where people eat, not a deli; B: the town, implies that she lives somewhere else; C: New York as we can infer from B, therefore the answer cannot be C; D: the Jewish community; We are given too much evidence to suggest that D is false; E, the town, is false.\nSo the final Answer is False\n\nInput:Abe was able to find another job in a field that suits her skills better than the one she quit.

She is described as 'bored' and 'annoyed'.  This does not seem like a positive environment or attitude.\n4) We can see from A, we know that she is no longer 'bored' and is now in a more suitable job.\n5) This gives me more reason to believe that A is the correct answer.\nSo the final decision is Bored", "answer": "E: town"}

Choices: A: Do her work with less haste. B: Set up rules about what needs to be done. C: Have a housework competition with her husband and child. D: Rename her physical activities. E: Hire a housecleaner.\nOutput: While having a housework competition should help a woman get more time for physical activities, it seems to me that that is not what the text is asking. According to me, the question is to find the best way to get more time for doing physical activities. So the real question here is whether having a housework competition is the best way to do that. There is no mention of the woman wanting to do more housework, so D: Rename her activities is out. Hire a housecleaners and hire a housework competition are actually two different things to do, so I think that A and C are out. Finally, E: Hire a houskeeper is an alternative to having a housework competition. So the best answer is B: set up rules about what needs doing.\n\nInput: A tiger is an example of a predator.

There is no need to smile, shake hands, say 'you're welcome' or 'appreciate the compliment'.\n4. Therefore, C: express gratitude is the correct answer.

The question goes ahead to imply that if we are faced with this scenario, the answer that we would give would be a combination of one of the three choices available.\n3. The options suggest that love can be verbally expressed as either \"I love you\" or \"I love you back\" or, in the case of the answer to the question, the two combined.\n4. The answer itself suggests that love can also be expressed as the statement \"I'm glad we're (got) together\".\n5. It is possible that this is a sarcastic comment but still acceptable.\n6.

In the same way, we are looking for a structure that is of large size, and 'large city' would fit best in place of the given choices.\n4. The other given choices such as 'water fountain', or 'central park' would not have hundreds or thousands of statues and therefore do not fit this question.\n5. Conclusion: Church satisfies all the criteria and is the right answer choice, so 'A' is our final answer.\n\ninput:The woman was so deft that she could remove a ring in a slip of water.Output:Her deftness was so remarkable that I can barely believe it.  The sentence shows that the woman's deftness was so surprising that we are having difficulty believing it, so we must use'remarkable', not'skillful', as the adjective that modifies 'deftness'.\n\ninput:The man had two sons who were very different. One was a quiet and serious boy and the other, a rambunctious and lively one.Output:1. The question asks us to find an adjective to modify 'different' 2. The first choice, 'various', is too broad for the context, and would apply to any two sons, regardless of their personality 3. The second choice, 'opposite', is not suitable since it is an adjective that is used generally, rather than describing the two boys individually 4. The third choice, 'dissimilar', is used here to describe the characteristics of the two boys, which are the opposite of the normal qualities expected.\n\ninput:Although many would say this is true, I don't believe she is the nicest person I've ever met.Output:To say that a sentence expresses an opinion, it must convey the idea that the speaker believes the subject of the sentence is the case. Hence, the sentence 'Although this is true, I do not believe....' does not express an opinion since the person who said it does not believe the subject of the sentence.\n\ninput:I knew it was the wrong choice, but I", "answer": "C: large city"}

{"text": "1: 'procreating' implies that 'he had a hangup'. The text implies that the subject 'wasn't enjoying procreating'. This suggests that the subject either liked to procreate, or had no 'hangup' in doing so.\n2: Since the subject 'didn't enjoy procreation', 'enjoy' is an antonym for 'enjoy'.\n3: Since the option containing the correct word is 'A: orgasm', D: in bed is incorrect.\n4: Similarly, E: wearing his 'birthday suit' is incorrect as 'procreating' is not synonymous with this\n5: Since the subject did 'not enjoy procreating', C: naked must also be incorrect as 'orgasm' is not synonymous to 'naked'.\n6.

Choices: A: her lunch B: her umbrella C:  a pocketbook D: a cellphone E: a book\nOutput: 1) She had a strange habit.

The text strongly suggests the following about many students. Choices A: are unmotivated. B: have trouble organizing their time. C: prefer reading stories to learning from course materials. D: find course material too difficult to follow. E: prefer to participate in sports.\nOutput: The text says that many students never finished the course. This means that they are not completing the coursework. They are also not studying or reading about it so E is not the right answer either\nInput: Mary never was much of a student as a kid.  She got so little sleep that whenever she was tired during the day, she fell asleep at her desk.  She got terrible grades and would read anything as long as it took the form of a novel.  It turns out, though, that Mary was a good scholar despite not getting much sleep.  She did well on her exams and eventually graduated from college.

{"text": "1) The text suggests that rumors of monsters are killing people is causing people to react emotionally and irrationally, so we can infer that the panic and mass hysteria options are likely incorrect answers.\n2) The text doesn't suggest any actions that can lead to getting in trouble, so that option is likely incorrect.\n3) The text does not use the term \"murder\", but rather \"killing people\". In fact, only the murder option suggests that the deaths are being caused intentionally, or on purpose.\n4) The text does not suggest that monsters are being killed on purpose, so getting in trouble is unlikely.\n5) The text doesn's discuss any criminal behavior, so you can rule out going to prison and murder.\n6) Therefore, the correct answer is B: getting in trouble\n\nInput: It's impossible to describe what it means to be a friend to someone who's angry all the time. Choices:  A. impossible to grasp B. impossible to grasp a hold of C. impossible to describe D. impossible to catch E. impossible to know\nOutput: 1.) The word \"grasp\" is used in the text to describe how a friend of someone who's angry would interact with their friend. The other options involve \"grasping\" a hold of something the text doesn't describe, \"grasping\" information, or catching someone, a feat that is clearly not possible with a person who is constantly angry, especially with the usage of the verb \"grasp\". Therefore, we can eliminate \"impossible to grasp\" and \"impossible to grasp a hold of\".\n2.) \"Impossible to describe\" is not appropriate, because the phrase \" It's impossible to know\" and/or \"impossible to understand\" might fit, as they both imply the author's inability to express himself.\n3.) \"Impossible to catch\" is also incorrect, for the same reason why \"impossible to grasp the hold\" is incorrect, mentioned in #1.\n4.) Finally, \"impossible to know\" is a better fit. This phrasing implies a level of difficulty that's impossible to surpass, or a lack of knowledge, both of which fit the subject of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer, as seen in the answer key, is \"impossible to know\".\nSo the final answer would be", "answer": "C: mass hysteria"}
{"text": "1)The text suggests that people tend to get bored while waiting, when something is expected and doesn't come.\n2)None other than singing is listed as an alternative, and it doesn't have an opposite option.\nSo the final sentence is \"When never comes (that is, when something is expected but never comes) people sing/singing\".", "answer": "B: getting bored"}
{"text": "1: Satisfied here means happy or as expected. That is not what'something' is. It is an 'object' with certain use, need and value. Hence, in this sense B: unnecessary is more appropriate if we do not want them. \n2: 'Use' has different meaning from 'use value'. The thing is 'use value' is necessary whereas the thing is 'use'. So, in this situation, if we do not want 'any' object, this choice is a good one.\n3: But, if we want to be specific and avoid having unnecessary things, we can have only required things. Luxury means extra; an extra thing, extra things. I think the only suitable choice is C:luxury.\n4: At the end, we do not want anything with exception for any necessity.

Therefore, the armchair must be either in a hospital or a doctor's office, and not in a furniture store or an apartment.\n4. But the text implies that an apartment might not be a suitable place for an armchair only used by a few people.\n5. Similarly, a furniture store would house chairs that are used by many people.\n6. This suggests that a hospital or doctor's office is the most possible location for an armchair used by only a few.\n7.

Choices: 1.  A: it was better B: it was worse\n2.  it was not bad\n3.  it was not good\n4.  it was better and worse\n5.  it was terrible\nOutput: This question does not refer to what the actual condition was. The phrasing of the question implies that it is asking the opinion about a hypothetical situation. In this case, the condition would be the same as the previous years.\nTherefore, the choice that should be omitted is 1A: it was better. That is, it was better, not the last year of highschool.\n\nInput:  I want to make the point that all three of these are adverbs Choices: 1:  A: and B: then\n2:  C: too D: also E: neither\nOutput: The question refers to the context of the following sentence.\n\"I don't want to make this more important then.\"\nThe word 'then' here is an adverb.

{"text": "1) The question suggests that secular parties take place with some regularity.\n2) For the secular party to take place, there must be a crowd, which would not likely happen if it were only held at the time of death of members of the household.\n3) Therefore, the parties would likely be frequent.\n4) This implies that they cannot be held just before death or at any other frequent point in time as then, the time period available for hosting parties would be limited, leaving little time to prepare guests.\n5) Since the parties usually involve food, it would be a tedious task to prepare the ingredients when they have limited time, or the food has to be pre-cooked and frozen and then re-heated.\n6) Since these parties occur with some regularity, the time period must have been well planned for, in advance, and the ingredients have to be bought in advance (not just at the short notice that would occur if the party takes place upon the death of a member of household).\n7) The party has to be eternal, since, if it is held at the time of certain death of people (after all people are always going to die at some point in their life), it will only continue in the memories of the family.\n8) Given that these parties take place at frequent intervals and are eternal because they happen at death, they cannot be held at the death of a person.\n9) Therefore, the time period at which they are held must be unpredictable.\n\nSo the correct choice is E: unpredictable.", "answer": "D: frequent"}

{"text": "Why does she sing so much answer: In the context of the sentence, she is asked why she sings a lot.\n\n1. However, the sentence does not specify how often or how long she sings.\n2. She could sing everyday for half an hour or 8 hours a day for a week or a month.\n3. Singing doesn't seem to be bothering anyone, so the first two options are out.\n\n4. Since she hasn't given other reasons for her singing, we can rule out that either of the other choices are her motive for singing so much.\n5. She is clearly enjoying herself, which suggests that either she has a good voice or that inhaling her singing is enjoyable.\n6. But it is unlikely that she inhales her singing, so that is out.\n7.

A better choice here is You will be able to get rid. The word would indicates that it will be possible in the future. There is no indication that a broken icebox would not be able to be disposed off.\n\nInput: I wish she had done her chores a long time ago.  \nChoices:  A. That's too late to do. B. Too late to do. C. Too late. D. Too late to. E: Too bad.\nOutput: Since 'a long time ago' refers to 'an earlier point in time' ('long time ago refers to the past'), that gives us a clue that Too late refers to the past. 'Do her chores' refers to an activity in progress, or a task not yet complete. 'Too late' refers to a later time, which means that there is still time for 'to do her chores'. Therefore, 'That's too late to' is incorrect. 'Too late to do.' is incorrect because the phrase 'do her chores' is being used in the third person (she has done her chores), so she should be the subject of the verb, not the object. Also, 'late' describes 'to do' which should not be the object; it should be the main verb. 'Too late.', 'Too late to.' and 'Too late to.', is incorrect because 'late' is not an adverb, but a noun, thus describing something, not adding to the meaning of the adverb. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Too Bad'.\nSo the final answer from above is E: too bad.\n\nInput: A. That\u2019s too late to be.\nChoice: B:\tThat\u2019s too late", "answer": "D: junk yard"}

{"text": "1. Grandma is not a person but a place.\n2. It is mentioned later in the sentence that she would be shopping at a fabric store where they had beautiful fabric and threads.\n3. This is a direct indication that a clothes store (not a clothing store) or a fabric store would have the velvet that she wanted.\n4. The only other place mentioned is a jewelry store, which makes it unlikely that she is shopping for velvet that she would use to make a quilt.\n5. Therefore, She wanted to make a quil for velvet, therefore, the likely place to find velvet would be a fabric store.\n6. Since the question is asking for where she should look, the correct answer is fabric store B: Clothes\n\nInput:  The last thing that you want to do is to try to explain quantum physics to a four-year-old. Choices:  A. Explain quantum physics B. Explain physics C. Explain four-year-old D. Explain quantum E. Explain why a four-year-olds needs to know what a four-year- ol d needs to know.\nOutput: Since the sentence says the last thing \"you\" want to do, the answer should be that which concerns \"you\" and \"you\" in the text.\n1. The sentence goes on to say that the author has done this multiple times, but that she has always regretted it, which shows that she has done this, so she knows that she does not want to explain quantum physics to her child, which is a \"you\" from the author's perspective.\n2. The sentence goes on later to say that other people have suggested that her child is interested in quantum physics, but she is not worried about that because she does not want to waste her or her child's time explaining quantum physics to a child who does not understand.\n3. The reason is because she and her child both know that their interest in physics is not at the level of quantum physics.\n4. Therefore, it wouldn't be a waste of time to explain it, just as it is not a waste of time to introduce your child to concepts that they do not understand while acknowledging that they will probably not understand what it is saying immediately or right then or right where they are\n5. Therefore, it wouldn\u2019t be a waste of anyone\u2019s time,", "answer": "E: fabric store"}

While the barrels that are used to load the bullets are essential in the firing process, they are not used to fire the bullet.\n3. Only the barrels that fire the bullet are used in firing.\n4. One of the barrels is used to load the bullet into the chamber, and the other barrels are used when the pistol fires.\n5. Only when one of the barrels fires the bullet does it use a barrel in firing.\n6. So, two barrels are used for firing a pistol.\n7.

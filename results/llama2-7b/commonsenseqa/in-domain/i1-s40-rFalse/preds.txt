A sequence "AB...A" makes a run if the first letter is not the same as the last letter. A sequence "ABCD..." makes a run if there are no repeating letters. A sequence "SCTUCT" does not make a run if there are repeating letters.<n>For example, given "STUT", there is a run, but given "ABCDABCD", there is no run.<n><n>## Instruction2:<n><n>Given an integer "n", find its 2's complement. We will denote 2's complement of "n" = n' and we will denote "n-n'" = 0. To find n': If n is negative, it is n' = n+1. If n = 0, n'= 0 (This is true because in binary "0" can be represented as 00. So in 2's complement, 0' = 1. So 0*1 =0. Since we can't use 2's complement for zero because then what's the use of taking binary and adding 1 to make it 2's complement). The only time where n-n' is nonzero is when n = 1. The value of n' can be verified.<n><n>## Instructions3:<n><n>There are two methods to find a run in a string. Method 1: Find the second longest contiguous sequence. The second longest contiguous run is defined as a run in a string with no larger run, followed by no other run in the string. For example, if the string is "ABCDEF", then ABCDEF is a run, in

Remember that in everyday conversation you would usually use adjectives to describe nouns. The 'have' + past particle usage is a stylistic difference. A native speaker will judge you less critically for using either adverb.<n>Think of the participles as words that give information about the past or present actions of a person or object, such as 'having driven' or 'driving' and 'driving'. If you leave out the 'be' or the 'have', you will have left out the person or object (the doer or the having person) and the participle will lose its meaning.<n><n>### Solution<n>    Answer : D(Thorough) and E(Shy)

What are 3 of these ways, and provide a sentence showing an example? Choices:  I am going to the store in a little while II. In the above sentence, there is nothing wrong with the word "going."<n>Output: going is an auxiliary verb<n>It is called as "modality", that is doing or having the ability to do; feasibility; feasibility.<n>I am going to the store. <n>Output: The sentence is right. It is good because it uses a subject-verb pair correctly. It uses an auxiliary verb in the sentence "I am." The subject "I" and the "going" verb (an auxiliary) are combined to make the action complete.<n>My parents are going to visit a friend in England. <n>Output: Subject-verb pair correct here again is "we are" where the subject "my" and the verb "am." "Going" again is an auxiliary with "to England" it is the main verb.<n>My sister is going to the store to buy chips. <n>Output: "Sister" is the subject. "Going" is the auxiliary. It is an action verb that "bought chips"<n>My brother is going to the dentist. <n>Output: Another case of subject-verb combination. It is the auxiliary, the action verb, and then the object. There are other choices for an action verb, so it is not the subject-verb pair, but it is still correct.<n>In this paragraph is an example of which of the three ways verb is "be" present in active sentences?

The subject should be "John" not "is going."<n>He is going to the dentists that does the implanting of permanent root canal posts.<n>Output: It is an example of one of three presentations: verb "be" present in the active sentence. It is a subject-verb pair, though. It does not use

If you see nothing in him, say nothing to him of this letter; and in that case there is an end of the matter. What must be let alone, to be truly let alone, must be as undisturbed in its remaining undisturbed as undisturbed to which it is worth your while to be at pains to get it undisturbed.  But the only way of restoring peace, is by letting things be quiet.  If you do that, though you should never hear from the individual in question again, you will have the comfort of knowing you have done the best for the object, which would have no satisfaction in having everything just as it would wish, if it knew everything was going to have nothing as if it did not wish anything.  It is in trying to get the world to go right, that your troubles begin; it is a mistake about what the word mean, and an ignorance which none but the truly philosophic can rightly hope to avoid making, in not taking a single step until they know where they are to step. But why trouble yourself with what the world expects from you?  It is what they did not expect from you, and your going on its giving you no trouble about anything else, that will at last give them more trouble than anything else, and bring what I know they want, not only to themselves, but to you. What I advise you to keep in this case, as in every other, is what the Greeks called the Logos, or reason of the thing; and you will find this the best ground to take for getting things done, which is also the surest way of doing them well, and for the way to take for what is really your good, and of doing your duty to the

It was always a source of constant irritation.  She studied it every second of every minute of every hour of every day and she could never learn.  That was the reason.  She could never have studied it so much if it had not been for her determination when she was a child that someday she would be famous or rich.  It was not good enough to be smart like her sister Emma.  Mary always wanted to study French so that she could someday be something that Emma would want to learn from.  The reason.  It was not her fault that she was smart like her father.  She needed more than just to be smart.  She needed success.  She needed it because she was not smart enough not to be smart so it was always hard for her to get people to like her.  All the children were always afraid of her.  Even the children her own age when they learned that she had learned every letter of the alphabet.  They always called her smart.  It was something they should have called her.  She was always so quick when they were studying something.  She could just read a book and do all the homework right away.  Even the teachers told them to be nice to her.  They told them it was her learning things that made it hard to get people to like to her.  If she studied French well enough she could impress her sister.  Emma was always saying how she was afraid that Mary could never really understand people the way she did and so she would be always worried about being a failure.  Her mother had always told her that nobody else would want to study French on the sea or even at the sea like her.  She had known that if she studied hard everything would be better.  They were always so afraid to talk to her.  Her father told her that she was like his and this made her feel better because he was smart, too, but now she was too afraid to do her homework.  She would sit in her room and look at all her toys and look at all of her notebook

Choices:  A: new hampshire B: dairy farm C: farm field D: texas E: county fair<n>Output:		A: new hampsire<n><n>### Solution:1. A: In my opinion to find the answer we need take the context of the sentence. What the man wants to do, where the heifer is and so on.Then we need consider the possible choices.  Choices in the example are: New hampshire, dairy farm, farm field, Texas and county fair. We conclude that the choice Texas is irrelevant. I think we do not need consider the word Heifer in the sentence. What we'd better to consider is the word East. It should appear in the answer word or words. And New hampshire and farm are suitable for the description. <n><n>So the answer is:  B: new hampshire.<n><n>2.The answer in this sentence is similar to the previous one. We need consider the choices to find out the answer. Choices are: In my opinion we can consider to use a computer and type the text, because if we do like this, we can find the keywords, the answer choice. Also, we need not consider the word "In my opinion" in the sentence, it just a way to express and introduce the whole sentence. It may be wrong to consider this word in the keyword.<n><n>### Solution 3:<n><n>input:  "Isn't it time to retire?" she said.  3 choices: A: What time is it? B: This isn't the time. C: It's time to quit. D: When is it time?. We should consider the word quit in the whole sentence. Because it is related to B, we need to look at it and compare with A, B, and D. According to my opinion, D is not appropriate. For D, " When " is important. Because of this we can guess that the answer is A. This is the best solution right now.<n><n><n><n><n><n>#### Question 3:<n><n><n><n>###### Question 4:<n><n>I want to answer the question if you don't have a good solution please feel free to let me know.

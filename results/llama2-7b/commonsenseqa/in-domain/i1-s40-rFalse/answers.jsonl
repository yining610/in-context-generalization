A sequence \"AB...A\" makes a run if the first letter is not the same as the last letter. A sequence \"ABCD...\" makes a run if there are no repeating letters. A sequence \"SCTUCT\" does not make a run if there are repeating letters.\nFor example, given \"STUT\", there is a run, but given \"ABCDABCD\", there is no run.\n\n## Instruction2:\n\nGiven an integer \"n\", find its 2's complement. We will denote 2's complement of \"n\" = n' and we will denote \"n-n'\" = 0. To find n': If n is negative, it is n' = n+1. If n = 0, n'= 0 (This is true because in binary \"0\" can be represented as 00. So in 2's complement, 0' = 1. So 0*1 =0. Since we can't use 2's complement for zero because then what's the use of taking binary and adding 1 to make it 2's complement). The only time where n-n' is nonzero is when n = 1. The value of n' can be verified.\n\n## Instructions3:\n\nThere are two methods to find a run in a string. Method 1: Find the second longest contiguous sequence. The second longest contiguous run is defined as a run in a string with no larger run, followed by no other run in the string. For example, if the string is \"ABCDEF\", then ABCDEF is a run, in", "answer": "E: formal garden"}

Suppose all these instructions are used equally, that is, one instruction is chosen with a frequency 1/1256. Let the time used to execute each instruction be a uniformly distributed random variable between 0 and 5 (no other assumptions). Let t(r) denote the total time it takes to execute instructions r through r+1 on a program having an instruction set of 4 instructions. Let A(r)= (max r1 r) t(r1,...,r+1). What is the probability 1256 that an instruction has a time t1?\n\nQuestion 2:Suppose f(x)=x+1 and g(x)=x3-2x. Let the probability that the random variable X has a value x, be p(x). Find a closed form of P(1) where x1 is the range of the sum.\n\nQuestion 3:Explain the concepts of a probabilistic relationship. Then find the probabilistic relationship between the probabilities p(x1) and p(x2), where x1  and x2 are integers such that 1 < x1 < x2 < 10000. Be sure to provide some arguments to support your answers and describe the steps behind your calculations. Explain why there are two different probabilities.

Remember that in everyday conversation you would usually use adjectives to describe nouns. The 'have' + past particle usage is a stylistic difference. A native speaker will judge you less critically for using either adverb.\nThink of the participles as words that give information about the past or present actions of a person or object, such as 'having driven' or 'driving' and 'driving'. If you leave out the 'be' or the 'have', you will have left out the person or object (the doer or the having person) and the participle will lose its meaning.\n\n### Solution\n    Answer : D(Thorough) and E(Shy)", "answer": "A: cold"}

In the above sentence, there is nothing wrong with the word \"going.\"\nOutput: going is an auxiliary verb\nIt is called as \"modality\", that is doing or having the ability to do; feasibility; feasibility.\nI am going to the store. \nOutput: The sentence is right. It is good because it uses a subject-verb pair correctly. It uses an auxiliary verb in the sentence \"I am.\" The subject \"I\" and the \"going\" verb (an auxiliary) are combined to make the action complete.\nMy parents are going to visit a friend in England. \nOutput: Subject-verb pair correct here again is \"we are\" where the subject \"my\" and the verb \"am.\" \"Going\" again is an auxiliary with \"to England\" it is the main verb.\nMy sister is going to the store to buy chips. \nOutput: \"Sister\" is the subject. \"Going\" is the auxiliary. It is an action verb that \"bought chips\"\nMy brother is going to the dentist. \nOutput: Another case of subject-verb combination. It is the auxiliary, the action verb, and then the object. There are other choices for an action verb, so it is not the subject-verb pair, but it is still correct.\nIn this paragraph is an example of which of the three ways verb is \"be\" present in active sentences? Choices: I am II. In the above paragraph, the subject is incorrect.\nOutput: The sentence says that an action is planned to happen. The subject should be \"John\" not \"is going.\"\nHe is going to the dentists that does the implanting of permanent root canal posts.\nOutput: It is an example of one of three presentations: verb \"be\" present in the active sentence. It is a subject-verb pair, though. It does not use", "answer": "C: late"}

It was not her fault that she was smart like her father.  She needed more than just to be smart.  She needed success.  She needed it because she was not smart enough not to be smart so it was always hard for her to get people to like her.  All the children were always afraid of her.  Even the children her own age when they learned that she had learned every letter of the alphabet.  They always called her smart.  It was something they should have called her.  She was always so quick when they were studying something.  She could just read a book and do all the homework right away.  Even the teachers told them to be nice to her.  They told them it was her learning things that made it hard to get people to like to her.  If she studied French well enough she could impress her sister.  Emma was always saying how she was afraid that Mary could never really understand people the way she did and so she would be always worried about being a failure.  Her mother had always told her that nobody else would want to study French on the sea or even at the sea like her.  She had known that if she studied hard everything would be better.  They were always so afraid to talk to her.  Her father told her that she was like his and this made her feel better because he was smart, too, but now she was too afraid to do her homework.

{"text": "A: new hampsire\n\n### Solution:1. A: In my opinion to find the answer we need take the context of the sentence. What the man wants to do, where the heifer is and so on.Then we need consider the possible choices.  Choices in the example are: New hampshire, dairy farm, farm field, Texas and county fair. We conclude that the choice Texas is irrelevant. I think we do not need consider the word Heifer in the sentence. What we'd better to consider is the word East. It should appear in the answer word or words. And New hampshire and farm are suitable for the description. \n\nSo the answer is:  B: new hampshire.\n\n2.The answer in this sentence is similar to the previous one. We need consider the choices to find out the answer. Choices are: In my opinion we can consider to use a computer and type the text, because if we do like this, we can find the keywords, the answer choice. Also, we need not consider the word \"In my opinion\" in the sentence, it just a way to express and introduce the whole sentence.

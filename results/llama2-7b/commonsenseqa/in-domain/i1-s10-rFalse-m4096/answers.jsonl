When the zoo first opened in 1831,  it was the first 'civilized' zoo in the world and became hugely popular amongst Londoners and tourists \u2013 an estimated three million people visited it in the first five years. In 1832, the first tiger arrived, and the animals were all free to roam, so the zoo became a dangerous place for spectators and staff alike. The lions were considered dangerous, and when one broke loose in late 1852 and ran loose for 4 days, several people were killed, so a barred enclosure was erected in an attempt to keep the bears inside. By 1833, the zoo had 6 lions, three tigers, two leopards, one jackal, two wolves, two hyenas and a black bear. A year later, an amphitheatre was built which was used for shows of trained animals and a circus-style presentation of the collection.   After the death of Charles Darwin, George Darwin, then president of the Zoological Society, introduced new policies which allowed the zoo to be properly organised and more animals were introduced, eventually leading to a rapid increase in the number of animals. Animals not needed for displays were no longer tolerated, and when the zoologist George Wombwell suggested exhibiting elephants to Londoners, Darwin promptly removed the two elephants that he already had and replaced them. As a result of this, the number of visitors increased from 88,437 in 1833 to 673,412 in 1901.  The zoo is", "answer": "B: graph"}

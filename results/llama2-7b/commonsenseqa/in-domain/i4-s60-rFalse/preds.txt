Choices: <n>A: side of crib B: inside of clock C: outside of church D: on a wall E: floor<n>Output C: outside of church<n><n>## Explanations<n>>Q1: The teacher needed to see both the answer and work for progress evaluation. This is similar to how programming is done. Most times the progress evaluation is for homework and only done in school. In school the work is also marked and if it is correct shown progress has been made. This is why both C and D are correct<n><n>>Q2: The old ladies indoor only cat would be in the house. This is again similar to programming. Programs are written in computer languages which are instructions for a machine(computer) to follow. Programs also always need an address of where to go. This could be the computer memory or a disk. This is why the correct answer is D residence.<n><n>>Q3: The vase is on a table because a vase is a decorative holder containing flowers. In this day and age we put decorations(flowers) with the purpose not to eat them at the dinner table. Because its at the table it would get in the way for eating hence the term tableware. As a result where would a table be? The answer is (A) at the dinner table.<n><n>>Q4: The astronots, being humans, they are on earth. Earth being a planet has to be passed as this is where the astronauts are. This is also where the space program was launched from. The second way of saying this is that the astronauts were orbiting earth. We know they were not orbiting the sun, we just know they were orbiting earth as we know they landed and were human. This is why (D) outer space is the correct answer because they were orbiting earth which is the correct answer.<n><n>>Q5: Corn fields can be seen. This is why (E) Utah is the correct answer. We can only see the moon at night as this is when earth stops rotating, creating a period of darkness in which we can only see the moon.<n><n>>Q6: A church has a clock or rather a bell in it. The floor is also in it. So the only answer is for it to be on a wall. There are no

In the old code, there could only be one question.<n>- In the beginning of the program, the user got welcomed to the programming language section. The user would be asked a question to welcome them to the course and the student would get to press the start button and they would proceed to do so.<n>- After clicking start, the user would be asked to enter the number from 1 to 5. The user would be given choices of answers, for example, number 1. The student can answer number 1 if they want but if they want to continue with a different question, they can press skip, and have the code move to another program where is where they would get to see the next course.<n>- On the end, since the user clicked skip, the user would need to type in their name and the code will ask if the student is ready to leave class and continue on with there different courses. If they pressed yes, it will ask if the user want's to go on and they will be able to press enter, and they will be asked if they want to come back or if it will be there last program they will do before they leave.<n><n>### Refactored Coding<n>Here is how I would refactor the program. If the user enters 1, it would ask them what they had for breakfast and they can be asked this questions again. It will ask the user what they had for dinner and again, it will ask them what they had the night before. The user could keep this answer by writing it down inside the code so the program will keep them safe and so the user keeps them in their head. After that, it will ask them if they had a sandwich so they can keep up. It will then ask the

The teacher didn't want just the answer and work shown, but also for the students _____ what?<n>```<n>The teacher didn't want... what?<n>In order to get the answer right, I had to think through the directions pretty thoroughly, and this is one of the ones where that's really useful. (Since we're discussing this particular question, let's assume it wasn't a trick question. For me, the main points were...<n><n>The teacher didn' know the answer to this particular question; she didn't want everyone else to be able to guess what she'd be looking for either.<n>In my (very limited) experience as a teacher, the best questions (i.e. those that the student really needs to think through) are ones that have multiple answers which, in and of themselves, do not completely answer the question. When a teacher assigns an essay, they can't always determine or articulate what they want on that essay. Some teachers write a detailed rubric, but more often there's an informal, "When I see this paper, I want to see this, this, and this..." That's because they've noticed that the students who do well on the essay have certain things in common that are not immediately clear as to what they are. That's the only non-answer answer that made sense to me, hence the answer I included above. <n>```<n><n>### 	02A. Where did the old ladies' indoor-only pet cat spend his time?<n>```<n>The question asks, "Where did the old ladies'..." This means that there's something called the old ladies which does not have a pet cat, and they didn't want to call it something like the old ladies who had a pet cat because that would have changed the question from one that is in the simple present (the old ladies have a pet cat) to one that is in the plural: the old ladies have (multiple) pet cats.<n><n>The word "indoor" is probably a little confusing because we think of it as referring to cats inside a house rather than outside. But in this case, we're dealing with something that sounds like more of a personal quality than a place. You can't have an "indoor-only pet cat", not unless it becomes

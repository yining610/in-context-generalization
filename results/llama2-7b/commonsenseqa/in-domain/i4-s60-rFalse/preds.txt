Choices:  A: race track B: populated areas C: the desert D: apartment E: roadblock<n><n>### Response:		<n>The answer to the question the students were asking Sammy was **populated areas**.  I added **population** as an answer because I saw a student adding that as an answer.<n><n>#### Explanation:<n>The question the students were asking was simple and direct.  The students just wanted to know where the people were. However, Sammy had other ideas.  Sammy wanted to think for another second. He wanted to figure out what they could get for thinking of a place filled with people. The idea was to do something that was going to bring an idea, they would have to think of a place with people.  The idea was not to let on the place Sammy was thinking of. Sammy realized that people were not talking to him. When did he realize that he was not the only one thinking about the question anymore?<n><n>#### Explanator:<n>Sammy said he was the fastest runner.  When Sammy did not get a response, he realized that he was thinking about something that no one else was thinking about.   He started talking about different places.  He realized that he was going to have to use their words to show he was thinking.  There seemed to be no one else talking.  Sammy wanted the idea to sink into the minds of the students.  He said that thinking hard and then thinking again gave him the idea of where the people were.<n><n>#### Conclusion:<n>Sammy started to think for another few seconds.  He wanted to think of any ideas that the students might have thought of before he came up with an idea.  He did not want to look like he had given up yet, but he did not want to get another idea that no one had given any indication that they had the same idea.  He had been trying to figure out what a place was where people were.<n><n>> The students had been trying to figure something out.<n><n>The question should be simple to answer and the person asking the question should expect the answer to be a specific thing or idea. The people asking the question are expecting a yes or no question or something that is related to the question they want to ask.  <n><n># Part 2:  (2)<n><n>### Instructions:<n>Give a response that appropriately includes details of your choice.<n><n>### Question:<n>> The teacher needed to figure out the problem of the old ladies indoor cat.

But then I was around the students & had to help them understand there work or give them help if they need it. I was around 7 years old in 9th grade but it's a little different helping my class in a classroom full of 8, 7 & 6 year old kids. They are also more advanced in their age compared to my class. When it came to the math I could do a simple 5th grade level math but the students math was more advanced. In my language class I have students from 8th grade & 9th grade and then the classes I'm helping kids my grade so I have to give them 2 different types of support. I had to remember the classes I'd been in during my years in elementary. 2-2:10, 3-2;10, 4-11-11:30, 5-4:55, 6th-5:20. They are in a class full of 9th grade students and when I'm helping 9th grade students I know a bit a bit more their classes and homework. I have to remember they have 3 classes in a day so it's about a 1 hour of study. When it came to studying for a test I had to help students I've been in their same classes so I remember what they are studying or what they are looking for. I found it was a little different helping 7th & 6th grade students because they are in a classroom full with many kids in there and I think it's harder for the teachers. I help 5th grade students in a classroom full 5th grade but they are there most of their day. When the classes are small they can have to go to the library or a computer lab but if the class is large I do not know this. What I learned is to be calm and have patience when I help a 7-12 year old student and it really means something different to me. I'm like a big

Choices:  A: happiness B: relaxation C: create music D: sadness E: loud noises<n><n>### Response:		<n>It depends on your passion for violin, if you're passionate, you will keep on improving, even if people laughed at you or discourage, keep on working hard. You don't have to care much if some are happy about your progress or sadness, keep trying to find who wants to buy or help you train hard and that will be your reward. <n><n>But if you don't are interested in violin, but you forced yourself to play it, probably you will get sadness, cause when people see who you are good at other things rather than violin, you will have feeling like no one understand you even though it is only your own decision to pick violin.<n>

Choices:  A: empathy B: anxiety C: knowlege D: falling down E: hear things<n><n>### Response:		<n>```<n>@student: Hello! That may sound like an easy question to answer but the hard part is figuring out what the word being used meant! <n> <n>Let's go through it piece by piece to figure it out. First we take the words "Listening is key" and we break it up into two parts: "Listening" and "is key"<n> <n>The part "Listening is" is simply an adjective phrase that is modifying the part "is key", so if we look at "is key" it is still telling us something about the verb "is". <n> <n>We know that the verb "is" takes a subject and an object and that the verb "is key" should also have a subject and an object but we cannot be sure of exactly what they are because the adjective phrase "Listening" gets in <n> <n>the way and we cannot tell if it is the subject or object. We need to figure out whether or not "Listening is" an adjective OR adverb before we can determine what we are looking for.<n> <n> <n>If you think about it, this part of "Listening" seems more like an adverb because it is telling us about the verb "Listening" instead of telling us about <n> <n>the subject or object. You may be thinking "How much do the nouns in the sentence matter?" The answer is actually more than you think. The nouns in the subject <n> <n>of this sentence are "The astronauts" and the nouns in this sentence's object are "The astronaut's main way to gain knowledge."<n> <n>What I want you to do now is look at your sentence and decide if you think "Listening" is an adverb or an adjective before you look at my answer.<n> <n> 👈🏻👈𱄐🏼👈𝖛𝖍𝖑𝖎𝖊𝖗𚁆𝖅𝖊👉🏾  I bet you feel pretty smug!<n> <n>Now, here is me correcting your sentence. It is actually an adjective.<n> <n>@student: The teacher told all the students to "Listening was key" they'd gain

The field trip took place indoors because it was raining. They were on a scavenger hunt for a vase that was in the restaurant's hallway.

Choices:  A: body of water B: lake superior C: underwater D: toilet E: aquarium<n><n>### Response:		The fish spend a majority of their time in the body of water.<n><n>### The question to answer:<n>Where did the old ladies indoors pet cat stay?<n><n>### How can you get the answer?<n>For cat that means that the cat, is in a location that isn't external. So it is indoors. But we are not interested only the location. Because there is many locations in a house, there is many places to put a cat and in a house you can find a lot of indoor things, so you can say that cat stay at the residence, but this would be too specific information to answer for the question. What we want to know is that the cat stayed somewhere that was indoors, not outdoors. To answer for the question we have to search the question until we can find an exact location that is indoors. So for example, we can answer with the choice ''c'', because that choice is the most general and it answers exactly what is needed or what the question is looking for, to be more specific it's the answer the question looks for, so the correct answer is (c), residence. With a (b) or (d) answer would not be the answer what the teacher is asking.

The International Space Station has built in protection against this risk.<n>The crew gets some protection by sitting or standing in front of the aluminum doors used to protect the crew from micrometeoroids (small <n>meteorites) during reentry into the earth's atmosphere. However astronauts don't have the convenience of just throwing their head in a hole to be <n>shielded. While on one side the doors protect the crew from dangerous meteorites flying through space, on the other side the crew is bombarded <n>with radiation. The solution was to reimagine a part of the space that they didn't know was possible.The doors had to be made transparent, and the <n>crew had to live with the doors shielding them from harm. The astronauts use a transparent plastic shield to protect them from radiation in the <n>same way that a diver's helmet protects against the water pressure. This solution required the astronauts to live in this uncomfortable and <n>unfamiliar environment for the week they are in orbit.

The teacher asks them to draw the item on a piece of paper for her to look at. The student explains what they can tell about the object. Some students might

An outback is “land that is not suitable to human use”. Therefore we need to find out if this outback has human infrastructure, such as restaurants, hotels, malls, etc…. Since we can live “for a whole day”, I conclude that there are no human infrastructure. It can then only last “up to six days” because you have to live from what you bring from/with you. Thus, the correct answer is: up to six days<n><n><n>### Input4: How long can you stay in the outback?<n><n>### Response5: ANSWER CORRECT<n><n>### Below is a task that describes a problem.

Choices:  A: factory B: garden C: supermarket D: garage E: warehouse<n><n>### Response:		<n>It seems that the question was asking for many words to define one thing, one container. The word “dime a dozen” is a saying meaning something that is so common that you can pick up a dozen for a dime, a coin used in America at the time. The questioner wanted to know where the containers were. Based on the question, my answer would be warehouse. A warehouse has many rows of them because they are used to store supplies for the city and the many buildings in it. They were large containers, they were a dime a dozen because there were many of them, and they were in the giant what?? Well the answer is warehouse because it was the only one of the choices that fit.

It is a collection of short stories about a man who is struggling to find out what it is that makes him unique.  In the end, he realizes that his uniqueness is rooted in the people he surrounds himself with.  At the time, he was confused and didn’t want to move forward in his life because he thought that he was the only person in the world who could see himself through the lens of his story.  However, reading the book taught him that although he is the only person who can see himself through the lense of his story, everybody else looks at him and sees somebody different.  In other words, everybody has their own story, and while everybody has a different perspective of themselves, everybody is uniquely beautiful in their own way.<n>

I think it might relate if step 3 was "Include details with words (like, so, for)" but wasn't sure, as I was under the impression I had to describe each subject from step 3, but maybe step 3 is describing what I wrote in step 2.  </ul><n> </li><n> <li>Second example, I thought this was another tougher one as I had to rewrite the topic sentence. I tried rewording the question to something like this, and I then got back on track.  <p style="line-height:28.18px;"> The space station has $miles$ of steel beams</p> <p style="lineheight:28.20px;">and in it is a cylindrical $module$ which is made of reinforce steel $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$.</p> <p> This made rewriting the topic sentence easier as I could rephrase parts of the questions as "How does the space station get up so high? or, How does the space station orbit Earth?"<n> |<n> </ul><n> </p> <p>Maybe the instructions are supposed to be more for teachers.  <p><n> |<n> </ul></li><n> <li><p>Third example, this was the hardest one to me.

On step 3, I think the question should be more focused on rephrasing "the human looked down longingly" to something like "He/she really wanted to be there".

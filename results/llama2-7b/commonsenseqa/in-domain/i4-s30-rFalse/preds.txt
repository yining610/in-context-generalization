Choices:  A: ink in B: caps C: ink cartridges D: take notes E: scribble<n><n>### Response:		<n>A) ink in, because ink will make your pens work<n>B) caps<n><n>### Explanation<n>The task requires the player to determine what they should do if their pens aren't working. The choices include "ink in", "caps", "ink cartridges", "take notes" and "scribble". The appropriate response is "ink in". The instruction to "ink in" is to add additional ink to pens by replacing empty ink cartridges. A scribble, in this case, suggests rewriting the text with notes, rather than writing something with a non-functional pen. "Caps" means replacing punctuation marks such as periods and exclamation marks in old typewriters and word processors. Replacing these punctuating marks with newer ones is not feasible for the given context.<n><n>### Input and output format<n>The below example would be an output.<n><n>```<n>PLAYER 1:Input:  What should you do if your car isn't working?  <n>Choices:  A: oil change B: mechanic C: tune up D: tires change E: drive<n>```<n><n>### The problem<n>You need to program the input and output format for the given task. Once done, the code must be able to correctly analyze the task and return an appropriate response to the player. The goal is to provide as detailed information as possible to improve the player's understanding of the game.

Choices:  A: self pity B: communication C: understood D: pain E: embarrassment<n><n>### Response:		When you are expressing yourself after getting a bruise by yelling, then you obviously feel embarrassment because you are embarrassed if people around you know. Also, the person is feeling pain since he did something and he is feeling embarrassment because the person is embarrassed if the people around him know.<n>The reason for my response is because: To start with, if people around me know what happened I can feel embarrassed. After all, if the people around know what happened then I will likely feel embarrassed.  Moreover,  if I get a bruise then I can’t feel like I understood what happened. For example, bruising a body part could be explained as you have communicated your self to me then I wouldn’t feel embarrassed or understood. To be exact, being embarrassed means you are embarrassed when someone around you is watching.<n>In addition, to be concise, how could one feel self pity from a bruise? The most you could feel is embarrassment or pain then you won’t feel self pity that’s for certain.<n><n>### Input : What happened as a result of the collision of two galaxies?<n><n>### Response(s): <n><n>### Input<n><n>The scientist was looking for answers, and he wanted to find out what.

Yes, Dylan has a cognitive disability of some degree and as such, many people (unfortunately) talk to him as though he is a child, including all the people he's ever interacted with - school, friends, coworkers, etc. However, Dylan _does_ have a degree of brain potential that others don't understand about those with cognitive disabilities, and some people that don't know that also believe he is incapable of higher cognitive levels. If Dylan had a cognitive disability (like a speech, language or emotional disability) of a milder degree or a physical disability (such as blindness, or deafness), people would not treat him as though he was a child as he would be seen by others as being at more of a cognitive _or_ physical disadvantage (those were the two _only_ choices listed), and therefore, wouldn't be speaking to him or looking at him in the same way.

When someone plays games or sports and wins or is a champion that is what makes them happy or satisfied with themselves. I learned that the woman was sad because she may have lost the game and that's what caused her to cry. A person can be sad in multiple ways but when they play, it is a form of therapy. It is also a form of escaping from reality. You get to be someone different so it is what I leaned from the scenario.

He offered them an iphone, but they would not accept because if they did what would happen to their current telephone, and most importantly their car. For most people their car is all they need to have the best life but they can't get by without a computer or phone, so he was giving them the choice. He asked them which would they like to receive first and they all said the phone and he just gave them the phone, because what's the worse that could happen? At least they could tell him why they would need a phone later, and after seeing how many people he had received a phone from they came back with excuses because they wanted the phone.

The city block is the answer because Bob's feet are no longer in the city, his feet are now on the ground, they are free of the city.<n><n>*<n>### Instruction<n>Create a function named myBank() that is a public subroutine.<n>### Demontration<n>Input:  <n>Input a double variable.

While attending college I have learned a significant amount about Computer Science and am still learning from the many classes I have taken to date. Everyone in Computer Engineering needs to know Programming if one wants to develop their software into becoming a full project.<n><n>My first class ever was Logic Design, where I learned about the many things in computer hardware. The other class I could remember is Programming 1 and 2. I took those courses many years before I began college.<n><n>**In my first programming 1 class I learned a lot, not only in how to program the projects my teacher gave us, but also a lot about what programming was, especially on the C language.**<n><n>Some of the concepts I learned in Programming 1 class were variables, string, and arrays. I learned about variables in Programming 1. I also learned about string in programming 1. In programming 1 I learned to do arrays.<n><n>**In programming 2, I did projects.**<n><n>In programming 2 I learned some more things. I learned about conditional statements, loops, constants, structure, operators, statements, functions, expressions, conditionals, if statements, if-else statements, and statements. I also learned about pointers and also many other things.<n><n>**In advanced programming 1 I did a C++ project.**<n><n>In this class I had to make a game. The game I decided to make was a space ship game that had music, asteroids, space ships, fire-balls, explosions, lasers, a score board, a game over screen, and a start screen. I did most of my code in Visual Studio. When I was nearly done with my game I needed to add music. I asked a friend if I could borrow his computer. He agreed to let me borrow his computer. The computer I borrowed only had Winamp on it. It didn't have any software to play music from. Therefore, I could not add any more code to my game without borrowing a computer that could play audio.<n><n>**In Object Oriented Programming I learned C++ and created a project.**<n><n>The projects I did for this class were a

I have not tested the code though and I assume there are few things I can improve the code with. But, this project has helped me to know how I have to approach a project. There needs to be a clear objective of the program, which one I have to follow and how the code will be broken down. I will not say the code is not to be improved, it is not the best way to approach the problem but for a start, it can be used. The code is not efficient either, there needs to be better optimization and refactoring of the code, which I can learn later.<n>

Choices:  A: school children B: parents C: get money D: require to pay taxes E: take money<n><n>### Response:		<n>I was asked, "Who does the government help when it comes to schools." In order to properly answer this question, I need you to choose my path of how to obtain the information I needed to answer this question. For instance, I chose to use a phone book.<n><n>You:<n><n>Talk with your friend, Alex, about the phone book, and use it to help you answer the question, "Who does the Government help<n>with schools?"<n><n>You:<n>* Phone book opens up to a page on "Government Departments."<n>* Phone book opens on a page called "County Government."<n>* Phone book shows "Schools" under "County Government." Go to the "Schools" page.<n>* Phone book under "Schools" list 13 schools. List them for Alex:<n><n>(a) "Woodbridge Schools"<n><n>(b) "Collingwood Schools"<n><n>- (c) "Graniteville Schools"<n><n>* You ask your friend, Alex, whether he knows who answers the question, "Who helps pay for schools?"<n><n>Alex:<n><n>- (a)<n><n>"Scholastic Aids Program"<n><n>- (b)<n><n>"Department of Education Financial Aid Division"<n><n>* Alex:<n><n>- (c).<n><n>"The Federal Government."<n><n>* You:<n><n>- (d)<n><n>I don't understand.<n><n>- (e)<n><n>I don’t know.

Alex tells you that another government official who is responsible for the schools is the Governor. When Alex asks who pays for schools, you say that the governor pays for schools. Alex says that is correct.<n><n>So, you know that the government is the one in charge of paying for schools. Therefore, you also know that the government is who helps with school.<n><n>End.<n><n>

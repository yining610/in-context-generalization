The mushroom is really good but you can only eat it once or else it will poison you until death. A woman wants to make about $100,000 from selling these mushrooms and was wondering how to do so with the least potential problems. I thought about the following:\n\n(1) You could sell mushrooms to every human on Earth.\n\n(2) You could pick 999 of the 1000 people with the most money on Earth and sell them all a mushroom. Once again after selling all 999 mushrooms there is 1,000,001 mushrooms left over. You would have to now decide if you pick all the people with the least amount of money on Earth and sell each of them one mushroom. After doing this you would have sold everyone mushrooms but then you'd be only one mushroom richer.\n\n(3) Take all the people in the world and put them on a treadmill. Once on the treadmill divide them in half, if one of them is fast enough that he/she passes someone else on the treadmill the fast person gets a mushroom. Then divide everyone into thirds until we are down to 1. I'm guessing only one person can run that fast but let's say all 7 billion people can. If you think about it, one person can run faster than all others. Once that person passes he/she gets to choose all the mushrooms in the world.\n\nComment: This is for a programming course. The course is focused on using OOP and some procedural programming. The programming language is Java.\n\nComment: You could implement each step, test them, and post the code you have so far.\n\nAnswer: 1.\n\n\\begin{code}\n   public class Q1", "answer": "A: washing machine"}

What is the most important principle for the scientist to take into account when doing the scientific research?\n\nThe most important principle for the scientific research is to keep things as neutral as possible by observing things objectively. Neutrality means avoiding personal attachments to people, circumstances, and events. It allows the person conducting the investigation to be fully engaged with it. Scientists are careful in how data is collected, analysed and interpreted.\n\n2. Which of the following is NOT a principle of scientific discovery?\n\nThe principle of replication is to repeat something that has been done. It is a principle that is applied when conducting experiments.\n\n3. Which principle of scientific discovery will the scientist apply for testing the hypothesis?\n\nThe scientist can apply the principle of predictability. They predict how things will behave in an experiment and observe any differences between what they expect and what actually happens. The data is then used to write a report or to try to prove a theory.\n\n4. Why would it be better for a scientist to keep notes of all observations, experiments, and measurements during a lab?\n\nKeeping a detailed and accurate report is important for conducting a proper investigation.\n\n5. Why might a scientist want to test their hypothesis in different conditions?\n\nDifferent conditions can lead to different results, as some can alter the accuracy of the science. It is important to test the hypothesis in different conditions to be sure the results do not vary with the test.\n\n\n### Question to be answered\n\n> What is the most important part of the scientific discovery?\n\n#### How to get the answer of question from the website\n\n```\n<div class=\"question\">\n    <div class=\"question-content\">\n        <p>What is the most important part in the scientific discovery?</p>\n        <div class=\"answer\">\n            <div class=\"answer-item\">\n            <div>C</div>\n\n            <div class='option-content-inline'>", "answer": "C: throne room"}

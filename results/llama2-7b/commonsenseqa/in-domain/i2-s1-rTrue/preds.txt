Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n>### Demonstration:<n>Input: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty? Choices:  A: oil refineries B: wall C: show D: own home E: water fountain<n>Rationales: 1. The question is asking for a type of plumbing that would not help quench thirst. <n>2. This means we are looking for a source of plumbing that does not provide drinkable water. <n>3. We know that plumbing in our own home (D) and water fountains (E) both usually provide drinkable water. <n>4. A wall (B) could have plumbing inside it for water flow, but again this water would typically be drinkable. <n>5. A show (C) is vague, but if it's referring to a place like a concert or theater, they typically have drinkable water available.<n>6. An oil refinery (A), however, has plumbing which is used for the processing and refining of oil, not water. <n>7. Therefore, the type of plumbing in an oil refinery would not be of use to you if you are thirsty. So, the answer is A: oil refineries.<n>Answer: A: oil refineries<n><n>Input: When a person is beginning work, what aren't they doing yet? Choices:  A: working B: resting C: tiredness D: accomplishing E: momentum<n>Rationales: 1. The question asked what a person isn't doing yet when they are beginning work. This involves identifying activities that are not immediate consequences of beginning work.<n>2. It is difficult to make assumptions about a person's physical state, so options B: resting and C: tiredness aren't appropriate because they don't necessarily correlate with starting work. <n>3. "Working" is not the correct answer, because if a person is beginning work, they are technically already in the process of working.<n>4. Option E: momentum is not applicable as it's not a verb or something you could do as per the theme of the question. <n>5. Therefore, option D: accomplishing is the most logical answer. This is because accomplishing suggests the person has already reached some level of success or completion in their work, which would not be possible if they are only just beginning. So, when a person is beginning work, they can't be accomplishing yet.<n>Answer: D: accomplishing<n><n>### Input:The sanctions against the school were a punishing blow, and they seemed to what the efforts the school had made to change? Choices:  A: ignore B: enforce C: authoritarian D: yell at E: avoid<n><n>### Response:		<n><n>Incorrect<n><n>Input: A school which has made an effort to change may not be punished. This can be seen in that  a punishment is a consequence resulting from not following rules at the school (in the example, for allowing people to spit and throw objects).<n><n>Correct<n><n>Incorrect<n>Input: A school where students have shown an effort to change seems like it still may not have authority.<n><n>Correct<n>Incorrect<n>Input:#1 The efforts the school had made were not enough of a  reason for the sanctions if the authorities didn't trust the school and its students to not go against the rules.<n><n>Correct

Choices:  A: pretty flowers. B: hen house C: natural habitat D: storybook E: dense forest<n><n>### Response:		<n>The fox walked from a human, city, to a wildlife, forest, location. In the city, the fox experienced an artificial environment for its living. In the wild, the fox would experience a natural habitat for its living. A fox lives in a forest and its habitat should be considered. Its habitat provides everything that it requires for its survival including the proper atmosphere, sunshine, water, food, plants, living space and shelter.<n><n>Another assumption can be made. The reason for fox migrating to the forest may be that the fox is tired of artificial environment. <n>There must be something more beautiful in the forest the fox has noticed. The fox might be looking for a pretty flower.<n><n>Finding shelter in the forest might help the fox survive. Finding shelter in the forest may be another reason.

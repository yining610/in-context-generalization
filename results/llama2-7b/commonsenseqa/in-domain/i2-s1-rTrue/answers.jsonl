B: refrigerators and D: fridge are the most likely places to store leftover food that would become old and forgotten. \n4. However, B: refrigerating the leftovers may help prevent their spoiling, but, it wouldn't explain why they got covered in mold.\n5. So E: coach sounds like the best possible answer. If the left over food was found in a coach, it would most likely have been forgotten and left to turn old. \n6. The choice is a noun rather than a verb, which doesn't make sense. \n7. E: coach is also more generic than the other choice and could have been referred to as a \"container\" rather than its specific definition. \n8.

Choices:  G: what kind of fruit it is  B: if it is organic  A: how many calories the fruit has C: how much it weighs D: what its color is E: if it is ripe or not\nRationales:1. Apples don't typically tell you what kind of fruit they are. \n2. Apples don' t typically confirm whether they are organic, but apples might tell you if they are ripe.\n3. Apples don' tell you how many calories they have, how much they weigh, or what their color is or if the apple is ripe. \n4. This leaves you with the choices G: what kind of food it is and A: how many calorie has. Both of these are the best choices as they apply to all foods, not just apples.\n5. G: what kind of vegetable it is is a good answer option. \n6.

{"text": "### Demolishment explanation:\n\n1. The question mentioned that an accelerator was controller via hand throttle, meaning that the throttle was operated by the driver's hands.\n2. The question mentions foot pedals and their use in controlling the steering suggests that the driver used their feet to operate these pedals. Therefore it is incorrect to say control.\n3. The question describes the controller used with the hand throttle as a hand throttle. It also mentions the foot pedals used to control the steering. So the thing could be a vehicle. \n4. The question seems to be concerned with the level of a vehicle, so it is unlikely that a pedal or accelerator would be operated via the hand, so it likely was controller via hand.\n5. The correct answer is therefore E: airplane. An airplane, as well as having hand throttles and foot pedals, can also use an accelerator, which is not present in a car.\n\n### Input :A device that controls the throttle position, while the throttle itself is controlled via a foot pedal located below the instrument panel. Choices:  A : airplane B: boat C: car D: fuel E: engine\n\n### Response :\n\n### Demostration explanation:\n\n1: The question says that a foot pedal operated the throttle position while the throttle was controlled via hand. It also talks about pedals and their use for steering. This suggests that, in the questioned device, the driver would operate and steer using their feet and control the throttle via a hand. Therefore, we can reject options A: airplane as it controls throttle via a foot pedal. Option B: boat contains both foot pedal for steering and throttle control as required. Therefore, option B: boat is not correct as well.\n2: In accordance with the question's instruction, the device is a car. It is not a boat nor an airplane, since it contains both foot pedals and throttle control.\n3: Option C: car has both foot pedals and hand steering. This would meet the requirements of the question. Therefore, the correct answer is C: car.\n\n## #4:\n\n### Instructions:What does a hand throttle operate?", "answer": "E: airplane"}
{"text": "What's the logic?\n\n### Input for #2:Too many people in California want to sell houses.  Which choice illustrates an extreme situation? Choices: 1. A: you don't need to sell 2. B: the only way you can sell is to make your 3. C: the price you sell at D: it's impossible to sell because 4. E: they try to get rid of it all on eBay\n\n### Rationales:\n\nWhen it comes to selling a house, the basic law of supply and demand is that the more supply there is, the less demand you will get. If this law of supply and demand was the only factor affecting the value of your house, this would mean that the value of your house would go down (you can look up this formula for free on the web), but in reality, the value of a house is a bit more complicated. In that case, option 2: B: the only way to sell is at a huge loss.\n\nIf a person had a house with a market value of $300k, they were willing to sale as is for a price of $200k and would take whatever they got, then they would have a $100k loss. This would be the case if the house sat on the market for a few months or if a lot of people were trying to sell their houses. If a person could put 100k into fixing up their house, then they could make it more valuable, but even that wouldn't do it completely. If a house was in a neighborhood with 5 houses on it, and 3 of them were vacant, then it would be harder to sell the house because it would seem as though people were leaving the neighborhood completely. This is because people would be more concerned about their friends who owned other houses or people who worked there about the stability and popularity of the area. \n\nWhen there's a supply of 5 houses with 2 on the market for sale, it seems like that it wouldn't be possible to sell, but a buyer could still try to get the one for the best price. If 4 houses are being sold, then only about one house will be sold per month. This would look better to somebody who has a house that is worth $300k and it took almost an entire year to sell it", "answer": "D: pet shops"}

{"text": "In the context of this question, the word \u2018sex\u2019 is a euphemism for sexual intercourse. The question is asking us what sexual intercourse \u2018often\u2019 make happen in people, and what are the \u2018often\u2019, and not the \u2018sometimes\u2019. With this in mind, the correct answer could be one of three ways.\n\n1. The \u2018often\u2019 may be referring to the frequency of intercourse, in that it occurs often or not that often. Therefore, we can assume that the reason people have sex is for the feeling of happiness it brings them.  If this feeling could occur from other things (e.g a hug, sharing an ice-cream with a friend, a massage\u2026) then the question wouldn\u00b4t specify \u2018sex\u2019, it would simply say that \u2018feeling good happens often in people\u2019, however this isn\u2019t the case. \n\n2. Alternatively, the \u2018often\u2019 may refer to the nature of the outcome of intercourse. In the question \u201cwhat does Sex often make happen\u201d, the word \u2018often\u2019 is used and is followed by \u2018happen\u2019 which is in the present continuous because the outcome of sexual intercourse is not limited to one \u2018thing\u2019. Therefore, sex may be something that causes people to feel happy. \n\n3. Another way Sex may satisfy our needs is if the word Sex is a metaphor for sex itself rather then the outcome of sex. (in which case, the person making this question may not be fully aware of this). \n\n### In conclusion, I have answered the question, as it is a multiple choice question, rather than a \u2018make sense of the sentence\u2019 type of question. \n\n#### Question 2:\nThe following sentence contains a missing word.

I think that we are given that a pearl necklaces is attached by something that is not pearls; I think it is more likely than not that it is some sort of cord or string to where it would attach to a shirt or blouse. There is too vague of an image to give away an exact location.\n2. The pearl necklace would be attached to something. We are given that this item of jewelry is attached to something that is not actually part of the pearl necklace. Therefore, it is more likely that the pearl necklaced would be attached to a dress, shirt, or blouse than the actual necklace would be attached by itself to a person.\n3. Since the question doesn't specify what exactly a \"pearl necklace\" is, I am thinking it is a string of pearls that is attached to something, not an individual pearl. A necklace is an entire piece of jewelry, not an individual pebble or pearl. Therefore, it is unlikely that the individual pearl would be attached to an item of jewlery, but instead, the necklace would be attached.\n4.

{"text": "- 39. A: shame\n- 41.  B: arrest\n\n### Rationales:\n1.  Answer to 39: The question asks that an individual committing perjury is likely to lead to something. This being that, perjury will likely lead to being arrested. We can conclude that the individual committing perjuriy will likely lead to an arrest because the person has intentionally lied in court with an aim to deceive the jury; therefore, lying to the police (the police investigating the case would be the arrest), and also that lying in court has the goal of deceiving the jury, is considered a criminal offence in terms of the Law of Perjury. \n2. Answer to 41: We know that the perjuror is not likely to lead to shame because someone can feel shame for something without breaking the Law of Perjurers (the legal framework outlining the criminal offence involving the case whereby the perjuror should be punishable), therefore, we cannot assume that an individual who has committed perjury is likely lead to shame. We know that the person that committed perjury was unlikely to lead to go to jail because, although committing criminal offences related to perjor is what has occurred, there have not been consequences associated with a jail sentence being served. Therefore, perjor is unlikely to lead to someone committing criminal offences and being sentenced to jail.\n3. The answer to 42 should be A because perjury is an example of committing criminal offences, however, this is not what the criminal offence is leading us to. We know that criminal offences lead us to an arrest, and this is to ensure that the law is adhered to.", "answer": "B: arrest"}

{"text": "Rationales:\n1. A: Grassy fields are likely not where a fox would be caught since, as the name implies, they are grassy plains and, most likely, would not contain any foxes.\n2.

{"text": "Rationales:\nI selected the response of answer B. The question is asking how Janet knew she was dying, so the answer must be something that directly indicates her death is approaching or taking place, such as the stopping of breathing. The other possible answer choices A: sleeping longer do not necessarily indicate the onset of death, but would normally be a result of death and are therefore not reasonable explanations.\nThe remaining answer choices are unlikely because they wouldn't be immediately associated with dying, nor could a person be performing them just before they die. For instance, changing color doesn't necessarily indicate the beginning of death, and changing color can be delayed or happen gradually. Additionally, death would only be associated with change of color if the person was previously alive and were dying. As Janet is already injured before she answers the question, change of color seems like an inappropriate explanation. \nThe response D: change of color is a logical possibility as it could indicate death, but Janet doesn't specify how she knew she was dying. This answer would indicate Janet was able to tell she was dying, but we don't know if this is necessarily the case.\n\nResponse:\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question.\n\n## Rational:\n\nI selected the response B.

A wrench would have an opposing shape to the opening a sink has, so if used in a sink, a wrench would not be able to do its job and would be of little help. \n3. If the question had stated \"A plumbers cannot use a wrench in their work when they're doing what\", it would have been difficult to answer because plumbers use wrenches during plumbing work, so they would not be using a wrench for anything else. The question here is therefore ambiguous enough to allow a plumber to use a wrench even though the question specifies they aren't doing the job they do in general. \n4.

In this case, the person can have a translator to be able to ensure what the instruction means and how it should be worded, because every word carries a different meaning, that sometimes can cause unnecessary misunderstanding.

We know that the historical items are in an attic so it would make sense that the home that the items are in be the top of the home, or at the very least be somewhere at the top.\n\nThe second sentence contains a description of what an attic might be like. If the attic is filled with historical items, we know the home in question must fit the first sentence for the question to make sense.\n\nThe answer should be the home that fits the description of the attic in the second sentence.\n\nOption A: Top of home: This is the correct answer.

In addition, \"leaf\" often refers to a specific species, so it's only natural to assume the question is also asking for the specific name of that leaf species. \n4. We also know that the leaf is green but not particularly shaped other than it's large size, so it is unlikely a shaped leaf would be the answer.

Option B: doctor's offices does not make sense because a doctor's office is certainly not a place where one can find a ficus, let alone a special ficus. \n4. Option D: public place would not be a reasonable response because you are unlikely to come across a ficus tree in a public place, let alone a special one.\n5. Option E: arboretums is not a possible response because arboretums are places that specialize in conservation of trees, and they certainly would not include ficus trees.\n6. Option C: in a sea is the most reasonable response as this allows for the possibility of a special species of ficus tree being found in a body of water.

Choices B: play sports and C: play games do not require any specialized equipment or facilities and are both activities typically done on a group basis. \n9. These choices could certainly include playing ball, but in this case the children are playing ball, so this can be discounted. We know this because it would be unlikely for adults to sign their children up to play games without knowing the children already play them or were comfortable with playing one. \n10. Therefore, the answer is D: play ball. \n\n### Input\nWhat does he have?\nChoices:  A: a new watch B: a stolen watch C: his watch D: no watch E: a worn out watch\n\nThe question is asking what a watch this man has, implying a watch is a possession. \n\nSince he is wearing a jacket, we can rule out the unlikely answer of \"no watch\", which would be the only way this statement could be true. \n\n\"His watch\" is not a good response because it is not a complete sentence. The options on the list are a watch, so these cannot be a possessive case noun. \n\n\"his stolen watch\" is incorrect since the watch is not stolen. \"we need the watch\" is also an incorrect answer. \n\n\"A new watch\" is the most logical answer because it indicates that a new watch belongs to the man. This can only be the correct answer since \"a new watch\" makes grammatical sense. \n\n## Input: One of the many interesting things about this town is that it does not have a stop light; what's most interesting about this town?

We know that the \"he\" referenced in the question is an electrician making some sort of mistake.\n2. The options aren't in the proper sequence because they're not related to work or electricity at all. \n3. Option A: work is not necessarily related to what the electrician will find when he touches the wire. \n4. Option B: shocked could be a consequence, but again, it's not related to what the electricity will do or how the electrician is feeling. \n5. Option C: humor sounds like something an electrician would mention when he wasn't feeling good. \n6. Option D: startled and E: funny are feelings that we know the electrician may experience, but they're again not related to work, electricity, or what will happen when the electrician touches the wire.  \n7. Therefore, if he touched the wire he should be surprised when he finds what. \nAnswer: D: startled\n\n### Input:\"A man with two 100w bulb is brighter than a man with one 200w bulb if the first one is at how distance?\" Choices:  A.10 feet B.20 feet C. 40 feet D. 60 feet\n\n### Response:\"A man with two ten watt bulbs is brighter than a men with one twenty watt bulb if the first on is at how distance?\"\n### Rational:\n1. The question implies that two men are working on an oil rig\n2. The question asks how far away each man should be from one another in order to have the ability to read a book\n3. The second man's bulb is in a distance equivalent to the first, which means the second man is brighter than the first\n4. Answers with higher wattage would not equal a higher brightness simply because of their high wattage.\n5. The brightness in the question is not based on the quantity of the bulbs that are lit so the 5th options is not the correct answer\n6. We can infer the man's positions from", "answer": "B: shocked"}
{"text": "C: stable\n\n### Instructions:\n\nWrite a response that appropriately answers the questions given. \n\nInput: A house which had one of its rooms turned into a bar had a situation where many people arrived for an event in the bar, but they would have to wait for everyone to settle down and calm down before they could enter. How long could it be until they could enter the bar? Choices: 1. A: several days B: around a week C: a month D: a day E: just a moment\nRationales:\n1. The question asks for the minimum amount of time before they could enter the bar. Hence, it would be at least 1 day before they could enter, because of how much work has to be done before the bar becomes operational.\n2. A few days (B) and a month (D) are too long, so they can be eliminated.\n3. Around a week or several days (B and C) are too many people to be able to guess easily.\n4. A day (E) is too short.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 1 B: around a week.\n\nAnswer: B: around a week\n\nInput: When you're trying to catch an object, which of these will be a good choice of the available options? Choices: \n1. A: a bowling ball B: a feather C: a rock D: a pillow E: a rubber ball\n2. A: a feather B: a bowling ball C: a pillow D: a rubber ball E: a rock\nRationales: The answer is E: a rubber because it is most likely to not hit your head or break easily. The feather however is most likely to mess up your hair. The rock will have the potential of breaking and hurting you. The ball will also have potential of hurting your head. The pillow will also hurt you if it's too sharp or if you drop it too hard or too fast. So the only option left is the rubber ball. So, the answer to this question is E: a rubbers ball.\n\nInput: In reference to a child who is 8 with no siblings, in reference to a toy, which of these would not be of interest to the child?

It is very probable that drinking will happen at a house party; it is a frequent part of celebratory events where the drinking of alcohol is accepted as an activity for enjoying oneself. \n2. If you go to the house party, you can expect to find people drinking. B: intimacy 3. If there is alcohol being consumed, it is very likely that there is intimacy happening as well. Intimacy is very sensitive subject matter, and thus people typically do not reveal in public that they are intimate with other people. 4. It implies that people in the place are intimate and comfortable with each other, and not inhibited by the presence of others. 5. Thus, it is more comfortable to share intimate details with a romantic partner than with a stranger. C: dancing 6. This is because if there is alcohol, there will be dancing. They will be dancing to the music, to get closer to the people they are dancing with, to drink, and to enjoy themselves. D: happiness 7. Happiness is defined as \"a feeling of pleasure and joy,\" and according to the OED, it is defined as \"an individual having or showing an elevated degree of feelings of happiness; elated, cheerful (in mood or attitude), lively-happy.\n8.

Choices:  a: office c: mall b d e f g \n### Rationales:\n1.The question is trying to figure out the location of a specific device.\n2.Both stairs & escalator require physical transportation which could be any part of the building where it is possible to transverse between floors without having to exert significant physical energy. Such devices include elevator, escalator, etc.\n3.Both stairs and an eslator are means of transportation, not devices (such as clocks).\n4.A suitcase, computer printer and large pieces of paper are devices\n5.An artist's studio involves the creation of art, not a device.\n6.An engineer's office (which, arguably, could involve the creation of art or devices), a courtroom, and a schoolbus all involve the presence of devices and require physical transportation.\n7.Since the question is asking where in a building would one find a device with physical transportation (but not a specific device, like a staircase), one could consider the option of finding a device with physical transportion that is not a specific device (or an escalator is a device that could transport the owner up and down floors, but it is not the same as the physical transportation stairs).\n8.Therefore, the correct answer is C: mall.

Choices: \n### Demonstiration:\nInput: A well known musician has a house built with 36 windows and 6 bedrooms. Which word would the missing? Choices:  \"A\" is missing _ B: house C: windows D: musician E: \n### Rationales: 1. The sentence is talking about one thing that's missing in a sentence. \nSo, in order to provide the missing thing, we need to identify that thing by looking at what options it could possibly be referring to. \n2. A: \"a:\" is the most logical answer, as the question is asking for one missing word, rather than multiple missing words. \n3. The house has been built with windows and there are windows mentioned in the sentence's body, suggesting this is referring to the house and not the musician. \n4. We can also conclude that \"house\" is not the missing word, since we've already been given an example in the sentence itself. \n5. The sentence says the house has 36 windows and six beds, not that a person, a piece of music equipment, or anything else in the sentence contains windows or beds. \n6. The sentence also says that the musician is well known, so this implies that the musician is not, in fact, a well-known bed, window, or house. \n7. \"B: House\" is not the correct missing word either, because if we are referring to the house, the sentence would need to read \"36 windows and six bedrooms and a house,\" which is not what we have. \n8. \"B: house\" is also ineffective because referring to the house as \"one word\" does not make grammatical or logical sense. \n9. So, it's most likely that the missing word is either related to a number of windows and houses or is related to the musical instrument that the musician is known for. \n10. \"B: house,\" however, does not contain either of these meanings.

{"text": "The answer is outside. \n\n### Inputs:This person is saying he was happy within his comfort zone, which at home, was comfortable.  But he had a crippling phobia of getting outside. \n\n#### The question:\nThe question is asking what phobia, or specific fear, the person had the most difficulty overcoming. \nThe option he doesn't have trouble leaving his comfort zone.  He does not have trouble leaving his home (A) and he does not have a phobia of idleness.  He also does not have a phoria of vacationing (C). \nThe answer is outside because that is truly what he does have a phobia about.  He had a great deal of stress, guilt, shame and anxiety about going outside of of his comfort zone. \n\n## Task Analysis\nThere was some confusion about the choice of words.  But these seem to be choices of a very specific meaning.  Outside (B) is where a person typically experiences the most discomfort, fear of the unknown and stress. Idle (D) is not an activity, just the state of being, so it is not an option even if the person does have trouble idling. They would still not have trouble with going idle. The same is true for vacation (C).  I went through the options one by one, eliminating those where I could think of reasonable context that would apply.\n\nI could be wrong about the specificity of these options.  But for this particular question, I believe it was specifically to see if it was the fear of going outside, or something else (maybe the fear of idle, or idle itself, but not going outside), and I believe the confusion with my answer came from my stating that it is the fear of going outside.  However, the question said the answer is outside, so, it would make sense then, that the fear itself is not in any way connected to outside.\n\nThe final example was much more clear cut.  To me, I believe the question was asking for the most obvious example of the person's phobia (having trouble accomplishing). \n\nI used those two questions to show that the test questions are specific for what they ask.  Often, those questions won't be vague like that, but they also won't have answers as obvious as outside.  They will include", "answer": "A: outside"}

{"text": "Rationales:\n1. A: tide pool \nThe answer is a tide pool because it's stated that the crab is scuttling, but he is strained. When one is strained, it means that they're tiring or exerting extra effort, which is not typically associated with a crab. There is no obvious constraint on a crab in the form of a rock, but a tide pool does limit a crab. This means if the tide pools are shallower that there is only enough space for a few crabs to move freely around them, so they have to move very quickly and carefully to avoid any dangers.\nFor example, I can be strained when carrying a heavy load up a steep hill so it's harder for me to move.\n\n2. B: beach sand \nThe answer is beach sand because a beach is a large body of sand covering the area between the water\u2019s edge and the high tide line. This answer is given by the second paragraph.\n\n3. C: tidepoils \nThis is not the answer because the question asks 'impeding him' which means hindering or preventing progress.\n\n4. D: current \nThis is not giving the correct answer because: \n\nThe question asks about a \"different body part for that part of the question you've read, and then make an incorrect but logical assumption-based deduction about that piece of the problem.\nIt only tells about the crab, it does not say whether the crab is moving or not.\n\n\n5.

When the show began, she did what? Choises:  A: persuaded B: slept C - D: did center stage Challenge E: spoke clearly Rationales:\n 1. We know that the lady began her show with the tell story. We should assume that she was also the only one performing.\n 2. By definition, persuasion means an attempt to persuade someone to do or believe something.\n   \n 3. Therefore, the lady can't speak clearly because this would be irrelevant to the actions happening in the scenario. \n \n 4. Also, because we know she is performing a tell story, she can't be sleeping.\n\n 5. Because this information is only available after the show began, the answer of a one-man show is not in place of begin, and this is a logical contradiction as we know they must begin before the show can begin. Lastly, answer C: challenge is also not applicable because the lady can only challenge someone if her story is already being told as a challenge. \n \n\n\n6. The answer of taking center stage (D) is an action that occurs as a direct result of a tell story, as the performer assumes the role of lead performer.\nHowever, the performance in the scenario only takes place after the show has begun. \n\n7. Therefore, we should choose between taking center stage and speaking clearly. \n8. We know the lady's performance did not include sleeping because this does not affect the performance and speaks clearly is unlikely because the show begins with the tell story.\n9.

The idea of business cycles is already covered in the explanation of inflation where inflation can \"lead to deflation and unemployment in the economy\". This also makes the explanation of business cycles more useful; you already covered business cycles that could be useful in answering similar questions.\n\n### Question Input: Where might a fish go if they cannot find their food? Choices:  B: water fountains C: seafood restaurants D: trees E: aquarium\nRationales:\n1. The question is looking for some type of place where a fish could go if they can't find their food. \n2. A tree (E) is not appropriate because a fish needs to have access to an aquatic habitat like water.\n3. An aquarium (A) is unnecessary because it's already a contained environment where the fish could find their food.\n4. A seafood restaurant (C) is not suitable because fish do not usually roam outside their habitat in search of food.\n5. \"Water fountains\" (B) are not specific enough to answer the question, as they could refer to any type of water source. \n6. This leaves us with the answer \"D: trees\" because trees can provide natural food sources for fish, like insects in the rivers and streams that are close to the tree. Fish can easily access this food source, making it an appropriate place to visit in search of their missing food.\n\n### Input Question: In 1906, when did the great San Francisco earthquake occur?

{"text": "The question asked how we feel when we do not have rest. Therefore, the only options are A: exhausted, which does not make sense, given the context. We would not feel exhausted from rest. \nWe would feel exhausted if we did not have rest, because we would not be able to relax and recharge our batteries. This is because we don't know how long the rest would last, so we would not be able or know how to rest for the full length of time to completely recover and feel energized.

{"text": "D: playing marbles\nInput: What is a major event for a person who is experiencing his fifth stroke? Choices: \nA: first event B: last event C: only event D: worst event E: main event\nRationales:1. The question asks about what would be a major event for a stroke survivor. This implies that major events in a stroke survivor's life can be considered unique or singularly interesting or unique. \n2. Option B: \"last event\" doesn't make sense because strokes tend to happen after years of time, not immediately before a single event. Option E: \"main event\" doesn't fit well because the question is discussing all strokes, not just one. 3. Therefore, option A: \"first event\" does not correspond as it implies the first stroke, rather there could potentially be multiple such events (first event meaning the stroke itself). Option C: \"worst event\" doesn't match either because there could be worse events than a stroke.  4. The correct answer is D: \"only event\".

We are asked about which of the five given choices is not included in the bookkeeper's responsibilities.\n\n1. We also know that the correct answer cannot be a choice that already contains all the information given in the question.\n2. Employee performance reports don't include any of the information in the other choices.\n3.

Tennessee could not have tens of thousands of fiddles, as they are an instrument and therefore cannot physically exist on their own, not to mention the fact that ten thousand people cannot all afford to buy one fiddle.\n2. Band practices and orchestras are also places where fiddle players can gather and play their instruments, but only tens of thousands of people in bands and orchestras would be able to play fiddle. \n3. Violin cases, while useful for storing fiddles, only hold a few of them at a time, and it wouldn't be reasonable to expect there to be hundreds of thousands of these cases in a store which sells mostly normal guitars. \n4. In addition, a music store like any other store that sells items only has a finite number of items that it can have at any one time.\n5. Tens of thousands of fiddlers in one place is therefore not an option, so option C: Orchestra is the correct answer.\n\n#### Explanation:\nWe can answer this question by recognizing that the question specifies that a place could have tens of thousands, or 10000, of fiddle players, which means that a place could have this many fiddle players congregate in one place in a short period of time, like in a band or orchestra. \n\n### Input-How could you get your hands on something that most of the time you should get on your knees and give it a go?\n* Choices: A.

In the film, many of the cast members were not allowed to touch the ground as their characters were from another planet.

It would be more accurate to say, for example, \"the Sun has 4 planets\", which makes it accurate and clear. This phrase is too vague to be sure what this statement is asking.\n### Rationales\nThe statement says \"star had\" which means that it has 4 rocky planes. The second sentence says \"which are in a gaseus state.\"\n### Option A: Hollywood\nThis is an overgeneralization statement that means that Hollywood is the basis for science fiction and that it originated from the Star Trek movie. It would be more direct to say that the statement originated from Hollywood.\n### Option B: The Night Sky\nThis option implies that the universe and the sky are the same thing. If the phrase that was used was \"Universe has 4 planets,\" then it would be a more precise and clear way of stating that the sentence should have been accurate, since it is saying that there are four planets in the universe and two of them are rocky and the others are in a gaseuos state. The other option is to say that the statement has 4 planets in the universe, but it is not stating whether it is in a gaseuor state.\n### Option C: The Constellations\nIf this is the case, it would be more appropriate to say that the planet is an alien planet.

This means we're looking for a noun that describes a person's abilities, which are typically referred to by their brain or mind. \n2. A \"strength\" (Choice A) and a \"potential\" (Choice D) are abilities of the mind or brain, not the body. A physical disability such as blindness (Choice C) is unrelated to a person's mind or brain, and may not affect their potential or strength. A \"qualification\" (Choice B) is a noun that describes abilities or personal traits that a person has, but it doesn't necessarily describe the abilities of their mind or brain. Likewise, \"competence\" (Choice E) is a noun related to a person's ability to perform tasks or complete actions, but it doesn' t necessarily describe the brain or mind.\n3. Therefore, the best choice for a disability affecting a person's brain is \"competence\" or \"potential\", since both of these describe mental capabilities. \n4.

Option A: The answer is because he was the first person who could figure out HOW the telephone worked. This means he had the idea and figured out how it would work, not who actually created the invention.\n2. Inventors are typically the person who created a device or invention. So, the inventor is who the device came from, not their name or the name of the company that invented it. \n3. The device is made by the inventor, not after their name. \n4. Option C is not an appropriate response because it doesn't involve an invention. Although option C does relate to the reason we call him the inventor, it is a different reason than the original question. Option C describes why we don't call someone else the inventor of telephones in the present day... which is clearly not the question, but the explanation of the reason we know about other inventors. The word \"why\" in this question means the original intention behind calling Bell the inventor. \n5. Option D involves taking someone and using their name instead of their actual invention. This does not seem to be what the question is asking.\n6. Therefore, the only answer is:  The reason we all call Alexander Graham Bell the inventor of telephony is because he was the person who was the first to figure out HOW the phone worked... which is correct.", "answer": "B: california"}
{"text": "Rationales for A, C, and D: 1. All but the word \"care\" imply a complimentary or complimentary approach. \n2. For options C and D, this suggests that popularity (things many people like or dislike) and not just popularity (a lot of people who you know or interact with) has a lot to do with the choice.\n3.  Both \"know all\" and \"care about\" can be ambiguous because it does not necessarily indicate whether the person being approached is being sought out as a person or not. For instance, it could be interpreted as a compliment to being personable and approachable in any given conversation, rather than someone who knows all the facts about an issue.\n4.  In option A, we can only conclude that the person is being approached because people they care about want to talk to them, which is not necessarily the case if they are popular or respected.\n5. Option A does not work because \"care about someone\" usually implies a close relationship, not a desire to congratulate someone based on respect or popularity. \n6. Option E: understand themselves can be answered in a personal manner or refer to a more general interest in one's feelings rather than popularity.\nRationales for B and E:\n\nOption B does not work because a person would be approached by many people because they care about the well-being of friends and family, not because of compliments.\n\nOption D does not work because the term \"popular\" implies that the majority of people don't really care about that person and their opinions, which is generally what one would refer to as popularity.\n\nOption E does not work because, as stated above, it does not really refer to a specific number of people so it is a bit of a stretch when it comes to a specific answer.\n\nOption C does not work because this is referring to an individual's behavior, rather than their popularity in a general sense.\n\nOption F does not work because \"knowing\" something is different than being \"approached\" by someone with information you already have.", "answer": "D: popularity"}
{"text": "A: The best answer is D: FEEL HAPPY.\n### Reason: \n1. Options A: B: C: D: E: should be rejected because they do not fit the question and the clue. \n2. D is the BEST answer to the question but should not be accepted because it is the simplest answer. \n3. It is necessary to write a response that contains only one part that is true and one part that is false. \n4. Feeling happy satisfies at least the definition of feeling. \n5. There are many types of satisfied people and many ways to choose one. \n6. A satisfied person usually feels satisfied and happiness. The person who feels better than satisfied is the one who has been feeling good enough for a long time, but not for very long, but does not last for very long. The person who has been feeling unhappy is the one who has not been feeling unhappy for a long time.\n7. So the answer is D.\n\n#### Answer:", "answer": "D: feel happy"}

They do not get grades or sit on desks, and they also do not necessarily get the pets answers or attempt to fly answers. What this could mean is they go to school together for breeding purposes.

A : dizzying 2. B : painful C : tiresome 3. C : disdain 4. A : heady 5. B : boring\nRationales: Someone who has fainted will typically begin to awaken after a few seconds. This means being disdainful towards you would mean they would likely already be awake to begin with. Therefore option (C) (disdainful) is the opposite to (A) (faint) in a logical sense. \n\n\n\nInput 1: If someone is sleepy then they 1. A : would eat a hamburger 2. A : would go to sleep 3. A : would have a headache 4. B : would have an appetite 5. A : may be hungover\nRationales: We can infer that if someone is sleepy, then (B) (sleepy) is the reason they have an appetite.

Choices: \u25b3 A: learn circus tricks B: study physics C: become a stuntman D: learn gymnastics E: read a book\n\n### Response and Rationale: D: learn gymnastic\n### Criteria of selection: A) This question is asking 'how you could become an acrobat'. So you have to identify a way you could become an acrobatic. This can be done by identifying components (the nouns) in the question.\nB) The most plausible way you could be an acrobatic is by performing gymanstics, which are a component of both (D) and (E).  They are the same gymnastic, but one is an instance of it, and one is an instance on which it is founded. (E) would be a good answer if (D) was omitted, but (D) is here because there is something wrong in (E). (E) is redundant, because you can learn gymnastic in (D). So (D) is the more plausible choice.\nC) The most plausibel activity you could do to get to acrobat is to become a stunt man, since you can learn circus tricks there.

{"text": "A: redemption.\n\n### Rationale 1: Answering the question requires us to determine the best sentence option that follows a forgiving attitude with an active verb. \nRationale 2: I have analyzed redemption as the best option based on the context. If I have a forgiving person, that means they have shown forgiveness which could result in that person receiving redemption.\nRationale 3: Isolation does not seem appropriate, since a forgiving attitude towards someone does not necessarily mean there is isolation towards someone.\nRationale 4: Absolution does not seem appropriate either because a forgiving attitude towards a person would mean absolving them from consequences or debts, not receiving absolution themselves.\nRationale 5: A feel better doesn't seem to be an appropriate answer, since it would seem unfair to forgive someone and then require them to feel better afterwards.\n\n### Inputs: \n1.

{"text": "When a student wants to hear what their professor is saying, they must listen carefully. \n\nThe question is asking us which response would an a student take in order to hear what the professor says.

Choices:  a: shaking hands b: asking your elders to speak c: standing up d: saying hello \n\n### Response\n\nSaying 'Hello' is a way to show basic respect because it is an acknowledgment of the other person's existence, a fundamental component of basic courtesy in Western society. \n\nWhen you approach a person and ask someone to speak, it shows respect as you are showing that you regard their experience as being equally as important as your own. \n\nSticking to the point is an example of being respectful as it ensures that your own point of view has priority, thereby respecting the other person's time. \n\nShaking hands is a very casual form of acknowledgement which is used in some contexts as an introduction but may not indicate strong feelings of respect. \n\nStanding up is not a way to show respect because although it indicates that you consider their presence to be important, it does not go into any detail to show that you are respecting their words. Shaking hands shows basic respect or acknowledgement, but standing up shows that you value them highly on equal footing to yourself and would consider them to be important in your life. \n\nTherefore, 'hello' is a way to express general respect, 'asking your elders to speak' is a way to indicate a sense of mutual respect,'shaking hands' is a way to acknowledge the other person's presence only and'sticking to the point' is a way to display an attitude of respect. \n1. Hello: Hello is a simple way to acknowledge someone's presence. It is a pleasantry and does not indicate much deeper appreciation for the other person. \n\n## Response: Hello is a very common way to say goodbye.

D: all the options given are sources of information from the internet so the answer is D: all the options \nRationales: The answer can be found in the question. The keywords to look for are the question phrase \"most\" and \"from\" which are words that show that \"most from\" is a prepositional phrase. Phrases are groups of words acting as a single unit (e.g. \"from the internet\" or \"the internet\") that follow a verb or a predicate noun. Since a phrase has to be a single unit, it cannot contain a subject. So, when a question contains a prepositional phrase that contains the subject \"most\", there is always another word that the subject \"from\" is modifying. In this case, option D allows you to see that it's the phrase \"from the internet\" so that is the right answer.\n\n### Input1: When a person is not feeling well they are doing the same activity as they were doing when they were feeling well, choose from the list. 1.

Although there could be temporary situations where a deceased person is sat in a room, that is not what the question is asking for at all.\n\nOption C: She would dig her way out - It's not possible for the deceased to dig themselves out from a grave, so the appropriate answer is A or D.\n\nComment: Can only two different users answer questions at a time in the main section?

{"text": "John hurt his hands punching the wall, which is what the text says is the problem. In the sentence, \"He would be unable to hold tools\", the meaning is that if John had been injured punching the wall he would be unable to hold any tools. John would not be able to hold angry/angry/fist/fists/or hands.\n\nThis is a pretty complicated question. It asks you to find the antecedent of the pronoun \"what\", which is a type of pronoun that points to something else earlier in a phrase. \"When he punched the wall, what was injured?\" \"His hands\" is the most logical response since it matches the example \"bloody hands.\" Here's what I wrote:\n\n> His hands were bloody but when John punched the wall he wasn't thinking about the pain those punches caused; he was focusing on his goals.\n> It wasn't until he had failed in his mission that he realised he'd also injured his very hands.  If his hands were hurt then he wouldn't be able to do anything, not even hold his tools.\n\nAs you may be able to tell I'm being creative with this one. :)  If I was a high scoring student I would be trying my best to only answer questions about people and animals as I'm sure you can get all the animals.", "answer": "E: hands"}

The choice is pantry.\n### Explanation: The reason that we choose pantry is because in our daily lives most people think that the pantry is actually a cupboard. The reason that we would choose the pantry over the cupboard is that cupboard keep our things nice and neat.\n### I thought of kitchen cupboard when I saw this question because if I had this jar I would want to put it in my kitchen where I would know that it would stay nice and cool.\n### Also, I considered the grocery store because a lot of food that goes into the grocery store is actually kept in a cool place that is refrigerated. The reason is because when you put food in the refrigerator it stays nice and cool which will then help to reduce the bacteria growth on that item.\n### So if I had the jar which was likely to be spoiled if left out then I would put it in the grocery store. But then I would think about how the person that is trying to put the item in the refrigerated area would have to show identification or a special pass to even step inside of the place.\n### Also if I had the jar then I would choose the pantry because it's just like a cupboard. The only difference of pantry compared to a cupboard is that the pantry is in the kitchen. What we consider a pantry it's just the cupboard next to the refrigerator where we store food.\n### Because every time you have food and you put it in the refrigerater where the temperature is controlled it will help to reduce the growth of bacteria. \n### In conclusion I would choose to put my jar inside the pantry because I don't need to worry about the bacteria growth as much when the food is put in the pantry.

Choices: \n\nA: airport B: home C: train D: office\n\nRationales:1. We know the question is asking for a place of work, as other places such as schools and restaurants would include places to drink cups of coffee. \n2. We know trains aren't workplaces, but airports and office buildings are. \n3. Even if one were to work at a train (B), one wouldn't find a place to drink coffee in an office as coffee is not made for people to drink at the train station.\n4. Even if one were working at an office, they wouldn't be able to find a place to drink. \n5. At an airport, employees aren't going to help other people with their food and drink, such as employees in restaurants. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: office. \n\nAnswer: C: office", "answer": "E: getting good grades"}

Your first question should be: What is the current employment status of the prospective employee?

The only options that are likely to be accurate are employed and available. If the person is not employed or not looking, then they're not eligible for the job.\n\n* Unemployed (C) is the wrong option, because the employer is trying to create a job for the prospective employee.\n\n* Retired (E) is also wrong, since the employer clearly wants employees who are active and able to work. Retired means that the person is no longer active in employment.\n\n* Over qualified (D) is not appropriate, because if the employee is overqualified, they will most likely be hiring for a different position in a company, as they will not need to go into a job that they already know well.\n\n* Available (B) should be chosen since the person likely wants the job in the scenario.\n\n* Answer: A: employed", "answer": "E: feelings"}
{"text": "I don't understand what you are looking for. I am not good at grammar nor am I a native speaker. And I don't want to do this for my whole life, that's why i'm studying English...\n\n### Input\nAnswer the following multiple choice questions. Where are you located? Choices: 1. Above ground level 2. At sea level 3. Above the moon 4. At the North Pole 5. Below ground level\n\n### Demostration\nRationales: One of the things that is common about all of the answers is that all five are not at ground level. However, we do not know what kind of landmass or terrain our specific location is on, so it is difficult to narrow our options down any further.\n\nEg Above ground level would make sense if our location were a hill - but as we don't know what type of terrain we are on, this is not an applicable answer.\n\nRationales: The moon, as the literal meaning of the word implies, is an object in space. \n\nAs the question asks for a location, however, the moon does not necessarily qualify as a place. As a place, the moon would only be applicable if we happened to be on the moon. Therefore, we can eliminate the moon as a possible answer.\n\n### Rationales\nOption 5: Below ground level:  As per the rationales discussed in answer choice B, we cannot determine whether or not we are on a hill. However, we can determine if we are on an island, because islands are usually not a part of earth's crust and must therefore be located in water. As we can already eliminate answers 2 and 4, option 5 is therefore the most appropriate choice.\n\nOption 1: Above ground level: While it may seem intuitively obvious that option 1 would be the correct answer, the problem with this answer is that we aren't told what kind of landmass we are on. If we are, for example, on a mountain, option 1 would make sense. But if we are on a hill, or if the question had been worded to indicate that we were on an elevated landmass (i.e. a peninsula or headland would suffice), option 1 would not be the correct answer. \n\nIf we can", "answer": "B: emotional distress"}

Choices:  -  A: cleaning bathrooms B: vacuuming C: running from bus stop D: doing the dishes E: putting clothes in dryer\nRationales:\n1. People who don't make their beds before running to a bus aren't vacuuming or cleaning the bathrooms, because their bed is still not immediately on their schedule or to do list.\n2.

This is an active, indefinite verb, indicating it to be a specific thing needed by the balalaika, not a generic role the instrument fills.\nAn orchestra is a collection of musicians who play together (choice E), so a balalaika _could_ be used as a musical instrument, just as any other musician could within the orchestra (choice D).\nAnswer: E: orchestra \n\n### Input :Why do most Americans prefer to have their teeth taken out of their head?\n\n### Response :\n\n> To prevent them from getting cavities, or infectious diseases such as leukemia.\n\n#### Demonstration: The question was asking why most Americans prefer to have one of their teeth removed, rather than use dental floss, and answer could be either because Americans prefer to remove their teeth and have dental implants, or because Americans like to have a tooth taken out.\nAnswer:  Americans prefer dental implants.\n\n\n\n### Input  :Why is George looking at the clouds in the sky on Saturday morning? \n\n### Response  :\n\n> To check the weather.\n\n#### Demostration: We can infer from the clue in the title George is looking at the sky in the morning looking at the clouds in order to check the weather.\nAnswer: To check the weather.", "answer": "D: symphony"}

Sky refers to the appearance of a specific atmospheric condition. We can easily identify air and precipitation as the correct answers. Barometric is defined as \"dealing with, expressing, or measured in barometric pressure\". It does not refer to weather or weather conditions, so it cannot be a synonym of the provided word.

{"text": "The woman was in Illinois while surrounded by other trees.\n### Explanation for the answer choice:\nWe do not know the gender of the woman, which makes the response ambiguous. Therefore the solution involves combining \"was\" with a pronoun.\n\n### Solution:\nThe response: The [pronoun] woman picked from an apple [pronoun] tree while surrounded by other [pronoun] trees, where was she.\n\n### Rationale:\nThe sentence is asking where a woman was when she picked an apple from a tree while being surrounded by other trees. Here's a breakdown of the question:\n1. A: Illinois\n2. B: Woods\n3. C: New York\n4. D: Indiana\n5. E: Farmers Market\n\nThe answer is Illinois. We can do this based on the following:\n1. The first part of the question (the woman picked from an apple) must be a fact.\n2. We don't know if it would be impossible to have an apple tree and other trees in the same place.\n3. Therefore the first part can also be the second part.\n4. Thus we can conclude the second part (the tree) must be in Illinois (the woman was with the apple).", "answer": "B: woods"}

{"text": "A: air (or a breeze) from a train station can only be found in a train station, not a house, cupboard, or cricket stadiums. The same is true of an airplane's baggage hold. Similarly, air (or a bicycle breeze) originating from the surface of the earth can only be found outside the surface of the earth. So we shouldn't have to consider choices B: house C: cuboard. The same is probably true of D: cricket stadiums. So to find the answer we need only consider choice E: surface of earth.\n\n### Input\nIt is clear in the original question that the air breathed by just a few people recently must be air from inside a closed-in space. The only closed-in spaces we can envisage being filled with air are houses, airplanes, baggage holds, or ships. The question also specified that the place from which air originates must not have been accessed by a large number of people recently. If a closed-in space has recently been entered by a large number of individuals, the air contained within has already been \"breathed\" by those individuals.

For example, an office park could house many different companies but not have offices that are always busy producing products.\n3. Choice B is not the answer because government buildings typically are not busy producing products all of the time.\n4.

The question is comparing the different groups that do and do not need a doctor. This refers to a particular kind of doctor, which is a specific healthcare professional, as opposed to all healthcare specialists. \n2. A doctor is a doctor, and they all need doctors. \n3. People cannot be described as the doctor's office. At most, they would be the patients in the doctor's office, so this is ruled out. A doctor's office is definitely not the same as their professionals themselves. \n4. Additionally, a hospital does not necessarily require a person, much like doctors do. Hospitals still generally require nurses, physicians, administrative staff, and other workers, such as housekeepers and other care providers. \n5. Nursing homes are definitely not healthcare professionals, so we can eliminate option B. \n6. Therefore, the only choice that has doctors in it is option C: a doctor's practice, which refers specifically to the doctor profession. \n7.

{"text": "Based on the provided information, the correct choice and best response is option C \u2013 stupid. \n\n### Rationale:In the provided scenario, it is indicated that people are purposefully harming each other. This doesn't simply suggest cruel (E) behavior; it instead suggests purposefully antisocial (i.e., harmful).\n\nIn the context of the given scenario, option D \u2013 cruel does not make sense. Although people can be cruel (E), they can also be cruel (E) for several reasons other than being purposefully antisocial. Further, option A - deceptive is not an answer choice for the following reasons:\n\n1. Deceitful behavior can be purposeful and/or unintentional.\n2. Deception can occur for other reasons, too, such as to protect oneself or others from harm.\n3. Deception does not necessarily mean that the offender will also harm the other person.\n4. In the context, there isn't even any mention of deception being used as a means to harm another person.\n\nOption B - altruistic is not an answer choice because altruistic individuals always do good; harmful individuals can also be altruistic. Option B - altruist is just a synonym for option B - altruism. Option C - stupid is the best choice because stupidity is being used as an intentional reason to harm someone else, whereas options A, B, and D lack intentionality.\n\nOption D - cruel is not the best choice because intentional harmfulness is being used as a reason to harm someone else. Option E \u2013 agressive is not the best choice for several reasons, including the following:\n\n1. Aggressive can be used as a noun for one's mindset or temperament or to mean being harmful.\n2. However, the given scenario suggests that intentional harmfulness rather than harmfulness alone is the cause of the behavior.\n\n### Input-Output examples\n\nInput: Which of the following statements about the word \u201cenjoyable\u201d is false?

{"text": "Input: Where would a ficus plant in a room? Choices:(1)A: middle east B: pots C: beds D: dictionary E: palace\nRationale: 1. The word 'brighten' can only be interpreted as \"to make (something) brighter or more luminous\". We know that plants absorb and release light in the form of photosynthesis, so it is most likely that the ficus plant is used to increase light levels in a room. The plant might make a room look more \"brighter\" or \"luminous\", or it might indirectly help to brighten the room by increasing the natural light. So, we should look for an option that mentions brightening a 'room'. \n2. The ficus plant (A) doesn't mention anything about increasing light levels in a room and is therefore not a correct answer. \n3. The plant is not used specifically in pots (C). \n4. The plant most likely is NOT used to brighten a bedroom, and is likely not used to brighten the apartment either (D). \n5. A ficus plant would be unlikely to be used in a palace, since a palace is far larger than an apartment. \n6. A dictionary (B) and a palace (E) both mention a ficus plant. And a dictionary often associates words with images, so that would indicate that the dictionary is not simply a list of words, but includes images and ideas as well. To say the ficus plant is in a dictionary would only make sense if the dictionary is a large volume that has images and more context about the word. Therefore, a dictionary would not brighten a room like the option stated. \n7. Option (E) mentions the ficus plant could be found in a palace, however, it is irrelevant regarding the prompt. The answer we choose in this case is D: dictionary.\nAnswer: D. The word 'brighter' means to make (something) brigher or more luminous\n\n### Input : What isn't a way to know how many stars are in the Milky Way galaxy?

{"text": "D: military installation\n\n### Rationale:\n\n1. \"Vast complex\" can refer to a large number of things, but the focus of the question is on the launch pad, which is the only piece of infrastructure mentioned that would have a military significance. Therefore, the military installation is the most likely answer. \n2. As movie (A) and spaceship centre (B) are not typically locations where missiles or rockets are launched, and neither do cape kennedy (C) or space center (D) refer to a military launch pad, they are not appropriate choices. \n3. However, A, B & C are all options that can refer to launch sites, which means we should rule them out to eliminate these as the answer.\n4. The question is also asking for a part of a launch site, which doesn't necessarily have to be the military installation, but the military installation is certainly a part of the launch site.\n5. Therefore, it makes the most sense to say that it was a vast complex, and the launch pad was just part of what was referred to as the launch site, therefore the military installation is an acceptable answer choice.\n\n### Input:- How long was it  for you  to get your own set of plates after becoming an adult? Choices:-  A: not long B: few years C: long D: many years\nAnswer: B:  few years\n\n### Rationales:-\n\n1. \"Becoming an adult\" and \"got your own set of pltes\" don't necessarily refer to the same concept.\n2. This means that \"becoming an adult\" doesn't really refer to an exact age, and plates can't possibly be made for someone who hasn't become an adult yet. \n3. There is no reason to believe plates could suddenly be made for a person who hadn't gotten them yet. \n4. Therefore, the plates should have already been made (as it isn't possible to suddenly get plate after age 00), so getting it from this information would mean the time spent looking for plates, or the actual time spent buying it is the likely answer, and looking for it is something adults would likely not have done while they were children, so buying plates was most likely the adult's first time.\n\n### How is this", "answer": "C: space center"}

In the question we know we should use 'defunct' because the previous sentence says: 'It was a fond memory of...the now-defunct zoo.'\n\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: If you wanted to make a salad you would cut the lettuce, carrots, and cauliflower, and then you would also put celery, onion, and parsley in the blender, what else could you use to make your salad?

Any other time reference in the question is either referring to a circumstance relating to a person's work, like needing to do work, or a result of a person's circumstance, like difficulty.\n\n**Choice:**\nWe can eliminate choice C because it refers to a circumstance and does not specifically call out time.\n\n**Choice E:**\nPhrases relating to impatience are not related to time.\n\n**Option B:**\nThis is the only one of the four phrases that specifically mentions time, and it is referring to appointments. \n\n**Choice B:**\nWe can assume that people want to do their work (e.g., a doctor's appointment is for the purpose of receiving healthcare to do with an illness or injury, not for entertainment). \n\n**Choice: B**\nTherefore, the correct answer is choice B - having appointments.\n\n### Input A word that is used to describe the feeling of displeasure because of having to do the dirty work.

{"text": "Input:Where should a person who is interested in becoming a pilot find more info? Choices: A: the library B: the airport C: online D: a friend E: a professional organization\nRationales:This question asks for a location to find more info about becoming a pilot. The location can be either online or in person, so it's worth noting that the airport is not the correct answer.\nOption D, a friend could actually help by recommending other resources or giving their own advice on how to become a pilot. However, they would not be a location that could provide more information on the subject.\nOption A, the library, could be helpful as long as the person knows what section to go to and what materials to look through, which could prove difficult without any prior knowledge of flying planes.\nAnd, option E, a professional organization, could also be a source of information about the process of becoming a pilot, but it would likely not be a primary location for learning more about that subject.\nTherefore, the answer to this question is option C, online.\n\nInput: What type of person would often be seen wearing a black hat that is also large and round?

The choice B: gangster is often associated to criminal activities, which is why you can associate it to a large black hat and make the association.\n4.

The choice C: gangster is not likely to be correctly answered, as it's not as strong of a relationship as B: gangster and gangster.\n6.

Given the information from the question, it is assumed that the potatos have been bought.\n\n2. \"Potatos\" are a noun and can take the place of \"them\" in the sentence.\n\n3. Any sentence in which you are carrying something must use the past tense. \n\n4. Therefore, the correct answer is: You carry potatos home in a farmer's market.\n\n#### Answer\nChoices: A: grocery sore B: grocery bags C: Restaurants D: Farmer's market E.

Given the context of the question, the answers should obviously be those involving an object that is able to carry the mass that is too big for the hand to carry.\n2. The correct answer is D.

It is also unlikely a person would carry moisturizer with them in their purse.

The question is looking for the city which has a large number of offices.\n2. Given that a typical skyscraper is home to many office workers who go to work every day, the answer is most likely to be C. This makes sense because a skyscraper would likely have the largest number of offices of any business type.\n\n### Input : Which of the following is the most effective thing about a house? Choices  A: a dog B: a backyard C: windows D: security system E : security gates  F: cameras G: alarms\n\n### Response\n\nHaving cameras placed around a house is one of the more effective methods of keeping it and its belongings safe.  Cameras could potentially deter burglary and other crimes.\n\n### Justification\n1. The question asks \"which of the following is the best effective of a house\". It isn't asking what the most preferred thing is; only what's the best effective.\n\n### Example: Which is the more effective of these two sentences: A: If the president had been more prepared, he might have done better in the conference with the king. B: If the president had not been more prepared, he likely would not have done so well in the conference with the queen.\n\n### Answer: C\n\n### Rationale:\n\nThe correct answer is C because it doesn't make any sense to consider B over A, so B is clearly incorrect. Similarly, it doesn't make sense to consider D over C since C is more accurate than D.\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe first sentence states that the president would have done better in his conference with the king if he had been more prepared. It then immediately goes on to state that if he hadn't been more prepared, he would likely not have done so well. But A isn't saying that if the president hadn't been well prepared, he'd likely NOT done so well. It's already assumed that he wouldn't have done as well if he hadn't prepared, so the word \"likely\" doesn't change this fact.\n\nThe second sentence is similar, but it", "answer": "B: skyscraper"}
{"text": "```\nHe would finally see idea becomes reality, never in a millions years did he know that this would could happen?\n```\n\n\n### Input and Rationale: The question asked if option A or B: patent was the correct answer. To answer this question, we need to go through the steps of a specific type of patent application, then identify if we can find any information that is applicable to the given example of \"idea become reality\" before the end.\n\n```\n    The first thing you need to know is that there are only a few types of patent. The two main type of patents are Utility and Design patents (https://www.nyus.org/services-for-inventors/legal-affairs/protect-your-inventions/patent-applications/pursuing-a-utility-or-design-patent). Design patents protect the external ornamental elements of a product, while utility patents protect the functionality of a product in terms of its performance or usage (ex. how it works, or how it's used).\n\n    Then, we need to identify which type of patent was applied for. To do this, we can look at the question where the text reads \"patent\". This usually indicates that a Design patent was applied for, not Utility.\n\n    Now if a patent was applied for Design, we need to determine if the design was applied for under a Design Patent or a Copyright (copyright law cannot be applied for products, only media such as a song or book). A Design patent is for a specific ornamental design of a product, while a Copyright is for a unique configuration of features on a product (https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/102).\n\n    To identify this, we can look for information about the product. In our given example, we can determine through text that this product is a shoe because the nugget of gold weighs 14kg. Using this information, we can determine it is most likely a Design Patent because the ornamental design on the product has been patented (notice we did not say the product itself).\n\n    Now that we we've identified if this was a Design or Copyright patent, we can continue analyzing the question. To answer this, we", "answer": "A: think"}

The question is about a person's home (as this is referenced in the 'are often brought to...their home they came from'), so it's a stretch to suggest that they are brought to E: south africa as this is a misrepresentation of the question's intent. \n\n2. This means they could be brought to places that are not south africa, such as B: research laboratory. \n\n2a. We know this is possible because a research laboratory would have the ability to house and test on captive monkeys.

In option D: treetops, we can see that this relates to the question's mention of a monkey's home, as it suggests a 'home-like' type of environment. However, we can be certain that option D: treetop cannot apply to the question's context because in option D we can see that there are monkeys, which indicates that it must at least partly apply to the question.

Choices: \n A: a red leather book \n B: a pile of apples \n C: a green couch \n D: a pair of scissors \n E: a table \n F: a blue car \n F: a red cat\nG: a green car \n H: 2000 dollars \n I: a brown sofa\n Answer: I: a brown sof.\n\n### Explain the steps taken:\nWhen deciding an answer, I went through an EBI to make sure I didn't forget anything. I first decided which information was relevant to this task before I did any analysis. The relevant information was given in the sentence: \"last fall you passed through the forest\" the book, couch, car and cat are irrelevant details. This is because there is no relevance to the topic and the question doesn't specify what 'appears after you pass'.\n\nI used the SQ3R reading skills technique to go through the passage. My reading strategy enabled me to get a deeper understanding of the text. From this I was able to establish the passage as fact through EBI. My reading strategy was further developed by using comprehension. I have been using this method to read every day to make sure I understand what I learn. \n\n### Justification:\nI chose the best answer among the choices because it is the only answer that has no irrelevant information. The book, car, cat and couch are not necessary to the answer because they are mentioned as irrelevant details that don't need to be factored in. The green couch isn't relevant because couches appear in homes rather than forests, the red leather book can't be answered because the text doesn't say you saw a book, it could have been anything. And as for the pair of scissors there isn't specifics to what the \"pile\" is as it could be anything. I also chose to skip the green couch as it is irrelevant.

This is a direct contradiction because the steakhouses outside the South do not need to be in Texas; in fact, he cannot travel to Texas in this scenario because he just left Texas for Florida.\nB: Michigan -- James visited The best steakhouse in Michigan is in Detroit, but this steakhouse does not have to be the best steakhouse out of  the entire South.

If you were looking at someone getting ready to play a game of baseball, you might ask them, What can you do to prepare to avoid getting tired?

A major difference between plumbing that brings in water and plumbing that takes water in is that the first one refers to a connection that brings water into a building, whereas the second refers to a connection that takes water out. \n\n2. One type of plumbing may bring water in and the other takes it out, but this does not necessarily refer to the drinking water or indoor use of water - there are also pipes in place for other purposes even within the same building. For this reason, we exclude choices C and D as they do not apply to the different types of plumbing.\n3. We also know that water fountains and own plumbing provide drinking water, which means they can be referred to as plumbing that provides drinking water - although again, it would only be for drinking, which is not the same as drinking water. \n4.An oil refinery only has plumbing that is used for processing and refining oil, so this is not suitable as a kind of plumbing that provides water. \n5.

Choices: 1. A: warehouse 2. B: parking lot 3. C: yard 4. D: construction\n5. E: none of these\nRationale: A warehouse (1) is only needed when storing building materials, but it would not be used (or accessible) during a current building construction project. Similarly, a parking lot (2), while used for storing heavy machinery temporarily, could not be used for storage during a building site. Also, an architect (5) is not present on a building site, but he/she is likely to visit the site to supervise the project. Similarly, construction (4) might be present at a building site but not necessarily used for storing building supplies. The answer is B in this case: parking lot.\n\n### Input:\"The word choice\" is the subject of the sentence below.The word choice implies that the person speaking of it has made a choice.

Option D: watch store does not meet the criteria as it is more of a general description than a specific action. The correct answer is option E: pawn, as it identifies a location where an item such as a wristwatch can be sold for quick money.\n\n### Input:\"She is still sleeping with her eyes open.\" What is she displaying? Choices: A: irritation B: distraction C: disrespect D: fatigue E: sleep\n\n### Response\nThe sentence \"She is still sleeping [verb]... [subject]\" is a statement. Given a verb and a subject the answer will correspond directly with the subject. The subject in the answer will correspond to the person in the question, whereas the verb answers how the person is feeling. This means that if we know the answer includes a verb, we can eliminate each answer which does not include a verb or the verb does not represent a feeling. \nA: irritation and B: disrespect indicate an action or quality of the person. Since these indicate a possible action towards the person, they cannot represent a feeling. C: fatigue is an incorrect answer, because it is an action or quality of sleep and not an emotion. D: sleep would indicate the subject is asleep. However, the question clearly indicates the subject is not asleep. The correct answer is E: sleep as the subject shows this quality. The question is asking how the person feels, and an object can only represent subjective feelings.\n\n### Response:\"I feel like I'm getting sick.\" What would best replace the bolded word? Choices:\nA: sick B: I feel that C: sick D: am sick E: am I sick F: I'm sick\n\n### Instructions:Replace the bolded word with an answer which is a feeling, not an action, not a quality, and not an object that belongs to the subject.\n\n### Answer:\"I feel [Feeling].\"", "answer": "C: hock"}

{"text": "Demonstration complete.\nRationales: The first thing to do is determine the key point of the question: Sammy. The next thing is determine what Sammy wants to do: go somewhere. We must now determine which of those things is being asked. Since I cannot determine whether Sammy is talking about his actions or his location, I cannot determine whether the question is asking about where Sammy wants to go (the place), or the resultant state Sammy will be in when he's arrived (going or arrived). Once I can understand what the question is asking, it's easy to determine that we're looking for where, rather than what state he'll be in. Then, I know what part of the question I am answering. Therefore, the choice \"D: apartment\" is incorrect, as the word 'where' isn't in that choice. The next choice on the list \"E: roadblock\" is incorrect, because the context of the question doesn't involve a roadblock. The word \"the people\" is telling us more about where Sammy needs to go, rather than what place he needs to go. For that reason, \"C: populated areas\" is incorrect, as well, since it implies he's talking about more people. Since we've already determined that the answer can't start with the word \"where\", and since this choice can, this is why \"B: race track\" and \"A: race track\" are incorrect answers. So, our answer is \"where people are,\" or \"where the people are.\" \n\n### Input (same as above):Sammy wanted to go where the people were. Where might he go?

{"text": "Input: How could one have a funeral that was the opposite of a gathering? Choices: \n1. A: a celebration B: a party C: a rave D: a wake E: an open-casket funeral \nRationales:\n1. The phrase is very specific in the description of a funeral, so no option can be ruled out as an incorrect answer. \n2. The phrase mentions that a funeral is the opposite of a gatherings, so the options that we can eliminate are any that do not involve gatherings. \n3. As a gathering typically involves the concept of meeting with others, 1: a celebration, and 4: a rave do not work. \n4. Since a wake (5) is when family and friends visit with the body of the person who died, it may be considered to be associated with a larger community of people rather than a smaller group, which would not necessarily indicate gathering as the phrase suggests. \n5. Option 3: an open casket funeral could involve people viewing the body of the person, but would not necessarily involve gathering since people are generally not interacting in any way, rather they are simply standing and looking at a body. \n6. This leaves us 2: a party and 6: a fun, which both can involve gathering larger groups of people, thus being the correct answers. As the question is asking specifically for opposites of gathering, neither 5: an open casket or 7: a calm down are the appropriate answers. One could argue that either option, because they relate back to gathering could be correct however, a party (2) is the most correct answer as it is the most obvious, because it contains the words people in the meaning of a party, as in people gathering.\nAnswer: 2: A party and 6: A fun\n\n### Input If a pizzeria had a free pizza for a 6:00 closing time, do the manager and employees have too make up 25 free pizzas by 7:00 o'clock?

Choices A: true B: false\n\n### Response\nWhen visiting a park, one can generally eat an apple without a major problem. However, there are some limitations regarding how you would be able to eat the entire apple without any problems. For instance, in the case of an outdoor park that contains large amounts of sand and dirt, it is possible that someone's clothing might get dirty by touching the apple or eating bits of it. Additionally, if someone were to eat an entire apple then it is unlikely that they could find a piece of apple with which to wrap. To solve this problem, someone could bring their phone along, and they could take photos or selfies throughout the park before eating their apple which are taken from the left and then the right side as well as up into the sky.

Choices:  a: eating healthy b: going to the gym c: eating at home d: working out at home e: restructuring your daily schedule to include more exercise\n\n### Demostration:\nRationales: In my interpretation, the question is asking for which is more important: going to the gyn, working out at home, or restructuring your daily routine to include more exercise. Since we only have \"eating healthy\" here as an option, I am assuming the question is not about what is more important for eating healthy.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. Eating is a verb, so it's incorrect here.  \n2. You can't go to the gin on its own, you have to take it to the gym.  \n3. You have to eat there first then go in order for this to be correct.  \n4. You can't workout at home since it's the verb for exercising.  \n5. Also, restructuring your daily time to include more exercise can be done outside of the gym. So, this one doesn't fit the question\n6. It's the same as 2, but is stated differently\n7. The point of the question is to decide which is more important between the gym and restructuring. You can't restructure from the gym! \n8. Therefore, it must be restructuring, since going to the gym is only a step to restructuring, and not restructuring by itself.\n9.

The key information is that John and James spend most of their time communicatipng, they are slowed down because the communication slows them or takes up a majority of their time.  \nI believe the answer is: E - Collaboration, because the answer has to be something that communicating has a negative impact on.

{"text": "The correct answer is C: Band because the band is composed of many different musicians, and it's likely that one of them will be playing the cello.\n\n### Discussion:\nBecause a \"band\" is an informal group of musicians, it doesn't necessarily indicate a specific number of people. Additionally, the word \"band\" is often used to refer to a type of music, rather than a specific group of people. Therefore, it's safe to assume that any group of musicians could potentially include someone playing the celli.\nTo answer the question, we need to consider the context and what information is being requested.\nIn this case, we're asked which group of musicians is most likely to include someone playing the celo. Since a \"symphony\" is a highly formal and structured type of music, it's unlikely that someone playing the cell will be in that group. Additionally, an \"ocean\" is an informal term used to refer vaguely to the sea, so it doesn't make sense that someone playing the cello would be in that group.\nThe answer to the question, then, is that an informal group of musical people, such as a \"band,\" is the most likely to include someone who plays the cello.", "answer": "B: symphony"}

Therefore, we can reason that the \"what\" was the spool and Sally was trying to reach for it. \n- It wasn't the child's hand that slipped from her fingers since when she was trying to reach for the spool it wasn't from a child's hand.\n- The last straw: this means the final limit of the spool will fall down when there is no more wind, so  it doesn't make sense to have these words in the sentence.\n-Hobby shop: She was holding the kite while standing in the hobby shop but Sally's carelessness costed her her kite.

Gas station (A) sells gasoline in canisters and in pumps, so it would be unlikely to find a phone booth there. City (C) doesn't mention anything about telephones. \n3. London (D) was referenced to describe the city as a whole because there wouldn't be any individual telephone booths located in the city's centre (C). Train stations (E) could perhaps have telephone booths, but generally speaking they are more suited for calling trains and other employees. \n4. Therefore, the best choice is B: city. As cities have a large number of people and telephone booths are useful for communicating with them, there are more telephone book in cities.\n\n### Input1: In which of these could you find a lighthouse?

C: A city. 4. D: An attic. 5. E: A house\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The airport isn't the best option, because if you're there to go on a plane, there wouldn't be much walking around from lighthouses.\n2. The attic (E) isn't an appropriate place because no one actually works by sitting in an attic.\n3. While a gas station (B) can have the tools necessary to repair a lighthouse, that doesn't mean they provide lighthouses. \n4. The city (C) could have a water source, as cities sometimes have fountains and refineries.\n5. A house (D) should also be ruled out since only a small amount of time would be spent maintaining the lighthouse. Therefore, the best", "answer": "B: city"}

{"text": "### Rationale\n\n\n\n### Input A: Fairy Tale\n\nInput: Where is the small knight likely to found? 2. Where could you find a small knight? Choices: 1. A: Fairy tale 2. B: Castle 3. C: middle ages 4. D: Chess board 5. E: Doll house\nThe small knight is typically found in a fairy tale, as this is where they are typically from. \nCastles are often described as settings for epic tales, like a setting for a story of some war-like hero. \nThe middle is described as the \"middle ages\" which describes a period of time, not a place. \nChess boards are objects on which chess is played. \nA doll house would most certainly not describe a place a small knight would be found. \n\n### Rationales\n\n1. The first sentence in the question is unclear about where specifically the small knight could be found. The question could be referring to something more generic where \"knights\" could be found, or it could be specifying a particular place, with the word \"found\" modifying \"fairy\" as a title, and the word \"this\" referring to a fairy tale. \n1. This type of reference is typical of writers and speakers when referring to a place that the listener is familiar with, so they use a more specific example to illustrate the broader point. \n2. When a listener is familiar with the thing being talked about, it allows them to fill in the blanks between the words and form a more specific idea in their head about the type of place being described. \n3. Fairy tales are typically fantastical and typically not part of this world. In this context, a fairy tale could be anywhere where \"knights\" would be able to be found. \n4. In short, the fairy tale is the type of place where one could find a \"small knight\". Therefore, A: Fairy tale. \n\n## Inferences\n\n**_Use the template below to make additional inferences._**\n\n### Inference A: Small knights are likely to be more familiar in fairy tales than in any of the other available choices. \n\n## Discussion\n\nHere is an additional prompt for discussion of this", "answer": "D: chess board"}

Choices:  a. The eye of the stair b. The mouth of the cave c. The doorway to the soul d. The entrance to the cave e. The eye of the cave\n\n### Response \u2013\n\nIf a person\u2019s eyes are their window to their soul, then their soul is in their mind, not their body. The body is a physical part of a person. Thus, I don\u2019t see what any of this has to do with a room they would be most comfortable in? Therefore, the most logical answer is:\nIf they are comfortable in a room, this would be in their mind, and therefore, it is not connected to their soul. This has nothing to do with the soul, which is located in the mind, not the body.\n\nThe question is asking for a physical place where a person would feel the most comfortable. \u201cEye of the Cave\u201d may be the metaphorical and symbolic significance, but that has nothing to do with actual physical places. The question is about comfortable places, not places with metaphorical or symbolic meaning \n(which is why the answer should be A)\n\nI can't come up with an answer based on your metaphor.\n\n### Answer for Task: The Eye of the Soul\n\nAn example of a room that would be comfortable for you is a place like your living room. However, the phrase \"eye of the soul\" doesn't really lend itself to a physical room or a place that would hold any physical aspect of your soul.

The choice has to be the answer to the original question since the question is why the priest was pushing for more orthodox behavior.\n2. We need to find the correct answer for what kind of behavior the priest pushed for. \n3. It would make sense that the behavior in question would be heretical since heresy indicates unorthoed behavior (that which goes against what is supposed to be done, in this case, orthodox). \n4. We know that there can't be heretical orthodox behavior, so option B: heretical is the answer.\n5. Option C: recalcitant means to be stubborn or difficult to change.

A: different implies that there are varying acceptable behaviors for different groups, whereas the statement is implying that acceptable behaviors may be different for the same group under different circumstances.\n3.

{"text": "There is no correct answer to this question.\n\n## Solution:\n\n1. To solve this question, first make assumptions about the answer choices. For example, a jigsaw puzzle (A) needs lots of little pieces and is more complex. A chess game (B) is more complicated and requires a lot of pieces. A puzzle box (C) and a jigsaw puzzal puuxle (E) would both need different pieces. A jigsaw puzzal box (D) just seems to repeat the question.\n\n2. Now look at the question and determine the answer choices that could possibly be correct, given the question.\n\n     So there are three options that could be correct: a jigsaw puzzel puuxle, a jigsaw puuxle box, and a jigsaw puxxle puzzle.\n\n3.

A jigsaw puuxl puxxle or a puuxle jigsaw puxxl do not begin with a jigsaw puxul box, so these are not the answer.\n\n5. A jigsaw box puxlu puzzle (B) doesn't seem correct, because it does not only mean that the jigsaw puzzlu puxlu is made out of one piece. Another way to write this answer is to state that it is impossible to make a jigsaw box out of only one piece.\n\n5. In this case, the correct answer is D a jigsaw puuuls puxxle, because only the last part of the answer requires that a jigsaw puul box be made out of one piece, and everything else is not needed to answer the question.", "answer": "C: puzzle box"}

If they excelled, we are more likely to see their favorite subject as something they are good at. \n\nTherefore, in our question, the answer has to be a subject they are good at but may not be a subject they excelled at.\n\n\nAnswer: C: math \n\n```\n\n```\n\nComment: While this might answer the question, it doesn't explain how or why the solution works.

{"text": "I believe that a lover is likely to want to do all of the following:\n\n- Make love (D)\n- Complete (E)\n- Fall in love (C)\n- Build a family (A)\n- Distance themselves (B)\n\n### Justify:\nAs a lover, your desire is to have love with your partner for you and your family to live a happy, healthy life. So, you are likely to want to do one of a few things: \n\n- Make love: This is a physical act which signifies your love is unconditional, so you are likely to want and pursue this. \n- Complete: You would want to provide and maintain your family as much as possible, which involves completing some things such as completing home projects and finishing errands so your S.O can enjoy their free time with family. \n- Fall in love: This is the act of starting a romantic relationship with someone where the desire is to be with them for an extended period of time. \n- Build a family: This is the process of raising a family, which requires an understanding of the individual, the person you love, as well as yourself. This way you can determine what needs to be done in order for the romantic partnership to remain successful, both in raising a family and developing a relationship.\n- Distance itself: While this is a verb, it would mean that you would want to remove some space between you and your partner. This should not be confused with \"distance oneself\", a phrase which typically refers to a relationship or group that is no longer compatible and desires to separate. \n\nTherefore, we can conclude that a lover is most likely to want to do B, C, D, and E. If the only verbs were complete (E) and distance oneself (B), I may have said more like A, D, E, and B. This is because the only thing missing that you may not have thought about was building a family. It's not something we all do, so it may not be obvious at first. Additionally, the choice A may feel awkward because people nowadays may consider \"family\" and \"love\" different things. \"Completed family\" is used now, but completing something, especially a family, indicates you're already in a romantic relationship.\n\n### Additional Supports:", "answer": "C: make love"}
{"text": "The question is asking someone who is looking for new things in their life. We should not be depressed, welcome change, or pay bills.\n\n### Logic: One might experience welcome change in life when they open themselves to different possibilities. Alternatively, paying bills can be a way you maintain a balance in your life. However, these types of experiences and feelings wouldn't typically be a result of a person who is actively or intentionally looking for new things in themselves. \n\n### The correct answer then, is A: become depressed. This may seem an odd or unexpected answer, but one of the most important facets of personal growth and development is self-awareness. If someone is actively seeking opportunities for personal change, they are probably more likely to realize that they are not being happy and fulfilled. If this is the case, they should be able to appreciate experiencing depressive feelings.", "answer": "B: welcome change"}

This suggests that she changed her position, which would've exposed her to the environment differently (e.g. removing the blanket), so she would feel herself warm up further, or feel the cold breeze, which made her blush. \n4. As a result, her body temperature would rise and she would be \"hot\" (B). \n5. To be \"feeling comfortable\" (C) would mean that she wouldn't have changed her position under the blanket and remained there. \n6. If her body remained the same temperature, then there is no difference between hot and \"hot\", so she could not feel uncomfortable and comfortable.\n7. Therefore, her body temperature would either rise to its warmest and highest state, or begin to fall before she was \"comfortable\". \n8. This suggests she would eventually cool and become \"cold\" (D), as she started the activity, because the film, book, etc. would need some form of interaction for it to start, and that interaction would cause her body temperature to change.\n9. This leaves \"blush' as the only option that fits all the requirements. As a result, the most relevant answer is \"blush\".\n10. As a side note - the answer is not blushing \"as she blushed.\" This would not make sense grammatically.\n```\n\n### Input:'The last known person on this ship was you'\n\n### Response;\n```\nExplanations: 1. The correct answer must be a noun as the question is asking who the last person on the ship was, and nouns describe people.\n2. A \"person\" would not be fitting the grammatical patterns of the sentence since it's a plural word, meaning there would be more than one person on that ship.\n3. Although \"anyone\" is a noun, it would not fit in this situation as the question asks for the last known living person, and the word anyone would imply that at least one", "answer": "B: feel more comfortable"}

Choices: 1. A: cloud cover 2. B: heat index 3. C: pressure 4. D: visibility 5. E: barometric pressure\n\n### Rationales:\n1. There are many atmospheric conditions that would qualify as \"weather changes\" but only the two listed correspond to a meaning that is relevant when the question asks if something were as it was before the weather changed.\n2. The answer is not heat index or pressure since none of the listed choices can be modified by humans.\n3. Cloud cover is something that can be created by humans or changed by humans through weather modification activities. But this isn't relevant since the question asked about how weather is affected by human activity and not how it is influenced by nature.\n4. The question isn't asking \"what's changed,\" it's asking what isn't as it was before the change. This requires that the answer must have changed and so option Visibility (the second item listed) is not the correct answer.\n5. Barometric pressure rises and falls all the time in accordance with human activity and the weather, so the change in barometric pressure, alone, shouldn't be counted as a reason to conclude it wasn't as it was prior to the weather change.\n6. Therefore, the correct answer is E: barometric pressure. As it says, barometric pressure is decreased by human activity, whether it's a weather modification activity, a plane flying by, driving a car down a paved street, etc; it doesn't have to be rain clouds or bad weather in general. \nAnswer: E: barometric pressure \n\n### Instructions:Answer the question by choosing the word/phrase that best completes the sentence.  \nInput: When the person arrives at the gate, what action will he", "answer": "D: doctor himself"}

{"text": "Input: In which of these does your house take the longest time to cool? Choices: A: in winter B: in the summer C: with the flip of a switch D: with the flip to another switch E: with the flip or change \nRationales:\n1. \"the flip of a switch,\" \"the flip to another switch,\" and \"with the flip or change\" are incorrect because they are not ways your house could cool.\n2. \"With the flip of a Switch\" and \"with the flop of a switch\" make mention of a particular switch located somewhere and how that switch has the ability to cool your house. It doesn't answer the question.\n3. \"with the flip to another\" is irrelevant because it uses a different switch to cool your home rather than the one in the question. It does not say where this switch is located. It makes no mention of it being in the house at all.\n4. The question asks which of these does your home take the longest time to cooled.\n5. The answer to that would be \"the flip of the switch\" as it's the fastest way to cool down your home. Switching on a fan, for example would require you to walk to another part of the house and flip the switch. \n6.

{"text": "This question involves the task of determining what people would be doing near a specific road, and what type of location could be that. In this question, we are interested in where we could find a line of several people that is adjacent to a road. There is some uncertainty in the type of object we are searching for. It could be a physical fence or physical barrier with people beside it, or it could be a mental barrier formed by people standing around in close proximity to each other. \n\nAs well, while the word \"line\" can mean a specific row of people standing beside each other, it can also connote physical lines like a road. This question is vague enough that it could refer to several different situations where several people would be standing near a road. We first must consider the context of this question and the situation in which we are searching. We may be looking at a crowd of people who are waiting in line at a food stand on a road that people frequently drive (and walk) on. Alternatively, we may be looking at a group of people standing beside a wall at a concert.\n\nWe consider each choice for possibilities that would fit with the question.\n\nIf we were to answer C: apartment, then this would be incorrect because the question specifically mentions wanting a location that is adjacent to a specific road. This location could only be a building or apartment that is directly beside or facing a street, but not something that is on the other side of the street or a building across the street. So, from our list of four options we can eliminate A: water fountains, C: apartment, and D: fire house. \n\nHowever, if this is an example of a group of people who are standing on a mental line waiting to get something, then all these options would be appropriate. For example, if the question was asking where people would be standing on a train station, they could be standing on the edge of the tracks in a row. This question is vague, so it could be about lines of people waiting for transport like a bus or a train.\n\n### Rationales\n\nThis question is vague and ambiguous, and it is therefore difficult to determine which choices are correct or not. We cannot assume that any of the choices would be appropriate at the moment that we are asked the question. We could only determine whether one of these choices would be more appropriate than the others.\n\nWe choose C: apartment", "answer": "E: bus stop"}

{"text": "The correct answer is C: FEAR.\n\n### Input - Explanation:\nThis question is asking for a reason someone might confess to committing a murder. The only real way to determine the answer to this question is by using deductive reasoning. \n\n### Demostration:\nLet's assume I am at a police interview, and someone has accused me of murder (A). I am innocent so it would be illogical to confess this crime as no one is going to convince me with a guilty conscience (B). I then think of myself going free as a consequence of this (C). This is not likely because if I commit murder I should be sent to prison (D). The only logical answer is this, I will confess due to fear of going to prison (E). \n\n### Input-Analysis: \nThis question is asking you to choose the reason someone might confess from a list of options.\n\n### Method: \nThe best way to approach this problem is by using rational guessing, or eliminating the choices that are incorrect according to what is given.\n\n### Answer: C: FEAR\n\n### Input and Demostration: \n**Input:** The person has confessed to murder.\n\nIn order to arrive at the correct answer I start with the following premises\n\n* The person confessed to the crime.\n* They are innocent.\n* If they confessed it should be because they fear going to prison.\n\nI then conclude that the only way this conclusion is possible in relation to the problem is if the person who committed the crime confessed it out of fear of going to prison.\nWe also know that if the person confesses to murder it means that there is evidence that points to them committing the murder, but at this point it does not mean that they did. This means that in order for the statement to be true they must confess.\n\nWe can conclude that the only way to get to this answer is if the person is innocent and to confess means that they fear going to prison as a result. So the best answer is C: Fear.\n\n### Explanation:\nTherefore the only answer that fits this logic is option C, FEAR", "answer": "A: guilty conscience"}

Choices: A: It's 100 dollars. B: It's a hundred.  C: It's a dime. D: It's $100. E: It's a fifty.\nRationales:1. The question asks how someone might say the sentence \"I've got a phone and a video game.\u201d The response should be how a person might express \"I've got...\".\n2. There are various ways one might say the sentence but it is a single expression so the unit of measure must be the same as the unit of measurement used in the sentence itself. \n3. A: the sentence is missing a \"0\" so this doesn't correctly express \"I got a phone,\" let alone \"I got a phone AND a game.\"\n4. B: \"It's 10 bucks\" doesn't convey the same meaning. It's not used the same way.\n5. C: \"It's ten cents\" also incorrectly expresses \"I got a phone.\"\n6. Anything else is incorrect because 1 and 2 are expressing values and 3 and 4 are unit values, in this scenario the units are \"ONE HUNDRED.\"\n7.

{"text": "A is not the answer.\n\n### Rationale:\n\nYou chose the answer that sounded aesthetically correct (like when you say a \"ham sandwicth\" in American English) instead of actually answering the question.\nThe question is asking where you can store meat that will last a long time.\nIf you store the meat in a backery, then they can have meat as long as the backery is open.\nWhen they close the backery, the meat would most likely go rotten soon.\nIf you store it at a butcher shop, the meat would last as long as the butcher shop remains opened.\n\nIf you store it in the fridge, then the meat will last as long as the fridge is open.\n\nIf you stored it in the freezer, it would last as long as you kept electricity on in the house, the freezer stays closed, the freezer contains no other frozen foods, there is not a hole in the freezer, and the freezer isn't exposed to high temperature or fire (e.g. a gas stove burns out and the air from the stove is sucked into the freezer causing it to malfunction).\nBut that's not what the question asked. The question asked where you can store meat for a long time, and if you store it in the freezer you are already storing it a long time, in perpetuity.\nYou could not really have chosen better than a butcher shop for that exact reason, though - the meat would not last a long time in the butcher shop in the sense of \"will it still be there later in time,\" but in the sense of \"could the meat go bad\" and you are already excluding the chance of the meat going bad.\n\nSo, if you store the meat in the fridge, it will last a long time as long as you keep your fridge open. If you store it in the cold, it will last longer in the cold.\n\nIf we're going to talk about it as long as the frige is open, then it's going to have to be the frige because of the butcher shop, unless the question is \"where can you store meat to last indefinite time\" and in that case the butcher shop could be the answer.\nIf you store meat in a freezer for an indefinite amount of", "answer": "E: freezer"}

{"text": "The question asks about a person delivering a letter directly to someone's hand in response to a request. Although option A: mail box does seem reasonable because letters are delivered through mailboxes, the question explicitly says a person delivers letters. A mailbox does not necessarily denote a human is handing someone a letter, and sometimes it is automated. As such, option A is incorrect.  Option B: suitcase may seem like the right answer because it can hold a letter, but again we cannot say definitively that a person is carrying the letter, just in case it is an automated delivery or not. This leaves us with three viable solutions. In option D: bowl, a person is definitely serving a letter to someone by handing it directly to them. Option E: post office does not necessarily mean a person delivers a letter to someone's hand, but it does show the person is serving the letter.  Option C: front door is most likely incorrect because we can't be sure it involves human interaction.

So, it is confusing as the options are contradictory, as the question implies that if someone is doing something, they should do it successfully i.e. not make a mistake. So, we should not do A: making a mistake. 3. Option B: forgetting something isn't useful because by definition it means the person has forgotten something. 4. The next option D: eating doesn't quite make sense because eating sounds like something a person would actively be doing to achieve a goal. 5. Option E: failing isn't useful because that's an outcome of a behavior, not the behavior itself. 6. Therefore, it is clear that option C: cheating is the only viable option in this case.

Brainstorming requires the people in class to use their minds, so it makes sense for this to be their most important activity. We know this because the people in class need to use their minds to brainstorm together and work as a class team to arrive at new ideas. This makes the most sense because the people in class can't control events or think creatively, but instead can use their minds to think critically and contribute to the brainstorming session.\n\n### Input\"While reading, what is the sound of ink making its way from a quill to a parchment?\" Choices:  A\"swooshing\" B\"whizzing\" C\"scratching\" D\"writing\" E\"chomping\"\n\n### Justifiy:\nA: Swoshing\n\n### Justification:\nA sound is defined as a sensation that occurs when something physical comes in contact with a surface. This would most likely be a sensation experienced while reading. It could also be experienced while working with papers or books, such as when flipping through the pages or tearing them apart. \n\n### The sound of ink making it's way from a quill and parchment is defined as:\n\n- The quill is a feathered pen, used for writing before metal nibs became available. The quill is sharpened to a point at the tip and then covered with ink and dipped into a container. \n- Parchment is a type of paper with a smooth, even surface made from animal skin coated with animal guts and lime. \n\nA sensation experienced while inking a parchment with a quill would be described as a \"swoshing\" sound, because the ink is being pushed out of the container by the quill, spreading the ink across the surface of the parchment. This would be contrasted to a \"scratching\" sound, which is not applicable as it would describe the quill making contact with the surface, rather than the ink moving through it. \n\n##", "answer": "D: think creatively"}

I've seen both \"going to jail and\" \"being punished.\" Although these are accurate descriptions of such events, they're not really the core meaning of a sentence.

The first sentence begins with the word \"that's\", uses an adverb (\"what\" can be an adverb) in the middle, and ends in a question (\"got\"? is a question). Therefore, this sentence is technically incomplete. The sentence is still grammatically correct, and the missing word or words do not disrupt the flow or meaning of the sentence, but this sentence is incomplete because it lacks a word.\n2. This sentence uses an active verb (\"was\"), which means that it is grammatically correct but not a full sentence by our measure of \"contains a subject and predicate\" as it lacks an object that could be considered part of the predicate. Again, the sentence remains complete, grammatically correct, and has full meaning, but it lacks one (or more) piece of information - namely, the object of the verb.\n3. In this example sentence, \"was it\" is an auxiliary, but it's not the main part of the sentence.

It can be argued suicide has very little to do with the emotional state of a person. \n### C) avoid problems - can be a valid reason, but it doesn't seem like it would prompt a deliberate suicide\n### D) unhappy - is an inaccurate explanation of why someone would kill themself deliberately, however suicide could be a way of seeking relief from unhappiness. \n### E) end pain - this option seems to fit, so we can choose that one.\n\nAnswer: E: end pain", "answer": "D: unhappy"}

{"text": "Answers: 1. A: modern house 2. B: building 3. C: townhouse 4. D: neighbor's and downtown house\n\n### Response Reasoning: 1. Light sensors and automatic doors are features often seen in modern housing, so a modern house is likely in the mix of the possible houses.\n\n2. While \"building\" can mean different things depending on the sentence in which it is used, it tends to refer to anything large or commercial. Since this house is more of a residence, \"building\" is more likely referring to something similar to a house.\n3. \"Townhouse\" is not the answer, even if in the literal sense, because a townhouse, by definition, is not detached from a structure. In this case, the house could be detached, in which case it may or may not be a townhouse.\n4. A neighbor's house is not the answer as neighbors can live in any house. And while \"downtown\" can refer to a particular part of a city, it is not referring to a specific building, but rather a group of businesses and residences. So, none of the remaining options are specific enough for us to know which one the garage was referring to.\n\nAnswer: 1. A. Modern House 2. B. Building 3. C. Townhouse 4. D.

This is more appropriate than D: returning (although this may be an equally acceptable option), as matching implies exchanging identical amounts. \n3. The gambler would not want to celebrate their winnings as this may indicate an increase in betting. This is an undesirable outcome when wanting to limit their risk by matchwinning. This is an undue waste of time, as the gambler should be concentrating on the next set of bets. Finally, the gambler shouldn't return (E) because this does not directly relate to the situation.\n4.

There have been many books throughout history, for example 1001 Arabian Nights, in which an unidentified main character lives in the top of an impressive structure, such as a tower, and is able to see clouds while looking out of a window.\n2.

Option A - in books - is the most likely answer, because although there are no modern books written about such an idea, there is one example that is centuries old.\n\n### Input:(Pick the best option.)A baker, an accountant, and a computer programmer share a house and make meals for each other.  In terms of meals made, in which position would the computer programmer stand on average?  Choices:  A:(1st) B:(2nd) C:(3rd) D: (4th)\n\n### Rationales:\nThe computer programmer is most likely to be responsible for making a meal for each person in the household, because this is the most specialized role that each person takes. \nThe accountant provides an important service by managing the household budget.  However this doesn't necessarily provide the household with a meal.  The baker prepares some of the specialized meals in the household, so their contribution is not as important as the programmer's.  Additionally the baker receives most or only some of the meals they made, which may make it difficult to measure how many meals they really provided.  Finally the computer programmer has a higher skill level than the average member of their profession, and would therefore need to make fewer meals than a computer programmer of average ability. \nTherefore the correct answer is B:(3rd); the programmer contributes meals at their specialist skill level, provides value for their contribution, and then receives some other meals in return.\n\n### Answer:B:(3rd)\n\n### The correct answers are:\n1. oil refineries\n2. in books\n3.

The question suggests that we're going to find options to make others feel bad, so it's most logical to consider ways to make others feel bad when laughing. \n2. Option A: Watch it without Laughing - In order to make others feel bad for laughing out loud at something in a movie or television show, the best way I could think of was making them watch it without laughing out loud too. If I mash my face in embarrassment to try to look like I hate it, there's another person there watching it with me that is going to feel as silly as me laughing out loud to something inappropriate like a funny moment on TV or a joke when you weren't supposed to be laughing. \n3.

The word \"fast\" in the prompt suggests that researchers are trying to understand the cause in time, and this is why they are looking for what causes the disease to spread quickly. The word \"spot\" in the prompt is most likely referring to the initial symptoms of a disease, such as a small rash or spot on a leaf. The cause spots on leaf is the correct answer because it is related to the researchers' motivation for studying the disease and provides additional context on why they are looking for the cause.\n\n### Input : Who's job might require them to give directions? Choices: A: tourist operators B: tourists C: drivers D: shop keepers E: tour guides\n\n### Response : According to the paragraph, the tourist's job may require them to give directions to tourists.

{"text": "Answer the following multiple choice question\n\nAnswer: C: table\n\n\n### Input\nA: A: apartment B-shelf C: pantry D: Table E: livingroom\n\n### A response for the instructions\nAn apartment is a place where you would typically store dishes but not necessarily books, because in a typical household, books aren't commonly stored in the kitchen. The same reasoning would apply to other options. A shelf (E) could be an appropriate place to store books, but then it's not also where you typically store dishes. A living room (D) is a place to hang out, not necessarily somewhere you'd normally find dishes. Therefore, out of these options, a kitchen table (C) is the only choice where you would indeed have easy access to books and kitchen items. So, the answer would be C: table.\n\nAnswer:  The best choice in 1 is apartment - dishes in the fridge shelf or table are not places where you'd likely store books, but you could store books in the living room (D) or in the library (E) if you wanted to.", "answer": "B: pantry"}

III) With group, the person can be more comfortable giving a one sided lecture. IV) With a few people, the speaker can choose to speak about something completely different. V) A speaker is different with a group because they are a lot less formal. \n\n### Input Choices: \nA) I only \nB) II only\nC) II and V \nD) I and V \nE) IV and V\n\nRationale: I) The group doesn't necessarily dictate that the speaker can't change topics, because it's more about the overall number of people that are paying attention to the speech\n\nII) This can't be said to be true under any one of these circumstances, and it's vague enough as a description that we can't be sure it describes any kind of speech\n\nIII) This is true of any speech, but can't be said with certainty about group vs few people\n\nIV) This is true for group speaking and true for few-people speaking\n\nV) This is true for sure of a group speaking situation\n\nDue to the vague nature of the questions in these instructions, we can't really make a solid case for any of the answer choices.

{"text": "Input: The helm is not something  you wear on your head,  rather  it moves the masts. \nChoices:  A:  sailing vessel  B:  paddleboat  C:  ship  D:1 motorboat E:2 tugboat\nThe correct answer is C: ship. This is because the helm is something with which a ship moves its masts. A ship has masts, and therefore the helm would be used to move its masts. A paddleboat isn't a ship, so that's not correct. A sailing vessel could be used both for sailing and for not moving the masts, so that's incorrect. A motorboat has motors instead of masts, so it doesn't use the helm at all. Tugboats use a tug, not a helm, and so they're also wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is C: the ship.\n\n### Detailed Response:\n**Instruction:The helm is a nautical term for the ship's steering mechanism, and so it has to do with what the ship does. \n**Demonstration:\nThe correct answer is the ship because the helm moves the masts on a ship. \nA ship is defined as a large floating vessel that carries people or material. \nTherefore, a ship has masts and uses the nautical term 'helm' to move these masts.**\n\nAn important part of communication is the use of nonverbal communication.

The question is referring to many of the world' s most populated areas, so we know it is talking about somewhere that is highly dense.\n2.

D: large cities would only be a problem in large cities, so wouldn't be a cause of any other kinds of cities. \n5.

A \"compass\" is an object that helps you keep your bearings and sense of direction. You're just as likely to have a compass when your brother gets lost as you're not. \n2. A \"cell phone\" is a technology that can help you contact others. Using a cell phone is the next logical step (that is, after you have located your brother). \n3. A \"mirror\" is something you can use to see a \"map\". Thus, you must be able to locate the map first, you can't just use the mirror to locate yourself. \n4. The \"watch\" is something that gives you the time of day. This is a secondary value to the \"tardiness\" or \"eagerness\" that your brother might encounter when he's lost. \n5. Although a \"map\" is a great choice for this question, the only thing that a map can do to help your brother find his way is to show you where you are (not where he is). By this point you've already found him, he may use it to see the way to somewhere else, or he may leave it and not do anything with it. \n6. The cell phone is the only object that allows you to speak to others in the same way it allows you to contact your brother via a cell phone.", "answer": "E: freeway"}

{"text": "The appropriate answer choice (D) is: shopping malls. \n\n### Rationales:The question is asking about what parking lot you would typically park in with shopping bags. It's safe to assume that you've probably parked in a shopping mall before with some items to buy and that you wouldn't want to get your shopping bags wet in the rain so you might bring an umbrella. \n1.

Choices:  C: shouting B: pointing A: talking E: text messaging\n\n### Response\nThe best choice of answer (A): talking. \n\n## Rationales:The best answer is talking (A), because this is by far the most common action taken in a large crowd. Pointing (B) requires you to direct attention to a specific person or object. Shouting (C) requires you to make your voice loud enough that it can be heard by all in your vicinity. Text messaging (E) does not require an audience, it could just be you. Talking (A) does. \n\n## Input:Can you  run across the bridge if you are pushing a baby stroller? Choices:  B: yes C: no D: yes E: no F: yes\n  \n### Response\nD: yes\n\n## Rational:The question asked if there would be any difference in whether it's possible to cross a bridge on a stroller. What it does not ask is if the baby's weight exceeds the weight limit of the bridge (which makes a lot of sense in the given question, why would it matter?). So technically what is asked and what is stated in the answer is  different. Therefore the logical answer is D : yes. \n\n## Instruction:The instructions state \"you don't use a single item to help your friend with their toothache.\" What does this statement mean?\n\nDemonstration: \nAn example would be that you could not just hand your friend the aspirin bottle and say \"here, you should apply it to your tooth, its good for that.\"", "answer": "D: shopping malls"}
{"text": "It was overkill. What did he shoot at in pursuit of his lunch?\n\n\nRationales:\n1.

The answer is E: animal, because animals are the only thing that could be killed in a \"kill people\" scenario within the context of lunch; human beings were the only thing capable of using the cannon as a weapon. \n3.

{"text": "Rationales: The question is asking for the two activities that would provide help in being able to ___ (do XYZ). It is important to distinguish between activities that lead to the ___ (do X) and activities that help to ___ (do YZ).

I believe the answer is D: intelligence as I have found that intelligence is used when describing a skill or trait a person has. The word \"knack\" used to help describe a special skill someone has. While everyone was saying that she had skill with entertaining they could have also said she had a talent for entertaining. However they do not say she had, a talent. This is because talent also means having more of a natural ability or talent. When entertaining is used it is simply being used in reference to it being a skill that she has.\n\n### Question2\nI think the definition of entertaining is that of something which brings pleasure, so I think the best answer will be A: fun.\n\n### Why?\n\n### Rationale:\n2. I believe that 'fun' is the keyword for this phrase. In my dictionary fun is defined as the enjoyment, amusement, or excitement which comes from doing something. I also know that they are asking for your definition of the word 'entertaining'. I don't see entertaining being defined in the dictionary as'something which brings pleasure' since that is not the only definition. The only other definition they have is as being amusing entertainment, which does not give me the feeling that the sentence can be rephrased like it is asked for. The sentence states that everyone believed that she had fun and was a natural at doing it, that is what they are looking for your definition of the phrase to be. The only definition of fun that I can think of that would be suitable and be in context, with the rest of the sentence without rephrasing, I believe is that of the enjoyment or amusement that comes from doing something.\n\n### Final Answer:\nA: fun\n### Why:\n\n### Ratios:\n1. I agree, I would use the phrase pleasure or that something brings them pleasure.\n\n### Rates:\n\n### Why: \n\n### Rate:\n\n### Demorise:\n\n### How:\n\n### Conclusion:\n1. 'fun' is the correct answer choice for this question.\n\n\n\n\n```", "answer": "B: talent"}

{"text": "A correct response is \"D. dreaming.\"\n\n#### Justifications:\n- I believe the wording is pretty explicit here.\n- As mentioned before, if a human is going to sleep their consciousness is being lost, therefore they will be unconscious; as the choice \"A\" reads \"the loss of consciousness\" - it is the only phrase that is accurate to the task\n- I found an article in the New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/25/business/25brain.html) that discussed \"1. Consciousness \u2013 the human brain is capable of a large amount of rapid processing and decision making.

This is probably saying that it isn't an excuse to skip a morning class, not that it's not an excuse to leave the house in general. \n- This choice assumes that if the individual is coming from work at night, they are taking a class at the same time in the morning.\n\n### Input One important thing you need to do before you leave work...

Choices: \nA: a company's success B: an interview process C: an employee's performance D: employees' potential to grow \nRationales: The word momentum is frequently applied to a job opportunity. It is used to describe how the potential of the business or company may lead to further growth and success.\n1. An interview process (C) is what the job opportunity is looking for, and not the word momentum. A company's success (A) is also a wrong answer because the two terms cannot be synonyms - one denotes a person and the other denotes a business.\n2. A person can have potential (B), but the word momentum cannot only relate to the business or a company being interviewed.\n3. There is also no such thing as \"Employee's potential to grow\" (D)\n4. Therefore, the correct answer is B: an interview process. So, the word momentum relates to the interview process when applied to a job.\nAnswer: B: an interview process\n\n*Input: How is momentum used when referring to a sport? Choices:  * A: the amount of time a player is on the court * B: a measure of speed * C: how well organized a game is * D: a way to celebrate your team's success * E: to give a player respect * * Rationales: 1.* In relation to the workforce, momentum can be used to refer to how the potential of the [business](https://lambdatest.com/tutorials/what-is-a-business-model-definition-strategy-proven-models/) or company could lead to further growth and progress. * 2. However, momentum in relation to a business is different than momentum in relation to a sport, so let's focus on the latter for now. * 1. \"Momentum\" in this instance has nothing to do with measuring the amount of time a sports player has physically spent on the court, the answer for this would be A: Amount of time a player is of the court * 2.

It is therefore unclear as to whether the binder will be for personal or academic use. Both college dorms (A) and classrooms (C) are associated with schools; a binder would be more useful when going to college than for a backpack (B), and they are often used for academic purposes in schools. 2. Oftentimes, office supplies stores will sell notebooks and similar items which are often used for school, but do not sell as many other necessary items for college life (like dorms and back packs). 3.

{"text": "Certainly. There are many factors that could potentially influence feelings towards running, and there certainly are plenty of activities that can follow a run. For instance, if the person was able to take a brief breather after a run, the post-run routine could include a cool shower, a warm meal, a nap and a nice stretch with some ice on the muscles. If this scenario were to play out, the post-run feeling may include a bit of exultation, a feeling of success, and some much-needed rest. With that said, after any kind of run a person is probably most likely going to feel tired and maybe even a little sore, depending on how intense the workout. The correct answer would be C, that a person would feel tired after running. \n\n### Rationale\n\nThe context of the question indicates that \"going for a run\" would most likely be a form of exercise, which would leave most people to feeling a little sore. Another reason is that the question doesn't make sense to assume that one would be running out of breath after running for a minute. But if one were to \"run for miles,\" then it would make sense that they'd stop in order to catch their breath. The rest of the question is rather ambiguous and includes a lot of activities that don't really mesh with the premise of running in the first place.\n\n### Additional Instructions: The following multiple choice questions will be used to assess your understanding of the English language.

People can choose Mary as a friend. \nb. People perceive Mary to be an attractive person to have as a friend, regardless of what she does. \n4. We cannot use choice because if Mary is bad, it means she makes bad choices, which would not be someone people generally like to have as friends.\n5. This brings us to option E: choice. \n6. We can conclude that Mary was easy to make friends with; people found her easy to choose as someone to be friends with. Thus, Mary was always open about that: people liked her because she was easy to choose friendship with\u2014a person who was always open about that characteristic.\nAnswer: E: choice\n\nInput: The type of thing that you don't know is, you're missing it.

Option A: lie down is not appropriate for this question because animals have no means of speech and thus could not tell us that they feel pain.\n3. Option B: run away does not apply because unless the animals already have means to speak to us, they cannot tell us that they feel the pain, and thus, will not run away.\n4. Option D: keep alive is not possible, as we are violating the natural order of animals to ask them to feel pain in the first place.\n5. Option E: feel pain makes the most sense here. This is because wild animals are not human, and thus, cannot lie down or run away. As such, their choices for their natural reaction to touching people is either to hide or feel pain. \nBecause of this reason, option E: feel pain is the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: E: feel pain", "answer": "C: bite"}
{"text": "E: Many Places.\n\n## Solution\nElevator Pitch\nAn elevator pitch is a brief and succinct summary of what a project is all about, including your vision or vision for the project, and how this project will aid your career, education, etc. This elevator pitch should be no more than ten or fifteen sentences, however, and it should be concise and easy to read without using complex or lengthy jargon.\n\n## Output: Elevator pitch:\nI am a [title] who has created this project in order to solve these following problems using these specific technologies. I believe my project will be valuable for these reasons. \n\n## Input\nAsk a follow-up question, or rephrase the original question in a different way.\n\n## Input\nInput: How do we know when we have won? Choices: A: we lose B: the team has lost, we win C: we lose D: the team has won, we lose E: neither team has gotten what they wanted\n\n## Output: Answer: We know that we have lost when our team has lost, and we know that we have won when our team wins.\n\n## Background\nIn computer science, it is sometimes necessary to output the value of a variable, even after a variable has been assigned a value. Using the assignment operator ( = ), we can assign a variable a value, and to use the output operator, the values of the following output operator (print()) will be printed to the screen.\n\n## Output\nOutput an integer, floating-point number, or boolean value.\n\n## Context\nThe output of the value to a user without any context is very impractical, as it does not give users the necessary information to decide how to proceed. \nFor example, just telling a user that the value of \"x\" is \"5\" won't help because the user doesn't know what this means, and whether it is good or bad. \nTherefore, an output must accompany any variable, and sometimes outputting a variable's value is necessary in order for a program to execute correctly. \n\n## Output\nThe following are examples of output statements, or assignment statements:\n```\noutput(\"Hello \")\noutput(\"World!\")\n```\nThese would print the statement \"Hello world\" to the terminal.", "answer": "A: zoo"}
{"text": "A\n\nAnswer: A\n\n### Rationale:\nGlass and plastic are both used to make jars. Jars are also the containers used to hold items in the kitchen. \n\nPlastic is used to make most of the objects in the kitchen, except for glass. Anything that is glass is not plastic. John liked glass over plastic. John is being held against his will and does not want to be in the kitchen. In this scenario, we know glass is not plastic in the kitchen and the person doesn't want to be in the room. There are other rooms in the house, and we can't assume how he would feel about those rooms.\n\nAnswer: D", "answer": "D: own home"}
{"text": "(The response is in italics.)\nRationales: The question indicates that the purchaser of wine is looking for a place to buy a glass of wine (hinted by the inclusion of the phrase \"glass of wine\"). \n\nInput: An author may be a famous man, a famous woman, or a famous woman who is a mathematician. Choices:  A. famous man B. famous woman C. famous man who is a famous woman D. famous woman who is a famous mathematician\nRationale: 1. The \"who is\" implies that the author is not the famous man or woman themself (hinted by use of pronouns \"him\" and \"her\"), but another famous person, \"the man\" and \"the woman\". Therefore, the author could be any of the options. \n\n2. Option A: F: famous man only refers to an author being a man, not both a famous man and a famous woman.\n3. Option B: F: famous woman only refers to an author who is a woman.\n4. Option C refers to \"the man\" and not \"the author\" so we know the author can be neither of the choices.\n5. Option D is the best answer option as it refers to \"the woman\" and \"the famous mathematician\". \n6. \"Famous mathematician\" indicates \"famous\" is used as an adjective, therefore, \"the famous woman is\" can refer to \"the woman\" specifically, not a group containing the woman.\n\nInput: Every time you see one of the world's great cities. Choices: D. A place to visit as a tourist B. It is a wonderful place to have a business meeting. C. A place where you would likely become acquainted with a beautiful woman\n\nRationales:\n1. The prompt indicates that this is information that can be gained when \"seeing one of the world' s greatest cities\". It implies that every time one sees some of the world's greatest cities, they would know whether or not it's a tourist destination (B), a business meeting location (C), or somewhere to meet a beautiful woman (D). \n\n2. All possibilities B: A place to visit as tourist and C: A place where you would like to become acquainted with a beutiful woman are out as they involve seeing a", "answer": "C: bar"}

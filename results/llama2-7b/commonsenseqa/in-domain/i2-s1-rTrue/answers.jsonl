{"text": "1: The question is asking where in a jewelery store you would go to find a choker. \n2: We can immediately eliminate all the incorrect answer options. The neck is not a place you would go in order to find a choker, as a choker typically sits around the neck rather than the neck itself. The jewelry box, D, is also incorrect because the question asks which store an item is located in, rather than where to find the item when it's sitting in a particular store.\n3: Let's look at the remaining answer options:\n- B - Jewelry box - While this contains some correct information, you can't determine where an item is located from simply looking at all the items in the box. Therefore, this option is not an accurate response to the question.\n- E - Boutique - Like the B-answer, the problem here is that you still aren't able determine where the choker is in this specific boutique.\n- A - Jewelry store - This answer contains correct information that fits the correct answer. However, there is a small problem with the logic of the question, which states where to \"go\" to find the item in a particular store. If a jewelery box is where you would go to find the item in the boutique, this means that you would have to go to the correct boutique in order to locate the choker. So, if the correct boutique is \"Jewelry Boutique A\", you would have to go visit Jewelry Boutique B (which could itself be a boutique selling jewelery or a boutique selling apparel, etc.) in order to locate the item. Therefore, this option requires an extra level of logic in order to find the final answer.\n4: The answer is A - Jewelry shop.\nSo the final and correct answer is:  A: Jewelry shop\n\nInput:In what state are not many of you born?

So the correct answer is E: Califoria\n\nInput: What is not an element that can be made by", "answer": "A: jewelry store"}

Furthermore, an airport would not be a place where this type of drawstring bag would be checked into.\n2)Thus, the correct answer is C: jewelery store\n\nInput: On your second anniversary, where are you most likely to find the man you're dating? Choices:  a) In a bank b) In a mall c) In a police station d) In his own home e) In a gas station\nOutput: To determine the right answer to this question there are two things to do.\n1. First, determine if it is about the second anniversary or not?\n2. And if it is about the'second' anniversary then, the man would not be in a bank, a mall, a police station, his home or a gas station.\nHere is why:\nIn a bank: as the time would be near closing time, and it is an unlikley place for a date. Plus the place would be crowded, and he would get his account balance at a very small percentage of the year, so it would be a poor date.\nIn a mall: as the man will most probably work at a mall, it will be difficult to take his date.\nIn a police station: as it will be nearly closing time, and it will be a police station with a very restricted area.\nIn his home: as it would be unlikley for a date, and the home will be a small place", "answer": "E: airport"}

So the correct answer here is indeed a computer network.  \n    -E) electrical circuit- This answer requires some slight elaboration.  Although the question doesn't specify the exact type of device being shared, we can assume that it requires some type of data input. We can also assume that the network we're talking about is some type of computer network because of how all of the other answers have already ruled out.

{"text": "1) the question wants to know what an individual can do if they want to earn money.\n2) The answer choices consist of the following 5 words, which represent 3 categories of activity. The categories are:\n    - *Apply for job*: These action verbs indicate activities that require human labor and can provide a return on time+effort invested. Examples would be *work in the fields*, *fix a car*, *clean a house* etc.\n    - *Stand in line*: This category of action verbs refers to actions that occur over a certain period of time. Things like *waiting* and *hanging out* would fall in this category.\n    - *Take care of proposals*: These action verbiage are related specifically to making money using financial capital. Examples include *hold stocks*, *hold a bond*, *lend money* etc.\n\n3) To determine which category an answer choice falls under, we can eliminate action choice that don't belong to that type of activity. For example we can rule out \"apply for job\" and \"stand in line\" because no money is being earned through those activities. Similarly, \"pass a course\" and \"play the lotto\" are actions which are based around exchanging labor for money, but are indirect, in that you need to have money before you can take a course, and you need to get money after you win the lotto. A final example is *take care of proposals*, which is relevant to this kind of question because it's about \"earning money\" not necessarily \"earning income\".\n  - *These eliminated answer choices are the remaining categories of action verbs that are relevant to this kind of sentence:* \n    - *apply for job*: \"earning money\" means you are applying it to your bills or other expenses, not accumulating new savings that can then be deployed to provide a return on the amount of time spent with the activity. Therefore we know \"apply for job\" is the correct action choice.\n4) At this point the sentence becomes ambiguous in that we don't know whether \"apply for jobs\" is a singular or plural action choice. In the future, should we ever have a sentence with this grammatical structure, we would need to interpret *apply for jobs* as *apply for *the* job*.\n5)", "answer": "A: apply for job"}

{"text": "1) First thing to rule out is answer choice \"B\" (join together), as you're not actually ever joining cuts together. \n2) This is a riddle, so the answer probably has more to do with the concept of \"cuts\" than it does actual cutting. \"Cut\" is a verb in this sentence, describing someone who's been cut off.\n3) Moving on to the answer choices:\n    - Answer choice \"A\" (join together) implies that after years ago, the cuts would be joined together\u2014which is obviously not true, as they are cuts.\n    - Answer choice\" C\" (heal) implies that after years of joining pieces of meat together, the cuts would actually get healed up, which is also not the case here.\n    - Answer choices \"D\" (stitch) and \"E\" (paste) would imply that a stitch or a piece of paper would be placed where the cut (in \"cutting off\") went.

{"text": "1) This question is very similar to \"What's the word that means an inordinate or excessive or abnormal desire or craving\". You can use the same techniques to solve it:\n2) First of all, if we don't know what kind of branch it is then we can cross off all other choices that don't make sense. In this case there is only one option: 'D: base'.\n3) After we've crossed off \"subordinate\", and \"foot\" we can choose \"owner\".\n4) Finally, we are left with only the base. Base has 3 different meanings:\n* The lowest part of a thing or its lowest part or part of the lowest part\n* a small town\n* the basic constituent part of something\n\nSo which of these descriptions applies to the example?\n* This doesn't make sense: base is not the lowest part of a tree (a tree's roots are below the ground so are deeper and farther away than the head of a branch).\n* This doesn'y make sense either: a base is not a small town. What this could refer to is a tree branch's location, meaning it's part of the tree's structure. However, I'm pretty sure we're supposed to identify the person this branch is yelling at, not where it's located.\n* Finally we get to the answer, the 'basic constituent part' of the tree!

{"text": "1-2. This question is asking about what James is scared of losing. So we're going to need to look for an answer choice that describes the loss of something important to James in his life. \n3-4. Looking at option A, death, this seems like a possible answer.  It's true that James isn't scared of dying because otherwise he wouldn't have felt himself losing consciousness, which indicates he's conscious.  So option A is a plausible answer.\n5-6. Moving on to option B, coma. It's possible that a coma could result in a person losing consciousness, but it seems unlikely to be the source of James's fear. So option B is eliminated.\n7-8. We can rule out D, Forgetfulness, and E, Loss of life. These options are neither things that a person wouldn't want to lose, nor are they things the person is specifically scared of losing.\n9-10. Next, looking at C, Peace, this can't be the source of James scaredness because peace is the opposite of fear. So peace certainly can't be what James is scared to lose.\n11. The last option, A, death, it's possible that James feels his personal safety is in danger if he doesn't wake up.

Choices: 1: drug dealer 2: drug wholesaler 3: drug mule 4: drug trafficker\nOutput: Let's first understand what a drug mule is: this person, according to the dictionary, is,\n    \"a person who carries drugs across an international border secretly for a drug dealer.\"\n\nSo what these people do is sell drugs with a drug dealer and do it secretly to avoid scrutiny. \n\nNow, let's look at an example of a drug wholesaler: what we have is \n    \"a businessman who buys and sells drugs in bulk.\".\n\nThis person is selling drugs and does indeed fall under the realm of the dictionary definition of drug dealer, but the answer also includes the phrase \"in bulk.\" Therefore, this does not fit what the question is asking.\n\nNow let's look at drug trafficking. Drug Trafficking is, \n    \"a global criminal enterprise where an organization, sometimes called a cartel, produces, distributes, and sells large quantities of illegal drugs and arranges for their smuggling into countries for which they have a market.\"\n\nSo you have to be in a business organization with other people with an arrangement for the drugs and their transport.

{"text": "1) We are asked to say what getting paid is not. \n2) After considering each answer choice, it is clear that the only one that fits the question is \u201csorrow.\u201d The reason is because all other answers are descriptive of a state that does not have anything to do with getting paid. The word \u201csorrow\u201d refers to a state or feeling of sorrow, grief, or sadness. On the other hand, B and C are nouns that do not describe a state but a thing. This means that the word \u201cfeels\u201d will always be followed by a verb in the sentence. \n3) If we put in a verb it will only make sense if \u201cfeel\u201d is followed by \u201cacquired,\u201d (\u201cWhat does acquiring something feel like?\u201d). However, \u201csomething acquired\u201d in a sentence can only be used for describing an object or possession, not an emotion, that someone feels or is feeling. \n4) If we put in the verb \u201cdone with\u201d, (\u201cWhat doesn\u2019t get done by paying something?\u201d), the sentence will be asking what a thing feels like. But, the answer is \u201cnothing\u201d. \n5) However, if we put in the verb \u201dis not,\u201d followed by the answer \u201csorrow,\u201d it would be exactly like the question as it asks what getting paid is not referring to. The only answer in this section that explains what getting paid refers to or does not refer to is \u201csorrow.\u201d \n6) The answer is \u201csorrow\u201d.\nSo the final answer for this question is A: sorrow\n\nInput: A person with poor financial planning is what?

Being careful has more to do with preparation and thinking about the possible consequences than the action itself, which in this case is financial planning. \n4: The definition of d", "answer": "B: satisfaction"}
{"text": "1: The question is asking which flower bed bees are attracted to, and the flower beds would include the place where bees congregate to gather the pollen from those flowers. Therefore, the question may be asking about where those bees congregate, but it may be more broadly phrased to mean \"Where do bees conglomerate?\" (A synonym of congregate is conglomerate!)\n2. However, we can narrow the range of answer choices as most bees are attracted only to certain types of flowers \u2013 for example, red roses. Red roses are typically attractive to female bees. \n3. Considering B, 'honey,' we'd have to clarify which type of bee is being asked about \u2013 specifically whether it's a honey bee. Bee species are very numerous and not all gather honey, which would be the only answer choice that could be correct if the answer choice meant 'honey'.  \n4. Choice C 'bouquet of flowers' doesn't meet the constraints of the answer choices in that bouquets tend to be collections of different species, and that's not what we're being asked. \n5. Choice D 'rose garden' is one of the most popular answer choices that gets thrown off for new players who know that rose gardens are attractive for bees. However, it doesn't stand as a suitable answer because rose gardens tend to be attractive for bees that are allergic to both red and pink flowers. \n6. Choice E 'field of flowers' could be the one to pick on this question because in a lot of agriculture, fields of flowers are a natural consequence of the cultivation practices. They're not necessarily attractive to bees if none are planted. \n7. If you're not sure, try to rule out all the wrong answer choices \u2013 but if you can't and it's the last question, you could pick randomly and still have a small chance of guessing the correct answer.\n8.

A desert is a large, arid, sandy area that has few plants. In contrast, a garden has many flourishing plants. Therefore, the best choice is D: a parking lot.

This isn't the best answer in the book, but it's the only choice that will work here.\n6) Choice D: 'own family' \u2013 The question is focused on where the skin is cut while cooking onions, and therefore, the person's own family isn't involved.", "answer": "B: finger"}
{"text": "1) The question is about identities for the answer, so we should first identify and eliminate words or terms that are not identities. For example, a person could be angry or sad, but not the illness of anger or sadness.\n2) In the second part of the question, note that we are only considering the answer to be the illness and not the answer choices. That would mean that the options A through E could each potentially give rise to the answer.\n3) The most common case that could give rise to an answer of unwellness or unhappiness is if a person experiences depression. But it isn't completely accurate to say that every person who is depressed has depression.\n\n4) Thus, we need to combine answers and eliminate words from being illness or identities.\n\n5) The options are now:\n\nA: downcast depression, downcast illness, gloomy,\nB: angry, angry illness, downcast illness\nC: angry\nD: illness, illness depression, depressed illness\nE: depression, illness depression\n\n6) Of the answers that are left, D is a phrase for a person who is unable to feel joy, so it doesn\u2019t quite fit.\n\n7) Looking at C, if a person is only angry about one thing, they could be experiencing anxiety. In that case, option C could be correct. But if, for example, an angry person is also sad or depressed, then their illness could be depression.\n\n8) We can conclude that we don't know what illness an angry/sad/downcast person has.\n9) Therefore the answer is C: \"I'm not sure but what illness could you have?\"", "answer": "A: depressed"}

If John injured his anger, it will not be his physical _anger_ he will be unable to hold his tool, but his _fists_ which are part of his anger. If he injured his hostility, even if he is unable to hold his tool _that is no fault of his anger or hostility which just happened to be_ connected to the tool in the question.\n    - **Choice B:** One can't blame nose injury _of all things_ on the wrong answer choice of choice D. He can't blame his hands either because they are the ones that would be injured.\n    - **Choice D:** The person is injured if he's punching and pounding. The first option could be considered, but we can't be so certain that the person's fists are the ones that will be damaged. Also, using the word \"if he damages\" isn't really correct because it's actually describing what happens when someone is injured. \n    - **Choice E:** The injured tools would be held by the hands, not the fists.\n    So we have only two valid answers: A and B.\n1.

We cannot be sure if people have gardens in this world, but that doesn't matter.\n3. This leaves two choices: creek and forrest. \n4. The lizard could surprise someone in the creek (because it might be hiding among rocks or in a hole), or in a forest, where it would blend in to the surroundings. We can say that they can be equally probable, so we must rely on a dictionary to determine the correct answer.\n5. Unfortunately, the dictionary only talks about 'arboretum' in the last line.

{"text": "1: The question is asking us for something that generally describes how a game is on sale compared to not being on sale.\n2: Some important terms to have in mind for this question are:\n    - Sale: An event where goods are typically sold at a reduced rate (typically to attract more customers).\n    - Purchase: A payment from one person to another person on behalf of a good or service they are about to receive.\n3: Let's consider each of the answer choices:\n    - A. Buying \u2013 The event of a game being on sale does not mean that someone is necessarily buying anything. If a game is being on sale for a low price, that does not mean that you need to make a purchase immediately. \n    - B. Purchase \u2013 The event of a sale does not automatically mean that a purchase is going to occur. If something is on sale (e.g., a game), that doesn't mean that you are forced to immediately buy it at the discounted price. The event of a sale may mean that people will actually take the time to consider their budget before making a purchase. This might mean that there is more incentive to wait on the purchase than for the initial sale itself. The question does not ask what people do when they purchase a product, like in answer choice B. Also, it is not mentioned that this scenario only applies to video games.\n    - C. Overpriced \u2013 A situation where a product is typically overpriced is not being on sale now. If a video game is typically overpriced, however, this does not mean that it will almost certainly go on sale in the (exact) future. \n    - This is a bit of an obfuscation here. Note that the \"the\" can be removed from the answer choice. The question doesn't ask 'will' or 'would' when describing when a game typically goes on sale, it just asks for when.\n    -  D. Way too much \u2013  If this scenario were describing a game being way too expensive while on sale, then this would be a more typical scenario (because the amount of money spent would still be greater than what the original price was beforehand).

The goal of playing sports is to have fun, but that would only be a byproduct of being involved in competitions. So even being competitive in sports can be fun for many people.\n    - C balls touch \u2013 This can't possibly be the correct answer because if we don't want a competition, we would probably not want to have them even touching each other. \n    -D winning E get tired \u2013 All the other options can't be right.

{"text": "1) At the intersection, there are several options for where one can stand. This includes both the cars (A) and the street corner (D). However, in the context of the question, the answer will likely refer to a human being so we can eliminate the choice for cars. For the choice for the street corner, this could refer to multiple directions, but as the question uses the word \"road\" instead of \"street\" and \"the forks of a road,\" it is likely pointing to something specifically to do with cars, not humans.\n2) When you drive through an intersection, you are often confronted with several options about where to take the next turn. The two primary choices at this point are which direction to go and whether or not to make the turn at all.\n3) As mentioned above, the option for city street (B) seems to refer to a particular direction or street, not just a section of the intersection. It's best to rule out options that just refer to one single street at an intersection, since the specific intersection may be important.\n4) The option of the intersection forks (E) is likely referring to turning directions at an intersection, and not the intersection itself. The option \"at a red light\" (E) sounds like it should be referring to the street intersection itself since only that portion of the traffic signal is red. However, the light can also be yellow before a turn so \"at a red light or yellow-facing light\" would also be an appropriate description of the situation. Therefore, we can use the term red light as a proxy of the choice \"forks in the road\" (E), which is not the answer we are looking for. \n5) Now that we've cut all the choices down, we are left with two options: cars or street corner. These are the only two choice directions left, but the street corner would only be an appropriate choice if a person is walking, running, etc. through the intersection rather than driving.\n6) Therefore, the answer is the cars.\nSo the final two answers are E: car and cars", "answer": "C: street corner"}

There are two options here: 'prefer' and 'would prefer'. \n3) If we use 'would prefer', we get a lot of conflicting information in the sentence: John is upset but he 'has to do it', which implies that he either doesn't want to or he doesn't have any other choice but to accept the job.\n4) Since the question explicitly says it was only 'a bit upset', John 'only' moved away from family and still 'preferred' it if he did not have to move away from family. So John 'could have' moved away from his family and still had the 'preference' that it wasn't 'necessary'.\n5) The only way to phrase 'prefer it if it wasn't necessary' is to use would prefer the job be here.

Choices: 1. A: goat B: cow C: horse D: human E: bull  \nOutput: 1) The question is asking for the name of the animal that is 4-legged but not a dog. \n2. We can first eliminate those which are obviously incorrect. A goat (1), a cow (2), a horse (3), and a bull (5) are certainly not dogs, and, as we can see below, they are also animals, so they can't be the right answer. \n3. We can also eliminate options that aren't 4-legged. A human (4) doesn't have 4 legs so they can also be eliminated. \n4. Since we can eliminate all 5 of the choices using our previous considerations, the only answer that might be correct is number 5: A bull. \n5. The bull is a bovine mammal that has four legs and is also an animal. \nSo we can conclude that our final answer is a bull.", "answer": "C: race track"}
{"text": "1) Consider the various actions people take when they trip in front a crowd and break their limb:\n    - People who experience emotional trauma such as pain when something happens and try to communicate or let others know what has happened usually show emotions such as communication, pain, embarrassment, suffering, and laughter. \n    - People who suffer the consequences and don't communicate their emotions usually show pain (or suffering), laughter, and embarrassment.\n    - People who simply laugh at themselves or something unlucky that happened to them show laughter.\n    - People can also experience embarrassment when something unlucky happens to them.\n    - People usually communicate their emotions by either speaking or making sounds such as groans, grunts, screams, and so forth.\n\n2) We now have four statements to consider:\n\n    - `1. People who experience emotional reactions such as pain show the emotion of embarrassment.`\n    - This statement is not correct as people can experience embarrassment in more than one way. People can be embarrassed if something unlucky happens, it doesn't necessarily have to be related to emotions. \n    - `2. People expressing themselves show communication` \u2013 This statement is correct because the premise is `If you break a leg and trip in front of a crowed then you will be in communication with people`. \n    - `3. People suffering the consequences of something unlucky that happens show the emotion of pain.` This statement is correct. If one experiences pain, it is because they are suffering the consequences of something that has happened to them (tripping in front of a crowd breaking their leg).\n    - `People who are simply laughed at show the emotion of laughter.` This statement is correct as well.\n3) Now that we have considered all the statements, we must select the one that is true based on the premise of the question. We can eliminate the option A: communication as communication is a statement, not an emotion. Therefore, B: suffering C: Pain E: Laughter can't be true statements and is eliminated. Then let's compare the remaining statements, D: laughter and E: Laughter. \n\n4) Let's do some reverse-evaluation and eliminate anything that may not reflect the original premise", "answer": "E: embarrassment"}

{"text": "1.- The question asks what a husband's likely to feel even with his friends after his wife requests that he stop being married to her\n2. - Each answer choice gives an adjective to how the husband might feel.

Again, this is not a emotion which would happen after being asked to end your marriage. \n    -C - happy \u2013 'Happy' can mean a lot of things according to the meaning.

A person can be joyful about a learning process involving many tasks or activities, rather than the subject itself. As such, this choice is not an accurate answer.\n4. From that we come to answer choice D. Learning should be important, and is a very important part of any educational experience.

F: a flexible schedule\nOutput: 1 .The question is asking about the reasons why some people don't want work\n2. First, let's consider the options that don't make sense:\n    - Paying bills would be a reason to want to work, not to want to avoid it.\n    - A pay increase would be a beneficial thing to want, not a reason to avoid work.\n    - Working with coworkers would generally be a reason to want work, not want to avoid work.\n3. This leaves us with choices:\n    - getting a pay increase \u2013 This is the correct answer. It is a good reason to avoid work because not getting an increase is a reason to want to avoid work. \n    - a flexible schedule \u2013 This is an outdated reason that is no longer relevant and so the answer has to be F, because all the choices don't make sense.\nSo the final choice is F.

Choices: 1. Reread the beginning 2. Skip to the end 3. Ask a librarian 4. Read another book 5. Read every page\nOutput: 1) Rereading is not really helpful in this situation. While it may be something a person can do if they want to read the entire book again, it won't help them understand the story's ending without reading every page.  1. Rereading the beginning \u2013 This is not what is being asked here. Rereading the opening of the book is not a way to find out it's ending.\n\t3.

Reading every page \u2013 The correct answer is E: reading every page. This is exactly what the man asked about, and although he asked about finding out the book's ending after reading a few pages, it is an extremely long process, especially if it is a novel.

Let's consider two remaining options that refer to states rather than cities: \n    - B: woods \u2013 Indiana is the only state that has 'woods' with 'woods' being forests of trees of indeterminate age.

A single child can easily engage in this behaviour; however the question doesn't mention other kids.\n    - Smell smoke - Mostly used if kids are outside or in an open common area.

Choices: A: move out B: remain quiet C: make noises D: keep calm E: look for food\nOutput: 1 The question is asking an action to take in order to avoid getting hit by a wild animal.\n2. For each of the answer choices we should consider whether it's the best way to avoid being hit by wild animals.\n3. Let's examine each answer choice:  \n    - A: Move out \u2013 This is an option which can help people avoid getting hit by a car, not wild animals. Therefore this is not the correct answer.  \n    - B: Remain quiet \u2013 In some cases, this can help to avoid being hit by a wild animal (by hiding).However, I don't think it would necessarily solve the problem across the board. Therefore, this is also not the correct answer.   \n    - C: Make noises \u2013 Not a bad idea. However, it's not necessarily a rule and I doubt the question would explicitly state to do this", "answer": "E: falling down"}
{"text": "1: The question is asking where a spoon goes on one side of a common plate found at many American tables. \n2: The four other answer choices are all incorrect because they are not places where a spoon would be expected to place on the side of an American plate.\n3: We can eliminate choices B and D because we're specifically talking about a spoon and not a fork or knife. Further, there is no reason why the serving dish or placemat would have an empty space that would accommodate a spoon. \n4: We can eliminate choice E because iced tea is an odd drink to serve at an American dinner table, when you really want to be serving wine and beer!\n5: This leaves us with choices A and C.\n6: It seems that this must be asking where one could place a spoon on the _inside_ of a plate?\n7: Choice A is incorrect as a bowl of soup seems to be a container for soup rather than where a spoon would go.\n8: Choice C is the most clear answer.

{"text": "1. First, let's consider what a virus does to a computer, and use that knowledge to understand what they do to a person.\n2. Computer viruses replicate by \"infecting\" computer files, which can cause a great deal of damage to a computer system.\n3. A person is not a computer system of files, which leads us to the second consideration: biology. \n4. In biology, a virus does not \"infect\" DNA, which makes it different than computer viruses. Instead, a virus can replicate, and it does that by attaching itself to a host cell and injecting its own DNA. Once the virus DNA is in the host cell, it can start to replicate; as more viruses are injected into host cells, the \"infection\" spreads.\n\n5. From this biological angle, we can see that the answer of choice B, \"infect\", is not correct because biologically, what a virus does is not the same as what a computer virus does. To answer the question as posed, we need to have a different answer. \n6. The other answer choices, C, D and E, have nothing to do with what a virus does when they infect a cell. Choice C, mutate, does not involve what a virus does to infect a cell. \n7. Choice D, \"eat food\", is not what a virus does to cause contagion. Instead, viruses reproduce through infecting host cells. In order to reproduce, they require a host cell, not food. There is no possibility of choice D.\n8. Choice E, \"make an electronic device malfunction\", refers to what malware does and is not what a virus specifically does when they infect and replicate.\n9. Therefore, the answer is choice B, \"replicate\".\nSo the final answer, by process of elimination, is B: replicate\n\nInput: If a woman has twins, how are they related to each other?

Therefore, it cannot be the correct answer choice. Choice B: England is not the correct answer. \n4: A hive does not typically have a queen. The hive is made up of a large group of female honey bees, with a single queen bee. Bee hives typically have only one queen. Choice A: Bee hive's is incorrect. \n5: Castles are a place where a queen could be, but are not always. They have had queens, and they do not always have a queen in them.

The general idea of the question is to ask whether you 'care' when you're being selfish.\n\n2, Let's consider each of the options:\n    \n    - A: crack \u2013 There is a meaning of 'cracks' that has to do with 'doing drugs'. With this meaning, crack-cocaine may be one way in which the usage of 'crack' could come under the umbrella of people who are being selfish. However, even in using crack-cocaine, it could be argued the people are only using cocaine, not dealing it or selling it. Additionally, not all people who do crack-cocaine are selfish to begin with. Considering these details, crack can't be the correct answer option.\n    - B+C: antipathy, being mean \u2013 There may be a few individuals who are being selfish and also mean or antipathetic (cruel). However, it seems like more than likely in the context of this question and this language, the'mean people' are being mean in and of themselves. For example, if a parent is mean to a child because the parent is being selfish and wants things their way, we wouldn't say that the parent's mean behavior in this scenario is due to them being selfish, even if they are. Therefore, being mean and antipathetic are not applicable here.\n    - D: disinterest \u2013 This seems to have a few different meanings, but for now we can ignore those. We'll see if any of the other answers seem to match up better to the overall idea of caring as well as being selfish.\n    - E being unfeeling \u2013 While some selfish people may not seem to care at all, most still have some inclination of caring, as they're often trying to get what they want in a selfish way. They also are usually not unfeeling because one who's being selfish is not always being unfeeling. Therefore, being unfeeling isn't the answer. \n3. With these details and considerations, we can't pick out the one word, so the answer is none of the above (none being the answer, there is no 'all of the above').", "answer": "C: being mean"}

The fact that our narrator had a cow mascot as a small child indicates that the animal commonly known as the cow was redefined as such long before the narrator reached adulthood.\n7 - However, this does not mean that only bovine animals were once known as cows. We can take the word cow here as a general term. \n8 - We can consider option B, a story book, as a way to explore this. \n9 - The book might just be a picture book where the cow mascot is depicted. There's no mention of the story; it's just simply presented as a representation of the mascot on a page. \n10 - Alternatively, the story could depict the life of an orphan who was rescued by a cow and therefore named it after himself, and then went on to have the animal named after him as a mascot. \n11 - In either case, the narrator could not read his storybook as a child, and his mascot no longer exists. \n12 - Therefore, our answer to the question is E: wildlife refuge.", "answer": "A: toy store"}

Again, this is not what they still have to do after commuting.\n    * We can skip to C - The scrap heap is the place where one takes their car once it breaks down or becomes irreparable. This is not what they still need to do after commuting and therefore, is not the correct answer.\n    * We now move on to D - The parking garage is the place one would go to park their car. However, if they do not have a car in the city, this is not something they would need to go do after commuting and as such, is not the correct option.\n    * Next up is E - The repair shop is the place one would visit if they have broken down their car. This is not a place one would need to go to in order to do what they need to do after commute and so is not the correct answer to this question.\nThis leaves us with the following answer:\n    - B - This answer choice describes what one must do in order to commute.\nThen, from here, the next answer is:\n    - D - This is one of the places that a person can park their car.

Choice A, the train station, would not be helpful if we wanted to get to another country because trains do not usually leave for other countries. \n4. Choice B, the baseball stadium, is out because while it's true that a baseball stadium features tickets that help you get to other stadiums, it does not help you to get to other countries. \n5. Choice C, the lottery, helps you go to a lot of different countries, but it's not something you use to do that, so we can toss this choice aside too. \n6. Choice D, the movie, is out because while there are, for example, movie theatres that feature films from other countries, they still aren't tickets that help you to a different country. \n7. Choice E, the bus, can be helpful when you're trying to get to other countries, but this will be different for each person. \n8.

This answer choice refers to adding the handle to the object you are carrying for your convenience.\n4) Since the given information refers to the item we're attaching the handle to and the context of the situation, the final answer will be C: carry object.\nSo the final correct answer is C: carry object\n\nInput: A person who owns a cell-phone isn't: Choices:  A:) owning a landline at the same time B:) using a flip-phone simultaneously C:) texting another person D) using the phone for work while at home E) receiving messages from a friend at their own house\nOutput: 1 The first step when analyzing this question is to separate out the key attributes of the answer choice, namely \"using a flip-phone, using the phone for work, receiving messages from a friend, owning a landline.\" These attributes tell us that the answer choice must refer to the activities a person is performing, not who they are.\n2. At this point, it becomes important to consider the verbs involved in the question. There are two types of verbs here:\n    - 'to receive' is an intransitive verb, in which there is no object (someone who receives something) and no subject receiving the action of receiving.\n    - 'to send, is a transitive verb, the object of which is the receiver.\nWith these two verbs in mind, the following becomes clearer:\n    - the person who receives messages is a friend\n    - the person receiving messages is at their own house\nIf the person is at their own house, they will not own a landline.\n3. The person also will not be using a flip", "answer": "A: briefcase"}
{"text": "1) We can eliminate answer choices that are obviously incorrect first. For instance, hatred and surprised aren't actions or characteristics that a person can be \"great at\" something.\n2. For answer choice A) focus, we can cross focus off because it is not an action that a person chooses to do.\n3) We can cross off C) compliments because this answer choice focuses on how others see us, whereas the question is asking about how we view our own performance at great tasks and how we deal with setbacks.\n4) Let us consider the remaining answer choices, D & E) Dedication and E) Dedication. Which answer choice is more likely to deal with setbacks and not get distracted or sidetracked?\n5) E) The answer is Dedication, which explains why you find people with great focus often have great dedication.\n6) So the correct answer is: D: Dedication.\nSo the final answers are: D: Dedicated", "answer": "D: dedication"}
{"text": "1) The question is asking about identifying a chore that a child has to do after breakfast but before they get on the bus, and it specifically excludes getting on the bus.\n2) Choice C does not mean a child has to ask questions because there are many kinds of questions. Furthermore, one cannot really ask questions of others as a chore.\n3) Choice B does not make sense because children do not typically drop out of school after breakfast, and would not do so before or even immediately after boarding a bus.\n4) Choice D also excludes the question of whether a child can wash dishes.\n5) Choice A does not make sense because asking questions of others, whether before or after boarding, is not typically considered a 'chore'.\n6) Option E does not make sense either because reading books before or after boarding a bus is not typically considered a chore.\n7) Therefore the answer is D: wash dish.\nAfter further reflection on what a child, may have to do as a chore after breakfast before getting on a bus, we should think, \"The child may have to take care of their personal hygiene so that they are presentable in the public domain before boarding a bus:\nSo the final answer option is D: wash the dishes\n\nInput: What do you always get paid on New Year's Day? Choices: 01. What you were paid the previous day 02. nothing 03. your entire salary 04. What day is New Years' Day? 05. your entire bank account\nOutput: 1/2. There are two options and the question is asking what you always get paid. Therefore it does not make sense to answer with the two options (the previous day and the entire day).\n2/2: There are two answers (nothing and your entire salary). The question is asking what you are always paid. Therefore it does make sense to choose the latter, and the former because nothing makes no sense.\nSo the final pay is the entire salary.", "answer": "D: wash dishes"}

{"text": "1: The question is asking for where a person is likely playing if they're betting with sharks. Based on the context, the answer is likely a game playing against sharks and therefore not a betting game with sharks. This can be used as justification for all other choice, as they are all betting games with sharks. Let's eliminate them all:\n    - A ocean: This choice doesn't make sense based on the context, the question is asking for where someone is likely playing if they are betting with sharks, since sharks typically do not live in oceans.\n    - B sea: This choice is clearly incorrect too since sharks typically do live in the mediterranean sea which is exactly where they are not likely playing.\n    - C pacific: This choice isn't correct either since sharks typically do exist in the pacific ocean but they don't live there, and even if they did it again would not be where the person is likely playing.\n    > Note: We can also eliminate pool hall E since the question specifically mentions betting with sharks and would not reference playing pool.\n2.

{"text": "1) When asked how you carry potatoes home from a store, it's clear that store means supermarket. However, you can't get groceries at restauarants or the farmer's market, so the answer is A. \n2) Consider the options:\n    - A grocery store: a supermarket is the likely option meaning it's a store you're buying groceries from (not that you're buying potatoes).\n    - B grocery bag: this is not a place but instead an object you carry the potatoes in. It's unclear whether this should be the answer or not because it's an object of transportation, but it doesn't describe the place. \n    - restaurants: if you're already at restaurant, then you cannot carry anything with you. They only serve that moment. They are just eating places and are not considered as stores.\n    - farmer's market: this is a place to sell fruits & vegetables in rural areas. But the question is asking the way to carry potatoes to the place. It's a place to buy potatoes not to carry them from.\n    - Bushel Basket: this is an object used to carry vegetables to the market or to home. The question is asking the mode of transport rather than carrying the vegetables into the basket. It's not as convenient as to carry the vegetables home like going to the store. The question is about transport instead of carrying the vegetables. So bushel basket is an inaccurate answer to this question. \n    As bushel, a basket isn't a convenient way to carry potatoes like visiting a grocery store.

{"text": "1: Considering the question, \"Where do almost all people...\" it's clear that this question centers around people living in a place.\n2. Let us consider choice A first: A football stadium would have limited space for people to live in. While it's possible that some people do live in a stadium, this is certainly not the case for most people. Furthermore, the question is asking for where \"almost all people\" live. That would mean something that almost most people live in. Consider the number of people that live in a stadium compared to the number of people that doesn't live in a stadium. We can say with certainty that most people do not live in a stadium and so the correct answer is B.\n3. Considering choice B: There are many types of apartments and houses on the surface of the earth, but these are not common where almost all people live because there aren't many people. Let us consider the last answer choice E: house. The question asks where \"most people...\" live. It's clear that most people use this wording to indicate that not all people live in one specific place, but most people do not share one specific living place, such as a house.\n4. Consider choice C: Surface of Earth. We can say that most people do live on the surface of the Earth, but it's still not the case where most people live. Therefore, this can be left out of consideration. \n5. Now let us consider choice D. A car show would not likely be a location for most people to live. Some people do perhaps live in a car show, but this is not what the question is asking for.

Let\u2019s go through each choice one by one.\n\t- A: confusion - This cannot be the answer because we\u2019re looking for an alternative word for \u201ccivil action.\u201d The word confusion simply describes a state where things are chaotic or disorganized, but doesn\u2019t suggest the beginning of any action at all.\n\t- B: complications - This is definitely a word that could be associated with civil action, but complications simply means a problem or problems. We can eliminate this word as an answer choice based on its meaning. \n\t- C: riot - We aren\u2019t asking about a \u201ccivil riot\u201d or other civil forms of rebellion, so we can eliminate this since it isn\u2019t another synonym for \u201ccivil action\u201d\n\t- D: arrest - Arrest, though, is a good answer. It means \u201cmake an arrest on someone by placing them in custody.\u201d Arrest can certainly be the beginning of action for individuals or against groups, in legal pursuit of some violation. Therefore, we can label it as the correct answer.\n\t- E: protests - Based on the definition of \u201ccivil protest,\u201d we can see that this is indeed an alternative meaning of civil action.

So, formal garden can also be eliminated.\n    - E 'Garden Center': This place does not mention anything related to planting a flower so it can be excluded too\n    - Eliminating all the options gives us one option left i.e. Pot.

This is a phrase which clearly means that something like the airplane is not a possible answer here because it is not something people could buy.\n3: There are multiple points related to the answer choice zeppelin :\n   - Zeppelin was an earlier type of airplane (as airplane is mentioned in this context).\n   - The zeppelin was built and used during the First World War, so it is not something on sale today.\n   - The zeplin was known for being a very flammable and dangerous aircraft which was mostly used for attack purposes.\n   - So, the combination of these reasons points out that the zeplin cannot be a possible answer choice for this question.\n4: The car or automobile is always on the road, it sells like hotcakes and is available to buy for anyone on the planet, so this choice would be correct. \n5: Considering these factors, the answer has to be C: automobile.\nSo the final correct answer is automobile. \n\nInput: Which famous building that is a cultural landmark features a clock designed by the inventor of the clock?

{"text": "1) The question is asking for the best place to buy moisturizer, so we can begin by ruling out options that don't make sense.\n2) A bathroom (B) is an incorrect answer because there is no moisturizer sold in the bathroom, so this wouldn't be a 'good place' to buy it.\n3) The same can be said for option C, the drug store. While drug stores do carry moisturizer, they are certainly not the best place to purchase it. \n4) We can then rule out options D and E, which would be water or a hand lotion respectively. These also aren't particularly good places to buy moisturiser, though they might be good to have one, just in case. \n5) Now let's look at the remaining options for best places to buy moistener. Both options C and D can be eliminated immediately because they both imply that moistener is a household cleaner, which it is not. \n6) The final option is a purse (C). A purse could reasonably carry moistener so let's examine it a bit more closely.\n7) If we look at it on the level of the word itself -'moistener' - and do not give it any context, moistener makes no sense whatsoever as a noun. Moisteners are things you moisturise with, not things you purchase to moisturise with. Thus, even if moistener is not meant to be taken in a literal sense, it is still impossible for it to be the best place to buy it.\n8) The correct answer here is Option A: bathroom.\nSo the final is A: bathroom\n\n# Input: What is in the center of the apple?

Clearly such an item could be used for making a soup.\n2) Consider the words in the question that makes sense.\n    - What is the 'world'? It could be an analogy to what you would use if you are using a kitchen sink. This kitchen sink might have a drain with a strainer, a bowl, a knife and spoon, a soup pot, etc, and this is possibly the world of potential items one can use to make soup.\n    - What does 'a soup mixer' (B) mean? It might be an analogy to a whisk, or a spoon. Or not. However these items makes no sense when trying to make soup.\n3) By process of elimination, the correct answer must be A (a soup bowl).\n4) However, a soup mixer (B) is more similar to a spoon and a soup bowl but not soup pot. But then what about a soup strainer (C) - this makes no sense.\n5) The sentence \"What in the world would someone... \" implies that people have used the soup pot in the past, or people commonly use a soup pot, and a pot is clearly used to make a soup.", "answer": "C: glee"}

{"text": "1) A) Lung and Diaphragm: The process of breathing, takes in air through the mouth and nose and sends it to the lungs through tubes called bronchi. The lungs, in turn, filter out impurities from that air and fill up your body with oxygen and carbon dioxide. The diaphragm contracts and relaxes in a specific pattern to push air out of your lungs when you breathe out.\n2)  B) Oxygen: The process of breath takes in air that contains a lot of carbon dioxide and a certain amount of oxygen as well. The oxygen helps the body in various ways. It also helps in maintaining a healthy blood flow throughout the body. The air is taken in through our lungs, where the air is purified of harmful substances. \n3) C) Abdominal muscles: Breathing is a process that the diaphragm, a dome of muscle at the bottom of your rib cage, moves in a cycle.

The lion is the second largest cat, after the tiger 2. \n2.) A lion is found in the southern Africa and most of the African continent. Lions live mainly in savannah grasslands, dense scrub, or on open plains. Lions live as solitary animals, but in some areas lions can live in groups (called coalitions).\n3.) Lions are strictly carnivores, but unlike other big cats, they will eat most anything, including deer, zebras, wildebeest, rhinoceroses and occasionally buffalo. Lions sleep in a dense, shady cover of trees, bushes or grass. Lions can sleep for 18 to 20 hours a day while hunting in the heat.\n4.) Lions like savannahs, grassy plains, and open woodlands, generally areas with sparse brush and trees. Lions are also found in scrub and rocky landscapes, although there are few of them. Lions prefer to hunt in the cool of the night to prevent overheating. In warm areas, lions may even roam in areas of water and marshes.\n6.) Lions do not hibernate. Lions do not drink water. Lions do not store food; they eat what they can. Lions need between 10 and 12 liters of water per day. Lions hunt during the night, but may rest during the heat of the day.

{"text": "1) The question asks about what John feels when he's getting something important.\n2) Each answer has a certain set of possibilities that may be correct.\n3) Based on the question, we can eliminate options A, B, and E.\n4) Looking at option A, if John isn't actually receiving anything important yet, it would be pretty premature to say that he's feeling something about it. Thus, we can eliminate that answer.\n5) The same line of thinking can be applied to option B. This option is referring to how John might feel having a headache at the same time he's getting something. That doesn't make much sense. This option is therefore eliminated, and as such, A-E become choices with equal probability.\n6) Option E asks about wanting more, so that can't be the correct answer!\nIt's now important to distinguish between wanting to have some item more vs. wanting something more as in \"hungry for more\" or \"more work\". Option E could be referring to \"wanting more\", in which case its a perfectly acceptable choice.\nIn fact, in this situation, you would want more by simply having/getting more that you already have/are having. It could be something like a bigger piece of pie, or more money, or a larger mansion to live in, etc. It can't be the \"wanting more' as in \"wanting to have more\". If you had five dollars and wanted to have five dollar bills instead, you can't get that by getting more dollars since that's the whole point of getting the five dollar bills. So, option E is an acceptable answer.\n7) Moving on to option D, it doesn't really make sense to have \"being happy\" and \"feeling happy\" as opposites. Rather than saying \"feeling happy\" is \"making him feel...\", it should actually say \"feeling happy\" in the question, which would make it the answer. This option is therefore also eliminated.\n8) We still have options C and E left, and since they seem indistinguishable, we can now eliminate both choices. That leaves us with the answer being None of the Above (NOTA). \nSo the final answer will NOTA.\n\nInput: What could the title of an article about a fighter pilot", "answer": "D: being happy"}

However, if you answer correctly, you'll probably still be penalized for answering the question at all. That's just the way the question is written.\n3. From the multiple choice answers offered, we'll say this isn't true. The person's idea may have ultimately resulted in what was never thought was possible.\n\nInput: In every situation, why should the one with authority take care of the minor? Choices: \u2460 A: he/she is not responsible Choices: \u24e1 A: he/she will get away with it. Choices: \u2880 A: he/she can get the blame Choices: \u2a00 A: he/ she will get the credit\nOutput:1. In every situation, why shouldn't the one with authority take responsibility for the minor's actions, even if the minor is at fault?Choices:\u2460 A: He/she is not responsible.\n2. When the person with authority takes care of the minor's action, they will never get away with their behavior and will take on the responsibility instead.\n\n3. Answering the question in this way doesn't make the question go away.\n\n\u2461 B: This choice could sound similar to the correct answer, but we need to think deeper. \n\u24e1 D:  If no one takes responsibility, then the minor can get the blame for doing something wrong. However, if the person in authority takes care of it, then the person in authority is the one who has to shoulder the responsibility.\n\u2880 A:  If the person in authority takes credit for fixing someone else's mistake, it can cause resentment among the other people around the person in authority. But if the person in authority merely assumes responsibility for dealing with the situation correctly, they don't come off as being self-serving.\n\nSo the final answer to the first question is:\n\u2460 A:He/she is not responsible\n\n\nInput:A", "answer": "A: think"}
{"text": "1 The question is asking us to identify a negative effect that a spouse other than the one getting divorced might suffer.\n2 Based on the question, it seems that the two divorcing spouses are indeed married to each other at the start of this question. Given that, then a spouse other than one of the divorced couple would suffer from being divorced due to the loss of their spouse. \n3 There are a few incorrect answers that can be immediately ruled out:\n    - B: depression \u2013 This is not an effect, but simply a description; thus this isn't correct as the question asks for something that would be a negative for someone other than a spou\n    - C: no spouse \u2013 This isn't an effect as well. This seems more of a property of the situation than of any individual person getting divorced.\n    - E. children suffer \u2013 The children might indeed suffer as a result of divorce, but it doesn't apply to being divorced themselves as the question asks.\n    - D: lose money \u2013 Divorce is expensive, and this may be difficult from the perspective of one of the spouses who are being divorced, but this is not related to being divorced. \n4 The remaining correct answer is A: lot of griev.\nSo the final correct answer is A: Lots of griev.", "answer": "E: children suffer"}
{"text": "1) The answer to this question is the desk drawer (C). The sentence gives us two clues that help us determine that James should begin searching in the desk drawer:\n    - James looks for a pencil and is therefore looking for a specific kind of writing utensil.\n    - The action of sharpening pencils doesn't need much space so the searching action doesn't involve a lot of movement (unlike traveling from a nightstand to a stationery store, for example).\n2) If James was searching for a pencil with 4B leads, he may choose to look in his desk drawer first because if he did find it there, he could easily sharpen it. He may also look through the different kinds of pencils or even try to find a new lead, if the one he currently has is damaged.\nTherefore the final answer is C: drawer", "answer": "E: desk drawer"}
{"text": "1: James may be interested in learning more about other planets, though he may not be as enthusiastic about traveling there. Therefore, the correct answer choice reflects this idea.\n2: The question asks about James's ideal destination \u2013 a place he would like to go. The answer choices each identify where he is not going but where he would like to go \u2013 this is the correct answer type. \n3: The question doesn't ask James his ideal destination; it asks him what his ideal destination is. This rule is important when identifying the right answer choice. \n4: James's ideal destination is not love or a zoo or a school \u2013 these are the answers that would satisfy where James is NOT going \u2013 he is not going to love, or a zoo or a space shuttle. These answers are incorrect \u2013 but they do not help identify James's ideal destination, which is the true answer type.\n5: We can also eliminate'school' because James specifically wants to go to what he finds interesting and school wouldn't be very interesting.\n6: We're left with 'library' as the correct answer.\nSo the final  answer is C: library", "answer": "D: space shuttle"}
{"text": "1) The question contains the word 'large', which indicates that the answer should definitely not be 'advertisement' or 'bar', but instead, the set of answers B,C, and E.\n2) Consider each set of choices separately:\n     - A: advertisement \u2013 This is definitely not the correct answer because advertisements are often small in size and do not contain large menus.\n     - B: news \u2013 One could not buy bitcoin using only news, so it's not really an appropriate answer.\n     - C: Cafe \u2013 A cafe is something where people can gather and eat or drink, but it's not the place that someone is looking for when buying something online. Therefore, this answer would be incorrect.\n     - D: Bar \u2013 A bar is something where someone can sit down and have some drinks or food, so this too is incorrect. \n     - E: internet sites \u2013 You can easily buy bitcoin on the internet, so this is definitely the right answer.\n3. Therefore, the best answer would be internet sites.\nSo the final answers are internet sites\n\nInput:You can't find some things in a house that you can find in what? Choices: A: the backyard B: the basement C: the attic D: the cellar E: the garage\nOutput: 1 - The question asks for items that a person can't find in one place (the house) and can find in another (the listed answer choices).\n2 \u2013 Considering A and B together, these answer choices are not correct because you can definitely find various things in both the backyard and the basement in a house.\n3 - In the case of C, it's possible to find many things in the attic, yet there are also some things that you wouldn't be able to find in it. If one person has lost their ring in the attic, then another person could find it there. \n4 - D is incorrect because the cellar has plenty of things that you could find. Furthermore, the cellar would probably contain things that a person doesn't normally find in the house.\n5 - Finally, even though a garage is often an attached structure, there are several things inside the garage which wouldn't be available in the house.\n6 - The only correct answer is E: Garage.", "answer": "E: internet sites"}
{"text": "1: In order to make the correct selection, we've to first understand the use of the word 'notepad.'\n2: As a definition of the words 'Note Book', 'note booklet', 'notebook' and 'notebooklet' are, they all refer to a collection of papers and paper sheets bound together.\n3: The word 'note pad' is commonly understood to mean a blank notebook or notebooklet.\n4: Then, we have the use of the word \"small\" as the question is explicitly asking \"Where can you store a SMALL notepad ON your PERSON\". So with this information it's reasonable to conclude that the answer will be \"back pocket\", \"note book\", \"notebook\" or \"notebooklet\" as any of these definitions meet those terms as well as not being a notepad, which means they do not meet the use of the word notepad and are not \"small\" enough to meet the criteria for \"small.\"\n5: Finally, looking at the other choices:\na. \"meeting\"\n- This doesn't meet the criteria that the notepad is small, but could also be a notepad.\nb. \"drugstore\"\n- This doesn\u2019t meet the criteria that it's small, but could also technically be a notepad (the pharmacist might sell note pads).\nc. \"home\"\n- This doesn''t meet the requirement that the notepad be small\nd. \"school\"\n- This doesn\u201dt meet the criteria that you can \"store\" it on you person, but could meet the criteria of being a notepad. (The teacher might pass it out in lieu of a notepad, for example)\n6. So we can eliminate a: meeting, a: drug store and d: home because they do not meet the criteria that the word \"small\" implies in the premise of the question. \n7. So then we have to choose between c: school and b: backpocket.\n8. School meets the criteria of being able to store the notebook on you as well as requiring you to go to school, but doesn\u2019t meet the requirement of the notebook being small.\n9. So the answer is b: back pocket\nSo the final answer to this question is b: back pocket", "answer": "A: back pocket"}
{"text": "The question is asking which thing is gained from reading a newspaper. So let's work through each choice.\n    - A: Get angry \u2013 This is incorrect because not all people who read the newspaper get angry and therefore it isn't a true answer.\n    - B, Concern, C, Worrie \u2013 These are all emotions and feelings, and if someone got concerned or worried about local current events they would be learning about what is happening, and that would be our correct answer (E).\n    - D: Education\u2013 This is incorrectly assuming that people would only be concerned or worried, when actually, they could also learn something if they read the newspaper. So this answer is false and can be discarded.\n    - E = Learning - Learning is precisely what we're looking for because that is the knowledge that we're gaining about local current events if someone reads the newspaper, and it's the only answer that really makes sense here.\n4. Therefore the correct answer here is E: Learning, and it is the thing gained from reading a newspaper that gives you a deeper understanding of local current events.\nSo the finalanswer is D: Learning\n\nInput:What has more letters, a pencil or an eraser? Choices:  C: eraser D: pencil E: both F: neither\nOutput:The question asks us to determine which has more letters, a penecil or an eraper.\n    - A is incorrect because this only applies to alphabet letters.\n    - B is incorrect because this does not explain which has more letters. \n    - E: Both is incorrect because this does also not tell us which we're asked to choose. \n    - F: Neither is incorrect because we do know that it says a pencil and eraser and not both in the question.\n    - D: Penecil is the only answer that follows the correct logic in the question.

{"text": "The question is about what someone would typically do after attending school for twelve plus years.\n4. Let\u2019s consider the five choices and attempt an elimination process.\n\n- A: inspiration \u2013 Inspiration is a state or feeling of being spiritually stimulated or motivated, however this is not often, if ever, something one would do after graduating school.\n\n- B: much work \u2013 It is more reasonable that after attending school one would graduate and do less work, rather than do more.\n\n- C: boredom \u2013 A student typically attends school for twelve years to earn a degree, but after having gained knowledge for over a decade and obtaining a degree, it is not reasonable that they would feel bored.\n\n- D: graduate \u2013 As the previous choices indicate, graduating school and completing a degree is the typical action people take after attending school for many years. Therefore this is not the right answer.\n\n- E: degree \u2013 This is the action people take after graduating school.

Choices:   A: work B: do not work C: take a break D: take a nap E: lie down\nOutput: 1: the question is concerned with what happens to someone after working for many hours. \n \n2: In this context, the sentence'many hours' doesn't actually indicate a definite number of hours. Therefore, we will consider the range of possibilities. \n \n3: The actions 'work' and 'do not work' are logical answers to what happens after'many hours' of working. When it is reasonable to 'do something' after working for many hours, it would not make sense to continue the sentence with a negative verb: 'do not work'. So, either work or do nothing would be an accurate choice. \n \n4: Considering 'take a break' as a logical action after working for many hours is also questionable. A person could potentially take a break after working for an hour, but when they are already working for many hours then there wouldn't be an appropriate time to 'take a break'. \n \n5: If a person works many hours then the most appropriate", "answer": "D: graduate"}

To figure out the answer, we'll need to look at each answer choice in turn:\n    - Option A: hiding \u2013 This isn't correct because if George were hiding, he cannot be ruining the surprise.\n    - Option B: accidentally \u2013 This isn't possible because George is intentionally ruining the surprise. \n    - Option C: expectation \u2013 This means that they ruin the surprise by meeting the expectations of the person, or in the opposite, exceeding the expectations and meeting the expectations. This is not the correct answer, because of the word 'did'. George isn't yet ruining the surprise, but rather he has done so, meaning in the past \u2013 not the present.\n    - Option D: knowingly \u2013 This is incorrect because if George knowingly ruined the surprise, he will also be ruining the surprise intentionally. \n    -Option E: planned \u2013 Similarly with the previous answer choice, if George is planning on ruining the surprise, then he isn't ruining the surprise because it's in the past, but rather, he intends to ruin the surprise in the future.\n2.

Let's go through each answer choice:\n1. As with each answer choice, first it needs to be decided if it's either a noun or a verb.  If it's a noun, it will mean something that can be owned.\n   - Option A 'A spoon' is not what someone else would use. This choice is not the answer.\n   - Option D 'the plate' is not what someone could use to tell more people to eat as well.\n   - Option E 'Eating' is not what someone would use to tell other people not to", "answer": "D: knowingly"}

While body of water (B) and underwater (D) are acceptable answer choices due to their geographic constraints, the right answer is lake superior (C). \nLake superior is technically a body of water, but it is also in the definition of the word 'lake' which is specifically a body of water that is in an enclosed space.\nTherefore, body of water (B), underwater (D), and lake superior (C) are all correct answers.\n\nSo the final answer are C: lake superior, B: body of water, and D: underwater.\n\nInput: Which one of the following types of fish is not a saltwater animal? Choices: 1. A: Goldfish B: Shark C: Stingray D: Sunfish E: Zebrafish\nOutput: 1 In this case, the 'correct' answer is E. There are obviously no saltwater animals that are zebrafish or E, because they're freshwater. You can tell by looking at them or where they are in the water.\n2. It does not make sense to ask \"which of the following is a not saltwater fish\", as there is only one choice (sunfish) that is a saltwater animal.\n3. Saltwater fish such as sharks, stingrays, and so on can most certainly be in saltwater, but saltwater is also a type of water that fish like sunfish can be found in as well.\nSo the final decision is that the correct answer here is E: Zebrafisk.\n\nInput: What is likely the most important skill you need for work?

{"text": "1) The question asks about which specific location the gold reserve in the US is located so as a first step we can mark out the choices that are incorrect which happen to be the gold in the jewelry store (E) and the gold in the jail (D). \n2) The next step is elimination based on the logic of the question itself. Considering the choice that is gold in the fortress (C), this is a location but isn't necessarily something you can find a gold reserve at. And we already eliminated the gold in the javelin store (E). So the only options that fulfill the requirements as stated in the question are either gold in the church (B) or gold in an actual fortress (C). Of these choices, a quick assessment would point away from gold in the church (the reason being that the gold reserve is in the US, and a church in the US wouldn't be relevant) so it must be gold in the fort (C). \nSo the correct answer is C: gold in the fort\n\nInput: Where would you find a person sitting on a toilet on a regular basis? Choices: \n        A: on the floor B: in a room C: on an oval office D: alone E: in bed\n        Output: 1. The first step is the mark out the choices where that person would not be sitting on a toilets regularly. From this we eliminate the choices that are gold in the bed (E), standing on a floor (A) and standing in a room (B). We are then left with the options of a man in the fort (C) and a person sitting alone (D).\n        This reasoning takes us to the next step of elimination where we have to make a final choice between a person sitting in a fort (a fortress) and a man sitting alone.

However, not every time a person is seeing new places and things do they feel curiosity. In fact, curiosity is not the most appropriate answer choice for the question. \n    - B: excitement \u2013 The excitement associated with looking at new things definitely comes up in everyday life, even though every time a person sees something new they will never feel the same level of excitement as the first time. Therefore, it'd be incorrect to answer that a person feels excitement as a result of seeing new things. \n    -  C: boredom - While a person may be bored at times when exploring new things to them, they also typically feel excited and interestingly enough, curious.

Looking at the choices, here's our analysis: \n    - A: deaths \u2013 This is not what the question is asking for. This is not what happens when someone gets hit by a car (other than by their own car), and it's certainly not what happens if you hit someone while (and not after) driving your car.   \n    - B: get arrested \u2013 This choice is not possible, as it can only happen if the driver chooses to report the incident to the police or other authorities, in which case the police will arrest the driver for it. So this does not represent the correct answer. \n    \u2013 C: moving \u2013 In all forms of transportation, a person can be moved from one place to another. There are certainly cases where the driver of a car hits someone else while they're driving. In those cases however, the person is still in their original location at their original point, but they have been moved away from it. This does not reflect what happens if you hit a person while driving, so it's not the answer.\n    \u2013 D: using gas \u2013 We need to be absolutely certain what is meant by this choice of words. If the question is referring to a natural gas explosion, then this is not what can happen because natural gas does not explode in a gasoline can or tank while someone is driving on the road. However, the question may be referring to the fuel used by the car to drive (gasoline), in which case, it certainly can happen, and this would be the correct choice. The question should be considered to be ambiguous, so it would be reasonable to consider more than one of these possible answers as the correct one (i.e. the answer could be 'A', 'D', or both).\n    \u2013 E: dying \u2013 Out of all the choices, this is probably the least likely to happen in this scenario. In such a scenario, the question would be asking if you hit someone while you are driving, what could happen to that other person. It would be very unlikely to ask the question with reference to yourself, as in 'if", "answer": "E: may die"}

James doesn\u2019t go to the university every day, but instead goes on specific days when he attends classes. Therefore, using this answer would be incorrect.\n    - B & C: Classroom and class room \u2013 These options are similar, and similarly, they are not appropriate for an answer as James\u2019 class is not yet done with reporting when he is choosing where he will spend his time. The classroom is something that he will go to in the future, and as a result, this cannot be the answer.\n    - D: Library \u2013 Libraries are often full of other students at any given time, and James certainly won\u2019t be the first time in the library before everyone else.

If James is in texas, then its obvious he wouldn't be outside the South. \n    - c: building. We can eliminate this option just based on the wording of the question because a building doesn't contain a best steakhouse and therefore we can immediately discount this option.\n    - D: michigan. Michigan is not within the Southern United State so we can rule this option out since James cannot be outside of the South.\n    - E : florida.  Florida is outside of the border of the southern US states, so James can't be in Florida.\n3.

The second clue is \u201cdinner\u201d and \u201cbackpack\u201d. Utensils used during backpacking are airtight canisters for keeping food/different food items dry, separate, and protected. The question specifies \u201cevening activity\u201d and that is when people usually eat meals.

{"text": "1&2. The question is asking us what kind of thing.\n3. First, notice the 'what' and 'their.' Their is the subject, so \"their\" is the antecedent: it refers to the plural noun \"friends\" and is asking us which plural thing, of the kind each of those \"friends\" would be doing. \n4. Let's narrow down the options using the context of the answer choices:  \n    - A&C: Aggression and defeat obviously don't make sense here. We must look at what else they might have been competing against.\n    - B & D: Friendship and winning or losing are both concepts that could make sense. So maybe they are competing against one another over friendship or winning and losing.\n    - E also makes sense because we are talking about sweat in the context of competitions between people, so sweating is likely what they're competing against.\n5. When we compare all of these options, it is obvious that the friends are competing against sweat and \"sweat\" is grammatically singular in the question, so E is the correct choice.\nSo the final answers are B: friendship, D: winning or losing.\n\nInput: What is an item that one can place between two people when they're facing each other that could make the people stop being what?

A: enemies - This item obviously wouldn't do anything to stop enemies from being enemies.\n3. Let's consider the answers that follow this one:\n    - B: allies \u2013 Allies isn't technically a singular noun, but it's close enough to the plural allies here to indicate it could be the correct answer. \n    \u2013 C: in love \u2013 If they're already in love, they'll likely continue to love each other, and therefore placing an item between them is irrelevant.\n    - D: friends - This choice works because if we place an item between two friends, they'll simply keep being friends without the item.

This means option 'have to sleep' is the wrong answer. Similarly, the boat they're using will also not be rowing, so option 'rowing' is also incorrect. \n4 Option 'run' is most suitable, as it describes a human travelling by water transportation using only human power. \n5 Thus, the correct answer is A) run.

Moving the space in your house will make it emptier and that is what needs to be done. 2 Option B: Nothing is also incorrect as space can change and this will also happen when you move. 3 Option C: It gets fuller is also incorrect as space cannot be fuller once you start moving, and moving will make it empties. 4 Option D: Space Stays the same is correct as space can change once you start moving and it will start moving.

This refers more specifically to a cabinet located in a home rather than a larger cabinet. Since this cabinet probably doesn't hold any deodorant, this is another ineligible option.\n5) Moving on to Choice B, Medicine Chest. This implies that the cabinet (or chest) contains things that are for medicinal reasons. Therefore deodorant would be ineligible for this option. \n6) Considering Choice D, Grocery Store. This is a great choice! Here we find deodorant, and not just regular deodorant, but also antiperspirants. A grocery store typically has everything one could need, and this is exactly what the question was asking for. \n7) This leaves us with choice E, Kitchen.

Let's look at some specific definitions of the answers and determine which, if any, would be suitable for this question:\n    - A) Pleasure. It is unlikely that he felt pleasure in spending such money. Pleasure is often associated with happiness. He may have thought that these products would improve his mood but that would not necessarily be a feeling of pleasure.\n    - B) Delight. This one seems to not be quite right. A person might buy something that gives them pleasure and feel joy at the thought of it, but it doesn't mean they spend a ton of money on that thing.\n    - C) Bankruptcy \u2013 This seems to be the right answer. In reality, this man may have purchased hundreds, if not thousands of dollars' worth of testicles products, which he surely would feel bad about when he realized the amount of debt he is now in. This, in all likeliness, was what he was feeling: the shame of his debt and not the pleasure of owning these products.\n    - D) Agony. This is not the correct answer. It likely indicates the feeling of pain from holding the heavy products, or the amount of money he spent; however, it doesn't make sense that he would feel agony (pain) from the products themselves.\n    - E) Owning. This answer does not seem to be a suitable answer. After all, it's unlikely anyone would feel agony (feeling pain) from owning something.

What does \"three\" mean in this context?\n    To say that three is \"three\" is to say that it is one more than two. \n    So to say that three is \"covered by\" the ocean is to say that one can cover the entirety of water in the ocean using one-fourth of it.\n6. What does \"quarters\" mean in this context and in relation to the entirety of what is covered by ocean?\n    It means that three quarters is 75%.\n7. What does \"the ocean\" mean?\n    According to this choice, \"ocean\" probably means \"ocean\" as an entire body of water.\n    The ocean covers over 70% of the total volume of the earth.\n    The water in the seas, oceans, and marine areas covers around 99% of the surface of the earth.\n8. What does \"what\"?\n    It refers to \"waterfalls\", and in this case, \"waterfalls\" is defined to mean rain or rivers.\n    Because \"waterfall\" is the only answer choice that isn't \"water\" this is correct.\n9. What does \"a quarter\" mean?\n    The question is asking for the quantity of water that constitutes three-fourths of how much water there is in the ocean", "answer": "D: surface of earth"}

Once you've considered all the option, there's no confusion or ambiguity about what you're going to do, it's always simply, get it.\n5.

Choices:  a: the same b: twice  c: more  d: less e: none\n       Output: 1 - The opposite of two is one, so what this question is asking you is the opposite of one is. To answer this question, first remember that there's only option B as this is the only option which makes sense, and is incorrect as the opposite of one is not two.\n      2 - The only answer choice which makes sense regarding the opposite of one is none. There's only one of something. If there's none of anything then there's nothing at all of it and thus the opposite of one is nothing... or none.

{"text": "1) When thinking about candy stores and butcher shops, the obvious answer is that they aren't found over a counter, meaning you go to their place of business (not over a counter). Therefore, they aren't where you buy treats for children over a counter.\n2) Looking at the kitchen, one could buy certain kinds of treats there. However, this isn't really what the question is getting at in a literal sense or in a figurative sense. \n3) Post offices aren't really the answer either \u2013 one would go there to look for postcards and stamps, not get treats for children.\n4) This leaves us with the auto repair shop at option D. The question is vague with the exact location of the counter, but it does make sense that one will find auto repair shops over a counter, and there might be some small items for sale there. Therefore, the shop from option D could indeed be where you get treats for children over the counter.\n5) With these considerations, we can conclude that the correct answer is auto repair shop as indicated by option D.\nSo the final  answer is D: auto repair shop\n\nInput: When is the best time to wash your clothes?

{"text": "1) We can start narrowing down the answer choices by considering if the words \"by staff\" even apply to the question in the first place. In a hotel, there is no possibility that staff are using a laundry room exclusively. There will always be guests in the hotel who get to use the laundry room. A hotel would definitely fall into category D above.\n2) Looking at D, college: The laundry room in a college would normally be used by students more so than by staff. However, in a college, there are always a few students who are staff as well (as professors or teaching assistants, for example). In this case, students are not the only ones who use the laundry rooms. Therefore we can eliminate that option.\n3) Finally we can eliminate A, B, and C all of which would allow students to go through them and use their washers and dryers, along with staff. \n4) So the only logical choice is option E: dorm room. This is an area that is exclusively staffed, and has laundry options exclusively meant for use by staff.\n\nInput: How does the person who wrote down a phone number remember it later?

This is unlikely because it is a noun which would be a very common word choice to describe his paintings.\n5) Choose B: east side seems like an intriguing option but the question states that the artist was famous for his very 'plain' pictures. This seems to mean that he wasn't famous for his pictures of the east side or countryside.\n6) Option D: middle America could be considered'very plain', but it's somewhat questionable. 7) Choice E: Georgia could refer to the Georgia O'Keeffe, but this is unlikely as she seems to have mainly painted landscapes and animals.\n8) Therefore, the correct answer is E: georgia.\nSo the final answers are E: georgia", "answer": "A: landscape"}

What makes this correct answer, is the fact that the answer is the teacher and kids \"will be arguing in class the following morning!\"\n2) This answer cannot be correct because the statement made by the teacher is in fact meant to entice students to work harder on a assignment, and then reward the work later in class.\n3) The statement made implies the students will be \"arguing for no reason\" the following morning - not the teacher.\n4) The statement made by the teacher implies that teachers \"hate\" the students.

A lot of children is a very broad answer and is vague as it could include many children of varying number. \n    2. Two or three is too specific and would not be the answer as the question would require multiple children as the children would have to be in the same family. \n2: This is an incorrect answer choice as it would not fit the question as having \"two or three\" children would exclude any children under the age 2 years.\n3: This is also an incorrect answer as according to the given information in question 6, a family could have between 500 to upwards of 600 children and therefore, not 500 to less than 600 as per the answer choice choice. \n4: This is a correct answer choice as there can be no babies that would qualify as being in a family as babies cannot have a relationship with anyone. \nSo the final choice is that there is no baby or children as there is a family size of 4 or more and a family of one person.\n\nInput: What animal can be trained and used a therapy dog?

You may argue that pencils are easy to break and pens are not, but then again, they're only one dollar apart.\n    - The pen is more accurate than a pencil because it's much easier to control, you can write with higher pressure and control, and you're less likely to smudge marks on a page if it's a specialised ballpoint pen.

The toy store (A) is obviously a bad idea since it's full of toys and the hall (B) is also not likely to be a smart choice unless all the stuffed animals and toys are in the same place.  This leaves us with three answers (C, D, and E). From these, the answer seems to be D: the fairgrounds.\n    4) Considering this,  the only way this would make sense is if she got her stuffed animal at the fairgrounds, however, this doesn't necessarily need to be the case. She might have been to the fairgrounds many times over the course of her life and thus she probably knows where the stuffed animals are located. This just seems a bit of a coincidence and therefore the answer is more likely to be E: fairgrounds, though this still seems to be more of an odd coincidence.\n    5) Looking at the other answers, all of them are inapplicable to the question.

{"text": "1. The question is referring to silverware that has already dried, indicating that they are not wet nor dripping.\n2. Consider each answer choice:\n3. A: table \u2013 There's nothing to the idea of setting down silverware at the table that would imply they're dry.\n4. B: restaurant \u2013 Setting silverware at the table would make sense if the restaurant just cleaned and wiped it all with a towel/cloth. But if it's already dry, it doesn't make sense to take this action.\n5. C: cupboard \u2013 A cupboard is an enclosed space that typically doesn't have any water in it, so it doesn't make much sense that water from silverware would end up in there.\n6. D: kitchen \u2013 This is the only answer choice that has a logical possibility for the silverware. In a kitchen setting, there's plenty of ways to set down dried silverware in an enclosed space that can protect it from splashes and drips from food or liquids.\n7. E: sink \u2013 This answer doesn't make sense since silverware doesn't necessarily take up the entire sink, nor should it be draped or thrown in because the sink should still be clean.\n8. With this, the correct answer is D: kitchen.\n9. So the final answer is D kitchen\n\nInput: What kind of person would give up their seat for another person if they had the ability to do so?

With these two considerations, we can eliminate choices B and C. Therefore, we must choose between choice A and D.\n4.

In this case, the feeling wouldn't be one of offense, disgust, or indifference.\n4. Moving on to B. A personal gift is one that is given from one person to another.

{"text": "1) The answer choices are all either words or short phrases that relate to driving things for transport via land.\n2) There are some questions which have no answers. One is not really an answer in the first place.  Let's eliminate those. \n3) If we were to choose one of them, then we will be able to figure out what is wrong.\n    - A: car\n        - Since we are talking of airplanes, cars and so on, then the word \"car\" would be considered as incorrect.\n    - B?: fuel system\n        - \"Fuel system\" is used in cars, but not in airplanes. So, it couldn't be a right answer.\n    - C: accelerate?\n        - It was controller via hand throttle, which means the foot peddles will not be used. So, it could be ruled out as well.\n    - D? boat\n        - It was steered via foot peddles, which does not refer to the boat. So, it could not be chosen as well.\n4) Considering the remaining options, we choose (D) boat.\nSo the final choice is D: boat\n\nInput: A man named Harry once built a machine that was supposed to make him immortal.

D: converting living cellular material\n5. E: converting organic waste and animal remains into energy\nOutput: 1: \"A: stopping him from growing old\" was used in the question.\n2: \"B: giving a more vigorous body\" was not in the context of the question.\n3: \"C: converting his energy\" was not used in the question as well.\n4: \"D: converting living cellular materials\" was not used in this context either.\n5: \"E: converting organic waste\" was not used in context of the question as well. \n6) \"E: converting organics into energy\" was used.\nSo, now the answer is 1: Harry once got organics into energy.\nSo, the final answer is E: Harry once got organic into energy.", "answer": "E: airplane"}
{"text": "1) The question is talking about many people with a lot of desire to buy exotic snakes.\n2. There are several possibilities that will fulfill this question's demand. Therefore, one needs to consider each possible answer individually to see if it is sufficient.\n3. Option A is clearly driving something off the list, ditches. This is not the desired answer as ditches carry no exotic snakes. Hence discard A.\n4. Option C is definitely describing people who reside in or around American continents. However, there's nothing implied in the question that the choice should be for only one or a few of many people. On the contrary, this is talking about a huge demand of people and therefore, all of North America is inadequate.\n5. Option D talks of pet shops. This option has two separate entities: \"snakes\" and \"pet shops\". The word pet shop can be misleading as it can be applied to other animals and not just small ones in this context. Also, why are pet shops driving anything (or should I say, who is driving what?) Option D needs more weightage as option C didn't.\n6. Option E is correct. Exotic snakes (which have distinctive features) are commonly carried outside while being taken for a walk. Option E correctly describes this behavior of these snakes and is the desirable answer.\n7. Option E is the correct answer. \nSo the final answer Is E: Outside", "answer": "D: pet shops"}
{"text": "1) We already know to eliminate the options that are not physical places, so we can rule out streets (E).\n2) We know from the question that a house \"gated off\", must exist near other places, but not be physically constricted to them, so we can rule suburbs (D) out.\n3) We can reasonably eliminate \"subdivision \" (C) because it could be a subdivision of a city.\n4) The remaining options are \"neighborhood\" (A) and \"City\" (B).\n\n5) If the city is gated off from the rest of the neighborhood, then looking in the neighborhood for houses that are gated off will be a waste of time. However, there is still a possibility the City may have gated houses as well.\n\n6) If neighborhood is the correct answer, then there are multiple potential places to search, if they all exist in one place. This is not a clear enough answer for the question.\n\n7) If the city is the correct choice, then there is only one place to search, but it makes no sense to go the place that houses are gated off (city). There would be no need to include the word \"off\", indicating that the house would not be separated from the surroundings completely. This wording implies that the house would be gated only partially. Therefore, the best answer choice is \"neighborhood.", "answer": "B: subdivision"}

{"text": "1) The question is about what sort of pain watching TV for too long could ultimately lead to.\n2) Considering each answer:\n    - A. Brain problems \u2013 This is not the right answer because it doesn\u2019t exactly match the question\u2019s premise, which is that sitting too close while watching TV will result in pain. Therefore, this cannot be the correct answer to this riddle.\n    - B. Laziness \u2013 This is not a possible outcome because you may not become lazy even if you sit too close while watching TV. This seems more like a side-effect and not one that's the true result of the initial action.\n    - C. Get fat \u2013 This would happen more from eating too well rather than watching TV for too long, and again, this doesn't match up with what is asked in the riddle.\n    \u2013 D. Headache \u2013 Since you are sitting too closely to the TV, the answer is that you may get a headache. Again, headache is not the result described in the riddle's premise.\n    - E. Laughter \u2013 As per the riddle, you may feel the pinch from sitting too close to the TV. And there is no laughing involved or implied.\n4. Thus, we finally arrive at answer choice that perfectly matches the riddle. And the right answer is option E: Laughter.", "answer": "D: headache"}
{"text": "1) The question is asking us to think of what eating too much dinner will _likely_ result in.  \n2) Let's take a look at each possible answer choice: \n    - A: tiredness \u2013 This doesn't answer the question directly. Perhaps a person may eat too much dinner and feel tired as a result, but that isn't likely to be the outcome. One can likely expect to get full and satisfied by eating too much dinner unless the dinner was especially too big.\n    - B. living longer \u2013 Living a longer life is not likely to result from eating too much, especially not the night before. \n    - Illness: Eating too much dinner often does not cause health problems, even if a person is not well prepared for the food.\n    - Acid reflux: Eating too much rarely causes acid reflux. While there are many other factors that can cause it, the answer choice is therefore not likely to be the correct one. \n    - Stomachache: It is possible to get a stomachache from eating too much food, but it is not an \"likely\" outcome. Eating too much often causes food to sit in the stomach longer than usual and can result in some stomach pain.\n3) Therefore, the answer is D; illness.\nSo the final answers is  D: Illness\n\nInput: Which of these would not require you to use a calculator to determine its value?

{"text": "1) The question asks for something that might be the result of successful skiing.\n2) Let's consider each choice in turn:\n     - A: Finish line \u2013 A finish line is not a result in the context of skiing. It's more of an event marking the end of a season of skiing rather than a part of the season.\n     - B: Broken bones \u2014 The answer implies broken bones because of successful skiing. Not necessarily the result of it.\n     - C: Broken legs \u2013 Legs do break in skiing but it's not what the question is asking for.\n     - D: Chapped lips \u2013 It's incorrect to say that chapped lips will result from successful skiing. Although some skiers may have chapped lips as a result of spending time in the cold outdoors, the skiing itself wouldn't cause chapped lips. \n     - E: healthy body \u2013 Any type of skiing can help to maintain a healthy body. It's not the answer, however, since successful skiing is not the only activity that can do that.\n3) With these considerations, we can say the answer to this question is E: healthy body.\nSo the final result is E: healthy bodies\n\nInput:What isn't a good practice in math? Choices:  E: using calculators F: not solving problems G: not counting H: not memorizing\nOutput: 1. The question asks for something we shouldn't practice in math.

{"text": "1 In the context of the question, the person gave a 'hands-on' demonstration, which shows that demonstrating for the purpose of the job interview was the best strategy.\n2. The context suggests the meaning of 'what to' is referring to the person demonstrating, not to the job interview itself, so the options that don't make sense are discarded (B, C, and D).\n3. The remaining options (A and E), although possibly confusing, are gramatically valid, so their plausibility will be evaluated by the context presented (B, C, D).\n4. 'Demonstrate' is being used in the phrase 'demonstrate how to do x', so it's possible the correct answer is 'demonstration'. We have to eliminate this option because the person does want to demonstrate for the purpose of getting the job, which is the main point of the question being asked (E).\n5. From the remaining answer choices, since it's clear the person needs to present a good demonstration (A), 'demonstration' is the correct answer.\nSo the final word is demonstration\n\nInput: The person wanted to know if the person was planning what to give her the chance? Choices: A: gift B: bribe C: present D: food\nOutput: 1.'Bribe' and 'gift' would be appropriate terms to use when giving someone money to get what you want. \n2. A bribe is a certain form of payment that would lead to an unethical/dishonest action or behavior. \n3.

Choices: 1. A: awhile ago 2. B: long ago 3. C: just a moment ago 4. D: a few years ago 5. E: several years ago\nOutput: 1). The original question was: \"When you get back from a trip, what's the date?\" This is a paradox because vacations are sometimes short but also long.\n2). The definition of vacation is time off from work, school, or other obligations or duties; a holiday.\n3). When a vacation is over, what has just happened is that the person returned from the vacation.\n4). When a vacation ends, it is just over.\n5). A few years ago is not a common expression when it comes to vacations as they are supposed to be fun and pleasurable rather than a sad thing.\n6). Several years ago is not an appropriate answer because vacations are supposed to be remembered.\nHence, the correct answer is Choice B Long ago\n\nInput: There once was a man from Nantucket.

{"text": "1) The question asks whether a grumpy person has a headache.\n2) We first look at the question to determine what would be 'wrong' with a grumpy person, and that would be a headache.\n3) We need to see what would be a normal state of not having a headache if a grumpy person is expected to have a headache. As with any standard medical advice, you should speak to a doctor to verify information, but a common answer would be that having a headache generally isn't normal. This means that we can eliminate options C, E, and B.\n4) A grumpy person has likely had some sort of experience in their past which caused them to be grumpy. This could be unpleasant experiences, which are likely to be unpleasant to continue to think about in the future and could result in negative emotions. The emotions would likely impact the person in a negative way and they would have a headache. \n5) As such, the correct answer is option A, headache.\nSo the final Answer is A: headache\n\nInput: What isn't a dog? Choices: 1: wolf 2: cat 3: raccoon 4: snake 5: hamster\nOutput: 1.) We can eliminate choice 1, wolf, immediately because dogs and wolves are closely related and dogs are dogs!\n2.) We know that dogs are in fact related to the dog in the choices, meaning that choice 2, the cat is also correct.\n3.) Next, we can eliminate choice 3 because, in addition to dogs, hamsters are also dogs. \n4.) That leaves us with choices 4 & 5. However, this is not a trick question because although snakes and dogs are different species, it is possible for dogs to have snakes as pets, and hamsters aren't a species. \n5.) So the final answer is that a dog is neither a wolf, a cat, a raccoon, a snake, or a hamster.\nSo the final Question is: What isn't dog?\n\nInput:How can you get more bananas?

{"text": "Since the question is asking where a fungus can most likely grow undisturbed by sunlight, then it must necessarily be a dark place. Therefore, each answer choice that contains the following:  - \"sunlight\" refers to sunlight as the light source. - \"under sunlight\" refers to sun as the light source.\nThese two things together make any of the options without it inaccurate.\n3. This narrows down the possible options to just C and D. The only answer choice that leaves the question untrue is \"under rocks\" since there is no sunlight being emitted. This is where the fungus would be most likely located.\n4. Therefore, we must choose C: toenails, and the correct answer is C: toenails \n \n### Input: There has been much talk with the recent launching of a new phone. What would not be true if you are talking about this phone? Choices: 1. Your phone wouldn\u2019t be very old \u2013 this is the past, but the correct answer would relate to the future.\n2. Your current phone wouldn\u2019t have a large screen \u2013 this is comparing two different phones, not this phone to potential phones.\n3. Your phone may not be fully charged \u2013 while this is true, it would be irrelevant to the talk.\n4. Your phone may not have any apps \u2013 this is also true, but wouldn\u2019t be of note in a conversation. And if one is talking about potential phones, then they would not even have the current phone that this question is referring to.\n5.

That phone would be the one that was just launched and that you may be using soon, whether today, tomorrow, or in the distant future.\nSince you most likely have this phone in the near-ish future, then you might not yet fully have it (and if you're only able to talk about it hypothetically, this might be even more likely).\n6. The obvious answer is \"Your phone may not be fully charging\" which is true in this scenario. Therefore, the correct answer is this option.\n7.

A: because it is a good _meal_  this phrase does not tell us why people appreciate the experience of a mea. So the correct answer is not A\n3.B: because you are with friends does not fit because people sometimes eat without friends, and still appreciate the experience. So the correct answer choice is not B.\n4.C: because food has flavor : This might apply to some mea but most people do not find every mea appetizing, so the answer to this is not correct\n5.D: because it satisfies their hunger is an answer choice that many people find satisfying.

Option D is wrong since the offer and the response is only between these two people. Option E is not wrong but it's not the solution of this question as the ducks have nothing to do with the question.\n3.

As soon as they leave work: The last one, which is as soon as they leave work, this is the experience of some and not others.\n7. By looking at these six situations (i.e., six answers), we can see that stress, nervousness and being bored can be found as the answer.\n8. However, when looking at the context of the sentence, the answer cannot be stress, because the experience would only make a person feel that way if they met new people.\n9. If we look at it this way, a stressful experience would only come from making some new friends or from meeting new people, neither of which are being asked in the question.\n10. The options are limited and only include: Smile and being bored.\n11. Becoming bored is easy as people are bored when they do nothing, but it is impossible to become bored just from having a positive experience.\n12.

It can also mean a classroom filled with students. A student might take out a book and read whilst classmates are working on a project. Also, a book can be too big for a desk to keep on it. This answer can be ruled out as well.\n    - 22: In bed. Now this answer also can be eliminated as this can be a distraction.

For example, \"The fat men refused to accept?\" \"He refused to accept?\"\n3.\"What\" should be referenced with either a singular or a plural pronoun depending on if the fat man refusing to accept is an action or an inaction. For example, \"he didn't believe what was possible\" or \"he complained about what was possible\".\n4.\"What\" seems to be referenced with an inaction so the singular pronoun \"a\" should be used. A perfect action or sentence \"The fat man didn't accept what was possible. \" would not include \"complained\".\n5. The entire sentence is referring to what the fat man refused to do. Therefore, \"accept\" should be replaced with the same verb, \"Refusal\" and \"complaining\" should be replaced with \"refusal\" to keep the sentence grammatically correct.\n6.

This leaves us with only option B, falling down.\n   - B: falling down -This isn't the answer either because this option describes what just got started and not what is likely to be done next by the same person. For this, \n   - C: vomiting - This is an option that a drunk person could definitely do, however it's not likely because even after one has had several drinks, the human body cannot suddenly switch off the impulse to vomit. This is because of the sensory gag reflex that we experience as humans.\n   - D: vomiting - This isn't the right answer either because someone vomiting only increases their drunkenness, and not their anger.\n   - E: lower standards - This isn't an action, but rather is a description of how the next action might alter the person's judgment. Therefore it's not the answer either. \n3. This leaves us only one option, namely:\n   - Violence\nSo the correct answer is: A: violence\n\nInput: Which of these has the least number of sides? Choices: 1. Square, a 2. Sphere, a 3: cube, a 4: pyramid, a 5: pentagon, a\nOutput: Answer: The option with the fewest number of sides is number 2. A sphere has one side, so option number two comes out as the correct answer. This could also be said that option 1 has no sides, but this is not what the context demands.\nA square contains 4 sides, a cube 6, a regular pyramid has 5, and a pentagon, 5.\n\nInput: What would you do with a mink coat?

{"text": "1: The question implies that cats somehow get inside or in the midst of places in which they normally have difficulty getting into.\n2: Let's consider each choice:\n4. A: dogs mouth: This isn't the case because a cat would not get into the mouth of another animal to access it.\n5. B: floor: This isn't right because a cat normally would not be able to get on the floor of their own volition unless a strong magnet were deployed to attract them, whereas when they destroy something they're not accessing the floor, they're simply destroying whatever they can.\n6. C: garage: This isn't an option because to reach a garage, cats would naturally use other methods such as climbing on a car or furniture items close enough to a garage door to gain access. \n7. D: trouble: This isn't applicable since the cats aren't getting in trouble.\n8. E: nature: This is an incorrect answer choice because cats are part of nature. \n9. Therefore, we can confidently arrive at the conclusion that the correct answer is B: floor. \nSo the final answer B: floor\n\nInput: What does a person put on when they want to go and get some fresh air? Choices: A: dress B: shoes C: a hat D: hair E: jewelry\nOutput: 1) The question asks us to identify the kind of item that people wear when they go and get fresh air.\n2. There are several options: A: dress \u2013 This isn't an applicable item because it's a garment made from fabric which is normally worn when you're at a ball or formal function, where the dress code dictates that you're required to wear something that's specifically of a dress nature, whereas no such dress code is generally mandated when going to get some fresh air.\n3. B: shoes: Here the question is talking about putting on something to cover your feet. A shoe would be an accurate match to this.\n4) C: a hat: This is not applicable because one would not usually put on a hat when going for a walk or hike in the fresh air.\n5) D: hair: Hair isn't something you'd generally see people putting on even if you were leaving the house to go for some fresh", "answer": "D: trouble"}

Also, if one did feel angry after doing housework, then they would have already been angry before doing the housework.\nB: boredom \u2013 We can eliminate options B and E from the question itself. To begin with, doing housework for several consecutive hours could potentially be an unpleasant and boring task. This leads us to option C.\nC: stress \u2013 Answers like A, B, and E could all be possible ways in which one might feel after doing housework. Option C, however, is only one of them.\nD: boredom \u2013 This option is definitely incorrect as boredom and anxiety are more emotions which could result from a tedious activity like housework but not the other way around.\nE: anxiety \u2013 This answer is already implied in the previous option, and therefore, it is not the correct answer.\n3. With the considerations so far, the correct answer is C. \n  So the final answer is C: stress", "answer": "C: stress"}

Watching soap operas \u2013 Soap operas are not associated to spirituality in any way therefore this is not the correct answer.\n    - D. Paying attention \u2013 Paying attention is a behavior which doesn\u2019t indicate a change in spiritual awareness of the change in life.\n    - E. Go into court \u2013 This option indicates the same as the option \u2018B\u2019 wherein you can go to court to hear a testimony of how spiritualty changes lives when you go to court that is irrelevant to the question.\n3.

Choices:  A) eating  B) cheering  C) shopping D) wearing leather  E) talking to your friend\nOutput: 1) The question refers to the action of leaving for the restaurant.\n2) Firstly, we consider the answers choices are not:\n    - Eating - as the question is asking about what is one not doing, it rules out eating as a possibility.\n    - Cheering - does not match with the context of restaurant.\n    - Shopping - could be interpreted as you are shopping for clothes to wear to the restaurant but again this is not the context of the restaurant.\n    - Wearing leather - this is not a valid action for a restaurant.\n    - Talking to your friend - as you are about to leave, you are certainly not doing it.\n    - So, one that fits the context is\n3) A: not wearing leather - this option fits the context as you are going to the restaurant, and thus do not wear leather.\nSo, the final answer is A) not wearing leather.\n\nInput:What are they doing if they are giving a presentation?

{"text": "1.) Answer choice A is incorrect because although the beach may be a place of relaxation, folding chairs aren't typically set up on the roof out of sight.\n2.) The garage wouldn't be a place to put a folding chair, since its ceiling is too high. The question is referring to the home itself, not the garage.\n3.) Folding chairs often rest in the closet or even on the bathroom floor. In fact, many people store a chair in front of the bathroom door in hopes of avoiding falls. Answer choice C is the correct answer\nSo the final answer 3.) The correct answer is c) closet\n\nInput: Can you go across a river?  Choices:  A) Yes B) No C) Not sure\nOutput: 1) Going across a river isn't necessarily impossible. Answer choice A is incorrect.\n2) You probably wouldn't go across the river by swimming since swimming across a river would be difficult and the goal of getting from one side to the other may be difficult. Going across the river by boat is the most logical answer, even though it doesn't mean you're using your boat, since a boat is a vehicle and not solely used for water transportation. Because of these reasons, answer choice B is incorrect. Answer choice C is correct. \nSo the final answer: The answer is C: Not sure.", "answer": "D: closet"}
{"text": "1) In order to identify the correct answer, we should consider the context from the other parts of the question. 2) The dog feels like it has all the space it could possibly want - therefore, the answer is something that is bigger than a small apartment but smaller than a big house. 3) It also can't be the dog park; the dog would not be inside any kind of park. 4) It wouldn't be the living room either because, in the context of the dog's situation, it doesn't have control over where it is, so it wouldn't be able to'move' outside of that room. 5) It is not a basket, even though this option doesn't directly contradict anything about the answer in the way that the above answers do. 6) Thus, the only answer that fits the bill of space that fits the description of being something the dog feels like it has a lot of (while staying strictly indoors) is the big house. \n7. This leaves us with the correct answer of the big house.\nSo the final alternative is the big house\n\nInput: A person who collects stamps has over one hundred postage stamps.

It doesn't follow that if you order sushi, France is where the person must be.\n3 C: fish market \u2013 This is the incorrect choice. The question seems to be about who or where Sam is instead of what Sam is doing \u2013 so something like ordering sushi isn't the full story.\n4 D: atlantic \u2013 This is a good choice, but when you look at the question again, it states the question in the context of Paris and a sushi restaurant there. The Atlantic is on the other side of the world and is therefore, not relevant here.\n5 E: cuba \u2013 This isn't correct because there aren't any sushi restaurants in Cuba.

Genre refers to the type of movie that this is. The title is what tells the audience what the name of the movie is.\n2 Movie: B: plot. This is also a name of the movie, not the genre of the movie. Genres and plot titles are two different things as genres is what type or type the movie is about. A plot title is about who did it or what was the solution of the plot.\n3 Movie: C: mystery. This also is the title of the mystery movie, not the genre. Genre is a bit more difficult to determine due to the fact the movie is called mystery, but it is a bit more vague on genres and this one is very specific.\n4 Movie: D: plot. Again, this is about whether or not he will have a plot in a movie or not", "answer": "B: france"}

Given that the question is talking about the person committing perjury, it's irrelevant to their possible outcomes. \n- B: arrest \u2013 This option can be the result of people committing perjury. It doesn't seem to be related to what a person is likely to experience if they commit perjury. \n- C: embarrassment \u2013 Embarrassment is a result of people feeling shame and having it publicized. But since the question is asking about someone committing perjury and not their peers reacting to that, and since perjury can be done anonymously online, it's not relevant to their experience. \n- D: go to jails \u2013 This is a reasonable outcome, but the other options don't preclude it. Jail is mentioned simply because it is an outcome, but if committing perjury doesn't lead to this, it doesn't make it unlikely.\n- E: tension \u2013 Tension is a result of one's perception of another, and therefore, is a result of someone's perjury resulting in it but not their actual experience of committing it. \n4.

This is also the exact feeling that the question is referring to.\n- B: get better at flying - This choice isn't applicable for an overly-nervous person.

However, being nervous about flying for a specific reason, like taking an international flight, for example, would be perfectly acceptable.\n- D: panic - Panicking is a perfectly normal emotional reaction when you're afraid of something. So if you're nervous about flying, then panicking is just an exaggerated version of what you already feel.\n- E: fly less often - Just flying less often might be an effective way to not fly in a specific situation like a short domestic trip, but it would only worsen your fear of flying in general.

{"text": "1) We first start by clarifying the context of the question.

{"text": "1.\" When people discover something new while talking to friends, why are they probably going to continue talking?\"\nThis question is about identifying the reason that people are more likely to keep talking to their friends after discovering something new rather than concluding the discussion. \n2. Each answer is based on what is typically thought to be true. However, this isn't always the correct answer to a question like this.\n  - A: Agreement - We believe that people continue their conversation because they have arrived at an agreement on the subject they have been discussing previously, and are talking now about something else that is also a topic of conversation between them - eg: a shared interest or some such. However, this is not always the case, and this is typically the choice that is made from context clues (this is called an \"easily identifiable\" answer - the \"obvious\" answer, if you will). \n  - B: To fill their time - This seems like an accurate answer because time was the focus earlier on, but we are trying to consider whether people keep talking to fill their time, which is also not a viable answer to this question. We could also rule this choice out by thinking about it a bit more - the people in question (if we presume this question to be about actual people) were speaking in order to talk to each other and get to know each other, so why continue to talk when all that's been gained is knowing more about the same subject.\n     - This is where \"filler words\" (think about it) like \"uhm\" or \"ah\" become a possibility as well and are actually the most accurate answer, if there isn't any obvious answer, which is also the most often misleading answer when there is one. \n     - One could argue that we're not sure if they're likely to continue speaking, but we don't know if that's the question exactly; let's not get overly picky. \n  - C: Discomfort - Considering the other choices above, this one is also not at all likely to be the answer. If they were uncomfortable when they started talking, it stands to reason that they would likely just end the conversation, which they did not do.\n  - D: Misunderstanding - Similarly, if they were misunderstanding their friend for how the conversation was progressing, it's unlikely", "answer": "E: learning about"}
{"text": "1) The question is about Janet recognizing something about herself that indicates her impending death.\n2) Each option is considered:\n    - A, sleeping longer, doesn't account for whether she knows the cause, which it specifically asks for in this question.\n    - B, getting cold, doesn't account to her having awareness that she's dying either.\n    - C, death and decay, doesn't account at all for whether she understands a cause, so it's not correct.\n    - D, change of color doesn't necessarily account for how she recognizes she's dying because she could feel herself changing colors and still not be aware (or not care) that she was dying, so this isn't correct either.\n3) E, stop breathing is the correct option here because of it's relation to the other options. She could stop breathing and not know she was dying at first (if she's unconscious, or for a very short period of time). It is a sign indicating whether she'll be dying soon, and therefore is correct.\nSo the final decision is stop breathing\n\nInput: What occurs when the sun doesn't shine on the Earth?

{"text": "1,The question is asking for the adjective that describes glass that hasn't been strengthened to be extra strong\n2. First, we can eliminate some wrong answers. For example, the word \"regular\" simply means something that is regular or normal, and as such it can't be used to describe an adjective in this context.  Another wrong answer is \"fragile\" since it's a synonym of \"weak\", and can't be used in this context to describe extra strength.  Another wrong answer can be \"forceless\" since \"forceless\" and \"weak\" are synonyms. \n3. Finally, the phrase \"extra strong\" suggests that the glass is strong by default, but \"extra\" suggests the glass has been made stronger.

The roadside stand is asking about things to sell.\n    - C: Supermarket. Because supermarkets are a place to buy items. It does not ask for the place to put it.\n    - D: State park. Not correct because the question gives you clues like \"no grass where I can get it to sell at the roadside\". You may not find \"no grass\" in state parks.\n    - E. Garden. Because \"at a roadside stand\" does not match the place asked for: \"a roadside stand would sell things, but it does not match the meaning of 'a garden that has no grass' asked for.\n3. So \"at a roadside sell\" means \"at a place with grass\". We should look for what that is.\n4. B is the answer.\nSo the final Answer is B.

Given that it's stating that it's a unique ability to do this, we can remove it from the possibility list.\n2) The question here is clearly telling us to answer which ability we could only have if we are a person. It is impossible for a chair or a plant to do these choices. Therefore our correct choices are A) to cross the street.\n3) Given our choices are narrowed down to A), it just leaves us to choose between C) and E).\n4) If we think about \"personality traits\" that would separate you from another person, chances are that you aren't actually the same person. For that reason, even though we could choose choice C, \"speak Chinese\", I would argue that it's a no-brainer that your other option, choice E: \"further education\", is definitely a trait that would stand out for anyone since it's possible to have different people having the same abilities and personalities, but I bet you're the only one in town to have a PhD. \n5) Therefore, the answer is E.\nSo the final answers is E.

The rich person's house may not have a squash court, or there might not be room for two people to use it. Plus if his friend was at the rich person's house or squash court, they would not have been waiting for their friend to arrive. \n4. So this leaves us with choice C. fitness center. Since his friend was waiting at the fitness center, there's a good possibility that both he and his friend would expect they were going to be headed to the fitness center to play squash. However, if his friend thought the fitness center was the other end of the \"public\" what, this could make them late.\n5. The most important factor is that the friend's perception caused him to worry.

Choices :  A: luck B: perseverance C: inspiration D: confidence E: talent\nOutput: 1:\nThe question is asking how one could obtain the necessary abilities to finish something with excellence.\n2: Let\u2019s now examine the answer choices:\n    - A-B: The question refers to a \u201cperson\u201d, who could refer to a child or an adult. In the context of this, if a person is unable to finish their essay with excellence, it could suggest that they have had lack of perseverance or luck to pursue their tasks. It is important to think of the context of the question, and therefore, neither of these are the correct answer. \n    C-D-E: Inspiration is a motivational tool, and to achieve excellence, it could mean that one would have achieved greatness from it. As a result it is clear, that one needs Inspiration, and thus, it could be \u201cthe\u201d required skill to be able to acquire all of the other skills to be able to finish a task with excellence. There is one difference between these choices: Confidence doesn\u2019t say how one could \u201cget\u201d the confidence to complete it with excellence. Inspiration states the motivation for a task and its accomplishment.\n3: Thus, the correct answer is E: inspiration. \nInput: When a baby arrives, a first choice for the baby's name would be which of the following?

Instead, the child put each tire on the car one at a time, so this is not the correct answer.\n    - **A pile** \u2013 This answer is referencing the boy collecting a bunch of tires (a pile) to change the tires of his car, and it's referring to their tire size or tire brand. Therefore, this answer is not applicable to this specific question.\n    - **Piece** \u2013 The boy was working with different sized tires when he worked on his car, so these cannot be the correct answer.\n  - **A pair** \u2013 This was not what the boy was trying to do when he", "answer": "C: smooth skin"}

Choices: 1: A: school 2: B: workplace 3: C: museum 4: D: office 5: E: school cafeteria 6: F: university building 7: G: parking lot 8:H: library 9: I: living room\nOutput: 12. The question asks: 'Where could you read a BOOK?', not a book on 'how to read better'.\n\n1. The'school' in this question probably refers to the classroom. However, a book read there might be shared by others or too big to read comfortably in the cramped and crowded space.\n2. The 'workplace': here, this is probably a reference to office break room or a lounge/sitting area.\n3. The'museum': you might be able to read a long in the museum, but only by visiting and spending money on tickets. This also gives a better chance to look at some exhibits and learn about the culture displayed.\n4. The 'office': you may read in the break room, but the office is still busy and noisy, even with a door shut.\n5. The'school cafeteria': this doesn't make sense, as you might be able to sit there in between meals, but you can't read a book while people are eating.\n6. The 'university building': it still might be loud, but you can probably sit under the trees in the courtyard to read.\n7. The 'parking lot'. It's free and you're not likely to be disturbed. \n8. The 'library': people there read to learn, not for enjoyment.\n9. The 'living room': most people don't get on it these hours. Even if they do, it's a cramped place.\n\nSo", "answer": "A: shelf"}
{"text": "1: When a canned good is being stored in a kitchen, the shelf it is being stored on is located either in a cabinet or pantry. \n2. Pantry would not be the answer since it would not be a'small' door. This further is eliminated as an option. Next, looking at the wording, a kitchen door would be a 'large' door, not a'small' door, so it is also ineligible.\n3. This leaves us with the following two: the cabinet and the cupboard.\n4. The cupboard would be the more likely option since it is much more likely for canned goods to be placed in a cupboard or pantry as opposed to a cabinet. \n5. As the final and correct outcome, the cupboard would be the correct answer.\nSo the final and correct answer is C: cupboard\n\nInput: What did the scientist discover about the earthquake?

Choices: 1. A: blue \n2. B: red \n3. C: yellow\n4. D: green\n5. E: white\nOutput: The answer would be B: red, since cucumber sandwich consists of cucumber and butter and spreads and it is impossible for these ingredients to produce blue in the color. We conclude that blue must have been inserted in the answer because no cucumber sandwich includes blue as its color.\nSo the correct answer would be, B: red.\n\nInput:What is the best way that the cash will make its way into the bank?

However, this is not the context of the question.\n    - 'C: branch out' \u2013 In no way would a company branch out during bankruptcy; it's during bankruptcy that companies are liquidated or shut down.\n    - 'B: own resources' \u2013 As mentioned above, the company resources are liquidated, and there would be no point to branch out or commit a crime when you are going bankrupt.\n2. Let us now go on to choose the options remaining:\n    - 'D: commit a crime'. This choice is not correct because the term 'commit crime' usually refers to deliberate actions taken by a person or the intentional commission of a crime. A company cannot intentionally commit a crime. They can, however, commit a crime as an unintentional side effect of their actions.\n    - 'E: game over': This is also not the answer to the question, as the game would not finish yet, since they are not bankrupt as of yet.\n3.

However sticking to fingers would not be of aid to the customer who is trying to buy honey.\n4- Option C: Honey is produced within a beehive.

The phrase in between the brackets is very likely there for stylistic purposes: We need an indefinite pronoun (something like an 'it') to refer to whatever the person is receiving/doing. If we could just say \"The person does poorly and...\", then the word \"makes\" in choice A would refer to the poor job and not the person itself.\n3. Looking at each of the answer choices:\n   - A: misfortune \u2013 This is not the wording used to state that a person will receive such a thing, so option A is unacceptable.\n   - B: fearful \u2013 This is not actually what would happen. A bad result might cause the person to be anxious about making future mistakes, but that's not the phrase used in the question. The correct answer is therefore, D: make mistakes.\n   - C: criticism \u2013 This is indeed what they could receive.\n   - D: make mistakes \u2013 A poor job could cause them to receive criticism.

When the selection of shoes is limited to a few options, you'd have to spend more time walking around the mall, and have to walk to get to the store.

Sinkholes are natural phenomena that form when the bedrock that makes up the surface of the earth erodes away. As that material erodes, it can form caverns below the surface of the Earth's crust. \nIf this material gets sufficiently large and the walls of the cave collapse, it can result in a sinkhole.

In fact, you really can't find a bookstore in a city phone book unless maybe it contains information about bookstores. \n\n    \u2013 \u2013 E: Magazines \u2013 This is a perfect answer because many bookstores also carry magazines on topics like travel, food, and entertainment, among many others.\n\n    - A: Town \u2013 This is the correct answer because towns have many bookstores that you could visit to explore your options and locate a good book.

The meaning with respect to lab terms when someone calls something \"contaminated\", it means it has been polluted, adulterated, or spoiled. It can no longer be said to be pure. \n4. An example of contamination would be if a lab assistant was instructed to measure out two parts of an impure (contaminated) chemical and one part of a pure chemical and they added one part more of the contaminated chemical \n5. \"Contaminated\" is indeed being applied incorrectly in this example. But as the other four answer choices don't use the phrase \"contaminated\" specifically, we can't use these to confirm whether the choice we are examining is correct or not.\n6. We can also narrow it down by noting that 'applied' can certainly be defined as the act of applying something. So we can eliminate choices B and C.

Considering Answer choices C, D, and E: **C. City.** This is not the correct answer as cities typically consist of multiple neighborhoods within the same area which contain yards of varying sizes. **D. Property.** This is not applicable because a property's yard size is typically determined by what the homeowner wants. If they want an abundant yard space, then they will indeed create it. Additionally, not all properties include gardens and yards at all, which would make this answer choice incorrect.  **E. Subdivision.** This answer is not necessarily incorrect. Subdivisions are technically defined as a section within a larger body of land, which is still able to be tiny.

For the correct options we don't need to consider the exact definition of 'program'.

We can safely eliminate any options that clearly do not contain this kind of information.\n3. Answer choices C and D don't fit for us because they refer to other types of information and are not associated with a theater show or similar event. 'Opera' does not describe a show that is broadcasted on television or the radio. \n4. We can eliminate A and E because the theater, concert, or other shows aren't necessarily associated with a paper program, although they are the kinds of events where such documents are created. \n5. This leaves us with answers B and C. Answer B refers to the 'computer', specifically the computer screen, where one might find a program that details all the required aspects of a theater show, just like it would in a paper program.\n6. Answer C refers more broadly to an 'opera' or a piece of music, as in a 'concert' instead of a'show'. There's nothing in the question, however, that requires us to be more specific than a theater event. \n7.

{"text": "1: The question is asking what the occasion would be called if they were celebrating it.2. Let's look at each answer choice:\n\nA: drinking \u2013 This can't be the correct answer because the question specifically asked what the occasion was called if it were being celebrated. It specifically does not ask about what the partygoers were doing during the celebration. \n\nB: intimacy \u2013 This cannot be the answer either, the question asked for the celebration itself and it does not mention anything about the partygoers.\n\nC: dancing \u2013 This also cannot be the answer as it doesn't mean celebration at all, and it wouldn't make sense to call an intimate celebration dancing.\n\nD: happiness \u2013 This option cannot be the answer as the question isn't asking about what the individual or their party would be called. \n\nE: enjoying \u2013 This is also not a valid answer because it doesn't say anything about what the celebration would be called.

And we know the reason they are not lined is because they are moving.\n2: \"Around and away from the chalks\" is the same thing as being \"around and away from the classroom\". The reason teachers or supervisors might make students stand in line is to ensure their attention and so the answer options will be the same, i.e. if they aren't lined up in hallway they must not be in the classroom.\n3: This cannot be the correct answer because if they aren't in line, that means they do not occupy the place where they are standing, which in this case is by the door, so they cannot be standing by the door. So this option cannot be the right one.\n4: The answer choice is either by the door or in the back\n5:", "answer": "D: happiness"}

With each answer, ask yourself (1) if the item could have large pieces of paper, and (2) if the people selling such items could be selling the large pieces of paper.\n    - A: cabinet \u2013 Some cabinets do store large pieces of paper. If we're referring to an office or storage cabinet, then definitely these could carry paper. Though, not for sale, i.e. they're not for sale, means one isn't buying them. So this cannot be the correct answer.\n    - B : computer printer - Incorrect because computer printers print, not store pieces of paper.\n        - This doesn't even answer the question, because if you had a computer printer it could very well have pieces of paper in it.\n    - C: suitcase \u2013 Maybe? However, suitcases can hold only so much paper. Not to mention, it's unusual for large pieces of paper to fit in a suitcase. It may be true for this case if the suitcase was specifically manufactured to carry large pieces of paper, but this isn't the context of the question.\n    - D: office supply store - Incorrect because this isn't the case, as office supply stores don't sell large pieces of paper (though, maybe they do have some in stock?).\n    - E: artist's room \u2013 Incorrect because artists don't usually buy large pieces of paper, though they do work on them.

We can eliminate some options right at the start:\n    - A is not possible because the balls were already at rest on the morning. Therefore, this answer cannot be the correct choice\n    - B can also be ruled out as the balls couldn't be in motion during rest\n3. Considering option C, active. If there are no distractions on either James or anyone/thing around him, then he would be free to perform some task, such as moving the rubber balls around in his home.

{"text": "1. The question starts by explicitly stating that the person was comfortable at home, meaning that they were not uncomfortable while home.\n2. So if this was the case, the fear of going, must have been due to something they did or experienced at home.\n3.

Choice B: vacation \u2013 One could feel comfortable while on vacation, and this could have been the case for the person. They're likely just afraid of going home and back to their 'problems' that they've been experiencing.\n5. Choice C: idle \u2013 'Idle' refers to a state of inactivity, or not being busy.

Choices:  a: 5 b: 6 c: 7 d: 7+1 e: 5+1\nOutput: 1) If you're referring to this game as a \"game\" during the day, it would be referred to as a \"game\" not \"games\", which is why the question is asking the cardinal (1st) number in its description.\n2) We can rule out choice A. The maximum number of people that can play the game is 6, so by adding additional people to play the game, it'll go above 6. When the card is dealt out between players, each player will receive a hand of 3 playing cards, so the maximum number of cards you could have would be 18.\n3) Given that we have 7 individuals (player A \u2013 player F), and each one of them has 3 playing cards, we don't have enough cards to get more than 6 additional players.\n4) Therefore, we can rule out choices D and E, as they both do not provide the correct answers.\n5) Given that we have a total of 39 cards (18 cards per player X 7 players = 126 cards, and we'll add an additional 6 players to complete a game, so we'll need one more), the maximum", "answer": "D: rest area"}

{"text": "1) When the question says the saucepan was used for marinara, it means it's used exclusively for that purpose. We can therefore eliminate 'Boil eggs' because the sauce pan mentioned in the question does not boil eggs.\n2) 'Georgia' is not the right answer because it doesn't refer to any particular state within the US. By this reasoning, 'The South pole' is also eliminated. \n3) If we say that the kitchen cupboard could have been used for sauce pans, then that would mean its interior was not the exclusive domain for a saucepan that was used for marinera. This means that 'Italian restaurant' is also an incorrect answer, since the restaurant can't have any sauce pans in their kitchen cabinet. \n4) This leaves us with either 'Boil eggs' or 'Kitchen Cupboard'. If you try to substitute another food product, such as a tomato ketchup, for the marinara sauce in the question, then you can see no other food product could be substituted for the marinara in the saucepan. In other words, the sauce pan was exclusively used for marinara. This means 'Kitchen Cupboard' is not correct either, as there might still be room for another food product like ketchup even if the spice rack was in the cupboard. This leaves us with a conclusion that 'Boil eggs' is the correct answer, as we have already identified a food product different to marinara sauce which is still a viable food product that can replace the sauce pan for boiling eggs when the sauce pan is kept in the kitchen cupboard. Hence, the final answer is 'Boil Eggs'.\nSo the final answer to 1/2 is Boil Eggs\n\nInput: Which of the following is not a thing to do on a plane? Choices: 1.

With these considerations, we can narrow it down to being a system of electronic devices possibly 'inside' the human body.\nWe can then move on to the final answer by determining whether it correctly describes where a system of electronic devices may be used in school.\n5.) The correct answer is E: Human Body \u2013 Electronic devices such as pacemakers and artificial hearing aids are designed to be used inside our bodies, and because the question wording doesn\u2019t specify that the devices are outside of the human body, that leaves us with E: Human Body as the only correct answer option.\n\nSo the final answer to the question is E: Human Body.

If we assume that'stop' here means 'to rest', then the answer could be (A), the driver of the caravan stops to rest.\nOr, it could refer to their truck stopping for gas. We are then looking for option (B) 'the driver of the caravan pumps gas. \nThis answer is a bit less likely to be correct because that isn't typically what a 'caravan' would be doing, but it's a possibility.\n\n\nThere is also another option: The caravan could be referring  to a group of people and vehicles travelling together and it also stops to take a break. If this were this the context of'stop', then the answer could (C) - the people stop to rest.\nOne more option that is less likely is: a caravan is a group of people who are travelling together, and these people stop to take a break.

{"text": "1) Let's eliminate the incorrect choices:\n\n    - A: unfeeling is not the answer, since it essentially means lacking in affection or concern for someone, so it wouldn't be a good descriptor of someone who wishes someone else ill.\n    - B, C, D, and E: These don't fit the context of the problem, so we can immediately remove. \n2) We'll take a closer look at the remaining responses:\n\n    - B: negligence \u2013 This sounds somewhat similar to unfeeling, which we've already eliminated. However, a good descriptor of negligence is willful ignorance or carelessness. So, we don't believe it's accurate that the wish was made as the result of negligence.\n\n    - We can next go over:\n\n    - C: antipathies are negative or hostile feelings, particularly feelings of aversion. So, someone who doesn't care at all about someone else likely doesn't feel hostility toward this person either.

{"text": "1) Let's look at the options the question has given us.\n    - A: grill \u2013 Since the question says 'one way to relieve your hanger if you live near [the] coast', this would be an inappropriate food to consider. \n    - B: go to market \u2013 Again, this would be an inaccurate answer option as it's not appropriate to say 'go to market' if you don't live near the coast.\n    - C: bring home fish \u2013 One cannot bring home a fish from the coast if they do not live near the coast. \n    -D: eat hamburger \u2013 If you live near the coast, there would be no need to eat a hamburger as they could easily get fresh fish which would be healthier.\n    -E: make bread \u2013 Making bread is unrelated to the coast, and this option wouldn't be appropriate. \n2) We can then eliminate the options that don't match the question.\n    - Options A, B, and E cannot be correct because they describe foods that would not aid in relieving hunger.\n    - Option C can't be correct as well because bringing home fish from anywhere else would not be an option if you don't have access to it from the coast.\n    There are only two options left: D and E.\n3) Considering D, we can see that 'eat hamburger' doesn't directly relate to relieving hunger. You can see that the answer would be more 'bring a hamburger from the shore' (if you needed one).\nIf you want to eat it and you don't have a hamburger to begin with, then you would need to bring one from shore \u2013 not necessarily from the coast. \nTherefore, we can conclude that option D is the incorrect option so the answer is option E.\nSo the final correct answer is: option E: Make bread", "answer": "C: bring home fish"}

{"text": "1st Answer: The question is asking us to determine what was impeding the crab. We already know that the crab was \"scuttling but strained,\" meaning he was moving along at a slower pace than normal.\n2. Consider each response choice in more detail:\n    - A. Tide pool. Since there is no mention of the tide pool, it is clear that the crab cannot swim through or move it at all.\n    - B. Beach sand. The crab could very well move in some sand. But since it wasn't moving normally, there must be some impeding object(s) that were keeping the crab from traveling in the normal fashion.\n    - C. Tidepools. Just as in the case of a tide pool, this impeding object is preventing the crab from moving normally.\n    - D. Current. The impeding object is the same as in the previous cases (it's what's keeping the crab from moving in the normal way), and it's obviously not a current.\n    - E. Cooking pot. The crab could be moving around within this object, but again, since he is moving less than normal, it is reasonable to assume the crab is in some way blocked from moving forward.\n3. There is only one response to the original question: beach sand. This is the one response that does not allow the crab a normal movement. A \"normal\" movement for a crab is moving by itself in the ocean. He could very well be scuttling and straining while moving through tidepools or tide pools. He could do this in a current, but he still couldn't do it as he normally would. However, since we know that the crab cannot move through the beach sand because he can only move through the waves that are pushing him, the object must be something on the beach rather than something in the ocean.\n\n\nInput: An employee would feel that they belong at work when Choices:  A. they've gained an important accomplishment B. they have a high energy C. they've achieved greatness D. they feel appreciated E. they have obtained an identity\nOutput: 1: What is the most fitting answer for \"an employee\" is \"a high energy\" 2: \"When does an employee feel that they belong at their job?\" The answer is", "answer": "B: beach sand"}

Food \u2013 this is clearly something that could go in a container, just like any other food item would.\n5. Port \u2013 this answer is a bit of an overreach \u2013 it's a bit like asking how many bicycles go into a port.

One is allowed to count cards in the casino, but there are strict limits. In general, people aren't usually required to count cards. \n    - E = 'Dealing' \u2013 'Dealing' can be the correct answer, because there may be times, in certain casinos, when you can be required to deal. This choice is also an action that doesn't happen that often in casinos.\n           - 'Winning' is an action that is prohibited in most casinos, although there could be exceptions.

The actual answer is still B. The lady doesn't \"persuade\" (as in, change minds) at the beginning of the show, and neither does she sleep nor take center stage for that matter. \nFurthermore, you could argue that \"speaking clearly\" is also not the correct action. \nFor example, she's a teller (who tells a tale), which means that speaking incoherently or with a bad/weak voice would not necessarily be a deal breaker for a good teller.\n\nInput:Which element is heaviest in the air?

The first option \u2013 \u201cWhen someone gives me a helping Hand, I should return that Same Treatment\u201d \u2013 is technically an exception to the Golden rule according to the context that\u2019s being given, because in the context, they\u2019re referring to \u201cHelping someone out\u201d and the first statement here seems to be saying \u201cWhen you Helping someone you should in turn return that same help\u201d but the Golden rule does not talk about helping and the way it\u2019s framed, the golden rule says that \u201cDo unto others as you would treat YOURSELF\u201d (in the context of the Question I gave which is a personal relationship)\nSo this would technically be an exception because this person\u2019s golden rule would want them to treat another person the same way as THEY WOULD WANT TO BE TREATED which is not what the golden rule says.\n2.

She knows precisely where he can find some. So this is definitely not the answer choice.\n\nB: nightstand \u2013 The nightstand is also not the correct answer as this location was already checked and it was not at the nightstand where he was told to look. \n\nC: armpits \u2013 The armpits were checked, too, so this is not the answer.\n\nD: own bathroom \u2013 This is not where she told him to look as well since it would indicate that she doesn't know his own deodorant habits. This would be a ridiculous thing to say because surely, a spouse knows where someone stores their own deodorant.\n\nE: medicine chest \u2013 This is not an accurate answer because his wife specifically told him to check 'the other cabinet' because it's been reported as being missing for other reasons.\n\n3) So, his wife correctly told him to check the 'other cabinet' and that's the correct answer.

It is therefore not the correct answer.\n3) This means either choice B or choice D is the answer.\n4) Looking at the words used in the question, we see they refer to'southern institutions' where slaves do the labor. What kind of work would slaves do in a plantation? Typically, they would be farmers. However, they weren't farmers in an ancient roman empire and neither were they in history books. Therefore, this means that there is no ancient romans empire as a whole that has the same features as a plantation.\n5) This leaves us with choice B, which refers to ancient rome. \n6) Ancient rome did have slave owners and slave workers and they therefore fit the definition of a plantation.

If a parent is happy, it may not be the case they are happy all the time. Moreover, there is no control in simply being happy or sad. Happiness or sadness is a feeling, whereas control (and its opposite, a lack of control) deals with an action that a parent is or isn't doing. \n4. Therefore, we are left with answer choices \"C\" and \"D\". \n5. \"C\" seems more accurate \u2013 we typically consider taking care of children as an adult duty, as it generally falls within the context of a parent's parental role, which is typically something we assume adults primarily do with regularity. \n6. If someone isn't a parent - for example, just a child themself - then they would have no duty as a parent to control themselves, take care of themselves, or attend school. We can cross out \"D\" and just focus on \"C\". \n7.

The answer involves the kids being tired after a day of playing. There is no wild ride in the question. \n3.B: need for rest- This isn't the right answer because when the story is describing the kids as having had fun all day and being tired, it doesn't involve a need for rest any longer, but to recuperate. \n4.C: massive bear \u2013 This doesn't fit. The question isn't about massive bears, it's about the kids. The answer is E, it was constructing.\n5.D: playing marbles \u2013 This doesn't apply. In the question it doesn't involve an explanation of why the day was one of fun in the form of playing marbles, so this isn't the right description for the kids either.\n6.E: constructing \u2013 This is the best answer for the question.

However, this cannot be considered as the destination of simply carrying the pen throughout the day.\n    C: friend's House - If a friend's house is chosen as a destination, this can definitely be considered a place of some significance, and could be a reasonably accurate answer choice. However, as mentioned for Answer B, this wouldn't simply refer to carrying the pen to a friend's house to acquire a new pen, but only choosing such a destination to simply carry it.\n    D: desk draker - this destination wouldn't be considered too significant either, and, like with the other answer choices, would likely just be considered a destination to acquire a new writing tool.\n    E: city hall - if city hall is chosen as a destination for carrying a pen, this would be considered a place of significant value.\n  3.)

{"text": "Let's start by ruling out the answers that obviously don't make sense:\n    - The question makes it clear that people chat with friends in class, not communicate in an important meeting or write to family.\n    - The choice that refers to class itself is therefore not applicable as well ('B').\n    - Choice 'E' also has no relevance to the question and therefore is ruled out.\n4. We can then eliminate 'C': inspiration. This answer choice indicates that a student might be inspired to chat by something they learn or discover - whereas the question is referring to chatting with friends for no particular reason.\n5. We're left with two remaining answers. Out of these, either 'A' or 'D' could be correct. 'D', which indicates a desire to discuss love and romance, wouldn't necessarily be a good answer in this particular scenario - but it's still a possibility that will be considered. \n6. 'A': necessity, then, is an option worth considering. This is relevant because all students need to use their class-time to progress through the curriculum, which is what chatting with friends can disrupt and thereby be seen as a 'necessity'.\n7. Looking back at the original question, we can determine that chatting with friends is not seen as a 'necessary' activity - nor is it something we would consider to be inspired by new information, or even something that necessarily leads us to love.\n8. 'A' therefore is the only logical answer.\nSo the final question is: Why do people engage in class chatting? and the answer is: A: necessity\n\nInput: Which fruit do both people and animals dislike? Choices:  B: mangoes C: apples D: both fruits E: none\nOutput: We will first throw out fruits other than apples and mangoes ('B') because we know that neither of them are the right answer.\n5. 'E', the choice 'both people and animals dislike', is not a correct answer either. This means that there must be something that both people and animals disllike. But in this case, it isn't fruit.\n6. If we look at choice 'A', 'Both people and animals dislike apples', we can determine that the answer is correct because people and animals are very likely to dislike apples.", "answer": "B: answers"}

Using the phrase 'card shark' in the question might be indicating that these card players were all experienced enough that they were simply playing the game how they wanted to.\n5.

By stating that the heifer resided on his cattle ranch, it's implying that this was only where she lived in her final days.\n    - B) Countryside \u2013 Similarly, the countryside was not the only place where the cow resided. The farmer also had a dairy farm and a grocery store.\n    - C) Grocery store \u2013 While the farmer had a dairy farm, slaughterhouse, cattle ranch, and countryside, the question doesn't indicate that he only lived on his property after retiring. This means answering the question with grocery store would be inaccurate.\n    - D) Slaughterhouse \u2013 This is also a false answer choice because according to the other choices on the list, the cow resided on a dairy farm, the countrysides, and a grocery story.

The first step is to eliminate the answer choices that are obviously incorrect because there is already a theater mentioned in the question:\n    - Choice B: populated area \u2013 This doesn't make sense because a 'populated area' is, by definition, full of people. However, there is already one theater mentioned so there is no reason to add any more.\n    - Choice E: church \u2013 The question states that you are \"looking for many theaters,\" so this particular theater clearly isn't what you're looking for.\n    - Choices C and D:'military base' and opera are both too specific. The idea here clearly isn't to find just one theater - it's to find \"many theaters.\"\n2. Looking at answer choice A: school. It may seem intuitive that there may be many theaters in such a location, but this is contradicted by the exact words of the question, which state that you are \"looking...\" for \"many theaters.\" It doesn't say in what place you'll find the theaters. So let's rule it out.\n3. This leaves us with two possibilities: answers A and B. One place with many theaters is undoubtedly a populated area. So, if you're looking for many theaters, it would seem clear that the populated area is the place where one would find many theaters.

Answer choices B and C are clear incorrect answers because there would almost certainly be a significant number of people wearing makeup at a museum and a military base. Likewise, a church, and an opera house would only have a handful of attendees, and so you would never be able to find \"a large number of people.\" This eliminates both B and C.\n2.

Options A and B give you the choice of using 1 or 2 ingredients to prepare the food while D, E, and F give you the option of using only 1 ingredient.\n4. Based on this observation, the answer has to be one of D, E, and/or F because options A and B would require either 2 ingredients or none at all.

To keep together the pages of a document D\nNote: 2. to provide physical support only helps secure documents when applied to the page itself. 4. to help secure a document to the scanner is another way of saying 4. to secure a document to the paper, which is the goal of an adhesive.\nOutput: 1) 2: 5. It is definitely not the purpose of an adhecive to be sticky, as the use of adhesives relies on their non-stick-ness.\n2) It is impossible to say definitively that an adhesive's purpose is to provide physical support, only because we cannot rule out scenarios in which it may have a slightly different purpose and still be considered an adhesive. \n3) It is also undetermined whether a paper document could require physical support as well as having an adhesive. It simply cannot be said that adhesives only help secure documents when applied to their pages/covers. All it's doing is attaching them.\n4) 4):  Secure a document to the scannner refers to a slightly different action from what we know to be'securing a document'. Securing a document means securing it to the material on which it's written, i.e. the paper. To secure a document to the document itself is not only redundant, but also indicates that what one intends to secure is already secured. So to simply 'help' in the action of securing a document to the material on which its written, i.e to the paper, cannot be considered to be the purpose of adhesive.\n5) 5): The purpose of an adhesives cannot simply be to keep together the pages of documents, because this could simply be achieved with a few elastic cords, instead of an adhesive, which are used for", "answer": "D: acute angled"}

What shouldn\u2019t you do? Choices: 1. Forget the ice cream 2. Eat it 3. Be in a rush 4. Drive away without ice cream 5. Give it to someone else\nOutput: \n1. The question is what you shouldn\u2019t do at the end.\n2. The gas station is a common area for getting gas, so you are not supposed to leave without doing that. Therefore, you shouldn\u2019t just drive away without ice cream.\n3. You are also not supposed to leave a gas station in a rush. If you aren\u2019t a resident of the area, you should plan on how much time the task will take you. If you leave the location in a rush, it might make it more difficult for you to plan the route home. \n4. You can\u2019t be in a rush because you have to buy gasoline, pay for the ice cream, and wait in the line at the cash register to pay for the gas. \n5.

A city can thus be excavated to accommodate a larger population.\n\n7: Option D \u2013 cemetary \u2013 is ruled out as well because the question didn't specify if it's an archeological site or if that's the site itself.

This means that they may have cheated or been in love with other man's wife, but the focus must be on their actions as a homewreaker, which is what they identify with, what they are known as in the community, and what they wish to be identified as.\n2. The first thing we do is eliminate choices like lesbian or cheater because they don't describe a women who is a homewrecker and are more general statements that might apply to anyone who has", "answer": "B: cemetary"}
{"text": "1: The question requires a location that could contain thousands of statues.\n2: The statue within the water fountain is usually a small, easily movable figurine with no weight or substance that will make thousands of them an impossibility. \n3: The theatre is an option, but if all of its shows were replaced by thousands of statues in lieu of props and scenery, they may not all fit within the theatre.\n4: The large city also isn't an option because the space isn't even for the large amount of statues required. If the statues of the central park are taken into account, then the question is just about whether there could be thousands of statues overall, which may or may not include a water fountain.\n5: The only option that can contain thousands of statues is a church, which holds multiple statues for worshippers to look upon while praying.\n6: Therefore, church is the correct answer.\nSo the final answers is B: church\n\nInput:Where should you go to look for a particular movie if you haven't seen it before?

The question is asking where to go to find a movie that you have not seen before. \n \n3. a) television seems like the best place to view a movie that you have previously been unable to see as many movies were once produced for T.V. However, this answer is inaccurate because there are entire channels dedicated to reruns of movies that you would be able to watch. \n\n1. b) Netflix seems to be the most reasonable place to go if you want to see a movie you hadn't seen before since it is notoriously known for being a site where thousands of old movies are accessible, even if you have to go through a lot of search terms to find the correct movie you're looking for. \n\n5. D) Youtube is an option because many movies released through big streaming sites like Netflix often have an additional Youtube channel that shows the entire movie.

Considering each answer choice individually:\n    - A) The answer does not mention any words to indicate relaxation, which is one of the options. So this is not the answer. \n\n3.)  B) The second answer mentions \"Good things in life\" which, in this context, are likely things like vacations and other aspects of the good life. So while this is a good explanation, it's incomplete and does not fully answer the question, making it the incorrect answer.\n\n4.) Let's consider the next option, C.) The answer says that vacations may be taken in order to \"show off\" or to be \"admired.\" These things seem to indicate that people may choose to go on vacations in order to have their own houses admired by others. This explanation, while not incorrect, is insufficient to completely answer the question, as it doesn't give the full thought process of a vacationer on why they choose to take a vacation.\n\n5.) Moving on to option D, we have a potentially more complete explanation. When vacations are taken, the vacationer may wish to admire the world. But there are other reasons than what is explicitly listed that someone would take a vacaction. For example, the person could need the money. This statement is incomplete, so let's continue in this direction to consider option E.) The option is saying that vacations are taken \"for pay\", but they don't need to be taken for pay as the other reasons listed earlier do not need to cost any money. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n6.) The correct answer is C because the answer mentions good things in life as a reason to take a vacation, in addition to admiration and show off, which are both good things in life, and good things to admire and show off to others.\n\nSo the final answer to this question is C.) needs money\n\nInput: Given that you can never see tomorrow, when can a person ever enjoy the fruits of their labor?

This is because clothing is generally not bought in a cinema in the way it is bought in a mall or a shop. Clothes are not bought in a mall after watching a movie or in a cinema during the interval. \n3) This leaves us with B and D. A department store is a place that generally sells clothing and other household items, so this can be eliminated. There can't be any clothing bought in the closet, so that can be eliminated too. \n4) This leaves us with two options - the B and D. A mall usually has a variety of shops and food stores. One can probably buy clothing as a part of the offer or sales in the mall. On the other hand, you buy clothing from a shop. They are more specific and have more variety. \n5 ) Therefor, the best answer out of these two is B - The mall.", "answer": "B: mall"}
{"text": "1) Let's start by eliminating some of the answer choices that contradict John's sexual hang-ups:\n    - A, B, and C are all choices that imply John enjoys the act of procreation, so these are very unlikely to be correct answers.\n    - If John does not enjoy procreating, then he definitely does not enjoy orgasming or ejaculating. In fact, any of the common definitions of orgasm, including the word itself, include the idea of 'ejaculation' so in that circumstance, orgasm must be defined differently.\n    - Likewise, cum is semen after ejaculation (as in semen collected in a container), so once again, cum is not a viable option.\n    - Similarly, a person who doesn't like to be in bed or naked clearly has issues with sex.\n2) Let's also eliminate the answer choices that express a liking for these actions:\n    - The act of procreating must be enjoyable if someone enjoys being naked or in bed. However, John's hang-ups do not suggest that he gets pleasure out of the act of having intercourse.\n3) So from this perspective, it seems as though the only remaining choice is E: wearing his \"birthday suit\".\n\nSo the final answer in this case is E: wearing\nhis birthday suit\n\n### Instructions:\nYou can submit your solution once you are sure you have the answer\n\n### Submission \n* Name:\n* Submission\n* Multiple Choice Question, Instructions above (1pt each)", "answer": "C: naked"}

The only regulations that come to mind in this context are possibly for cleanliness and sanitation (i.e., no pools after showers in the locker rooms). Therefore we can rule this out.\n4. Consider option A, the YMCA. They may very well have pools in their building or facilities. However, one of the key qualifiers in this context is that it was an outdoor pool unable to be refilled.

A few compliments is unlikely to be what attracts most people.\n  - C: know all - This isn't an accurate or relevant description of why people approach a person. Unless a person is known for a certain skill/knowledge that they can demonstrate or share with others, they're not likely to be approached by 'a lot of people'.\n  - D: popularity - This is a noun, and a person could indeed be 'approached by a lot of people'. However, it's important to note that a lot doesn't have to be measured in quantity or size - it could be in terms of variety. For example, if the person is exceptionally good at many different things, it could be that they're approached by different people seeking their expertise in those areas. Therefore, it still fits but it's not the exact same meaning.\n  - E: understand themselves - This is probably an obvious answer, and could work as a better answer than D, but the question was meant to elicit the least obvious answer, and therefore this is not correct.\n3) Therefore the correct choice is B: compliments.\nSo the final choice is B: compliment\n\nInput:What are you not supposed to wear to a party after 12 AM?

Finally, there is a noun that fills the role of \"a crowd of\". For this option, there must be a subject and object that follow. In the phrase \"a crowd of\", the subject is fish, not any one particular fish, and so fish do \"sit at desks\" together (although in crowds, not singularly). So the desired answer is fish.\n7.

The rumor we are talking about is supposedly about a group of monsters. However, the question asks for the possible outcome if these rumors were believed. Therefore, even if no monsters are real or even really exist, these rumors would most likely lead to mass hysterical behavior (answer D).\n3. Answer A: panic isn't the correct choice because a panic is usually caused by some real thing or phenomena. People panic most likely because there is a real threat or a real danger that is causing or potentially causing that threat. For example, someone being chased after by a dangerous robber might cause a person to panic, where as a monster is not real and could therefore not cause a panic. \n4. Answer B: the getting in trouble is also not the correct choice either because if you are getting in trouble in a situation where you have not even done something illegal (e.g. just rumors), then that could be considered some form of hysteria.\n5.

{"text": "1) The question is about an explanation for what'something' would be if you do not 'need' it.\n2) In the question, something is a pronoun that is being used as an unambiguous alternative to whatever is being discussed.\n3) For example, in the sentence 'A person who is a pro at the backgammon card game is more likely to have a good grip on a Rubik's cube,' the thing being discussed is a Rubik Cube. If backgammon is substituted by any one of the other choices for the pronoun'something' in that statement, then it still holds true.

Unpredictable means an unpredictable length of parties would be unpredictable, but it doesn't mean that the secular parties are unpredictable.\n    - D.

Therefore, since all is an adverb, there is nothing for it to \"almost\" equal. This reasoning can be applied to the answer choice of \"almost\" as well, since \"almost\" is an adverb and \"differences are adjective.\n\n5. Therefore, the correct answer is C: \"all the differences\". So the final answer is C: \"almost all the differences\"\n\n\n \nSolution:\n 1.

However, this isn't immediately obvious from the wording of the question: why would you sell something in an antique store when it wasn't being offered as a valuable antique?\n - Option B is 'in the graveyard': even the title here indicates that this has something to do with the death of an object, but also the idea behind the question indicates that it is not the final resting place and more to do with disposal. As a consequence, it doesn't seem likely that this answer could be the correct one.\n - Option C indicates putting the icebox in the kitchen, potentially where it originated with the ice, which would make it a waste of space. However, the wording of the questions as a whole indicates that there's a more serious meaning (than waste) for this choice.\n - Option D, the junkyard, is exactly what the first hint indicates it should be: the last possible place for the junk box to be.

Tombs don't lead to large buildings. They typically mark the final resting place of someone, such as a grave.\n    - E. Treasures can be anything from money and jewels to historical artifacts. We can't determine this from the provided clue.\n10. Let's look at A, the central passage leading to a public building. Although there may be more than one entrance to a city, a central passage is unlikely to be the correct answer. \n11.B, the central passage leading straight to a treasure chamber, doesn't fit the clue provided: treasures don't mark an entrance, and there isn't any other information besides the clue that would suggest there is a location named a treasure chamber. \n12.D, the central passage leading through a large building, could potentially fit the clue that the explorers discovered a central passage that led to a large building, but we can rule this immediately out because it doesn't include the word 'buried'.\n13.C, the central passage leading underneath a massive building, could potentially fit alongside D because there is no mention of location, and therefore we can't rule out that a central passage could lead from a massive city underneath an ancient building. However, the answer choice doesn't include the part of the riddle stating it's been buried, and therefore this answer isn't the right choice. \n14.C, the central pathway leading by an ancient arena, fits the clue: an arena is a large site for events, and it fits this riddle as it has been buried.\nSo the final choice is C: ancient arena", "answer": "B: tomb"}

If we are talking about a \"break\" as in, a \"dish break,\" we definitely would not refer to the glass as a \"coaster.\" We can then eliminate this choice.\n\n4 \"Lacked skill\" is not correct, as there is not \"lack\" in reference to the \"skill\" or the \"what\" mentioned. There may be no \"skill\" used to set the cup on the counter, but the word \"what\" isn't specific enough for us to be able to tell if the man would not have the \"skill\" to place the \"what\" on the counter at all or if the man didn't have \"skill\" in that particular thing that he could use to balance the \"cup.\" \"Hands\" wouldn't use the word \"what\" to replace \"what\" with a singular noun. \"Break\" can also not be used to fill in the blank as it isn't part of any verb. Choice B, \"hands,\" would be acceptable to use as a \"what,\" but it didn't use the original context of the sentence, so we can eliminate choice B.\n5 \"Had the tenacity\" could be used to replace \"what,\" but the sentence doesn't say that the man has tenacity. It does say he \"lacked the what\" to balance things and \"didn't heave,\" so his attitude wasn't appropriate.

The question describes the locker room as being an 'after' place, presumably indicating that the 'green' drink you would drink before going to the health club. This means that the 'after' is a reference to the locker rooms at the gymnasium, and therein lies the option C: fitness centre.\n   - D: stadium \u2013 When the question describes the 'green' drink being something you will have gotten, not something you're about to get, this puts the 'after' in reference to something you have already done. Going to the locker room at a stadium just doesn't make sense in the context of the question. \n   - E: gymnasium \u2013 The gymnasium is the one location mentioned that could include both a locker room and a place where you could get a green drink.\n3.

However, it's located much further south than the question is asking, but further inland.\n    - boston: Boston is also located on the east coast, but on the east coast of Massachusetts. While it could be a seafood restaurant it's not specifically on the east coast of America and also in the north.\n    - coastal cities: This is not an answer because it doesn't specify what area these cities are in, we can't be sure they're located on the east coast and we don't know what city this is referring to.\n\n6.

However, beaver dams can indeed lead to major damages.

We then look for the correct meaning of the answer that contains the name of a city, which is (D), \"Coastal cities\".

We can rule this out right away. \n    -C) Bed Sores - Again, we can't give ourselves the benefit of the doubt that she was already feeling painful bed sores and missed out the event. That doesn't make sense given the context of the question.\n    -D) Missing Out On An Event - That's exactly what she did. She missed out on an event by being sick and unable to go. So that's the correct answer.\n    -E) Comfort - The character is staying in bed because of discomfort, so how can we say she's comfortable? That makes no sense. That's why this must be the incorrect choice.\nSo, the final answer here is D: miss out.\n\nInput: What were you doing while I was sleeping? Choices: .(a).(b).(c).(d).(e)\nOutput: So, the input question asks, \"What were you doing while I slept?\" We can break this question into two parts: (1) while I slept (2) what were you doing.

Choices:  C: the sun D: nothing else E: the moon F: the planet Venus\nOutput: 1: The question asks about what kind of thing doesn't 'look like' the sun.\n2. There are a few things we can eliminate. For example, the moon looks a lot like the sun, so we can rule out D, F, and E.\n3: Nothing else looks like the sun. The other choice, F, is a planet, like Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn? Of these, only Venus looks anything like the sun, but other than in the very early morning (as in sunrise and sunset) and the very late afternoon (as in sunset), it doesn't necessarily 'look like' the Sun either.\n4: The sun has a big, orange glowing disc and so does the moon. The sun radiates heat and so does the moon, but on their surface, that's the only superficial resemblance they have. Neither resembles the other.\n5: The sun doesn't have any surface at all. It has a solid yet gassy core, around which are the plasma and magnetic regions, then the photosphere, and the Corona. The moon has some surface, but not all.

A child isn't an object and certainly isn't something that you would want to wrap your string around while storing it on a spool. \n\n- B: 'the last straw' \u2013 Again, this isn't right because a straw is a pipe and not something that you can wrap your string around to keep it on the spool. \n \n- C: 'hobby shop' \u2013 This may come close because a hobby shop is certainly a specialized place where you could buy string and spools. But it wasn't the item that Sally wanted to wrap the string around.\n\n- D: \u2018end of the line\u2018 \u2013 Again, this may sound similar to using a specialized place to buy the string. It may even be used to wrap Sally's kite. However, it wasn't what Sally was specifically trying to wrap the string around in a specific way, so this option isn't correct. \n\n- E: 'toy store' \u2013 This option is also incorrect because a toy store isn't the proper use for string. \n\n- Finally, we're left with option B: 'the last string'because this is the only option that makes sense.

But it could also be the listener could relax *to* music, especially if a listener is getting ready for sleep. So there's a problem with this choice as well. \n3. This leaves us with the choice of B: smiling. Smiling is most certainly something someone could experience while listening to music. It's likely they would smile in the process of listening to music they enjoy. The listener probably wouldn't become happy or calm (A, C, D), since those are emotions that would result from the music, and wouldn't necessarily be caused by it.

'Homeless Shelter' isn't logical because the question doesn't specify any time-frame for this, implying the length of time that he has actually 'been' on the bridge is what the question is trying to ascertain. Moreover, it is illogical for a person who is recovering from alcoholism specifically a person who is currently a recovering alcoholic spend 8 years at a homeless shelter. \n5. 'Luck was not on his side' isn't the answer either. It doesn't talk about being an alcoholic and also, this specific sentence is worded incorrectly as well: it is 'wasn't on his side'(not \"was not...wasn't\"). \n6. 'Neighbor's house?'isn't the answer for either. 8 years seems like a bit of a stretch to spend in a house belonging to somebody else.\n7.

Combining these considerations, we can conclude that option 2 (instant results), 4 (more can be purchased if needed) and option 5 (they won't spread germ) could be correct.\n3. We could eliminate all the other answer choices because they explicitly state something contradictory to each of the 3 remaining options.\n4.

Therefore, a person who isn't a person is not a person.\n  A trash is something that isn't good, isn't valuable and isn't pleasant. Therefore it can't be referring to something that isn,t a person.\n3A pile is used in reference to an accumulation of items. It would be a pile of clothing, a pile of trash, and so on.

{"text": "1) In this question, we are asked to select where an individual would play a board game with one's family.\n2) When considering the answer options, it's easiest to disregard options that contain certain words that could indicate other locations that might suit the situation, but would not be the answer.  In this case, the options that can be ruled out are A: toy store, C: school, and E: shelf.\n3) At this point the remaining answer options are the home and the 'toy shop', which could be interpreted to mean a location where one purchases toys, such as a store. However, as we have eliminated option A: toy store as one of the answer choices, we need to understand why 'toy store' is a potential answer. That is because in this question, 'toy' can easily be replaced by the word 'board', the latter of which is what someone might play a board game with their family on.\n4) Therefore, there are two valid answer choices to remain, home and toy shop. Since the toy store cannot be disregarded for being too literal, this leads us to be able to eliminate the home as a valid answer. The reason is that while the home can be a place to play a board game with someone, it is also a common location for playing games and other indoor activities in general. If we're looking for a more specific place to play, such as a board game, then the home is not a specific enough location, as it could also mean one simply plays a game on a table in one's home. Therefore, the toy shop is the correct answer.\nSo the final output is D: toy shop\n\nInput: When is it difficult to swim?

For this task, we can rule out all but one answer.\n\nLet's take a look at A: burned \u2013 As soon as wood is burned, all that is left is charred bark or a pile of ashes. Charred bark or ashes have not got any reflective quality whatsoever.\n\nLet' get to answer C: Carved \u2013 It is obvious that when we carve anything, we are leaving a hollow. In the context of this discussion, we are not carving to create an image, so carving alone cannot help us in solving this question.\n\nLet' move on to B: Polished \u2013 A smoothly polished piece of wood can shine when exposed to strong light. However, it does not show an image.\n\nNext is Let's look at D: Nailed \u2013 A nailed piece of wood will be very shiny after a few months when it receives lots of exposure to direct light and air. That being said, its glossiness does not imply that it is reflective.\n\nWe are left with a single answer:\n\nLet's look at answer E: Compacted.\n\nWhen we compact wood, we are taking various materials and shoveling or stacking them to form a block. Such pieces of compacted wood have their reflective ability, but the only way to have such a reflective quality is if there is a smooth, flat surface with no blemishes. But for this to be possible, the wood would have to lose all its rougher features.\n\nThe correct answer is E: Compacted\nSo the final answer to this question is E: Compact wood\n\nInput:What kind of building was never created to house an entire town?

However, each of the options has a different level of outdoor/indoor percentage. So we can disqualify some options.\n    - A: High school gym \u2013 The basketball court here is definitely indoors, even though it is at a high school, as high schools have gyms.\n    - B and E: the city and Los Angeles \u2013 These have an indoor/outdoor ratio of about 50-50; so they can contain basketball courts but this isn't a place where a basketball court is likely to be outdoosrs. \n    - Use: use \u2013 This answer choice doesn't even give a basketball court; instead, it's giving an unspecified place where basketball courts are used. So this option is not correct.\n    - D: Park \u2013 This choice may have basketball courts, but it is more likely a park contains fields and courts for many sports; so it's not possible to identify this as the answer.\n3. Looking at option C: parks, we can easily eliminate any other option as there are no other choices where a basketball court is at a 100% rate of being outside. So the answer is C: parks (or any park will do)\nSo the final answer, the correct answer, is C: parks\n\nInput:What is it when you can't make it?

Choices: A:  take a nap B: add sugar or sweeteners C: add cream or milk D: brew it yourself E: spill it\nOutput: We can eliminate options A, B, and C right off the bat since they describe activities that aren't done when having a delicious coffee. Therefore they are irrelevant.\nNext, let's take a look at D and E.\nOption D tells us the coffee must be freshly brewed to be enjoyed. Though this could be true, we can also get delicious coffee by brewing it ourselves. Therefore D is irrelevant as well.\nConsidering option E, this option is telling us it's wrong to spill the coffee since it must be delicious to be considered good coffee. However it doesn't mention that it must be delicious when consumed in its original form. So this option is irrelevant. \nThat leaves us with option C as the remaining answer option. The answer to the question asks for an activity that's not done when having a deliciously freshly brewed coffee. Therefore the correct answer to the question is to add sugar or sweetening. So the final answer is C: add sugar or sweeter to it.\n\nInput: When you first set eyes upon an incredibly delicious looking dish, what will you most likely do next?

It is also annoying to get texts from companies which want my business. I should just buy a paper notebook because I don't text or email friends as much as I used to.

You'd have to ask the waitress for that information.\n3) With this information, the correct answer is A \u2013 You find out by talking to the waitress.\nSo the final answers is A: You find out by talking the waitress\n\nInput: How could a man's hair tell him about his health? Choices:  B: color C: quality D: length E: thickness\nOutput: Let's take a look at each answer option:\n\n1) A is not the correct answer because the only thing a man's hair might tell you about his health is whether he has cancer, but the question is about more general symptoms.\n\n2) C is not the answer because 'quality' generally describes one's personality, not health conditions.\n\n3) D is not the answer because hair length has little to do with a man's health conditions beyond his gender and age.\n\n4) E is not the answer because thickness isn't really about his health either. \n5) Looking at the options left, B is the answer if we take into account the context of the question. Coloring can have to do with a person's health in a number of ways, including certain kinds of poison in food and medication affecting hair coloring, or infections and diseases that cause hair changes.\nSo the final is B: color", "answer": "E: menu"}
{"text": "1) When we are given a list, we generally start from the beginning and go through each option in order, stopping only when we find the correct answer.\n2) The question is asking us to identify a possible outcome of driving a car that does not involve any pain.\n3) Choice A: automobile accents \u2013 This is not a possible outcome of driving car because automobile accidents, by definition, are painful experiences.\n4) Choice B: backache \u2013 This isn't a possible outcome because painful or not, back pain is the result of sitting for a long time, typically while doing sedentary activity, such as driving.\n5) Choice D: getting tired \u2013 This isn't correct either because getting tired is not a consequence of driving unless driving involves pain. \n6) Let's look at each option in order, beginning with choice E: car crashes \u2013 This answer is correct because in this scenario, there is no pain and therefore, the car crashing does not lead to pain. Therefore, it is the correct answer.\nSo the final answesr is E: car crash", "answer": "D: getting tired"}
{"text": "1. The question is related to a dog barking which is triggered by a presence of someone at a specific location.\n2. Looking at each answer choice (in ascending order) we can rule out B (friend's house) as it does not explain the presence of a person who is not there.\n3. Similar to this, C is not the correct answer, since a classroom is not necessarily a home where a dog is present.\n4. If we eliminate A (building) and E (front door), then this leaves D (window). The window is the only possible answer that would explain the presence of a dog barking.\n5. Therefore, the correct answer is D: window.\n6. So the final answer is D; window\n\nInput: When speaking with a friend what might a person be doing? Choices: \nA: being happy B: working C: drinking ginger ale D: drinking coffee E: having fun\nOutput:\n1) The person can be happy, working, drinking ginger ale, drinking coffee or having fun when speaking with a friend.\n2) A can't be the correct answer because when speaking with a friend, what the person is doing isn't the point. Instead, what the other person is doing is the central aspect of the conversation. If the person is happy, then the focus is on that, for instance. \n3) Similar to this, C can't be the true answer either.\n4) Drinking ginger ale isn't the true answer because it's not possible to do all of these things simultaneously.\n5) Likewise, D isn't the answer since having fun is an action that isn't possible to do when speaking with a friend if also drinking coffee.\n6) Therefore, the correct answer will be E: having fun.\n7) So the final answer is E: having fun\n\nInput: Where can you find a place that has no walls?

{"text": "1) this question asks about one of the things people do when they examine different things.\n2) We can start by trying to eliminate option B: this states that the question is asking about the chapters of a book. However, this is irrelevant if the question is concerned with what one does when they examine different things and not about the composition of the book.\n3) We can next turn our attention to option C: this option states that a person could examine different things with this behavior. While this is technically possible, it does not accurately reflect the question that's trying to be answered.\n4) Looking at option D, reading a book is one of the things people can do when they examine different objects. This is consistent with the question as well.\n5) With all of these considerations, we can conclude that the only correct option is D: reading a book.\nSo the final option is D: reading book\n\nInput:what is the most appropriate size of book for most individuals to carry?

In terms of sizes, it would make most sense to carry mid-sized book.\n5: In option E, large means big or great in size. So this option means a large book.\n6: So the correct answer is option D which is medium.\nSo the final choice is D: medium", "answer": "D: read book"}

With this in mind, we should start by eliminating choices A and B, which specifically refer to glue guns. \n2) The rest of the choices are more subtly referring to glue. However, these can still be misleading because a \"school\" can be an actual school or it can be an educational institution. \n3) Now that we've eliminated most of the choices, let's consider the final answer of choice D: desk drawe - we can tell that all the glue has been bottled, and we do see a lot of them. \n4) Therefore, the answer to the question is D: desk drawerp\nSo the final answer to question: What building has a ot of (a) glue bottles is D: desk drawers.\n\nInput:What is the only kind of meat you can get that's made completely of meat? Choices: A: ham B: salami C: sausage D: bacon E: porkchops\nOutput: 1: Let's start off by eliminating options B, C, and E - \"salami\"/\"sausage\" and \"porkchops\" obviously do not contain any non-meat ingredients of any kind. Meanwhile, \"ham\" is not actually ham, since ham is usually pork (if it's not, it's beef). 2: We can also consider option D, \"bacon\". Bacon does usually contain a portion of \"pork belly\", but this does not make it ineligible. The only way it could be an incorrect answer is if we had a bacon that only contained pork and no fat at all, and even then we could always slice off the extra fat later on.\n3: Let's now evaluate option A, \"ham\", closer. This option could be mistaken for a ham product that contains more than only meats. While a ham-based product can contain both meats and meat by-products (like, for example, \"chicken-flavored\" ham), there are never any instances of non-meat ingreidients in \"ham\" products that only contain meat meat. 4: So the only valid answer to this question is option A, \"ham\".\nSo the final answer the question is", "answer": "E: school"}

That's the answer choice you should pick, which can be in first person singular, plural, or other types of constructions.\n\nThe answer is A: 'dance', we don't know if Jimmy was dancing or not, but the party had dances (sorry, not dancers).\n\n\nInput: Where do people with too much salt look to remove it?

Choices: \tA: despair B: anxiety C: optimism D: apathy E: hope\nOutput: 1: The question's looking for what may happen to you if you are waiting for something but do not want it.\n2. Let us analyze each answer choice in turn as follows:\n    - A Despair \u2013 This isn't really the right answer because it cannot be used to explain the scenario described in the question.\n    - B Anxiety \u2013 This isn't suitable either, as anxiety could be caused by many different reasons and having to wait for something isn't the only one.\n    - C Optimism \u2013 Again, this couldn't be a good choice because it has multiple meanings and would not be necessarily relevant to the scenario described.\n    - D Apathy \u2013 This would be a perfectly suitable answer except that the question is asking what you experience when waiting for something you don't want. Apathy, in this specific context, would include desperately wanting something, or the polar opposite. For instance, being disappointed you didn't get it.\n    - E Hope \u2013 This is what you experience in the scenario if you really do want the thing you're waiting for, which is an essential condition for answering the question.\n3 Combination of considerations", "answer": "E: palpitations"}

How many workers are wearing protective clothing? Choices: 1: 15 2: 14 3: 13 4: 12 5: 11 6: 10\nOutput: 1:\nThe question is asking what the number of workers wearing protective gears is.\nLooking at the options, one can simply exclude options 2, 3, 4, and 5, since they all have values less than 20.\nThis leaves us with option 1.\nSo the answer is 15 workers\n\nInput: You were the last letter in a Scrabble word you made with your significant other.

{"text": "1) The question is asking where someone would go if they were using a parking lot that is near a roller coater.\n2) Let's first eliminate some obvious incorrect options: A, B, C, and D are all inappropriate because a roller coaster can be found in an amusement park or other parks with rides. E is not an appropriate choice since a roller coaster is not generally found near an urban area.\n3) Now we look at the options that are left: It can be concluded that A and B are wrong since a roller coater is found in an action packed amusement park or carnival. This leaves C and E as our correct answer options: C states that you would be going to a \"business district\" while E states that you would be in an \"urban area\".  \n4) From context, the correct answer can be deduced to either be an \"amusement park\" or a \"business district\". This leaves us with C and E as our options since a business district is the only other option left where the user could be going, thus E is the correct answer since it is the one that refers to the business district.\nSo the final  answer is E: urban area\n\nInput:Where can you be on a boat's top deck? Choices: \nA: ground  B: rooftop  C: balcony  D: bridge  E: subdiving\nOutput: 1: The question is asking where you can be on the top deck of the boat.\n2: First, let's eliminate a few of the wrong answers: A is ground, a type of surface, whereas B is a rooftop, a top surface. C is for balcony, a smaller version of what the answer is going for. D is for bridge, and E is for subdiving, which isn't even on a boat.\n3: Now, we can see that D and E are incorrect options. D is for bridge which is certainly not one and only possible of the options for top deck.

{"text": "1. The question being asked is where an actual bullet projectile is actually located throughout a war, and not where wars are fought. \n2. To simplify the problem we can first consider that this is a multiple choice question that doesn't have a trick question for extra points. \n3. Choice A: battle field \u2013 If we have bullets being shot in the war, and then those bullets are reused, then the bullet projectiles will likely end up in the battle field. However, the battle field may not be the answer to this question as the main question being asked is about where a bullet within a war projectile is located during the war. The question asks for the projectile, not for where the war takes place.\n4. Choice B: museum \u2013 If there was a museum that housed various bullet projectiles for wars, then this would be a great option. However, when researching this answer, I've found that museums don't typically house weapons used in wars. \n5. Choice C: weapon \u2013 As this is a bullet projectile, the main question being asked of where it will be located is during war, not the time leading up to the war. \n6. Choice D: canon \u2013 If we're looking for where a bullet projectile may be found during war, then a canon could potentially be the right answer. This is due to the fact that if there are cannons firing in a war, then any bullets that were fired and have been collected might be located in this canon.\n7.

One can't leave a paper notice on a refrigerator without potentially ruining the paper quality of the note. The refrigerator is also likely to make the note wet, which could also damage the paper or the adhesive used on it to stick to the surface.\n3. Similarly, a note left on a classroom door is likely to also get wet by someone walking by it or by rain. The paper note might also get lost, damaged, or destroyed accidentally.\n4. A paper note left on a suitcase is similarly risky because the suitcase gets picked up and moved around a lot, and the note could either be damaged or potentially ruined entirely.\n5. The front door is a good location because it's a constant part of the environment around the house and is unlikely to be damaged. It's also probably the single most common place someone leaves a notice for people inside the house.

As mentioned on the previous multiple-choice question, option E: chair, cannot be the correct choice since this implies some sort of chair that somehow houses a light.\n3.) Options C: universe, and D: attic, have no contextual relevance to the question and are therefore removed. \n4.) What\u2019s left are the options, B: desk, and A: ocean. \n5.) While the option A: ocean might seem like an interesting or clever decision given the context of the question, it\u2019s not what the question is asking of you. The question merely asks where is the best place to put a light to illuminate an area, and the ocean cannot be seen as illuminating its surrounding area.\n6.) In the next question, what to you would be a better reason for a student having a good grade?\n7.) Choices:  A. Having better grades than their classmates B. Having better reading skills than their classmates\n\n8.) Let\u2019s consider each choice:\n    - Choice A: Having better grades than classmates. \n    - This doesn\u2019t necessarily have any contextual relation in the question. They are better grades because of a reading skill and not the other way around.\n    - When we choose a good or logical reason for them having a good grade, then the other can be eliminated. So they already have better grades than their peers, and they\u2019ve also proven their reading skills as they have better grades.\n    - Therefore, this isn\u2019t a good option and can be thrown out. \nIn the end, we\u2019ve come down to the following options:\n-B.

But because the building site was difficult, he advised the builder not to dig too deep. Which of the following does he have more of? Choices: 1: money 2: information 3: influence 4: time\nOutput: 1- money doesn't come from the same place as the choice and time comes after the choice.\n2- it does not matter where influence is, it's about the person in general.\n3- It doesn't matter where information comes from when it's the choice that matters.\n\n4-it's not only money you put in the ground before you fill the land, as that's going to be important if you want the ground to be solid. You can use dirt, sand, water, and other materials to do that.\n\n5-the choice is the site itself and it is different from the ground.\n\n6-time can't last beyond the choice itself, since it's the choice itself that will take time.\n\n7-if a builder is hired, it means they are doing work. Therefore, they don't have time to spend.\n\n8-it is irrelevant where influence comes from, as it can be used to do anything with, and therefore has more of everything if it's done.\n\nThis means that \"influence\" must choose \"more\", not time, because it's not an extra thing, it's a resource that one will put in if there's enough for it.\n\nHence the correct answer is B: information.\n\nSo the final answer will B: information\n\nInput: A man who lives in California has an unwritten, informal agreement with the manager of a", "answer": "B: heretical"}

Let' start from the opposite answer choices:\n    - B: southern hemispher \u2013 The southern hemisphere is a region in a planet's upper hemisphere, but there are no oceans in the southern hemisphere. So, we can eliminate choice B. \n    - E: earth \u2013 The question specifically says \"Indian Ocean\" and \"Martian\" which obviously has nothing to do with earth. So we can eliminate choice E. \n    - Planet \u2013 We can eliminate choice C because the question is about finding the Indian Ocean and Martian which doesn't quite make sense as they need to find the planet and then the Indian ocean. \n3. Choice A would certainly match the phrasing of the question because the Indian ocean is an ocean on Earth. Additionally, Martians are a race of sentient inhabitants of the planet Mars.\nSo the final and correct answer is B: southern hemisph. \n\nInput: A boy in the class is 13 years old.

The animal doesn't have a name. What do they have to do before they can name the animal? Choices:  [A] Gather information on it. [B] Feed it something it likes. [C] Give it the most appropriate name itself. [D] Gather information on other animals.

Therefore we can rule out two options. \n3 - Considering each answer option:\n- A is a logical answer because we will have to know quite a lot about the animal before naming it.\n- B is not a suitable choice because we don't know if the animal is capable of eating what it likes, or if it would even like the food given to it.\n- C won't work because an animal itself cannot decide what name to use.\n- D will not work because we also don't know what other animals we will be keeping for this particular animal. (However, this answer option might be suitable for other animal choices because it might be that knowing about other animals will be a requirement for this task. In that case, a different answer choice would be A - Gather", "answer": "D: space shuttle"}
{"text": "1. The question is trying to disguise the answer for the next choice. It asks to identify what you probably shouldn't have when you're fiddling through a book, but instead should be playing in front of the music.\n2. To answer this question we can look at the choices and rule out options that don't seem to be necessary, and then use this knowledge to identify the answer that makes the most sense. \n3. For example, option B, dexterity, is not an appropriate answer because your purpose whilst practicing is not to exhibit your dexterity. We can rule out dexterity since it isn't the answer.\n4. It seems intuitive that option A is incorrect because playing and practicing are two different things and we shouldn't be practicing when we should be playing. Further, we were supposed to answer based on the context of the question which suggests playing in front of the audience or a conductor.\n5. Likewise, option C, idle time is incorrect because your purpose for practicing your music should be to avoid idle time so that you can spend more time playing in front of the conductor or in public. Option C, idle time is an incorrect choice. \n6. We can therefore move on to the next choice.\n7. Option D, knowledge of music is perhaps the most difficult choice to eliminate from option E, the conductor, so we can eliminate knowledge of music because we can determine we are not expected to ask the conductor the music itself but rather to ask the conductor to play through the music and then ask the conductor to repeat the music. Option D, knowledge is discarded.  \n8. Now we're left with two choices. Knowledge and conductor. Since we cannot expect the conductor to be at either our level of proficiency in the music or the conductor\u2019s own knowledge of the music. We can rule out knowledge.\n9. Therefore, the final answer is E: The conductor\nSo the final answer to what you probably shouldn'ta have when youre fiddling through music book, is the conductor\n\nInput: When you are at school, what do you not do?

The question is asking about what someone would like to be if they were thick.\n4.) What does the word 'thick' mean in this context?\n    - The first association that comes to mind is the thickness of one's body. If the person was thin, they would prefer to be thick, like when someone desires to be taller.\n    - However, this is not what is being asked in the question. Instead, a closer consideration of each option is required.\n5.) As per the first point, the meaning of 'thick' seems to be referring to the thickness or density of something.\n6.)

It is used to indicate socks as a set of 2. - 'a matching sock' - Here 'a matching sock', 'a matching pair' can be used to indicate a colorful sock. We have to choose the one meaningful sock that is colorful and it is 'a matching pair'. - 'a non-matching sock' - 'a non- matching pair' can be said use to indicate a colorful pair.

Choice D,'state park', does not answer the question either because nothing is said about the TV show being about a state park, and so this cannot be the correct answer.\n5. Finally, choice E,'surface of the earth' is not an answer to the question either because the question is clearly asking for a theme that can be applied to the TV show, while the theme of the surface of the earth probably would not apply to both the ranger and the gardener shown in the TV show. \n6.

Choices: A: run B: go C: jump D: take E: fly\nOutput: 1: The question asks for the long distance between two places.\n2: Here, there's a lot of ambiguity, and as you can tell, we're not actually told if two people are traveling and need to get there, what the two places are like, what type they are (ie. if they're houses or something), or how long this distance is.\n3: We can eliminate four out of the options pretty quickly (run, jump, fly, take) because each has one of these problems: run doesn't actually get you anywhere and jump is something you do once, fly is one way to travel but not a general method and take requires you to interact with someone else who can drive you.\n4: Which leaves us with only one option - B: Go\nSo the correct answer to this question is to go by the car\n\nInput: A person may be feeling _________ by their favorite flavor of ice cream.

Choices:  A-drain B-suck C-shake D-sweep E-clean \nOutput: 1: There are many words you could use for what you might do in order to remove a plastic.\n\n2: Let's consider each word:\n2 A) drain - This doesn't seem like it's quite correct based both off the context of this question and off of context alone. We could replace this with water and, the water would clearly not be able to 'drain' a plastic bag because of the porous nature of it.\n\n2 B) suck - This doesn't make sense either - if we were able to use a suction machine to remove the plastic bag, then that would suggest the plastic was porous, which makes the bag not plastic at all. It might be possible that a suction machine *works* on a plastic bag, but not in a way that would fit the context of this question\n\n2 C) shake - I'm not sure I'd describe a shake-down or shaking motion as \"sucking [the object] in\". We want to \"shake\" the plastic away, and not \"suck\" it in.\n\n2 D) sweep - Sweeping with what? What are we using to sweep the plastic? This makes little sense.\n\n2 E) clean - Clean is a good answer, and this is the only one in which I could imagine clean as the action to get the plastic off the area, although this might happen post-shaking, so it might be a sub-set of shake.\n\n3.

Let's consider the various answer choices available:\n    - A, Building a family together \u2013 This is not a common action when lovers are just beginning to date. Instead, they're more likely to be involved in other activities instead of building a family. \n    - B, Falling in love \u2013 Yes, lovers will want to fall in love with their partner or with someone they're looking to date. But this action of falling in love isn't complete.\n    - C, Make love \u2013 Lovers can make love with each other. But this is also a process because it doesn't represent the entire experience of making love, which includes making out and other intimate activities. \n    - E, Distance themselves \u2013 We don't want to isolate ourselves from one another; lovers often prefer to get closer to each other, rather than further apart.\n4.

In this case, 'largest' indicates that we are referring to the 'physical size' of the largest among the species of bugs, not their 'number or population'. \n3. Considering the given answer choices, choices A-C refer to fliers while choice D refers to a flyer, and thus not an insect in the kingdom of bugs.

A person who is looking for change would welcome the novelty of something new. However, the use of 'change' in the question isn't being used in a way that relates to 'welcome' here. The context of the question is to look for new things. This type of newness implies a certain level of exploration or discovery that a person new to an experience like travel would get when they were learning a foreign language. It doesn't imply the same excitement or joy they could experience when, for example, trying a new food or learning a new game. The choice that is more applicable is 'welcome novelty.' However, 'welcome novelty' isn't a valid answer since it was never provided as an option.\n\n - C: thank god \u2013 This one can be eliminated for the same reason as choice B as it doesn't make sense to thank god for discovering new things.\n\n - D: experiences \u2013 This doesn't mean anything here.

Unless the question was looking for industrial machinery in general, it's not accurate to the question. \n    - B: museum \u2013 Copying machines themselves would not be on display in museums, but rather they could be described by a museum attendant or exhibit as being used, but this seems irrelevant since the question already suggests that people are specifically searching for old ones. \n    -C: barn \u2013 Barns tend to specialize in agriculture or animal husbandry, not machinery. \n    -D: school \u2013 Old copy machines aren't found in schools very often, and they likely would not be displayed. They aren't even very common in schools, since machines have evolved a lot and most schools just use a document camera to scan and share documents in digital form.\n    - E. Office \u2013 These seem like the most obvious place to look according to the question, as it describes that an office is where these things would be viewed.

Therefore, this isn't what the question is asking.\n3: 'Filled with tears' does not refer to the state of our eyes, but in this case, we'll consider both the literal and figurative definition of the phrase. If something is filled with tears, it means that it's saturated in tears. You cannot literally fill an eye with tears. Also, a newborn would never say that they are or will be filled with tears.\n4: 'To be happy' does not necessarily mean that you're the happiest (i.e. the most excited) you could be. For example, someone could be happy to see a familiar face.\n5: If something is 'glassed over', then the glass is a protective layer/barrier. If you're 'glassed over', it can mean that you're pessimistic, indifferent, uncaring, or unimpressed. The word is more figurative than literal. Therefore, this is not the answer either. \n6: This leaves us with option E, which is what we're looking for. This answer describes the literal state of infants' eyes at the time they're first exposed to light. \nSo the final answer here is E: glass over\n\nInput: What is the opposite of the opposite of 'fierce'? Choices: 1: B: gentle 2: C: loud 3: D: mild 4: E: weak\nOutput: 1\u20133 are all wrong because they are not actually the opposite of 'fearless'. 'Fearless' is an adjective that describes something that is not afraid or not causing fear. To check the definition of the opposite of the opposite, we can use the definition of the opposite given here:\n\n(adj.) without fear", "answer": "B: see light"}
{"text": "1: The question is asking about where one can find bread in bills.\n2. The answer choices are:\n    - A restaurant: restaurants are places where customers pay for food. There is no such thing as a bill that contains bread.\n    - Congress: congress isn't related to bills/debts, only laws. \n    - An envelope: this doesn't necessarily relate to what is asked in the question. What matters is if there is an envelope in the bill that contains bread. For example, what if every government bill contained an envelope that had bread and cheese in it? \n    - A mailbox: a mailbox is more associated with letters.\n    - A cheese store: It could be asked that if people go to a cheese store can they find bills that contain bread, as some cheese/meat/grocery stores have bills, but this is not the answer we're looking for.

Based on this information from the question, we have that fruit and the bridge are the only two things that we can include in our logic.\n2. In the context of the question, an eating area is likely a place where you can sit down and have a bite to eat. However, the wording of the question suggests that this could be the location of fruit and not necessarily an actual area.\n3.

Therefore, based on the given information we can eliminate B, C, D, and E. (B, C, D, E)\n5. Choices A and E don't really fit logically either. A refrigerator doesn't allow for a place to eat fruit and the E market also doesn't allow for the 'eating' of fruit but is instead a place to buy/sell fruit.\n6. Therefore, with all of the above considerations, the answer can be determined.\n7. The fruit on the bridge must be the bridge itself as in a red bridge, there is the existence of fruit. In terms of eating fruit, the fruit is the structure that is the bridge and it's where you can 'eat' the fruit. So the correct answer is A \u2013 Fruit on the bridge.\nSo the final solution is A: Fruit on the bridge\n\n# Instruction :\n\nThis solution is correct, because \n- in the first Question, when we consider the question, answer A: Oil Refineries is the only option that fits the question, thus it is the exact Answer.\n- the second question is a multiple choice and the correct answer is D: Accomplishing and the above reasons why all answers are false and why this one fits.\n- the third question is also a multiple choice problem and the explanation of above can be applied to this question too.\n\n# Input: Where do you learn to fly fighter jets?

Choices:  I: thunder is the sound of the lightning II: when lightning strikes III: rain IV  weather V: clouds\nOutput: 1: This question is about identifying things that can be associated with lightning, but do not cause lightning.\n2. The correct answer (III) is 'when lightning strikes' because lightning does not cause itself to strike. For lightning to occur from which it may be said 'lightning strikes', there must be something else. That something else is rain. It's correct according to the instructions (see #3).\n3. It's important to know the instructions on this particular question. 'when lightning strik is caused by...' does not mean to find the cause of lightning. It means when lightning is caused by a certain thing, 'lightning strikes'.\n4. After narrowing it down to lightning strik, what are its causes?

{"text": "1) The question's statement in bold is the clue to the answer.\n2) A routine can often be said to make a sequence of events appear mundane when those events are not out of the ordinary (as opposed to happening with exceptional frequency.)\n3) The choice that will describe a way of getting rid of this, is the one that doesn't allow what would normally appear routine to continue from their point on in the same way (i.e. not by repeating something that would normally result in the outcome of that routine.)\n4) In context, 'exceptional' does not mean something noteworthy enough to be considered a mild positive occurrence. It means quite the opposite. Someone using the phrase with such intent can only understand that an exceptional occurrence is the complete opposite to what might be considered normal or routine.\n5) Therefore the only choice (of 5) that meets the criteria to describe a mundane routine being described in the statement above is C: 'imprevist' (i.e. something unexpected).\n6) The correct answer is choice C: imprevist.\nSo the final the final answer is C: imprevist\n\nInput: Which is the longest word that begins with's?'

We can then break down the question a little further: \"How would one normally recognize bleachers?\" We should be able to identify bleachers by the design of their seating structure.  If we were to describe bleachers, the following features would be salient: - They are usually comprised of several parallel rows of chairs or benches.\n - There are no more than a few rows and typically less than 20 chairs.\n - These seats would be close together and may be arranged so that you need to squeeze past other people to move up or down a single row.\n - The end of a seat generally wouldn't be aligned with the ends of other seats in the near vicinity.

{"text": "1: The question is about determining what a person is feeling when they hurt someone unintentionally but are unable to stop that person from being hurt.\n2. Let\u2019s identify which of the answer choices does not fit the description:\n    - A. empowering \u2013 Empowerment feels wonderful to a person and has nothing to do with hurting another person.\n    - B. regret \u2013 Regret only occurs when one has stopped being in the action of hurting another person. It can result from a conscious decision to stop.\n    - C. despair \u2013 This doesn\u2019t fit as a person who is hurting someone else is still in the process of hurting them and wouldn\u2019t feel despair. The action of hurting someone has not ended yet.  Despair would be felt in a different scenario.\n    - D. glee \u2013 Glee is felt when someone harms or hurts another knowingly and can only be experienced when the action of harming or hurting comes to a sudden end. The person would feel happy when a person is harmed.\n    - E. sadness \u2013 Sadness is in an entirely different state. In the event a person is not able to stop hurting another person, then they are experiencing immense regret or despair at what they have done to the other person. Sadness would not be appropriate.\n3. Therefore, the answer choice that is the most applicable to the scenario we\u2019ve set forth is C. despair.\nSo the final Answer is C. despair\n\nInput: A person has gotten what they wanted, but their happiness is still low.

{"text": "1: When Sally was a senior in her house, what she was a member of was none of those things:\n    - She was not a member of an assisted living facility or an old people's home because she was a high school senior.\n    - She was also not a member of the republican party because it is an organization or institution rather than a place where she resided.\n    - Likewise, Sally was also not a member in high school or in college. It can be inferred from using context clues that whatever Sally was referring to as the house in this sentence was a high school or college that she was not in. In addition, high schools are distinctly different from elementary schools, and high schools can be further divided into public and private. Likewise, colleges also come in various forms and contexts. For example, many countries have public colleges as well as private colleges. This makes the answer \"college,\" which may appear to be a choice that fits, a bit ambiguous in the context of this question.\n2: She was also not a senior in the republican party because a senator in politics is a person (not a high school senior).\n\n3: It can be inferred that she was not a senior in an assisted living facility.\n\n4: Thus, Sally was a senior high school student or a college student.\n\nSo the final answer from 4 is C: high school or College\n \nInput: There are four people in a hotel room sharing a queen-size bed.

He could live physically in Texas, live as a citizen of Texas, or live within the boundaries of Texas as part of a state/country. \n2. As we further dissect the question, we find that John lives outside the borders that make up the United States. From here, we determine that:\n    - A) Oklahoma is not the correct answer, because it is located on the opposite side of Texas (in the Eastern United States), or;\n    - B) that the 'developer of land', whatever that means, is not applicable, as John lives in Texas and hasn't done any developing on land in Texas.\n3. So it becomes clear that John lives 'outside' of Texas, and the options we're left with are the Desert and Mexico. \n4. Since we're looking for a country here, we eliminate option E.

If you feel tired after running, then you did not run.\n4) Choice C: Restlessness is a symptom of a health concern, such as insomnia from a lack of adequate sleep. It is not a symptom of taking a shower after running. \n5) Choice D: describes the symptoms of cramping legs. This is a potential symptom of dehydration and not taking a shower after a run, where we are focused on the process rather than the symptoms.\n6) Choice E: is also irrelevant.

We can eliminate certain options by considering john's preferences more carefully.\n    - Pet Store: The pet store is just a store that sells pet animals.  This wouldn't be a place where John would actually need to abstain from going because there would be no reason for him to go in there in the first place.\n    - Parking Lot: John wouldn't go into a parking lot per se, but he would drive through it in order to park his car somewhere. As a safety precaution, he might prefer to take longer and more circuitous routes in order to avoid this but it still wouldn't be something for him to fear.\n    - Woodland: John wouldn't avoid the woodlands per se because they could be places for him to go hiking in. Rather, John would stay away from the areas that humans might have abused the woodlands with.\n    - North America: John would avoid traveling to places that humanity has exploited and neglected such as the North American desert.  He would probably also avoid the human-destroyed forests located in such regions.  He would, however, stay among human-made natural spaces such grassy lawns.\n    - Park: The park would simply be a recreational space that john could access and go to.

Using a pronoun to replace 'that' is a different use altogether.\n    - F is used to join a clause with a phrase or question. While it can be used to combine two sentences, one could also achieve this by using a conjunction.

{"text": "1: The question is about what a commonly accepted indicator is that someone is lying. \n2. We can look at the following ways in which a person might be communicating while doing so, but in the process of lying:\n    - Avoiding eye contact \u2013 Not everyone avoids eye contact when they are lying. In fact, some people avoid it when they are telling the truth too. It's therefore not a 100% accurate indicator. \n    - Falling asleep \u2013 In some cases, the opposite may also occur: the person may fall asleep.\n    - Guilt \u2013 This is something that can follow a lie even after a person is no longer lying. \n    - Dog food \u2013 It's not applicable as an indicator of lying because everyone does not eat dog food.\n3. With this in mind, a commonly perceived indicator of deceit is a blush: \n    - In order to feel guilty about something, your mind must be engaged in thinking about the deed you are guilty about. This, in turn, can lead to a blush.\n    - In order for someone to fall asleep while lying, they must first be engaged in a lie that they are telling. The same can be said about blushing: blushing occurs when the person is talking, leading to evidence that the mind is in a state of heightened arousal. \n    - If a person were to avoid their eye contact, this may occur because they're concerned about their guilt that is connected to the lie. They would avoid eye contact to avoid a potential sign of guilt and subsequent blush. \n\n4. The correct answer is B: order dog food online.\nSo the final answers is B: order online\n\nInput: What are three things that you'd never see a spy sitting at?

It asks about what makes directions in a labyrinth 'complex'. \n2 Considering options: A, B and C:\n    - The'simple' (A) and the 'complex' (B) are not applicable because they describe the actual labyrinth instead of what makes it complex.\n    - The 'contains many directions' (C) isn't really applicable either, because it only provides an example, and not the reasoning behind what makes directions complex in the labyrinth which the question describes.\n3 We can then eliminate options B and C, because they are not describing complexity at all. They are just making statements about the labyrinth. \n4 That leaves us with option E: having only two directions, and it makes sense because this is indeed what", "answer": "C: curry"}

There is nothing in the question that states how many of each item you can receive, what kind of brush you can buy, or whether those items are for your personal use or for resale.\n\n3.) As far as the answer choices are concerned, we can eliminate any items that contain plural nouns because each noun can only be combined with one other noun by our logic. Additionally, any item that states \u201cfor children\u201d or anything similar should be disregarded because that's already stated in the question \u201c..bought along with bandages.\n\n4.) We can also exclude the car and hospital from the list.\n5.) Therefore, the remaining choices are house and drugstore.\n\n6.)

For example, answer options, E: walk slowly, is not the correct answer. We can definitely imagine a child going for play while walking slowly. Similarly, answering options A: laugh or B: sit are also incorrect, since these are things that a child might do while going for play, but not necessarily at the moment they're going for play. \n3. Answer options, C: happiness and D: be entertained might be a better fit. However, the question makes it clear in the beginning that what a child is likely \"to do\" while going to play, so we need to consider answer options that are actions rather than emotions. \n4.

It would be a business meeting consisting of employees only. E. The meeting would be a small, informal meeting \nOutput: 1.) There are a few scenarios in mind here:\nA. The meeting could be an official meeting between boss and employees, in which the importance of not being missing anyone is the fact that the boss won't be there to hear a report.\nB.

Option A (attic) & option B (basement) are both incorrect because it is not typical to store wine in either of these two locations. \n5) Option A would be a fitting choice, however, storing wine in the attic would be an unsafe & non-appropriate storage place to keep it. This would give it a good chance of spoilage as extreme temperatures could be a possible result.\n6) Option B (basement) is the correct answer in this situation. Basements in which are used as storage in many homes, offer the optimal temperature that wine needs in order to mature in.\nSo the final answers is B: basement\n\nInput: Which of the following words are spelled with an \u201co\u201d?

{"text": "1.)  The question does not indicate explicitly that the razor must be a double edge or specify where it is to be stored, but it's a good assumption that the razor in question is a double edge razor when looking at the other answers.\n\n2.)  Looking at the options, and thinking about the general use-cases that one would find them in, we can eliminate choices B, C, and E, which specifically mention a location where one would be likely to store their razor.\n\n3.)  When considering choice D, it's important to look at the context of the question as a whole since that's where the correct answer will be found.\n\n4.) The context of the question is looking at where to store something that would not be of great use when in use but could lead to danger if left unmaintained or stored somewhere it should not be stored, indicating that a razor would be a good example of whatever item is meant by the question. It's also mentioned that the place of storage mentioned will not be obvious or easy to access.\n\n5.)  Thinking about the context, we should look at places where the location of the item would not be obvious. If you were storing a razor in a place where it would not be used often, such as a drawer that you rarely open, it would not be obvious that the item is there given that its location is not easily accessible. However, because the item in question is not in use and in that sense, it would not be a valuable (or obvious, as mentioned in the context) possession, the person wouldn't want to leave it in a place where they don't have easy access to it.\n\n6.)  Therefore, choice D would actually be a good place to leave the razor, however, leaving it there would mean that it may not be properly looked after.\n\n7.)  Looking at the answer choices again, it becomes apparent that leaving the razor behind in a place it shouldn't be would be the most likely choice.\n\n8.)  Choice D is not likely to be a good place to store the razor due to the way it is described. This is where the conclusion is drawn, and therefore, choice E would be the correct answer. \n  \nSo the final answer would be E: shaving kits", "answer": "B: shower"}

{"text": "1) The question is asking what to say after a conversation with a person. To answer this, let us consider each answer choice: \n\n    - A: open letter - An open letter means a letter that someone publicly shares with a wide audience and may potentially have many recipients. The word 'open' in this context can also imply that the letter is written for all to read. Therefore, this can't be the correct answer as this is a conversational concept and would seem strange to share or publicize, especially with the potential that you're conversing with this person. \n\n    - B: thank god \u2013 The answer, thank god, is in reference to the fact that you have just finished your conversation with a person. So, you say this to express your relief at what was just discussed with them. This is a 'normal' phrase to say at the end of a conversation as it's an alliterative statement. In the choice B answer, the 'thank god' part is a clich\u00e9, which is a phrase that is said to be overused, commonplace, or banal. This is the opposite of the 'non-clich\u00e9' desired in the question. Because of this reason, the option B answer 'Thank God' can not be the correct answer.\n\n    - C: say goodbye - The question uses the phrases, \"you have finished a conversation with someone\". Say goodbye is in the past tense and therefore is incorrect. Whenever we talk about a conversation, the correct phrasing is 'we're going to say goodbye'. Therefore, this can' be the correct answer. \n\n    In summary, A: open letters can't be correct, B: thank god is a clich\u00e9 and therefore wrong, C: say goodbye is incorrect, leaving the answer to be D: Bless You.\n\nSo the final answer  is D: Bless You\n\nInput: When there is a bad smell of oil where does it come from?

Given the question, we can eliminate answer choices that don't make any sense given the situation. Since no numbers exist in a body part, and since we don't know what a \"populated area\" is, we can eliminate options A and C. Since the purpose of government is to control or create numbers, and since numbers don't naturally exist in a \"group of people\", we can eliminate options B and E.\n    3.

{"text": "1 The first step is to eliminate the options that aren't possible responses to the question.\n2. One can't live in a band, so we can immediately eliminate this choice.\n3. Similarly, a music room doesn't count as a house, so we can eliminate this option.\n4. Both colleges and universities are educational institutions and they cannot count as living places. Therefore, we can eliminate a college.\n5. A university is a type of college, so we can also eliminate a university.\n6. Bill clearly has to live in a house. If he lives in a band or music room, he wouldn't be able to buy a piano. Also, Bill isn't an educational institution and he isn't able to live in one. So this leaves us with only option E from the choices, i.e. Bill lived in a house.\n7. So the final answer is Bill lived in a house\n\nInput: Which is not an organ? Choices:  K: liver Q: stomach J: colon R: heart U: intestines\nOutput: 1) First, consider the options that cannot be the answer.\n2) Organ (K) is not a word that can be found in plurals. 2) Since R has the right vowels, it is the only word that contains the letter \"e\" in the right vowels and thus, is invalid.\n3) Thus, the final answer is organ (J),\nSo the final answer to the question is organ (J)\n\nInput: In 1987, who directed the classic \"Back to the Future II\"?

D: pay bills \u2013 This doesn't belong in this sentence because only the phrase \"free slaves\" is making sense to fit it.\nd.

Of the given answer choices, only \"invitro for reproducing\" makes reference to this process, so this can be eliminated as a potential answer choice.\n3. Answer choice B, \"problems,\" while technically an accurate answer, is somewhat unclear in the context of this question. In most cases, the phrase \"problems with reproducing\" is often interpreted as infertility, not referring to IVF treatment. Therefore, the phrasing needs to be altered to better define the intent of the question to eliminate this answer choice.  \n4. Let's go through the remaining answer choices:\n    - A; offspring \u2013 While infertility can cause couples to seek medical treatment for having children, it's not clear that \"in vitro fertilization\" is being referenced with this phrasing. Since only the answer choice which refers specifically to the process of \"invitro for fertilization\" is referencing the same concept, this can be eliminated.\n    - B; overpopulation \u2013 While overpopulation, which refers to the concern of there being too many people in a certain area of the planet, can definitely cause couples to seek out medical treatment for having children; it's not clear if this is what the phrase for the question is referencing.\n    - C; larger family \u2013 While some people might seek out this type of medical treatment to conceive twins, triplets, or other types of \"larger families,\" most people seeking to have children have already been able to conceive offspring naturally, so this is not applicable as an answer.\n    - D; baby \u2013 We have already defined the meaning of the phrase \"in invitro for fertilizing\" and have demonstrated the need to alter the phrase to better conform with that definition, so this is not a valid answer.\n5.

So as per 1, it's most likely the people are queuing up at an establishment that provides water. \n3: It's also an unlikely scenario that you'd see people standing on a line at a bus stop. Usually, people who are waiting at a bus stop are standing in a single line. They're waiting for a bus.\n4: People in apartments usually can fill up their own water bottles from the inside of their home. Also, many apartment buildings have a laundry room that is typically connected to the inside of their home via a plumbing pipe system. Usually, there are laundry machines that you put a coin in to operate, so they're not free of charge. If you have to queue up to fill up your water bottle in an apartment, it's probably going to be in the laundry room.\n5: People from outside the community don't typically come to the fire stations, except to volunteer there.

It's doing something about the situation but doesn't necessarily cause any action against the original perpetrator.\n    -  E: lend money \u2013 while lending money might result in a person retaliating against the one who hurt them, that sort of reaction isn't necessarily the reason for someone to lend money. It's possible that the person who was injured might ask them for a loan as well, or they might do it for other reasons, not necessarily for anger.\n3. Therefore, the answer is E: Lend money.\nSo the final choice is E: lend money", "answer": "A: feel sorry"}
{"text": "1 & 2. The question is asking about what basic skills a dance instructor teaches a beginning dancer that will help them in other aspects of their life.\n3. We have a few answers which we can cross off by rule of elimination, as the answers: euphoria, rhythmic-movement and music, don't seem to fit the context of the question.\n4. The instructor's objective is to teach their student the basic skills that will help them in any scenario where they need to move their body, and we can cross off choice C: moving body, as it doesn't seem to be a broad enough skillset, and choice B: rhythmic-movements, because it sounds like it is too involved as a specific skill that isn't really applicable outside of a dancing context.\n5. Of the choices left, we have two contenders: having fun and music.\n6. While having fun could be considered a basic skill one should learn how to do if they want to interact with other people or feel comfortable moving around, it likely isn't one the instructor will teach a beginner as not all situations involve having fun (for instance, working, or playing a board game, or other instances where it wouldn't be appropriate to have fun). Additionally, being able to have fun is not something one learns from their dance instructor, but rather from their surroundings (such as in the context of the instructor who teaches the instructor how to teach).\n7. This leaves us with option E: music which is the correct answer", "answer": "B: rhythmic movement"}

Therefore, it'll be incorrect. \n    - B - Sea World: This is a theme park where they have a tank with glass walls where viewers can look at dolphin and fish, not sharks. Therefore, this cannot be correct answer.\n    - C - Pacific Ocean: Since the question asks for a location, it doesn't make sense to be talking about the entire ocean. If there was an exact location in an ocean (at least a part of the ocean) where we could find a clear tunnel to view sharks, it could possibly be the correct answer.\n    But if there wasn't, then it wouldn't get accepted as the answer because this would violate the requirements of the question.\n    - D - Indian Ocean: In the same way, Indian ocean is a body of water and not a location as has been asked for.\n    - E - Gulf of Mexico: Similar to the previous two answer choices, this is a body of water.\n\n3.The answer is C- Pacific Ocean.

This choice doesn't satisfy the criteria.\n    - B : fear \u2013 A person could confess to a crime due to fear, for example, being afraid of being caught if they don't confess. This is a valid potential answer. It could also be a way to find relief from a guilty conscience.\n    - C : go free \u2013 This isn't possible as most people, by confessing to a crime, don't go free.\n    - D : problems \u2013 A person could confide in another person about their criminal activities for any number of reasons from needing help, to asking for advice on how to change their actions. However, a confession to a crime would not qualify as a problem. This choice doesn' tell us why the criminal confessed\n    - E : find god. This isn't a good fit either as it's only a partial part of the answer. It doesn't even mention confessing to anyone else. This option is not a perfect fit.\n    - Finally, we find B: fear being the correct choice.\nSo the finals answer is B: fear.\n\nInput: If you look back on your childhood, did you used to love math?

After considering each answer option, we can cross out answer choices which aren't valid solutions to the problem. \n3.1. A. Hanging clothes in a closet won't solve the problem of a smell, because the smell will still be present, only in a different environment. \n3.2. B. Smelling clothes won't work either because the clothes already have a smell, and you'd end up smelling it. \n3.3. C gets crossed out because the very act of getting clothes dirty will cause them to develop more odors.\n3.4. D is incorrect because becoming soiled only refers to getting dirty. The answer isn't about just how the clothes get dirty, but which solution you should choose. \n3.5. Finally, option E, airing out, is the correct answer.

{"text": "1) The question states that not being able to learn causes distress.\n2) By reading through each answer, we can see why one of them is incorrect. \n            - The inability to learn might cause intelligence to decrease in someone if they're not learning new things regularly. In this case, answer choice A is incorrect because intelligence has no relation to learning.\n            - In answer choice B, education isn't the cause of distress. This isn't because education is irrelevant to learning, but because the question mentions learning in general, which implies education of any type will likely happen naturally in the context of the question.\n            - Since both A and B are wrong, the only remaining options are C, D, and E. \n            - Since answer choice C is distress, it can't possibly be the cause of distress it's suggesting someone would feel. This leaves answer choices D and E as the best answer choices. \n            - Looking at D again, the word effectiveness points toward a person who has lost efficiency due to not learning. For example, one might become distressed or confused after losing the ability to learn.\n            - On the other hand, answer choice E mentions a stupid someone. This isn't the cause for distress being mentioned in the question because this phrase wouldn't mean the person couldn't learn anything or was unable to do so.\n            - The answer choices are therefore E: a stupid.\n            - The final answer is E: a stupid.

Eaten.\nIn order to test if this answer choice is correct, we will examine each answer one-by-one to test each.\nI. Eaten. \nWhen someone eats olives, they can't prevent said olives from getting nearby food wet. The answer is false.\nII. Glasses.  One needs to have eaten one's olives to put one's olives into glasses. One doesn't eat the olives first, but then put them into glasses, for that is where eating would occur. The answer is false, because one would already have had the olives either consumed or be actively consuming them. Further, the fact that one would not be eating the olives (as the question asks about food near the olives) in fact makes it even *more* likely that one would be eating the olves. This isn't to say that one must be eating said olives, but when the question asks to put them in proximity to other food, they must be in a location that does not require ingestion. \nIII. Jar. As with choosing a jar over glasses, the question asks to put the olives near another object. If the olives are in a jar, they are not in proximity to other or new food and this choice is incorrect.\nIV. Pizza. This choice is also incorrect. The question is to prevent olives from getting the nearby food wet, not wet it themselves. This is to say that if olives were on a pizza, they already are in proximity to said pizza. \nV. Refrigerator. The question states that you wanted to put olives in proximity to other 'food'. If the olives are refrigerated, they are not in close proximity to other food.\nVI.

There's some ambiguity here as to whether the author is referring to the idea of death as an emotion, rather than a state that you can be in.

The athlete is stopping competition after a lot of hard work. He's not quitting. \n    - E: Winning or losing: In this context, winning or losing doesn't seem to be the primary focus.

While the remaining choices don't contain the word blotter, you can infer the meaning from the question and answer choices.\n    - A: shirt pocket\n        - If you're writing with a fountain pen, surely you won't be holding it in your shirt pocket just to prevent the ink from drying.\n    - B. calligrapher' hands\n        - While you can hold a calligraphy pen in a calligrapher' hand, there isn't much need to do so and it would really have no impact on your writing.\n    - C. inkwell\n        - The inkwell is where you store your ink in a fountain pen.

The desk drawer is where you store the inkwell, not where you use it to absorb ink from the fountain pen. \n3) The only choice that's left is the paper blotter, and that makes sense because paper blotters are where you put your paper to absorb the inked image.\n4) Therefore the final answer is: B: blotter.\n\nInput: A man decides to travel up in a helicopter to an  island.

If we look at the text, he was worried about being found out because he was lying about a dead body. \n2) Let's take a closer look at each choice, beginning from the correct answer:\n   - D: Problems.\n  - There is a plural form of problem in the text \u2013 \"he would have problems when he was found out\". This means there are more than one problem. These problems are clearly associated with him being found out, and that is why \"problems\" is the correct answer. \n  \n3) Considering the other answers:\n   - A & B: Lying will not result in hurt feelings or trouble from anyone. It just results in a lie. \n  \n   - C: It is likely that being found out could potentially cause him hurt feelings or difficulty for him in the future, but that is not a concern when \"finding out\" isn't the goal. Thus this is incorrect.\n   - E: Trouble is the opposite of reward. \"Trouble\" would mean to cause problems for Sean and not reward him for lying about a dead body, which is what the text says. Thus, this answer isn't the answer.\n4) With these considerations, we can conclusively say the answer is D: problems.\nSo the final outcome is D: problems\n\nInput: I would have preferred to be a ________.

Now with this information, let's try to eliminate the other answer choices:\n    - A. We eliminate this option because the family did not cause any bleeding or wounds, which Joe suffered as consequences from stabbing the stranger to death.\n    - B. We also eliminate option B because the family of the man who received a knit in the neck did not in any way do anything to Joe. But rather, Joe might have been sentenced to 6 months in prison for the case after his trial in court which he only won a small plea bargain, where he pled no contest to a misdemeanor and a $50 fine. Joe was also ordered to pay $2000 to the victim's family in damages and to attend 5 anger management classes in restitution.\n    - C.

E: The farther an object will be displaced when acted upon by a given amount of force.\nOutput: 1).We can immediately eliminate choices B, C, and E because they directly contradict one another.\n2).The remaining statements are as follows: \n    - A: If an airsplane has a constant air speed, its lift and drag is directly proportional to the airspeed. This statement is false because the airspeed of an airplane, lift, and drag depend on the velocity and acceleration with respect to the airplane. Because lift and drag depend nonlinearly on the magnitude of the airspeed and are governed by the product of the drag coefficient and the airspeed, 2Csairspeed, the two are not proportional. This incorrect because it is a logical fallacy to assume that as the airspeed increases, the lift and drag increase proportionally. \n    - B: An object has mass while it is in free fall. This statement is true as the object is falling through the Earth's atmosphere. Therefore, it has mass. \n    - E: The farther an unladen object will be displaceed when acted upon by a certainty of force. This statement is true because the force exerted on the object is directly proportional to the displacement of the object.\n3) From these considerations, we can conclude that statement D is the one that is false.", "answer": "D: beach"}

However, if a pool table is the place players in the game are playing, then answer choice C (a sporting goods store) is the right answer because that\u2019s where we can see people in uniform playing a game on a pool table. On the other hand, answer choice B (a TV) clearly shows people playing by being on television. 1.2.2) In answer choice D (a sporting event), the person playing is not necessarily playing in the game itself. They might cheer for a sports team, but they certainly aren't participants in the game at all.  \n\n1.2.3) Therefore, the answer choice must be a sporting goods store or a sporting event.\n\n2) We can now decide what the right answer is. If we rule out the sporting goods store (choice C, answer C) because we don\u2019t expect people in uniform to be able to be playing a game of a sport in that type of store. \n\n3) Therefore the final answer is, the right answer is choice D, as seen in a sporting event\n\nSo the final answer will be D: A sporting event.", "answer": "E: sporting event"}
{"text": "1) The first step of the question is to define what we mean by \"book store.\" We can assume that a \"book shop\" generally sells books and that a \"book store\" deals in books of both fiction and nonfiction.\n2) The second step would be to decide which book store offers which kind of books.\n3) In our example, she needs to buy nonfiction. She needs to visit a department store like Walmart or Target to have an option to choose non-fiction. The other choices do not really meet the specifications of the question.\nSo the final answers is D: department store\n\nInput: You like to play with others in a team sports. What makes the game less interesting? Choices: A: A loss B: Tied game C: Winning D: Drawing E: None of above\nOutput: 1: The question is asking us to choose the answer between 4 options.\n2: So we need to find a answer that makes the game less interesting. As per the options:\na) Loss - it can make the game less interesting only when you lose.\nb) Winning - this is more exciting.\nc) Draw - you may draw in half matches so it is neither interesting nor boring.\nd) None of above - I dont think that is a option.\ne) Tied game - I think \"Tied game\" also can make the game less entertaining because at the same time you play well but fail in the tie breaker.\nSo the final correct answer is b: Winning\n\nInput: The woman who will be walking her brother is a.\nChoices:  A. walking B. sitting C. standing D. a man E: not defined\nOutput:\n1) The question is clearly asking us to define the answer.\n2) We need to tell them the type of person who will be walking with her brother. So the answers are:\nb: a woman\nc: a man\nd: not defined\n3) We're looking to exclude a woman and exclude a man, so any person who meets these conditions is the correct answer. The answer is b: a woman.\nSo the final option is b: a woman", "answer": "B: mall"}

{"text": "1: The question is asking where an individual was receiving workman' scompensation.\n2: Let's look at our choices:\n    - A \u2013 Factory: A factory is a building where work occurs for manufacturing purposes. We can immediately rule out this choice as the question specifically mentions tripping over a'metal rod' (a plumbing component) and the wording indicates that such events occur on a construction site or at a job.\n    - B \u2013 Construction site: Construction site is a type of site where work is going on for building purposes. It is unclear exactly what plumbing components one might find in the construction site, but from the construction site, one can presumably receive workman' s comp due to any work-related injury. We can rule this choice out as well as the question specifically mentions metal rods which are not found in the construction site.\n    - C \u2013 Engine? This isn't an option either because the wording is clearly referring to construction or plumbing components, suggesting that this option is not applicable.\n    - D \u2013 Inside skyscrapers? While it is technically possible to receive comp because of injuries while inside a skyscraper, there is no information in the question for verification. Moreover, the wording doesn't seem to be asking where this is occurring or what one should be receiving comp for. The inside skyscrapers doesn't seem like it would be the right answer to the question.\n    - E \u2013 Shops? From the wording, we can understand that the question is not asking where one receives work comp from being hurt in a shop specifically. Rather, it is asking for where an injury occurs on site for which workman' s comp can be received. Hence, the shop location doesn't fit the question.\n3. With consideration of all the above points, we can deduce that the correct answer is 'A: Factory'.\nSo the final answer after all of the above is A: Factory", "answer": "B: construction site"}

However, in some rare cases, some meats can be stored safely at room and refrigerator temperatures. There is, however, a limit to how long a food item that is kept in a fridge can last.\n    - D, the butcher's shop \u2013 Butcher shops typically prepare meat as they sell it, and not in bulk quantities.

{"text": "1.\\. The question is asking what leads to someone's suicide when they are very depress.\n2. Let us first identify which choices are ruled out by the questions. Obviously choice B, overdosing, is ruled out because a person is dying from too much of a substance, not too little. In this case, we're talking about someone who is too depressed and they aren't taking their own life, but rather choosing to end it by overdosing. In addition, choice B does not apply because it's the person's depression, not just their feeling sadness, that leads to their death.\n3. Next, let's consider each answer option:\n    - A suicide \u2013 According to the question, if someone is depressed and they die, it is usually not because of a suicide attempt.\n    - Sadness \u2013 This is also rejected here because the question describes someone who is very depressed, and sadness typically isn't the main cause of death among those people. In any case, it's a general emotion, so it wouldn't necessarily lead to a person's death.\n    - Cyanide \u2013 This choice is a poison, which can obviously lead to death. But in this context, it is just being discussed as a substance, not a cause of death. \n    - Murder \u2013 This isn't possible because the idea is that a person is dying because they are very depressed, not being murdered.

The organ called a 'heart' is in most of the mammalian species \u2013 although there are exceptions \u2013 and species aren't an appropriate or relevant element of this question.\n    - Artichoke \u2013 They are a plant that is not an animal. They also aren't the correct answer because plants can't be given the attribute of having a 'caring heart'.\n    - All mammals \u2013 It's worth noting that all mammals are animals and have hearts. So, while all mammals are technically likely to have a \u2018caring heart\u2019, this doesn't answer the question in the context of the question. Also, this doesn't explicitly include all mammals, even though it is clearly implied.

We can eliminate choices B and E immediately because the question explicitly mentioned \"person who is well educated,\" not \"people.\" And the words \"being\" and \"educated\" in choices B and E are the past tense form, which indicates that the subject is already educated. Since our subject is \"a person,\" the answer choices must be in the present tense.\n3. Regarding choice D, this doesn't really fit the context. Someone who is well educated is well learned in things, typically academia, but being well educated doesn't automatically mean that that person has enough food.

For choice C, one could have a lot of money and still be someone who is well educated. And while it is good to have a place to call home, it doesn't necessarily come with some sort of guarantee for educational quality.\n6. Choice A also doesn't really qualify because we're not looking for something that could be an attribute of someone who is well educated, just a specific attribute.

Choices are babies, sisters and brothers, cousins and grandchildren  \n3a-3e. Only the children's relationship to the other child is relevant, not any other information.\n4f. The children can be siblings or cousins.\n\n5. Therefore, only 2 alternatives are possible, babies and brother or sister, and 2 babies only.\n6. The options can be eliminated based on the following criteria:\n\n6 and 3 can be eliminated because they say the children are babies, so a baby cannot also be a brother or sister at the same time.\n  1, 5, 6 and 7 can't be options because they refer to the children being the parents.\n5, 8, 2, and 3 can't be choices as they refer the children being born before the other child, which could happen only if the other child is a sibling, parent, or grandchild, and not a great grandson.\n\n 7.

While this option is certainly possible, the way the question is worded it's not likely. \n    -C - _Work, when used as a noun in this context, doesn't make any sense.

It is a place, and places just don't get stressed out.\n    - B food\n    Is it a product which would be sold in a market or a place where food products are sold? The answer to this question is yes. If you are talking about going to the market to get some food, your answer would be B.\n    - C that you\n    Is it you talking about going to a market? The answer to this is no.

No. You're unlikely to pet a dog if you're not trying to calm it down, which makes it a bad answer.\n    - b: train him\n    Is this choice a good answer? Yes. If you're trying to train a dog to be less aggressive, then the choice would be B a good choice.\n    - c: tell him\n    Is this a choice a dog would understand? The answer is no.

And this piece, when performed, will almost always be played in a reasonably nice and pleasing to the ear. Therefore, this answer isn\u2019t the one they\u2019re looking for. \n    - E: A high school band is likely to contain many instruments, including, a bassoon, but would also have other musicians playing other instruments besides bassoon. For the group of all these musicians to produce bassoon with an unpleasing sound, even with a bassoon in there, all the musicians would have to play the music poorly. With the high school bands you will notice that not even the bassoon is always played perfectly, but that being said the band as a whole is capable of producing excellent music at times. Therefore, having bad musicians in a band can\u2019t be the correct answer.\n    - D: At first glance, a play music might seem to be the correct answer given that often musicians are included in plays and other theatrical performances. But that's not what this question is asking for. The play music should have a bassoon played in it with an unpleasant or not good instrumental arrangement. This is not always the case, and even if it is, there are other instruments in the play with good instrumental sound.\n3) That leaves us with option C, a symphony\u2014an orchestral piece. And with an orchestral piece, musicians often play well together producing relatively good sound. Even if there was a single bassoon player in the symphony who did play with poor instrumental sound, the whole orchestra would have to be playing poorly in order for a bassoon's sound to be perceived as not good. If every other musician in the symphony played well, though, then the bassoon's sound would sound good, and would indeed be the correct answer. \n4) In conclusion, the answer is C, a symphony", "answer": "E: high school band"}
{"text": "10: The question is asking us to find a place where a printer can be used by 'thousands of people.' We can quickly eliminate the following answers, because none of them contain places that would allow a printer to be used by a wide variety of people:\n    - A \u2013 a school has a limited number of people, since it's only populated by the students and educators for a given time. \n    - B and C \u2013 the home office and the people store are not places where you could use a printer to print something for many thousands of people.\n2. In general, however, an office of every sort must have people who work there that would have use of a printer. That rules out the choice D as well.\n3. Finally, the newspaper office (E) can use a printer to print out thousands of handouts for their customers (people who want the newspaper). So the place in the choices where a printer can be most useful by thousands of people is a newspaper office.\n4.

The first two choices aren't correct because they aren't about why crayons are difficult to draw with. They are correct about why crayons make drawing easier.\n2. 3. This one is also incorrect because, again, it isn't describing why crayons are harder to draw with; rather, it describes why there's an advantage of crayons being soft rather than hard.\n3. 4 \u2013 The box is shaped like a square.

Considering choice 2: The question mark, although the correct answer, is not the last letter of a text. The last letter of a sentence therefore cannot simply be a question mark.\n4. Consider option 3: This is a letter, and is the last letter in some sentences (for example, the sentence \"What is the word for the final letter of a sentence?\" ends with a full stop), but is not strictly the first and last letter of the sentence \n5. Considering choice 4: sentence is not the last letter in a text either (the last letter could be a word or abbreviation). It would be incorrect in this case.\n6.

(See image below of the map of I-5 in Michigan)\n5) Ramp metering helps to regulate the flow of traffic on the freeway in both situations, but the specifics of how it is implemented vary based on the location of the freeway and traffic itself. So the answer choice choices for this question are 'a' and 'e'.\n6) If ramp metering were applied at rest stops, as in choice 'b', it wouldn't regulate traffic as effectively because you can't 'hold' vehicles in line for long periods of time while they wait at a rest stop.\n7) And in the case of choice 'c', the United States isn't the only country that has a freeway system, so 'american city' wouldn't be helpful in this instance.\n8) The only remaining choice is therefore 'the country'.\n9) 'the country'.

It would be a response to something the person liked, so it's inappropriate.\n    - C - laughter - This is not a reaction to happiness. It is a reaction you can have after you laugh, which can be caused by many different emotions.\n    - D - smiles - It is also not a reaction to happiness because you can have a smile even without being happy.\n    - E - tears - In its most basic form, tears are a response to pain. Therefore, this reaction would not be due to happiness, so that eliminates it as well.\n3. With the considerations we've done so far, the only correct answer is E: tears.\nSo the final answe is E: tears\n\nInput: When do people typically see their doctor, if not when they're sickly? Choices: 1. A: after sickness 2. B: not while sickly 3. C: before sickness 4. D: during sickness  5. E: when sick\nOutput: 1, The question is asking when you should see a doctor, either when you have an ailment or not. \n2, Options B and D do not suit this. Option B indicates you only see the doctor when you aren't sick. So an ailment doesn't exist or at least it is not yet diagnosed. Option D says you see a doctor while in a sick state. This implies a person is already sick, and hence they're visiting a doctor already.\n3, Options A, C, and E make sense. As per their implications, A states you visit only when you're sick which is not what the context of the question demands.

That's the exact opposite of what friends want to do when they spend time together.\n    - B, friend's house \u2013 In many cases, friends spend time together in their mutual friend's house. So this again would mean they'd be engaging in conversation.\n    - C, internet cafe \u2013 This is possible, but not very likely. This option seems too specific to be the correct answer, especially because of the specific mention of staying quiet.\n    - D, movie \u2013 This seems highly likely that a movie would be the correct answer.\n    - E, restaurant \u2013 Like a movie, a restaurant could reasonably be the correct answer. Also like a movie though, it's quite feasible that friends could engage in conversation while eating and drinking.\n\nTherefore the final answer is D, movie.\nSo the final answers are D: movie and D: movie\n\nInput: When are you most likely to find someone wearing brightly colored socks?

At night time, you're most likely asleep, or relaxing in your home, or out and about with friends.\n    - B. Anytime \u2013 This isn't really helpful because one could find people wearing bright colored clothing anytime.\n    - C.

We can quickly know that answer choices A and B are not possible because he doesn't have a desk drawer or pencil case with him, he just has to go to the store to pick up pencils.\n2. The answer choice is clearly not D, because he does not work at an office depot, and therefore this is not an option.\n3.

Choices:  A challah is first dipped in tahini, which is what B: tahini is made of.  C is a Jewish bread that is traditionally eaten for Friday dinner.  What is a challah?   D: challah, E: challah itself? \nOutput:  We can quickly eliminate answer choices A and D as false, because tahini is primarily a condiment made from sesame seeds, and Challah is both a bread and an aromatic word.\n  The answer choice is B: tahini.\nSo it's tahini in answer choice B.

{"text": "1) The correct answer is B, animal\n\n2) The other answers are incorrect because they are not valid things that you can harvest from a garden that you plant.\n\n3) The other answers can be eliminated by thinking about how you plant a garden. You plant flowers, you don\u2019t plant animals. You don\u2019t plant flower petals, you plant flowers so you can enjoy their beauty. \n\n4) The best way to quickly eliminate the remaining two options is to think about what you harvest from a garden when you plant it. You don\u2019t harvest vegetables when a garden is growing, you harvest vegetables when they are fully grown and have reached the point where they are ready to be eaten. So C is wrong. You eat the vegetables from the garden after you have harvested them, but you don\u2019t eat the vegetables while they are alive. You would need to kill them before you eat them. So E is false.

The teacher's wish is indeed more students, but it asks more specifically for something more. So this choice isn't exacty correct.\n3: Let's now look at the choices that are not options. The teacher does not wish for:\n    - less students (B) \u2013 this choice is not an option because the way to his house is not in the past.\n    - More students (D) \u2013 This is not the case: On the way to his house, the teacher wants more students, but these are not necessarily the students he already has in his classroom.\n4: The question actually asks for the teacher's wish about the future, however this could mean various things. He could be wishing for more students by the end of the school year, he could be hoping for more students to apply to his school for admission, or he could wish for more students who apply for admission to go to his school, etc. While these are not necessarily the case, we can deduce that these answers are what the person asking the question may be trying to infer. \n5: The final answer is therefore B:", "answer": "A: sitting down"}

Let's consider each option for the answer:\n    - The temperature \u2013 you don't know the temperature in the building before you come in it; the temperature is a result of the building and what's inside of it.\n    - The location \u2013 When you are in the building, you know where you are; it's already specified to be the building itself.\n    - The weather \u2013 Weather is completely separate from buildings, regardless of whether they are indoors or outdoors; therefore, this is wrong answer.\n    - The climate \u2013 The climate of a building is a complicated measure, and is not answered by any one element, which is why this is not the right answer.\n    - All of these choices \u2013 This means they are all wrong, so the right answer is 5: none of these answers.\n3.)

{"text": "10.1. I can't think of a single answer choice that would make you \"feel vomiting\". \n2. So since one doesn't \"feel vomiting\", we can \"throw away\" the \"vomiting\" answer options.\n3. Next, let's look into \"mess\" and \"happiness\" as plausible answers. \nA \"mess\" can be made if you spilled something in bed, and this is not the kind of a mess you are describing as an answer choice, so we can \"throw away\". \nAs far as \"happiness\" or \"contentment\" goes, both of these are states someone could only feel if they are already comfortable and relaxed, which is the exact opposite of when someone is just beginning their morning and eating breakfast in bed. This eliminates possibility of \"happiness\" and \"contentment\" being the chosen option. \n4. We are left with two options: \"pleasure\" and \"being pleased\". \n5. Let's look at \"being pleased\" first. This is an accurate reflection of what you can feel after eating breakfast in bed, provided you haven't spilled anything.\n1. Now let's look into our last answer choice - \"pleasure\". In light of this case, \"pleasure\" can reflect all kinds of other things as well. For example, a person might feel \"pleasure\" after eating breakfast in their very clean room, which has no mess on the floor, not because they just ate in bed. There is a possibility they ate in their very clean room because they just made their bed and made it nice and comfortable. \n2. In this scenario, it makes more sense to answer \"being pleased\" or \"pleasure\" to what you've felt. \n3. Therefore, the correct answer is \"being pleased\".  \nSo the final answer to this question is \"being pleased\"\n\nInput:I am not an expert on what.

Let'e consider each answer choice: \n    - A: go to jai \u2013 This isn't what he is doing when he condemns the man. The man is already in jail when he arrives to pass judgement, and therefore we can't say that he condemned him to go to jail.\n    - B and C: incarceration \u2013 This can't be correct either because one isn't imprisoned within jail (if you're going to jail for whatever crime you've committed), you have already been incarcerated.\n    - D, E and F: judgement \u2013 We can eliminate D, E and F as well because you don't actually pronounce judgement after the man has been jailed. And if you were a judge, 'intercourse' probably isn't what you'd be doing after your work day.\n    - F: death \u2013 Even though death does happen upon a person being convicted and sentenced, it's not 'condemning' them to death. This person is already condemned to death after a guilty verdict and sentence (so this isn't really fitting to the question).\n3. The man is guilty and therefore should be pronounced and sentenced accordingly. However, this means you have the job title of judge, and then must do your best to ensure that any criminal who stands before you is adequately punished for their misdeeds.

{"text": "1.) The question is about finding the correct place to put a dollar bill where it is hard for someone to get it out without breaking something.\n2.) As per the given wording, we can eliminate options B, C, E. While a cash drawer could be used to store the dollar bill and is therefore suitable for our purpose, it isn't difficult to get the dollar bill out of the cash drawer without breaking something.  Similarly, a piggy bank breaks when you pull it open to get the money out, you still technically aren't breaking something other than the bank since it's not a living thing. And the same can be said for a purse and a box respectively.\n3.)  So now we have two viable options in our hands:  A: cage and B: coin purse. 4.) The cage is likely referring to a bird cage, not something you could put a dollar in. Thus it's not suitable for this purpose.\n5.) The remaining option is B: coin purse \u2013 which is also a good fit.\n6.) Thus, the correct answer is B: coin purses. \nSo the final answer to this question is B: coin purses", "answer": "B: piggy bank"}
{"text": "1). This is a tricky question to answer as there are multiple places where one could play games; however, not all of which will be a viable option.\n2. To begin, we can eliminate some of the choices (that don't really make sense) pretty quickly. First, children do not typically play games at a casino, and toys do not typically live in bar. \n3. This leaves us with the following. If we look at option C, which is a casino, it does have games that children could (presumably) play. However, a casino seems like it wouldn't make a lot of sense, so we can cross it off the list. If we consider option A, a toy store, there are some toys that do make the cut. However, a toy store wouldn't typically be a place where kids could play games where there is a lot of interaction with other players. Instead, a toy store (likely) has many toys that kids cannot play with themselves but rather need adult assistance. \n4. Moving on, option E would seem to be a good fit. In a family room, kids usually playing games that involve at least some level of physical interaction or strategy with other people. A card game would qualify since it requires an opponent, and there are tons of board games that children could play together with their families. 5. This leaves us with 2 options to choose from \u2013 B and E. Because it's a game, E is still very likely to be correct. However, option B is the best choice. In a bar, there are lots of games that have people playing against one another that kids can partake in. If we look more closely at option E (family room), it is true that there are many strategic games kids can play along with their families, but the bar would most likely have more options to choose from if it were an option for us. \n6. With these considerations in mind, the best answer is B: bar.\nSo the final Answer is B: Bar\n\nInput: what doesn't a person drink from?

The chair is similarly not a good match because we know that the attache case can't be in a location that's constantly moving as that will interfere with the accessibility and durability of the case.\n    - D. The hospital is not acceptable either because attache cases aren't used to store surgical equipment.\n3. The remaining answers, E and C, are both viable options.

{"text": "1. The question is seeking a term that means something that the business provides to customers and which helps them to get the items they want straight to their doorstep with minimal effort required of them. \n2. Answer choices:  A: Mail orders - This is clearly the wrong answer choice because a mail order is one that the customer sends on to the business and does not involve 'things straight to the doorstep'. \n3. Choices B, C, and E: Demand satisfaction, Spend money and Pay merchants with money - These are all options which we can easily rule out from the question context. Demand satisfaction means addressing customer demands through products or services. Similarly, spend money and Pay merchands with money would also mean that the customer is having to put in more work to acquire what they want, since they are spending money to buy from merchants instead of things being shipped straight to them. \n4. Choice D: Place money on counter - This doesn't fit the bill for how the customer gets the items straight to their doorstep either because placing money on a counter would have the same effect as paying the merchant. Placing money on the counter doesn't mean there is any delivery to the customer's door from the merchant.\n5. Therefore, the answer choice is C: Cash on delivery. \nSo the final answer  is C: Cash ON Delivery\n\nInput:Which of these are not the same? Choices: 1. A: The first monthly payment is usually larger than subsequent payments. 2. B: The annual fee is larger than monthly payments. 3. C: The yearly interest rate is higher than the monthly interest rate. 4. D: Monthly repayment is larger than the yearly repayment. 5. E: More payments for short-term bonds.\nOutput:\n1. We can easily eliminate answer choices 1-4.\n2. Answer Choice E: More payments are definitely not the same as the other options, unless the wording is intentionally misleading.

Therefore, we can discard this option as well. \n4) We'll move on to the third choice, it has brown fur, however, this one could technically be considered a possibility.\n\n5) Again, the fourth choice, it is big, this does not accurately reflect the options we previously stated (such as brown fur.)

Choices:  a. plumber b. cowboy c. waiter d. farmer e. astronaut\nOutput: 1 & 2)  We know that none of the given list should be jobs for pigs.  \n3) When there is no mention of other animals at all, there is no way to know what they do and do not do. Therefore this is a red herring.\n4) The only job for a pig that has already been mentioned anywhere else is that of pig. So, the statement 'if you don't know about a job, a pig shouldn't be doing it' is invalid.\n5) This question is asking us to find an incorrect job choice. Therefore, we should find a job that doesn't fit well with the category of things that a pig does, as opposed to finding the only job that a pig does that is outside of the category.\n6) Therefore, the correct answer that is not a job for pig is a. plumber.\nSo the final answers are a & b, cowboy is not a job for the pig.\n\nInput:An old man gave a boy a job at his butcher shop.

{"text": "What this prompt is asking is where within the kitchen the cabinets would be installed. We have the following clues: \n1. That they \"look good\" is not really helpful information when one is asking where they might be installed in a kitchen, but it may be useful to figure out where they won't be installed.\n2. It's relevant that they were \"imported from the south\" - while this isn't explicitly stating that they are made of wood, in Mexico they are more likely to be made out of wood, rather than plastic or metal, as often happens in other places.\n3. Finally, it's relevant that they are \"containing pots and pans\". This describes them as being a place to put cooking utensils and food. It's not as if they are cabinets for storing non-cooking related items, such as toys or clothing.\n\n4. There are multiple answer options:\n    - A. The kitchen: Not a very likely option. We know they'll look good and will likely have a south-of-the-border feel. However, it's likely that a kitchen in the south of Mexico wouldn't have cabinets.\n    - B. The pantry: Seems like a likely option. Cabinets can fit quite well within a kitchen pantry.\n    - D - In a flight: This doesn't make sense.

{"text": "Here's a general approach to solving this question\n1. Let's first look at what we do know:\n    - The blowfish lives on his own\n     - This means that a blowfish can be by himself without company.\n     - Since he lives free, he doesn't have a set home and doesn't live with or in any type of community or living space with others of his species.\n2. We can then consider the options that make no sense:\n    - A. The blowfish lives on a fish market (fish in this context is referring to seafood, so he would live on a dock or something else not appropriate) \n    - B: Pet shop (not a logical option). This leaves us with C, D and E.\n3. Considering option D: river:\n    - This is definitely not the answer because the river is a water source, and it provides all kinds of fish and other aquatic species a home, and would contradict the notion of him not having a set home and living alone. \n\n4. Considering now E: Little Mermaid\n     - There's no real place where the entire plot of the little mermaid takes place, so let's not think of it as a place he lives\n    - We can also rule it out because blowfish aren't from the sea. \n\n5. This leaves us with option C: great outdoos:\n    - This matches the description given because in the wild, the blowfish would just freely swim and reside in the \"great outdoos\".

Some argue that birth is often overshadowed by gift-giving and holidays, but we know there is also a great deal of focus on presents, and these can be included under birth, making \"overpopulation\" out.\n3) Finally, we have \"fun\", which can be seen as a positive or negative experience; you can have fun with a child, but a majority of the time it is related directly to birth, making it out as the incorrect answer.\nThe correct option is D: Birth and new life.\nSo the final options are A & B  and they are A: overpopulation and B: Birth and new Life.\n\nInput:When people are in high places, what are they not doing?

{"text": "1 It is asked where a hole is compared to other things of different types in its environment, therefore there could be more than one thing it could be called.\n2 The first step is to eliminate some of the answers by looking at the question and the context of the story. A and B are unlikely answers as hills and gorges are physical features that involve more than just a hole.\n\n3 If we remove these two answers we are left with the answers C and E. At this point in the story, the context can be used to help us decide the answer. E is most likely to be the answer based on the context of the story because if Sam is trying to reach a location by getting over the plain then the hole he has found must be a mountain, as the other mountains he might travel near are not likely to be as tall or large. This is the context of the story after all, where Sam has to get over an obstacle so the question is referring to that situation and asking us to use the context to decide between the remaining answers. From what we understand, E is the best answer as the context of the story states that it has to be.\n\nSummary: If it doesn't make sense to use the context to answer the question then just ignore the context and the question may still be answered by eliminating answers.  If the answer doesn't make sense according to what you know and it seems like the context is meant to be applied to the answers and not the context then take the time to apply the context.\n\nInput: What do you call those cement pillars outside of most modern restaurants?

Out of all of them, C and V are not used when referring to a column or a slab.  A and D both have words with similar meanings to columns or beams, but the context in which they are usually found would indicate that these do not refer to concrete objects at the entrance to the restaurant, therefore we can eliminate them", "answer": "B: gorge"}

From here, we end up with either 'A', 'D', or 'E' to choose between. As we learn about the word 'artifact', we see that it only relates to objects.

Choices:  A a) one b) two c) three d) five e) four\nOutput: The question asks what kind of fruit would you find in a plastic or plum-shaped container.\n1. The prompt is asking what would be found in a plastic or prune-shaped container. The fact that it is a plastic prune, is very important to take note of.\n2. The answer choice that mentions a two is not viable, since that refers to the container having two plums inside. This does not jive with the prompt, as the container must have pruned plastic. So this answer is ruled out.\n3. Similarly, the one is not valid, due to the container having only one inside.\n4. The rest of the answer choices are simply wrong, since a four, three and five does not describe a single prune in a container, although this might be valid for an orange.\n5.

It could be a result of unhappiness or a feeling of isolation, but it could also be linked to any other emotion. There isn't any evidence in the question itself to know what sort of emotion the man was experiencing when he committed suicide.\n4: The phrase 'commit suicide' has nothing to do with happiness or unhappiness. Therefore, one of these could not be the main reason behind the lonely man's suicide.\n5: Since the answer is likely not related to anything that has to do with happiness or emotions, the only reasonable answer choice that remains is option C. \n6: Answer choice C is to avoid problems. This is a logical solution to the statement that the lonely man committed himself to the hospital and died shortly after.

{"text": "1) This is a question that asks you to find a place where stool legs can be built.\n2) The key here is to disregard any of the choices that have to do with furniture, or with making furniture, because we aren't looking for a place that has stools. The question says we're looking for a place where stool _legs_ can be built, not stools, themselves.\n3) All of the other answers seem like they could be places where stool legs could be built. However, upon careful consideration, they simply don't convey the sense that this would be the answer to the question at all. \n4) For example, building C isn't a place where you could go to build stool legs. It's a place where other types of building could occur.\n5) Similarly, we can dismiss options B, D, and E from consideration because they are all places related to furniture of some kind. \n6) This leaves us with option A: jail.\n7) In a jail, you could build the legs of a stools; if you've ever had a bar in the ground, you'll know that the legs are separate pieces of wood that can be attached to the bottom of the bar at the foot or footrest, and then secured or screwed together. This fits the criteria perfectly, meaning this is the correct answer to the question.\n8) So the correct answer is A, jail.\nSo the final and the correct answer is A.\n\nInput: Which would not be ideal if you wanted to get there quickly?

For most people, walking is not faster than walking if one is slow. This means it is not the correct answer", "answer": "C: blacksmith's shop"}

Let's analyze each of the answers individually based upon the context of the question.\n    - A: study philosophy. Studying philosophy is about the study of philosophical thought or an idea by philosophers rather than about learning philosophy. The student is not trying to study philosophy when they begin. Therefore, this can't be the correct response. \n    - B: become an adult. Students are not trying to become an adult at the very beginning of their education when they are children. \n    -  C: ask questions. This does seem like it might be appropriate. However, after asking a question, students are not necessarily trying to do anything else. Therefore, this is not the correct answer. \n    \u2013 D: further education. Students are not 'trying' to further their education at the beginning of their studies, but they are taking certain steps which will help them when they are further along in their education, such as taking classes and receiving a degree. \n    - E: study together. This doesn't quite fit. We're not even sure if it's meant to be plural (together) or singular (study), but either way, the answer isn't correct.\n5. What is it that students are trying to do at this very beginning of their education? We are trying to find what purpose they are starting off with \u2013 this makes sense. \n6. This narrows us down to choice D: Further education. We know that they are not asking questions to understand further education yet still, but instead we will say they are taking certain steps such as taking classes and getting a degree. \n7. This is a good interpretation of the question, so the correct answer is D: Further education.\nSo the final  answer is D: Further Education.", "answer": "D: further education"}

It simply requires you to find a location in the house where swords are stored, regardless of who owns it.\n2: This means we should eliminate answers that do not exist in houses since obviously you aren't going to find swords in a theatrical performance or in one's business since these do not exist in residential settings.\n3: To further narrow down the options, think about where you may find swords or a sword collection. You would likely encounter this in areas that are dedicated to storing weapons, such as sheaths or sword closets. \n4: Option C, the collection, and option E, the museum, are also unlikely places where you would be able to store your own swords. Therefore, exclude the options that are meant to describe where it's stored when not in use.\n5: All that's left are option A, sheath, or option B, the Sword closet. Of these, the closet will be your better bet because of the greater chance of an assortment of weapons being stored there.\n6: So the answer is B, the sword closet.\nFinal Answer: B: sword closet\n\nInput:When do you not need to be worried about your health?

We can immediately rule out D: pliers, as pliers are obviously not necessary to help a person stuck on the wall.\n2) Consider choice B: door. This may seem like an obvious answer, but this is the correct answer. This is because a door, unlike other items such as the mirror, can be opened to help remove a person stuck on the other side. \n3)Choice E: other tools may seem like a plausible answer. However, what if you were stuck on another side of the door? Then you wouldn't be able to use that door, would you?

A tower could be considered as tall buildings or tall castles.\n4.)Therefore we can eliminate the answer choices of: books, radio station, and a tower.\n5.)Looking at the word choice of'medieval castle,' James might actually have some old fashioned weapons and other items in the tower.

Not all of these locations involve walls. If Billy is bouncing the ball against a wall in the pool hall, then we could consider the location to be a pool table. \n    - B) Toy box \u2013 As one might expect from this description, this is not an appropriate answer because a toy box has toys, not a target. As such, the location cannot be a toy box.\n    - C) Playroom \u2013 Similar to a toy box, a playroom would have toys rather than a target to hit with a ball.\n    - D) Park - This may be a misleading answer because the question states that this is where Billy is bouncing his ball off the wall.

In fact, getting drunk isn't something anyone does before going to a particular activity. \n - D: having sex - It's unclear if this is something a person 'does before' going to a party because having sex could occur 'after' going to a party. Since the sentence has not specified anything related to 'after', we may assume the person is going to'sleep' before the party.

We must do our very best to complete the job.  We're doing one of the steps.  So in what order can it be completed? Choices: 1. A: Cut, B: Fasten2, C: Fasten1, D: Hang, E: Place\nOutput: The question asks in what order the various building steps can be completed to build a certain product.\n1. The question essentially states that building something in a sequence is more efficient than doing it in a particular arbitrary sequence. Thereby, it makes more sense to take a short cut and solve the problem in as few steps as it can be solved.\n2. To understand the right solution for this problem, consider the following:\n    - For step 1, we need to cut the material before we can actually use it to build whatever we're constructing. So the appropriate order is 1 >2.\n    - For steps 2 and 3 together, you would first need to attach the other side of the wood with the other side of the piece of wood which means that 2 and 3 belong in the same category and therefore 2 > 3. 3 > 1. 1 is the lowest possible value, so 3 > 1 gives C as the optimal answer.\n    - For step D or H, we need to do them last, and since we're already down to the final three steps, the last ones don't really matter", "answer": "E: produce"}

The first portion refers to 'ferrets' that are getting lots of attention. \n2) The choices:\n    - Trouser Leg (A): If a ferret was getting lots of attention, it likely won't be on a person's trouser leg. People are more likely to take them out of their pants when they're being attentive.\n    - Sick Bay (B): It's unlikely that a ferret will be found in a sick bay, or veterinary hospital. The same reason as above applies here as well. If a person was sick, they usually wouldn't have a ferret on their trouser leg. \n    - Own Home (C): This answer choice definitely doesn't make any sense either as a home isn't necessarily where people would want to carry around their pets.\n    - Petting Zoo (D): This option might sound like an interesting prospect, but it can't be correct as it's unlikely that they would be getting lots of attention if they were a ferret in a petting zoo.

It's quite clear that there's going to be a ferret mentioned since, in the prior step, it was confirmed to be getting lots of attention, and it's been alluded to that there are things on mother's hair. 4) So what could these ferrets be?

While some people might keep their bedroom door closed, others prefer an open door. Therefore, it'd be inaccurate to say that one would have to keep their bedroom door opened since they owned a new kitten.\n9) As for answer E, the door's staying locked was a deliberate decision.

The first choice, eating more healthy, sounds like it could, at face value, work, but the next choice, eating junk food, sounds like it would actually make someone less successful.\n3. This leaves us with the remaining two choices of the next choice and the last choice. \n4. So, the final answer to the question must be A: eating more healthy diet\nSo the final answer to the multiple choice question is A: eating more-healthy diet", "answer": "C: clerk"}
{"text": "1- The question is asking about a feeling that might motivate a person to take legal action of some kind. The options provided are meant to represent various feelings that might motivate such a reaction.\n2- Let's consider each option's implications carefully:\n    - A & B are irrelevant choices. Neither of these would be motivation enough to take legal action. Also, tiredness can only cause someone to institute civil action if it's the final straw on their back.\n    - C is the answer. Anger can indeed motivate legal action, for example, a lawsuit or any other type of action that is commonly initiated with feelings of anger. \n    - E and D are also wrong because they aren't necessarily feelings that might motivate a civil action. A court case itself can serve as motivation for taking legal action, but this would be a choice of action, and not a motivating emotion.\n3- To summarize the point, legal action, when it originates with someone, is most often caused by anger, which could be the right choice.\nSo the final and only answer is, anger.\n\nInput: What did the professor have a PhD in? Choices: 1. A: Psychology B: Physics C: Engineering D: Mathematics E: English\nOutput: 1 In an excerpt of a story, the professor has a PhD. Hence, the narrator tells us that the professor has a Doctor of Philosophy degree. Choice: D\n2 In terms of what type of degree, choice: D\n3 In terms of what subject, choice: A\n4 The professor of the story has a PhD in psychology\n5 Because the professor has a Ph.D., we can conclude that he is a professor (one who teaches). He's a professor for psychology.\n6 A Psychology professor is a person who specializes in Psychology. Because of the qualification of a PhD (Doctor of Philosophy), one who qualifies for a PhD degree has typically dedicated at least 5 to 10 years in specializing in a specific field of study, and hence has some experience in said field. Therefore, the professor would teach only his area of interest, hence psychology.\n7 Thus, we can now say that the professor is a Professor of Psychology\nInput: In which country was the game of baseball", "answer": "C: anger"}

Considering the four remaining options, we can:\n    - eliminate hardware store, since it specifically mentions fishing poles, and therefore can't be used to describe where one can buy a fishing pole.\n3. eliminate sporting goods store option, since it is definitely a store for a range of sporting goods, and selling fishing rods is not a specific focus in such stores.\n4. eliminate engine, since fishing rods are not engines \u2013 they're not mechanical devices designed to work on water, and it's not even specifically mentioning a fishing engine.\n5, eliminate furniture store, since it could very likely sell other kinds of fishing rods. In fact, a fishing rod is probably used as a part of doing fishing, rather than being bought to be put up on the wall or used as a lamp shade.\n6. eliminate fishing camp, since it is a place to rent fishing devices, and to sell fishing devices is not an exclusive focus of the camp.\n7. There's only one option remaining, hardware store, since it can sell fishing poles specifically, and could very well be where you would buy a fishing rod since no further information is given in the prompt.\n8.

We can also eliminate option B because this option would contradict the statement that baggage handlers say they are always late.\n2. We can still eliminate option C because John does not say that the baggage handlers are always late. \n3.

One can have fun playing cards by other activities.\n5 E: win money is not the correct answer either because it does not apply to the entire family.

Hence, this is also wrong.\n3 Have more sense of taste and smell \u2013 This option cannot be the answer because even people without blue eyes have a sense of taste and smelling.\n4 Can hear better \u2013 This option also cannot be the correct answer because even people who are not colour blind can also hear better.

One could have a \"sad time\" afterward as well, and this choice is not applicable to the question as worded.\n    - (C) - \"Sad\" is a strong word and we are looking for a comparable word, so this is a viable option.\n    - (D) - Similarly, \"bad time\" is not too strong, and \"sadness\" could work as a comparator.\n    - (E) - \"Sadness\" doesn't make sense because a \"bad time\" could mean an unhappy occurrence, while \"playtime\" would refer to fun activities.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: sadness.\n\nInput:What has 8 balls and 4 legs?

Therefore if \"and\" is present, we can expect the ball count from the previous item to continue into the question such that the answer contains eight balls. Additionally, we know that the answer has (at least) four legs.\n\n(B): We are already aware of C, so we can quickly rule that out.

{"text": "1) The question is about selecting an option that is one of the many activities that animals do that John is watching them do. For example, John wants to observe what animals are doing on their own time, such as sleeping, eating, etc.\n2) When the question asks for something animals do that John is observing (bite, copulate, etc.), the options are not mutually exclusive. For instance, animals can bathe both before and after eating. In other words, there are overlapping events (bathing) which can be selected when the choice is 'how many of these can be used to describe what John is watching?'\n3) Let's look a little closer at the choice D, obesity, and whether it could be one of the many things John is observing on a day to day basis:\n    - Some animals are quite obese, such as Pigs for example, but some animals do not have the possibility for obesity. For instance, alligators, which John is likely watching, are more likely to die from exposure to sunlight, toxins in ponds to name a few.\n    - Some animals which have the possibility for obseity (such as a dog) aren't necessarily obese (hence, not in John's line of sight). Additionally, these animals may only acquire additional body mass sometimes, if at all.\n    - All animals are capable of acquiring body mass, including from a simple binge of food (in fact, this is called \"pig-out\" in this case). Therefore, an animal can become obese, if at all, without John observing it. Hence, the option D, obesity is not correct.\nSo, now we know the answer is C: die of cancer", "answer": "E: copulate"}

However, this is a bit tricky because police officers *usually* help people! Therefore, the correct answer that will satisfy this question has to describe a type of police who doesn't do the very common thing that police typically do to help people.\n3) Answer A: direct traffic. According to the question stem, 'only some types of police do....' and policemen typically *direct* traffic, so no one could deny that they do this. However, this also contradicts the definition of the word'some', which is to refer to a portion of a group. Therefore the correct answer must be D: 'find drugs'.

A. drink station B. beef C. bar D. tipple E. fuddle\nOutput (1): There's two things to think about going into the question -  **What is the literal definition of each answer and what's the common phrasing of that answer?.** \n\nFor common phrasing first, Watering hole doesn't quite fit the context of our problem statement as we're looking for someone to get a drink and beer. \nBut in the general sense of saying someone goes to a local pub to get coffee - you could say, you went to the bar. But when we are looking for what's most frequently used in this context, Watering Hole doesn't seem to have the most weight behind it.  \n\nThe second factor to consider is the literal definition. Again, when you say, a. watering hole, it's more likely there's a literal watering hole than it is a drinking hole. So we're left with this option as the more literal answer. \n\nSo if we combine the two together watering hole is the obvious answer even though one could interpret \"beverage\" as something stronger.\n\nFor the second answer, the common phrase 'drink station' is not the most commonly used phrase in this context, so E doesn't fit. \n\nNeither do A and D, as I've never heard either of them being used", "answer": "A: perfume"}
{"text": "1) The question is about what a person who wants to get good grades would do.\n2) For each answer choice, we need to consider whether the described actions would be in the context of acquiring good grades. \n3) For choice B, try to learn has to do with acquiring new knowledge, which would be indirectly related to acquiring good grades via your success in courses. However, this doesn't describe what the person would do to get high grades, so we can rule it out.\n4) For choice C, the need for assistance is an action, similar to the ones you would take to get high grades. Therefore, option C can be eliminated.\n5) For choice D, this choice is incorrect because the gratitude would be for the high grades, not for the learning process.\n6) For option E, this is an action that involves acquiring knowledge or information through reading. So, in context with this question, we can again exclude this choice and consider options A, C, and D.\n7) Let's look at each answer choice to see which one is most accurate with regards to how a person would get good grades.\n    - A: feel proud \u2013 This is definitely a feeling. If you feel proud, you will probably not have a specific action or method in mind for acquiring good grades in a course.

However, a person could call themselves a captive monkey to be sarcastic, so just because a person is in a zoo, doesn't mean they are captive.\n    - E = great outdoors \u2013 The question is asking where you'll find a monkey 'captured', so you shouldn't be finding monkeys in the great outdoors. \n3.

How is this different from the previous situation? Choices:  B: it's a deal. C: bc you don't give it up. D: you lose a bet. E: all of these are reasonable.\nOutput: 1. There is a time difference here. If you have your car breakdown and you get a service to fix it, they are going to make you give over your money before fixing it. There is no deal involved here. You pay them first and they fix it.\n2. If both situations ended up in a tie, then you would say that they were all reasonable to do. But that's not what's going on. One situation ended with the person just calling for help. The other one involved money changing hands. So these two can't be in a tie.\n3.

We need to consider each possible answer choice: \n    - A: have tv \u2013 Although the answer might seem obvious as the question requires us to think of something that can help someone sit down, have tv has no relation whatsoever to being able to sit down. Instead, TV is a set of actions that can allow a person to relax and have a break from sitting down or doing something else. \n    - B: fall asleep \u2013 We can't assume that this is the right answer either because it is possible to fall asleep while not being in the sitting position. Falling asleep is the action of transitioning through different states of sleep so a person might fall asleep while lying down or even while standing up. It's also possible to fall asleep in different positions like on a couch or on your cell phone too.\n    - C: learn \u2013 The answer can't be learn here because while it might be true that learning something can allow a person to sit down, this requires a large effort of work and not something one might naturally do to sit down. \n    - E: dancing \u2013 The answer can' be dancing because firstly, there is no logical connection between learning to do something and doing it.

Let's consider the answers one by one:\n    - C: Shop \u2013 In the context of a radio, this is not likely because people typically don't go to shops to buy electronics like radios. They're more likely to purchase electronics at online stores.\n    - D: Bedroom \u2013 Not everyone has a radio in their bedroom or owns one, so it doesn't seem like an appropriate answer. \n    This leaves us with answer choice B.

In this case, there are options that are more general and others that are more specific to the project manager's goals.\n    - A: greedy - While it's true that a project manager doesn't want someone who is greedy on their team, this isn't really what the question is asking for. Greediness is not a quality a person brings to a project manager but a quality they have in general that might affect their performance.\n    - B and E: boss and have knowledge \u2013 These may be good qualities to have on the team, but are also not specific to a project manager.\n3. Among the remaining options, there's still some ambiguity about whether the project manager needs more specific requirements for the position or just needs a simple answer to the question.\n      - D: worry \u2013 This is a clear contradiction of the question and an incorrect answer. \n    A project manager needs to be calm and composed, not worried.\n4. With this in mind, consider answer choice C: take charge.\n    - This is the only direct answer to what the manager is looking for: someone with the knowledge and skills needed to get the project done.\n    - Therefore, we can answer the question accurately as D: take charge.\nSo the final answers are C: take charge\n\nInput: What can a manager who is in charge of an employee who is very good at their job do?

As such, the manager is looking for the ideal response to the situation at hand.\n2) We can rule out options D & F. The employee is a star at their position and a firing or taking a day off would be detrimental to them and the company.

Therefore, these options cannot be the best choice.\n3) The remaining answers should", "answer": "C: have knowledge"}
{"text": "-1. This question is about someone processing wool, and keeping their leg bouncing as they process wool. \n -2. The question states that wool is being processed, which means it's coming untangled and becoming strands of wool that can be made into fabric. There is not a wool processor I know of that sits at their spinning wheel bouncing their leg in order to process wool. It's more accurate to say that they are bouncing their leg when they are not processing the wool.\n -3. Legroom does not have to do with processing wool, and the question is not asking about anything relating to space.\n -4. The spinning wheel isn't being used to process wool, so it doesn't follow that it is being bounced when wool is being processed.\n -5. The type of music played at a grand piano is not relevant to the processing of wool because the question wasn't explicitly referring to grand piano music.\n -6. Finally, the rhythm that you'd be bouncing your leg to while processing wool would be a tempo, not a rhythm. Rhythm refers to the beats or sequences of beats in music or in general. \n -7.

B: This would be an answer choice if the question asked what the opposite of 'Africa' is, but as the question asks for the opposite of a village, the opposite of a village would be a city.\n3. C: This answer choice fits as an answer as well because a village is a small town or rural region, whereas 'Ohio' would be the opposite of that.\n4. D: This answer choice does not work because 'big cities' would not be the opposite of a village but rather would most likely be the opposite of small towns or rural regions. \n5.

Home depot is not an option either because a man would not likely purchase something that large in a place where flooring is sold for homes. Home depot sells for home repairs, and flooring isn't a repair. It's a change. The man is changing what he currently has, so home depot isn't an appropriate place to be looking. \n    -D: tiles \u2013 This is an incorrect answer because it doesn't state an actual type of flooring.

This is where we ask ourselves what is typically capable of increasing humidity levels in the ambient air?\n    - A: humidifier isn't the correct option because it increases the relative humidity by evaporating a water solution.\n    - B & E: The answers mentioning 'water' aren't useful because you can only use them to add water to the air. You can't use them to get rid of water vapor.\n    - C: This seems unlikely. \n3. The answer seems to be D: ice cube because the ice can evaporate into smaller water droplets over time and increase the relative humidity.\n    - However, the skating rink and surface of the earth are just incorrect.\nSo the final the answer is D: ice cube\n\nInput: Which of these is an example of a meme?

{"text": "1, Since the question asks why one would want to exercise, the only choice that can be picked would be an option that suggests a good reason for starting an exercise regime, for example, 'losing weight,' 'tiredness,' 'fatigue,' or'muscle weakness.'\n2. The first choice is'relaxation,' which cannot be picked because while we all need to relax every now and then, this cannot be a reason to start an exercise program.\n3. Choice C 'tiredness' refers to the feeling of being tired as opposed to being fatigued or weak all the time, which is also not a reason to exercise.  \n\nThe second option has a clear mention of working or exercising when you're tired, rather than always tired. That is why choice B'relaxation' cannot be chosen as an answer.\n4. In the same vein, the fourth option, choice E 'losing weight,' states that you exercise to try and lose weight, not to stay thin (though that may be a side effect). This makes the choice a perfect answer because exercising is clearly a means, not an end. \n5. Choice D'muscle weakness' is also correct because exercising works to strengthen the muscles as well as improve your overall health \n6. So, the correct answer is E: losing weight.  \n  \nSo the final answer would be E: losing weight\n\nInput: The best part about being around others is when you don't get to interact with them.

I've deciphered it to mean that you'll be going into detail by providing examples and explaining the reasoning behind your answer.\n3. The question is looking for the appropriate type of fishing or body of water that's mentioned within the choices.\n4. Looking at each answer choice, you can quickly rule them out if they don't seem like a likely fit:\na) Pond: It's not clear to me what the \"greatest\" refers to, but it sure doesn't seem that a pond would be \"greatest\" of anything if ice fishing. There are many lakes and rivers that are greater than a pond. Therefore, this answer choice can be discarded.\nb) Aquarium: The reason why this choice could be correct has to do with the fact that sometimes aquariums contain fishes from a \"great\" body of water. However, it's pretty evident that a \"great\" aquarium doesn't mean the aquarium or tank alone is a great body of water. If you had, for example, the Chesapeake Bay in an aquarium, that would never qualify as a \"great\" of the chesapeake bay. In the end, this answer choice may be slightly helpful but is definitely not enough to be the correct choice.\nc) Lake superior: This choice clearly isn't what we want, given that the question states that we're fishing \"far out\" from Lake superior. Therefore, this isn't a suitable solution.\nd) Body of water: This answer choice refers to a large body of water that can't be further out than any other large body of water. But since one could fish \"far out\" in most bodies of water, this is not enough of a hint to provide as the correct answer.\n5. Therefore, choice E can be discarded as well. This leaves us with C: aquarium and D: lake superior as potential answers.\n6. When looking at the context of the paragraph, it's pretty clear that the question is referring to lakes within Michigan, and that there must be some place that allows ice fishing to be conducted \"far out\" from most lakes.\n7. This means that the only two remaining choices are", "answer": "D: lake superior"}

This choice could be correct. \n5) For Choice D \u2013 the \u2018space shuttle\u2019 \u2013 this choice could not be correct since the smell could not be coming from the space shuttle. \n6) Choice E \u2013 'the surface of earth' \u2013could mean different things.

Record store (C) \u2013 We are looking for a store that sells a lot of listening vinyl and by implication, record albums so that it is likely a place where one could purchase listening vinyl. \n5. This option is therefore the correct one but has already been suggested. \n6. Record albums (B) \u2013 This has already been suggested as well. \n7. This leaves us with three options: Safeway (A), Car (D), and Wallpaper (E). \n8. The listener is presumably looking for a vinyl, to listen to it, and then they would have to play the vinyl in a record player, so this leaves our options as either a place to purchase the vinyl or listen to a vinyl (A, D). \n9. A safeway is also a place a person might get vinyl, since all stores carry vinyls now, but as such it's not very likely that the listener would be getting their listening vinyl from this place, especially when you consider that a safeway doesn't have a huge variety of listening vinyl.  So we can eliminate option A.\n10. Next, we'll be looking at options D and E. The listener will play their listening vinyl in a record, so the listening vinyl could have been purchased in a record store, option C, or could have originated from wallpaper in the Car, option E.

The question is not asking about what the purpose of the cabin is while the plane is flying, but rather is asking about the primary purpose of the cabin in the event of a crash.\n3. So we can consider each answer:\n    - A \u2013 there is no purpose of the cabin in crash as it can just cause it to be unstable and fall into the crash.\n    - B - the cabin is used as a living space on the plane, although it is more comfortable than the typical economy class seats, it is not the primary purpose.\n    - C - it cannot be the primary purpose because it is not needed to slow down in case of emergencies.\n    - D - the cabin is used to carry people, but this is not its primary purpose.\n    \u2013 E - this is not a primary purpose, as it would make the plane faster and the passengers would die.\n4.

Choice C, classroom, is not the correct answer as classroom may refer to an actual classroom, which already has a binder. Furthermore, if a person wishes to buy a binder and is simply not in a classroom, they won't be looking for a classroom to buy a binder from. \n4. Choice E, office supply store, is the correct answer for this question as it's a place you'd go if you want to buy a binder.

Furthermore, the answer should more explicitly mention playing or exercise.\n    -C: kept in stables \u2013 Horses can't digest too much hay, so they are placed in stables so they eat less hay, thus lessening their risk of colic. Horses are fed hay so they don't die of starvation. So being kept in stables isn't related to horses getting energy.\n    -D: dominated \u2013Horses get their name from the PIE root 'kwo', which was later dominated to become horse.

Therefore, this doesn't match what the question is asking for.\n    - B \u2013 For a bus station, it can be convenient to be on a street where people can catch up with the bus. Hence, the street is a good choice of an answer. However, the question is asking us to identify the best place for a bus stop, not the most useful or handy place for it. So, we rule this as incorrect.\n    - C \u2013 Like the street, catch bus can also be a convenient option for bus commuters.\n    - D \u2013 In general, the city centre is a good place to catch public transportation. It is convenient because most people are already in the city centre for other reasons. However, this is again not the best place to set up the bus station. There are better options that offer more potential for ridership.\n    - E \u2013 School is not directly relevant to the question and also isn't a convenient place to catch the bus. A bus station is not typically placed in a school building.\n4. Therefore, the correct answer is B: street. \nSo the final answer to the question is B: street\n\nInput: How can you tell if you will win a football game when your team is getting ready to play? Choices: \n A: watch them practice\n B: see how they feel\n C: look at their mood\n D: consider their play\n E: watch their performance\n Output: The question is asking about how one would know if their football team is going to win the game when they play. So we need to figure out what an effective indicator of victory would be.\n1. There are a few different actions one can take to identify if they", "answer": "D: city centre"}

{"text": "1) The question requires the user to identify what papers one might hold together, meaning that the object they are holding together is not the paper itself, but some sort of other entity. The answer choices do not indicate what the object is, meaning that some answer options are correct (ones which name the object being held together) and some answer choices are not correct (ones which list the object itself).\n2) Consider each answer option:\n    - A. Tighten. One cannot \u2018hold\u2019 something by \u2018tightening\u2019 it. \u2018Tightening\u2019 can be used to hold an object together temporarily by applying pressure (such as in screwing a screw into a board).\n    - B.

One binds a book of loose papers together to hold them together. We do not hold a book \u2018bound\u2019 together.\n    - D. Faithful. Although this is true, it does not answer the question.\n    - E. Compact. One compacts a book by binding the pages and encasing them within the book\u2019s cover. We do not compact a book in the same way as we \u2018pack\u2019 other loose items.\n\n3) With these considerations, it is clear that the only answer choice that answers the question correctly is A: tighten.\n\nSo the final answer are A: tighten\n\nInput: How do we distinguish between a 'person' and a 'peoples'? Choices:\nA: one belongs to it B: one is the whole C: one person is the whole\nOutput: As we go over the choices and eliminate all false information, it will become possible to distinguish between a 'person', and the 'people'.\nConsidering each answer choice:\n\\- A: the whole is not it. This is incorrect as the word \"peoples\" is a plural of the word \"peopled\".\n\\- B: the person is not the people. This is an incorrect answer as a person could be the people if the whole group consists of 1 person.\n\\- C: The person is not the whole. This is incorrect as it simply states there is just the one person in that group.\nThe answer to the question is C: the one person is", "answer": "C: bound"}
{"text": "1.) Let's consider each choice: \na. A: obtaining information - While all of the other choices are valid answers, this is incorrect because \"obtaining information\" is about something that you have done in the past, but it does not define what a person is doing when their brainstorming. Moreover, the sentence states that there was a lot of \"the talking\" as opposed to \"obtaining\" information. \"Obtaining\" would require you to have already done the action to some extent, whereas the question is asking you what a person is doing right now.\nb. B: exchange of ideas - This choice is correct because the verb \"exchanging\" already describes what a person is doing. \nc. C: sharing information - While we discussed the previous choice, this one, although more technically correct, tends to include the extra phrase \"within the ideas\", which is the exact thing not stated in the sentence which could lead to confusion.\nd. D: conversation - This answer contains the extra phrase of \"among themselves\". As with the previous option, this could lead to confusion, and even though the choice is technically correct, it is not what we are looking for in the sentence in its entirety.\ne. E: gathering of information - This is the grammatically correct choice because the verb \"gathering\" describes what you are doing in the present tense, and it matches the phrases \"there was a lot of talking\" already stated in the sentence, as well as the lack of \"in\" in the sentence to describe \"gathering\" as an action. \n2. As can be seen from the above, the final answer is E:gathering of information.So the final answer is E-gathering of information\n\nInput:What is one of the primary things an ejected piece of land is missing?

Let's try to answer each choice one by one\n\na. Zoo choice: The zoo is an institution in which animals are kept for display and usually for human recreation and/or education. In New York City, there are two zoos, both located in different places, so we can eliminate this choice. \"A human and an animal can be both in the same location\"\n\nb. Workplace choice: A workplace is a place in which people work, usually as an ongoing, long-term activity. One cannot see animals in the workplace as they would be busy working. \"A human and/or an animal may be working in the same location OR may not be working in the same area\"\n\nc. Sky choice: In this question, the sky is considered not a place where animals could be seen. It's not stated but we can assume that the sky is always above, so it'll always be further up compared to the place in which the human can find a place for animals to be seen. So by implication, animals cannot be seen in the sky, but only in the sky's lower region where it meets the ground (this is assuming that animals can stand on the ground). We can therefore eliminate this choice\n\nd. Sky choice: New York is an example of a large northeast city that could have animals in the city.\n\ne. Sky choice: Many places is not an option for the question posed. At best it would mean that many places in the sky can be seen, but by previous implication this is not feasible. The sky must be more specific for a place to have animals be seen there. There are probably many places in NY that can have animals visible, so we can safely eliminate this choice.\n\nConclusion: This means that the answer must always be NY (New York), so the correct answer is A (option B)\n\nInput: When an object is placed in water, what happens to both the body mass and density of the object as it is submerged?", "answer": "A: zoo"}

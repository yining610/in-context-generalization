Choices: \nA: racket\nB: stick\nC: paddle\nD: club\nE: sword\nOutput: E: sword\n\n### What I Learned:\n1. When given an input, it is a good idea to make sure if that input is even sensible or not.  \n2. When given an output, I should start by eliminating possible outputs, such as if a multiple choice question had more than one possible output, I'm should look at the possible choices to start the process of elimination,  and if an output is a single choice, make sure to think of every single word that fits for that choice. \n\n### Challenges Faced:\n1. When a question isn\u2019t even sensible, it\u2019s hard to think of ways to eliminate choices, and in this case I wasn\u2019t able to think of any other way to eliminate choices that fit the answers or to eliminate choices that do not fit the answers.  \n\n2. When the question was given as a single choice, I found some difficulty distinguishing the words so that made it difficult to make a choice.  \n\n3. When the question was long, I had some trouble understanding the question, such as \u201cWhat might this lead to? \u201d I had trouble understanding that question.\n\n4. When giving a question, consider making it shorter so that you're able to make it more easy for people to read.\n\n5. \n\n## How To Improve:\n\n1. Don\u2019t use such long sentences and make each question shorter because it made it difficult because of all the information, and when you think of it, its easier to put information in shorter sentences rather than long sentences.\n\n2. Instead of making long questions, making each question more simple to read is key not only it is easier to read but it won\u2019t confuse the person reading the question as much.\n\n3. To better get people not confused about a question, break down what it is about and give an example to show what the question is talking about.", "answer": "E: erections"}

What can be a problem is when humans don\u2019t know whether the questions they are asking are actually what people need to answer.\n\nWhen designing survey questions, you should consider more than just the type of question you are asking. It might be more appropriate to ask a different question, or to ask a question with alternative answers that can provide more useful insights. You\u2019ll sometimes find that even the words you use may cause confusion.\n\nFor example, if your question is \u2018What kind of breathing makes a lot of noise?\u2019 the obvious answer might be \u2018a cough\u2019. However, the question may have more to do with whether the answerer is healthy, rather than whether they are making an unusual noise.\n\nTo help, it is a good idea to use as much background information as you can when designing survey questions. Try to figure out what types of words might be associated with the question\u2019s topic. Is there another way people might refer to the topic? Can you write the question, or part of it, in a slightly different way? You might even try asking a completely different question and see what responses you get.", "answer": "A: sit down"}

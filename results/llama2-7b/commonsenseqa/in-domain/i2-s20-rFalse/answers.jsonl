Your program should find all the sentences, print them out, and then for each sentence, indicate in a newline after each word exactly how you would correct each mistake. \n\nFor example:\n\nThis would go under \"Punctuation: Wrong word(s) use.\" \n\nExample sentence: \"I have seen a need for an invention like this for some time, although it hasnt been until i \nread the book (in 1482) i \nthought the idea could actually work...\"\n\nHere is how you need to change it: \n1. Put a comma after \"book.\"\n\n2. Add \"and\" to \"i thought.\"\n\nYour program must take in a string of text and print the output after each word of each sentence in standard output. The sentences can also have punctuation errors.\n\nThe input sentence will always start with \\\"There is one or more mistakes in the following:\\\" with the input of sentences underneath.\n\nFor example: There is one or more mistakes on the following sentences:\"I have seen a need of an invention like this some time, although it hasn't been until i read the book (in 2018) i thought the idea could work\".\"I have seen a need but until I read the book, I \ndidn't know that I would really love the idea.\"\n\n--- Part Three ---\n\nWrite a program that takes words from standard input.

Then we could generate all the possible words formed with this input I.\n\nNow, suppose 'I' is being taken as a stem and all other characters are being taken as prefixes, suffixes or some other characters. Hence I could lead to be 'iaq' and I could be 'lq'. So, there are lots of variations that could fit in 'I', for example in the given example there are 6 possible words that we can construct with the given input 'I'. I'll construct all the possible words from each input and then use the 'Naive Bayes' classifier to predict whether the input is acceptable or not acceptable. Because 'Naive Bayes', it is quite fast and very efficient for classification problems.\n\nHere I have tried to implement it in Python. To use 'Naive Bayes Classifier' I have first pre-processed the data with 'TextBlob' library which is python based library and then I have", "answer": "B: movies"}

You can define as many levels of parameters in methods that you want but most of the time you should try to simplify problems.\n\nA recursion function is called when its object is a number. In our case, `this` is a number. `this.toLowerCase` takes a number and returns the number after applying the function on all its characters in lower case.\n\nFor example:\n\n**`machine('car')` returns 'a'`**\n\n**`machine(5)` returns [string 5]`\n\n**`machine` takes in a numerical argument in the start so our base case does not need a return statement.**\n\n### Question:\n\nWhat type of object is `this` (i.e. is this a number, a string, or else)? **Answer", "answer": "E: shopping center"}

As we look for each string we have to keep a position counter in which we check if the current substring is found. If it isn't found, the current substring is inserted into the word array and start searching for the next greater substring. If we find it we break out and continue searching the next substring.\nThe time complexity is O(m).\n\n### Solution for solution1\n\nThis is a solution for Codeforces.\n\nIt is very similar to the solution for Java as it consists of a KMP algorithm for strings. Our algorithm contains a class word which contains the type string, a position counter and a word_counter. We have to do the same thing for the codeforces code. There is an array of words w and we have to sort and find the greatest substring. If the current substring is not found or is not in the words[] we must insert it. The algorithm works in a way that as we check every letter in the substrings, we have to check the positions for the previous letters. In the words[] we sort them and we iterate over them. At every iteration we find if the substring in the w array contains the previous substring in the current position. If we don't", "answer": "B: louisiana"}

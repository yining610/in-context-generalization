As we look for each string we have to keep a position counter in which we check if the current substring is found. If it isn't found, the current substring is inserted into the word array and start searching for the next greater substring. If we find it we break out and continue searching the next substring.<n>The time complexity is O(m).<n><n>### Solution for solution1<n><n>This is a solution for Codeforces.<n><n>It is very similar to the solution for Java as it consists of a KMP algorithm for strings. Our algorithm contains a class word which contains the type string, a position counter and a word_counter. We have to do the same thing for the codeforces code. There is an array of words w and we have to sort and find the greatest substring. If the current substring is not found or is not in the words[] we must insert it. The algorithm works in a way that as we check every letter in the substrings, we have to check the positions for the previous letters. In the words[] we sort them and we iterate over them. At every iteration we find if the substring in the w array contains the previous substring in the current position. If we don't

One of the easiest ways to crack a test is to memorize the correct answers (e.g. 1) for everything and the ones that are frequently asked, so that you can quickly get an intuitive feeling as if this is something we should know, right? This is definitely not an optimal solution.\nIf we approach this problem in a different way and try not to memorize anything (except perhaps the test questions) we may get to a more optimal way of studying. One strategy may be to:\n\n- Read the questions and ask: For what kind of person do I need to spend time learning this.\n- Look at the options.\n\n   This is not the time to memorize them, but the time to see which of the statements may be true based on the input. It can't be true (2) if it's not in the input, so that's not an option. Maybe A is true (if it's given as table and there is a table for example. If it mentions a table, but not a restaurant, then it can't", "answer": "C: argument"}

This is probably my most hated part. I'll start by walking through the steps to what I thought was right. Then, I'll post the final solution.\n\nI first solved the first 4 questions with a while loop. I would loop through a couple conditions, checking for a set string and a specific number of choices in the list.\n\nWhile loop:\n\n![While Loop.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d5npxg92kzlqwoy/While%20Loop.png?dl=0 \"While Loop\")\n\nOnce I got that to work, I used OOP to make that solution more maintainable. The first issue I noticed from that solution was I forgot to update the test cases. I was missing a way to check for the next question.

The code was too long and I was checking for a lot of things, so it wasn't as clean as I wanted. I saw that another person created a test case program, which allows me to test specific tests to confirm my code is right.\n\nI tried making use of the second set of questions to loop through all of my tests. I wasn't able to get any of it working correctly.\n\n![Test Questions Program](https://www.dropBox.com/s/y4m17z5g44j19b3/Test%20Program.png?dl=1 \"Test Program\")\n\nI thought that by creating a `TestCasesClass` and having that `TestAnswers` be the answer and solution for each question I could run through each test program in order and compare it against my solution.\n\nI then used OOP to create a `SolutionClass` that handles the", "answer": "C: change yourself"}

Characters: G. Penn K. Hudson R. Downey J. Fox M. Stoltz\nOutput: G. Penn\n\n\n## Solution:\nMy thoughts:\nFirst, the multiple choice question is a common sense question and I think there would be better questions for this challenge.\n\nFor the next question, I think a simple method is to find 'include examples' and remove 'in school' and 'prove their point'. Then replace include with example:\n\n```\nfor example\n```\n\nFor the last question, my first thought was to find a simple rule for the questions, such as one of the questions has \"a vase in a restaurant\". But it's too hard for me to find more information about the character, so I will take another shot at it as to find something from the question:\n\n```\n'A Golden Globe for the best performance by an actor'.\n```\n\nSo I replace the keyword for 'best', then the next keyword is the name of the actor. After this:\n\n```\nBest actor:\n```\n\nThis is the sentence with the same pronouns, for examples:\n\n```\nM J. Fox\nM Stoltz\nG Penn\nK Hudson\nR Downey\n```\n\nSo now it's the time to try to figure out the name of the actor;\nIn the end, if there are two characters (M and J) in the same sentence, then the second character is the correct choice.\n\nIf you wanna try it, you can try the following command:\n\n```\nvim test.py\npython my_parser.py\n```", "answer": "A: redemption"}

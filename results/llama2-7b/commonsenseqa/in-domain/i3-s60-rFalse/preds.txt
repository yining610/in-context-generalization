This is probably my most hated part. I'll start by walking through the steps to what I thought was right. Then, I'll post the final solution.<n><n>I first solved the first 4 questions with a while loop.

The first issue I noticed from that solution was I forgot to update the test cases. I was missing a way to check for the next question. Instead, I created a second set of questions, where the set of choices for the first set were the choices for my second set.<n><n>I was still running into problems. The code was too long and I was checking for a lot of things, so it wasn't as clean as I wanted. I saw that another person created a test case program, which allows me to test specific tests to confirm my code is right.<n><n>I tried making use of the second set of questions to loop through all of my tests.

Characters: G. Penn K. Hudson R. Downey J. Fox M. Stoltz<n>Output: G. Penn<n><n><n>## Solution:<n>My thoughts:<n>First, the multiple choice question is a common sense question and I think there would be better questions for this challenge.<n><n>For the next question, I think a simple method is to find 'include examples' and remove 'in school' and 'prove their point'. Then replace include with example:<n><n>```<n>for example<n>```<n><n>For the last question, my first thought was to find a simple rule for the questions, such as one of the questions has "a vase in a restaurant". But it's too hard for me to find more information about the character, so I will take another shot at it as to find something from the question:<n><n>```<n>'A Golden Globe for the best performance by an actor'.<n>```<n><n>So I replace the keyword for 'best', then the next keyword is the name of the actor. After this:<n><n>```<n>Best actor:<n>```<n><n>This is the sentence with the same pronouns, for examples:<n><n>```<n>M J. Fox<n>M Stoltz<n>G Penn<n>K Hudson<n>R Downey<n>```<n><n>So now it's the time to try to figure out the name of the actor;<n>In the end, if there are two characters (M and J) in the same sentence, then the second character is the correct choice.<n><n>If you wanna try it, you can try the following command:<n><n>```<n>vim test.py<n>python my_parser.py<n>```

He called the parents of the missing students to find out what they were hiding from him. One of the missing students said that he was going to the zoo. As expected, his mother said that he was at home. A second missing student said that he was at school. As anticipated, his father told the teacher that his son was home in bed. Another missing student also mentioned that he was at school while his father told the teacher he was home. The teacher asked about the students who had not been seen in class and when their parents would return them. But the parents kept giving different reasons as to why the students were unable to attend class. In the end, the teacher did not believe the reason that they were giving him. After checking for themselves, they found their children at a restaurant. When the teacher confronted the students they gave an explanation. But they did not have time to finish their explanation.

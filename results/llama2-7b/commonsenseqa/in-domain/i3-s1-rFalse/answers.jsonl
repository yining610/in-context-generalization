The returned value of `abs(d)` is the **absolute value** of the `number d`. This function returns the *same number to what I pass as argument*. If I execute the code `abs(-7)` it will not return 7, rather it will return -7 as the absolute value of 7 is -7. If I pass an integer as argument, it will return only the integer and will not contain any decimal.\n\n```py\n\na = abs(-3.5) #3.5 is of type float and hence its absolute value is 3\n\nprint(a)\n\nb = abs(-3.9) #(-3.9) is of type float so the absolute value of (-3.9) is -3.9\n\nprint(b)\n```\n---\n\n### Instructions: This question has multiple choice questions:\n1. Given your answer, give two examples where 0/1 is a valid answer. (If not, leave this out.)\n\n    - 0 for my age\n    - 0 when I am not hungry\n\n2. Given your answer, can you think of any more questions about it that begin with: what is not?\n\n    - \n\n\n\n```py\nprint(3/0)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Question:\nGiven the code `1-2` What will this do? This question is about a single statement that has multiple values and if we divide by any of those single statement, what would it return?\n\nOutput: 0.5\n\nThis would divide and return a float value. \n\n\n```py \n1-2/1\n```\n\n--- \n\n### Instructtion:Answer the question below with a single-line statement.\nCan you think of a different example?

What we do is, we scan the text on each test question and replace each input character for the one that matches the one in the corresponding answer choice. \nWe use a string variable for storing the entire text. Using a dictionary, we scan the text and find the index of each character. For the index in the answer choice we insert the one we are looking for. \n\nThe program takes input from the user and then uses a while loop that iterates through all the test questions and outputs the answers. \n\n\n##### Program logic:\nThe program uses a while loop that checks the input length in the question. After each test we replace each character with the corresponding answer choice character. At the end we output the sentence with the answer. \n\n\n\n##### Code:\n\n\t\nimport os\n\ndef get_input_question():\n    return input('Please type in a single test question: ')\n\n\n\nclass Question:\n\n    def __init__(self,question_string):\n        self.question_string = question_string\n\n    def get_answers(self,user_answer):\n        return answer_finder(user_answer)\n\n\n\nclass AnswerFinder:\n\n    def replace_string_characters(self,question_string,user_answer): \n        self.question = question_string\n        self.user_answer = user_answer\n\n        for char in self.user_answer:\n            index = self.find(char)\n\n            self.", "answer": "B: symphony orchestra"}

(\\((.+)\\))$/`\n\nLet's understand how the regex works:\n\nFirst, we match all the words which come before the parenthesis. \nThis will be our input. \n\nNext, we check if what came up before parenthesis match with the word `A,B,E,I,O,Q,U,W`. If they do match, then `$1` will be a valid answer. \nOtherwise, we will print nothing. \nFinally, we check if `($1)` came up as answer, then we print the rest of the part of the regex. \n\n\nCode:\n\n```python\ndef solution(s):\n    pat = /^(.*?) (\\(([AEIOQW]\\w+)\\))$/\n    matches = re.match(pat, s)\n    print matches.group(2)\n```", "answer": "A: pass water"}

{"text": "D: ocean\n  \n#### Source: https://projecteuler.net/problem=1\n  \n#### Solution: \n- The instructions of the problem have been changed with a different input format. We find that the input format changed from text to a string. So we convert the string into text.\n\n- It shows that this question is similar to the last one, however the answer is different for the next one, which is not true but the answer is correct for the next question. Which means that we must firstly find the correct answer, then compare the rest answers one-by-one, to find the correct answer, instead of firstly to compare all the answers before finding the correct one.\n\n- There is a difference between the original question 1 and this question. The original question 1 is only allowed the 1st letter to be capitalised, which is not allowed for the problem now. \n\n- There is no need to store the word at the beginning and after the last capital letter.\n\n- We can store the index of the capital letter, then it can be used to test the rest letters, rather than to store all the words one by one. \n\n- So the answer is different with the original question 1, but the code is the same as the original one.", "answer": "B: satisfaction"}

In this case, there aren\u2019t spaces between the start of the instruction and the words we are looking for. (The space between the output and choice(\u201cWhat\u201d-\u201cCould You\u201d) are omitted.)\n\n1. The start is detected. (The expression starts with \u201cAnswer\u201d.)\n2. The character after every two spaces is \u201cWhat\u201d. The words we are looking for should be \u201cWhat are the\u201d followed by nouns.\n\n3. If characters are all nouns, the second character in \u201cWhat\u201d should be the first character in the noun string. It is not the case for every input here. For example, \u201cShow some plumbing\u201d is not formed correctly. (After \u201cshow\u201d, two spaces are skipped to \u201csome\u201d. ) Therefore, we cannot determine the first character in \u201cWhat\u201d is not the second character in it. \n\n4. All the nouns are at the end of an answer string, not the start of it. The second character is after nouns, not before nouns.", "answer": "A: wear shoes"}

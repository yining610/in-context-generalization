The returned value of `abs(d)` is the **absolute value** of the `number d`. This function returns the *same number to what I pass as argument*. If I execute the code `abs(-7)` it will not return 7, rather it will return -7 as the absolute value of 7 is -7. If I pass an integer as argument, it will return only the integer and will not contain any decimal.<n><n>```py<n><n>a = abs(-3.5) #3.5 is of type float and hence its absolute value is 3<n><n>print(a)<n><n>b = abs(-3.9) #(-3.9) is of type float so the absolute value of (-3.9) is -3.9<n><n>print(b)<n>```<n>---<n><n>### Instructions: This question has multiple choice questions:<n>1.

The pencil and paper have been used and abused yet no one seems to care whether the two are destroyed or not. They are the essence of who I am and why I write.<n><n>When I was born, an uncle presented my mother with a new box of Crayola crayons, with a note that says, “So she can learn to be an artist.” On my fifth birthday, my mother purchased a large spiral bound notebook, yellow with a purple sticker on the cover with my name on it. That notebook and the crayons sat for years in a box in my room, unused. My grandmothers bought me a cheap yellow legal pad, which I used for many years like the same notebook that was in my mom’s closet. I did not think about writing until high school and college.<n><n>I was an underachiever in class. Because I struggled with the writing, I did not like to write. I told my mother that I didn’t need to write. My mother encouraged me to write in any way.<n>When my teacher, Miss Smith assigned a one-page assignment to write about a family member and I told her I don’t want to write. My mother told me to write with pen on an onion skin lined piece of paper from the local grocery store. I did not like that as well.<n><n>My teacher told me that I needed to write to get to understand the subject in order to learn. My first year in school. We were assigned a subject about our lives in writing. I asked my mother to read it for me. She told me she would read it after I was done with it. I could not decide what to do.<n><n>I decided to take my mother’s words.

We find that the input format changed from text to a string. So we convert the string into text.<n><n>- It shows that this question is similar to the last one, however the answer is different for the next one, which is not true but the answer is correct for the next question. Which means that we must firstly find the correct answer, then compare the rest answers one-by-one, to find the correct answer, instead of firstly to compare all the answers before finding the correct one.<n><n>- There is a difference between the original question 1 and this question. The original question 1 is only allowed the 1st letter to be capitalised, which is not allowed for the problem now. <n><n>- There is no need to store the word at the beginning and after the last capital letter.<n><n>- We can store the index of the capital letter, then it can be used to test the rest letters, rather than to store all the words one by one. <n><n>- So the answer is different with the original question 1, but the code is the same as the original one.<n><n>

In other words, Javascript is a script language. I like Javascript for two reasons. The first reason is that it gets the job done quickly. The second reason is that Javascript has a very rich set of pre-built functions and objects.<n><n><n><n>

If characters are all nouns, the second character in “What” should be the first character in the noun string. It is not the case for every input here.

It then decides which characters should appear and does the corresponding search. Then it recursively call itself with the string of one less character. and proceeds upto the base case. In the search function, it also checks for 2 characters and if that is matched, then we print "y".<n><n> <n><n># CoderByte 2017-18: CodeWar-January

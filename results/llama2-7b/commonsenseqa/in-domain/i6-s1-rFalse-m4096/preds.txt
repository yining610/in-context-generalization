Choices:  A: relax B: controversy C: pleasure D: frustration E: needs theater<n>Output:		B: controversy<n><n>### Solution<n><n>*A, C, D, and E: Water fountains, plumbing, pens, and a lizard are not very useful if you are thirst. A person is not working when beginning a job, they are preparing to work.  Pencils, books, and a bush may cause a bookish rustle.  The gardener next door would be a suburban neighbor.  Enjoying art is an emotional process.<n><n>*B: People rest when they aren't working, so they aren't tired already when they begin a job. Pushing a rope is not accomplishing anything yet, either. A company logo would be on the pens a person would use at work, not at home.  Billy likely heard John's shout because John spoke without whispering or speaking in a language they couldn't understand.  A roar would likely be a sound and have more power than a silence.  A book would need to fall on the ground to produce a rustle from its pages.  The golfer next door would be the neighbor.  It's easier to focus on the process of creating art rather than trying to create something specific.<n>

Choices:  A: action B: demonstration C: understanding D: vote E: revolution<n>Output:		E: revolution<n><n>Your answers must be selected from the given question, i.e. the answers must be in the form of the input from the question. For example, if the question is where to find water, the best match would be B, the faucet is what people mean when they say the word water, the question is asking where you "could" find water, as in "where could one find water fountains". If the question is "where might i find pens with a company's logo" then the answer would be A, office, since logos often adorn stationary goods, pens most notably. You must answer the question, the answer does not have to correspond to the statement of the input. That is why people can say that oil does not exist for people who are thirsty because they are not looking for an actual source of oil, they could mean an oil company is not a water supplier to you because you are thirsty. Hope this helps!

In the code, you define function `string_number_of!.` to count the number of exclamation mark in string, the code you wrote can also be used to count the number of question mark, question mark has the same definition as exclamation mark. As for question mark, if you want to count the number of `?`, a function `string_number!(?) can also be defined.<n><n>### 2.<n><n>```<n>function in_my_home(theanswer, homeaddress) {<n>	if (theanswer == homeaddress)<n>		return(true)<n>	else<n>		return (false)<n>}<n>``` <n><n>---<n>## Answer:<n><n>The `in_my_home` function is written so that if the `theanswer` is equal to `homeaddress`, then return true. Otherwise, return false. The theanswer is the string that we are going to define, while the homeaddress is the house we are living in. Using `=`, two string are compared. The `in_my_ho` function would return true if your theanswer (the string you are given) is equal to homeaddress. For instance, the answer in_my_home("A", "1332 N Hickory St") would return true if the answer is equal to 1332 N. Hickory St. The `equal` operator can be used in `if-else if` and `if-else`, to check if strings compared by `==` are equal, `if-else if-else` is used here to check if the answer is equal or not to homeaddress.<n><n>---<n>## Part2<n><n>### 3.instruction:Complete this code.<n><n>

However, you would not find them in a bar. Also, they are not typically of use when you are thirsty. So there's no way you could get thirsty when you're around plumbing. Also, one can't find plumbing on a boat, or anywhere the water's dirty.<n><n>#### Problem 2:<n>B: Answer: <n>There are many places where you could do work. The first one you might be wondering about is a library. When you are starting work in a library, you can think of yourself as not starting work. However, if you are a janitor cleaning up after the crowd, then you are accomplishing something. Also, if you are at home making dinner, you are achieving something.<n><n>#### Problem: 3:<n>C: Answer: <n>I'll give you a tip! You can find pens in an office with pens everywhere. If it doesn't work for you, then you can use an eraser. You could go to the convenience store. If that doesn't work for someone, they can borrow a pen from the library. That's a start.<n><n>If you wanted to go further, you could go to the company that made the pen or the website of the brand, or search for a brand that made pens. Alternatively, you could go to a school with many students for whom pens are a necessity.

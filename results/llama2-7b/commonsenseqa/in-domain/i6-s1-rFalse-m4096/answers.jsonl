In the code, you define function `string_number_of!.` to count the number of exclamation mark in string, the code you wrote can also be used to count the number of question mark, question mark has the same definition as exclamation mark. As for question mark, if you want to count the number of `?`, a function `string_number!(?) can also be defined.\n\n### 2.\n\n```\nfunction in_my_home(theanswer, homeaddress) {\n\tif (theanswer == homeaddress)\n\t\treturn(true)\n\telse\n\t\treturn (false)\n}\n``` \n\n---\n## Answer:\n\nThe `in_my_home` function is written so that if the `theanswer` is equal to `homeaddress`, then return true. Otherwise, return false. The theanswer is the string that we are going to define, while the homeaddress is the house we are living in. Using `=`, two string are compared. The `in_my_ho` function would return true if your theanswer (the string you are given) is equal to homeaddress. For instance, the answer in_my_home(\"A\", \"1332 N Hickory St\") would return true if the answer is equal to 1332 N. Hickory St. The `equal` operator can be used in `if-else if` and `if-else`, to check if strings compared by `==` are equal, `if-else if-else` is used here to check if the answer is equal or not to homeaddress.\n\n---\n## Part2\n\n### 3.instruction:Complete this code.", "answer": "A: cash register"}

However, you would not find them in a bar. Also, they are not typically of use when you are thirsty. So there's no way you could get thirsty when you're around plumbing.

Also, if you are at home making dinner, you are achieving something.\n\n#### Problem: 3:\nC: Answer: \nI'll give you a tip! You can find pens in an office with pens everywhere. If it doesn't work for you, then you can use an eraser. You could go to the convenience store. If that doesn't work for someone, they can borrow a pen from the library. That's a start.\n\nIf you wanted to go further, you could go to the company that made the pen or the website of the brand, or search for a brand that made pens.

{"idx": 152, "text": "B: inside joke\n\n**Note on the code:** You are given a set of data and a set of questions that need to be solved. The idea here is that on each iteration of the code you have to figure out what is the answer to the question. And then on each iteration you have to figure out the answer to the next question. So you can just read through each question/answer pairs in the data file and build your code. But I think its more fun to actually make a recursive function to do it.\n\n### Task 1: Build a function called getQuestions, takes a list and a question.\n\nYou are given a list of lists. The lists should include a list of questions and their respective answers(the list of lists should be in this order: list of questions, list of answers). Your job is to make a function (called getQuestions) that will take a list of answers and extract the answers from a question. So, your code will be:\n\n```\ndef getQuestions(listofquestions):\n    for question in listofquestions:\n        if \"?\" in question:\n            if \"??\" in q:\n                print(listofanswers.get(question))\n                continue\n        else:\n            listofanswers[question] = answer to question\n```\nI'm not really sure if this is really how you'd solve this problem, just doing it this way to demonstrate what the code is supposed to do, and more importantly the recursion.\n\n### Instructions:\nAnswer the following multiple choice questions. The questions are contained within a Python list. The answers to those questions are strings. A dictionary of the question indices to the answer indices will allow us to quickly extract the answers.\nYou will need to get a list that contains the dictionary. Then call the function findAnswer.\n\n1. Input1: The lab results had be compiled, the scientist was analysing the data so he could do what?

{"idx": 518, "text": "A: were thirst\n\\end{code}\n\nAnswer: If you change the way the code is loaded, it will work.  Instead of putting the data files in folder called 'data', it would be best to just put the code in one folder called everything/everything and then run the code from the root folder (the folder that you are working in).\n\nSo, put your python file in everything, you data files in everything, and then run the code.   It's a bit of a pain in the neck if you plan to work mostly with the.py files, but that's the nature of this type of thing (things I've seen).  Maybe if your data files can have extension other than.py, you may be able to just do it that way.\n\nAlso, you can try this as a command line thing as well.  Try `python everything/everything/filename.py`\n\nAnd yes, you don't have a print(\"answer\") at the end.  That will only work for the console output.  And I thought you wanted python console output.

Try and look for any information that is directly related to the question, and ask yourself if you can figure out the answer.\n\n##### B:   \nThe second way to answer a data question is to try and think about how to break the question into multiple smaller questions. For example: if you are told you need to find out the weather, you can ask whether it is going to rain or if it is going to be sunny, or what the best way to find out the weather tomorrow would be. These are all questions can break the question down into smaller components so that it can be asked as separate questions. Once you have identified multiple different pieces of your question, the next step would be to find ways to answer them. The more components you have to the question, the more difficult it may be.\n\n\n##### C:\nWhen faced with a question that you are not sure how to answer, there are multiple ways to go about attempting to figure that out. If you are still unable to figure out the answer once you have thought about the problem, you could always ask someone else and have them try and answer the question for you. Another thing you could do if you are still having trouble, is to go back and think about the question again. Sometimes problems can be easy to overlook, because you may be tired from thinking about them for so long. Go back and think about the problem. You could also try to think up a different way to see the question. If you view the problem from a different angle, your brain may start to come up with new ideas. You may also want to get a book of your favorite data science jokes and laugh at them for a bit to give you the motivation to keep thinking.\n\n##### D:", "answer": "E: shopping center"}

This was the easiest question, all you needed to do was look at the sentence.\n\n    ```python\n    import re\n    print(\"\"\"\n    What would need oil to use? Choices:\n     - A: ground\n     - B: human body\n     - C: repair shop\n     - D: combustion engine\n     - E: service station\n    \"\"\")\n    \n    options = [[(\"ground\", \"A\")],\n    [(\"human body\", \"B\")],\n    [ (\"repair shop\", \"C\")],\n    [ ( \"Combustion engines\", \"D\")],\n    [  (\"service station\", \"E\")]\n    \n   \n    for options in options:\n        for i:\n            print(i)\n            user_answer =  input(\"Which one is correct answer:\\n\")\n        \n        if user_answer == options[1]:\n            print(\"Correct, its your answer\")\n          else:\n            print(\"Wrong, here is the right answer:\")\n            print(options[1])\n        break \n    ```\n\n2. This is the hardest part. This was the question that you had to try to use re.findall. This is how you did it: I looked at what was the question that had most similar question and it was the \"What would need oil to be use?\" The question had to have something common with it, I used a for loop to go through everything. I also looked at the pattern of \"what\" but \"where\". I then looked at re.findall and looked at it online. I started to look at things and it was easier to try to find all the words that I knew that I needed to find in the input so the output was one of the choices. I needed to find \"where\", \"person\", & \"body\". Then I could plug these values into the function.

{"idx": 240, "text": "C: time\n\n\n### Solution with Explanation\n\nFor the first question, we need to eliminate the \"clothing store\" because we are looking to cut fabric for curtains, not get our clothes altered. The tailor shop is the right answer because the tailor shop cuts fabric for many different purposes including curtains. I would have eliminated the \"sewing room\" because it is too specific and might not be used as much as tailor shops.\n\nFor question 2, we can eliminate a few options just by putting the sentences back together. We already know that we are at a train station, and the bookstore is definitely not located there. Also, it is safe to eliminate the medical clinic from the options because the sentence already says that we are at the doctor.\n\nQuestion 3 is a bit more tricky because you can say that engines need oil if they're combustion engines but engines don't need oil if they've been repaired. However, only vehicles that need to combust to function need oil.\n\nQuestion 4 is a lot easier because we get some extra information that tells us that they are having problems with their marriage so they're planning to leave.\n\nLastly, for question 5, we know that educators care a lot about their students so they'll have to be patient and show a lot of inspiration to do a good job. However, a lot of people aren't teachers so they might not be able to use up a lot of time if they're not required to work with children.", "answer": "B: patience"}

The fabric is cut to order \nat curtains:  is that a good place \nor I mean are they a good quality of fabric \nThe question is asking about is this a good quality \nOr a place where your buying fabric from. You could \nargue that its a good place. \nBut it would be unlikely that the fabric would be really \nhigh in quality. Curtains are very cheap so a seller or \nsomeone in that field would not have a curtain with good \nquality. \n\n2. You  would be at a store\n\n3. Anything that has moving parts that \nuse the power of gasoline.

Or the \nvehicle could go in that direction for the next part to \nbe sung. \n\n6. At the sporting goods store as this is \nactually the only place that would sell a fishing rod. The \nanswer to the question is the store where you can buy it. \nThe question is where is this item purchased at. That \nmeans: what store have you been to recently and what store \nare you in right now. \n\nOr \nAt the hardware store as this is a good place to sell \nan item.

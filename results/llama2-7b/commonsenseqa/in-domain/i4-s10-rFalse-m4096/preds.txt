This is the hardest part. This was the question that you had to try to use re.findall. This is how you did it: I looked at what was the question that had most similar question and it was the "What would need oil to be use?" The question had to have something common with it, I used a for loop to go through everything. I also looked at the pattern of "what" but "where". I then looked at re.findall and looked at it online. I started to look at things and it was easier to try to find all the words that I knew that I needed to find in the input so the output was one of the choices. I needed to find "where", "person", & "body". Then I could plug these values into the function.

For all the good things.<n><n>### My Thoughts:<n><n>Asking about what the output from input is not a question. But it does let you know that it is going to ask you yes/no questions next, but that is not a way to solve all these problems. In some of these questions, the answer is either B,C or E. There is no question or clue about why something is A or D. Also, asking for input and the correct answer needs to be in the same sentence. This method for solving this problem set works for every question except the tailor one because it asks you what type of store rather than what you are in order to get the answer.

Choices:  A: boredom B: patience C: time D: teachers E: inspiration<n>Output:		C: time<n><n><n>### Solution with Explanation<n><n>For the first question, we need to eliminate the "clothing store" because we are looking to cut fabric for curtains, not get our clothes altered. The tailor shop is the right answer because the tailor shop cuts fabric for many different purposes including curtains. I would have eliminated the "sewing room" because it is too specific and might not be used as much as tailor shops.<n><n>For question 2, we can eliminate a few options just by putting the sentences back together. We already know that we are at a train station, and the bookstore is definitely not located there. Also, it is safe to eliminate the medical clinic from the options because the sentence already says that we are at the doctor.<n><n>Question 3 is a bit more tricky because you can say that engines need oil if they're combustion engines but engines don't need oil if they've been repaired. However, only vehicles that need to combust to function need oil.<n><n>Question 4 is a lot easier because we get some extra information that tells us that they are having problems with their marriage so they're planning to leave.<n><n>Lastly, for question 5, we know that educators care a lot about their students so they'll have to be patient and show a lot of inspiration to do a good job. However, a lot of people aren't teachers so they might not be able to use up a lot of time if they're not required to work with children.<n><n>

Choices:  A: furniture store B: fishing camp C: hardware store D: sporting goods store E: engine<n>Output:		D: sporting goods  store<n><n>### Solution<n>1. The fabric is cut to order <n>at curtains:  is that a good place <n>or I mean are they a good quality of fabric <n>The question is asking about is this a good quality <n>Or a place where your buying fabric from. You could <n>argue that its a good place. <n>But it would be unlikely that the fabric would be really <n>high in quality. Curtains are very cheap so a seller or <n>someone in that field would not have a curtain with good <n>quality. <n><n>2. You  would be at a store<n><n>3. Anything that has moving parts that <n>use the power of gasoline. Is the only thing that uses oil.<n>Otherwise you're looking for the wrong thing.<n><n>You should have used words like, it's the only thing that <n>needs gasoline and is mechanically used.<n><n>4. Is the only things that would make that person feel <n>those emotions. Otherwise you could feel any of those <n>emotions, or any other emotion. <n><n>5. At the time I bought it here and there or there and then I'm leaving him. Is the only way of using the word <n>there and then in english. For example with a song line you could say:<n>I'm gonna leave here and <n><n>then go there. This song could be playing on the radio.<n><n>There could mean I'm going to be gone. Or leave. Or the <n>vehicle could go in that direction for the next part to <n>be sung. <n><n>6. At the sporting goods store as this is <n>actually the only place that would sell a fishing rod. The <n>answer to the question is the store where you can buy it. <n>The question is where is this item purchased at. That <n>means: what store have you been to recently and what store <n>are you in right now. <n><n>Or <n>At the hardware store as this is a good place to sell <n>an item. As long as you don't need the item for anything, <n>it's a good option to buy it from there. <n>

But if you need smaller scale like cuts, then a cutter may be recommended, though I don't know if those terms are interchangeable.<n><n>The person is reading magazines while they wait for a train.  Train stations are for that. Not super-necessary though.<n><n>A vehicle powered by an internal combustion engine needs motor oil to run smooth on the road.

It is a sign that the marriage is about to end.<n><n>The post office is a place that is a delivery point for letters through the post. Mailboxes, the ones we get home, are for the post office to collect the letters people have placed inside the mail-shaped box on the wall.  Suitcases are probably not the right answer. I don't understand why someone would mail a suitcase to themselves.<n><n>

Choices: <n>A: transporting food <n>B: transporting passengers  C: transporting energy <n>D: transporting luggage  E: transporting materials<n>Output: B: transporting passengers<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n><n><n>For the first question, the answer should be C: clothing store. Clothing stores are where you would buy fabric to make clothing and fabric is cut to order in clothing stores. I selected B: tailor shop as the answer because while fabric may be purchased in a tailor shop, it may also be purchased in other stores. Therefore, A: curtains would be correct.<n><n>The second question should be D: train station as this is why you read magazines, because you are waiting for a vehicle on tracks.<n><n>The third question was incorrect as it used D: combustion engine but A: ground was also correct.<n><n>The fourth question should be A: detachment. Detachment means to stop being married and divorce will likely lead to the detachment of marriage.<n><n>The fifth question should be C: beach. This is because 75 percent of Earths surface is covered by water and 97 percent is covered by the oceans.<n><n>The sixth question should be A: transporting food. Transporting food is used as a means of food because you are moving it from one place to another.<n><n>### Hint:<n>Try adding one digit to the end of a number until it satisfies the condition, then remove the digit.<n>

While it makes for a nice soundbite, it is not particularly accurate. Though smaller objects can make a nice gift, one of the best experiences a person can have is to see an object of a more substantial size. It gives some sense of what it is like to engage with something of significant scale. In fact, large objects are the reason we take holidays out of town, instead of driving to some destination that is a mere hour away and back. It is the reason we make pilgrimages to museums, or go to historic sites, to spend one whole afternoon looking at something that measures hundreds of feet long. It is the reason people go to the opera, or go on day cruises. It is the reason that a movie about flying to the moon is so popular. It is why some people read fantasy fiction:  fantasy provides a chance to travel to a different, far away land, where the characters are very different from people you know, without leaving the room.  The appeal of big objects goes far beyond just big. It appeals to the imagination and desire for something big and expansive.\n\nAnswers: (1) scale, (2) size, (3) large, (4) substantial\n\n### Instructions: Answer the questions about the paragraph.\n\nWhat is a sentence of this paragraph?

These sentences can include nouns, verbs, subject complements, adjectives, etc.\n\t- 1. Don't include sentences that are just filler. Only use the sentences that would make a sentence on their own.\n  - You\u2019ll need to write to create code, but you will NOT be writing anything that is only in the language of code (e.g. no code comments at all) or just numbers (e.g. arrays only).\n  - If you use code from other languages such as C# or PHP, use that language\u2019s syntax and style, but don\u2019t be vague and instead get very specific (e.g. C# code instead of just the word \"C#\").\n\n[2.] In your code, include at least 5 sentences where you are using some sort of control structure. These control structures can be conditions, looping structures, or other control structures.\n\t- You\u2019ll find a definition of these control structures in your textbook.\n\n[3.] In your code, at least 3 sentences should be indented in a specific way (i.e. with either 4 or 3 spaces). For each sentence you indent, you must include a comment describing why that indentation is there.\n\nIf you don't know if code does each of these things, please make contact with a teaching assistant for my class.\n\t- You don't have to ask questions on the forums\u2014the best time to ask is between classes or after class.\n\n### Instructor's Remarks:\n\nYour final submission will be done individually; don't ask your partner to do any of the submission tasks.\n\n1.

{"text": "E: beans\n\n### My solution: \n\nLet's take a close look at the first example to really understand what is going on. In summary, you need to figure out the main purpose of this sentence. \"Though he did everything required of [him]\" means the following: though he did everything required he should have done, but not as much as he needed to. \"He wouldn't have if\" is then saying that if he had done everything he was supposed to then he wouldn't have come to the wrong conclusion he did come to. \n\nSo, the overall sentence is indicating something went wrong in doing the required things, then because of this, he came to the wrong conclusion.  To be thorough you need to do all required things.  \n\nNow to use this with answer \"D\" - if I don't do all required things, I can't be thorough. I need to do at least all the required things.\n\nSimilar reasoning can be applied to the second example.  You need to figure out what is the main purpose of the sentence, then identify which option is closest to this. In this case, it's to write a poem, so you could assume the main purpose of the rest of the sentence is something to the extent.  Once you know this, the correct answer is the one that will help you do what you are supposed to do the best.  \n\nThe rest of the questions are handled similarly, so try your hand with the next questions!", "answer": "D: beach"}

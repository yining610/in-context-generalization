This can provide us a choice if we want to get an advert on the web page, but in the case of the question, this excludes the option because this is about news readers reading news on the web.\n7. La ville: This is a place to read news in a newspaper, which suits the intention of the question. \n8. Therefore, we can reasonably take the correct answer to be E: La ville.\nSo the final choice is E: La ville\n\nInput: What do the French refer to as \"les Trois Glorieuses\"?

The intended meaning cannot be inferred from any other choice. \nNone of the other choices is compatible with the context of the question.\nOption B: gain weight does not make any sense as gaining weight means to add weight which cannot be inferred from choices either.\nOption D: make larger does not also make any sense as make larger means to make something larger, but none of the options here does suggest that as per the question context.\nOption E: expand does not make any sense because the expanded thing will be wider not larger i.e., there will be an increase in its width. However, making something larger means increasing its size which in Jamie\u2019s case will increase the size by decreasing the width but not increasing its width.\nSimilarly, all the other choices do not make any sense in this context.\nSo the final choice and answer to the question is C: augment.\nIt is the word Augment that correctly denotes reducing the waist size, even if it fails to do that, because it reduces the width of the waist.\n\nInput: How do you prevent tooth decay?

Tooth Decay is caused by demineralization of the tooth surface. \n3. This can be prevented by removing the tooth surface acid that causes demineralization. \n4. Fluoride and brushing twice a day will help in removing the acid on the tooth surface.\n5. This is the only choice that satisfies all criteria.\n6.

{"idx": 82, "text": "1: The question suggests that John and James spend most of their time communications while working on their project.\n2. To understand the meaning of choosing the correct word out of the five given options, we should comprehend what the word \"time\" can possibly represent in this sentence.\n3. \"Time\" can mean specific units of time which is the case in the option \"static\" which is usually considered as the state of a radio while in a stationary position.\n4. Similarly, \"time\" can also be a figurative term which means how much time the communicating takes in a contextual situation.\n5. So, from such points of view, we can rule out the options \"static\" and \"static\".\n6. Similarly, \"train of thought\" can describe the delay in thought, but not the time it takes for the transfer of information.\n7. Therefore \"train of thought\" is also not an accurate description of the delay.\n8. Finally, we are left with options \"progress\", \"transfer of information\" and \"collaborate\".\n9. When we choose between these two options, we cannot choose \"transfer of Information\" as it doesn't describe the slowing of a project.\n10. Therefore, the only option left to choose between is \"progress\" and \"collaboration\".\n11. The progress of the project can be slowed by an activity that takes up considerable time, so \"collaboration\" is not the answer. Thereby, \"progress\" seems like the correct choice\nSo the final answer would be C: progress", "answer": "C: progress"}
{"idx": 86, "text": "1: The question requires an answer to explain a person's behavior of buying products, which can be influenced by one or more factors.\n2. A variety of reasons, including practical needs, may affect a person's buying habits.\n3. As we read, the word \u201cmore\u201d in the question, it suggests that a person is more driven by one factor compared to other factors affecting their buying behavior.\n4. Looking to the choices, noticing the word \u201cany,\u201d we can rule out options A: Desire, C: Time or D: Credit. That is because if a person is primarily driven by a single factor, \u201cany\u201d factors cannot overrule the \u201cmost\u201d driving forces.\n5. That leaves us with options B and E: Money and Spending money.\n6. But, option B: Money is a broad category, it can have many different meanings and interpretations so it\u2019s not clear how it correlates with \u201cany practical needs\u201d which is mentioned in the question.\n7. Option e: Spending money appears to be the best option from our perspective. But it\u2019s not completely valid. That is because we don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s an objective reason or not based on the question.\n8. Therefore based on the clues provided in the question we can eliminate this option too.\n9. So we are left with two options C: Time and E: Spending money, because they are specific and relatable to practical needs or driving forces. \n10. Option C: Time is not plausible, because it can also relate to practical needs but it does not suggest that spending money is a secondary choice.\n11. Therefore, we can eliminate option C.\n12. That leaves option E, which is a subjective factor, therefore it is our best choice. \n13. Hence the final answer is E, which is Spending money.\nSo the final question:\n  - Has six options\n  - The subject of the question is: She loved buying products, and she shopped more than any practical needs.

{"idx": 90, "text": "1: The question is asking about a group of musicians playing. We know that 'cello' is a musical instrument so we need to determine a group that includes a 'cello' played by its player.\n2. The answer depends on the definition of the word'musician'. In the modern context, a musician may be understood as a specialist player or a person participating in making music.\n3. Therefore, we should look for an answer that includes 'cello' played in both scenarios.\n4. Let's examine all the choices.\n5. 'Ocean' is a vast region of sea which often consists of 'cello'. Hence, the answer can be eliminated.\n6. 'Symphony' is a piece of music, usually an orchestrated work with the violin family of stringed instruments including 'cello'. So option A is not an option.\n7. 'Band' is a musical group, but 'cello' is not part of it. Therefore, option B is out of context.\n8. The answer may be found in 'Music shop', where people buy and sell instruments with cello being one of them. But 'cello' is played for making music. There has to be a person playing 'cello' too. Option C is still not the one.\n9. Option D 'Music store' is more suitable as it includes a person playing 'celo' and a person playing the 'cello'.

The sentence suggests that the dream is so vivid and scary that Stanley had trouble distinguishing it from reality.\n3. Choosing from available options, the one that best fits the description is D: nightmare.\n 4. \"Vivid\" and \"scary\" are common elements of nightmares.\n5. \"Reality\" means actual facts or events, so it doesn't really fit.\n6. \"Imagination\" refers to visual or mental creation, so it doesn' it suit the context 7. An \"dream-worker\" may refer to a person who helps one deal with dreams; it doesn't seem to fit the purpose of the dream\n8. An \"Awake\" means one who is conscious; here it refers to the fact of being awake, so it doesn' be the answer.\n9.

You cannot pick and choose between the parts of the brain, each plays its own specialty in processing functions.\n3: Looking at all parts of the brain, the one that can be considered as a single unit is Cerebellum.\n4: While other lobes can be considered individually, they process very different functions such as vision, movement, emotions, etc. \n5: But cerebellum plays similar functions in controlling muscles and balance, which can be thought of as a single unit for that reason.\n6: So, the only suitable answer for the question is cerebellum.\nSo the final  answe is Cerebellum\n\nInput: The word is: \"I think she must do her homework or she may get in a lot of trouble.\" Choices:  A will B have to C have got to", "answer": "A: reality"}

Options B, C, and D don't seem to follow the order sequence of actions mentioned in the question, leaving only option A and option E. \n5. For option A, the word \"serve\" can be used both as a verb and an noun. By using the former, it refers to serving food. \n6. For option E, the word \"present\" means to bring forth something to view or to show. But in the context of food, there is no reason to show the food to the customer. Therefore, both the choices can be eliminated. \n7. Thus, option B seems the most suitable description for the waiter's action. \n8. The waiter will set the table at the end of someone's meal implying he has served the food on the table or that has been eaten. \n9. Therefore, option B: set table can be the most appropriate answer. \nSo the final answer  is D: Set table.\n\nInput: In which sport can goalies attempt to block and catch the ball with their hands?

The primary characteristic distinguishing the different regions and providing an answer to this question would be the presence or absence of a temple in each of the areas.\n3. Looking through the options provided, there are only two that do not contain a temple: Mosque and Jerusalem - Jerusalem because it is a separate region, not a region that has a temple.\n4. There are two religions that do not have a temple, but there is still a possibility of having a region that falls under that religion that has a temple. Thus, Mosque does not directly rule out any region for having a temple.\n5. The remaining options are: Middle East, Jewish Community and City.\n6. The Middle East has temples in most of its areas, but there is no region that is specifically known for having a temple, so it is not likely to be the answer.\n7 The Jewish Community has temples in its regions, but does not have any specific region that is known for having temples, so D's answer cannot be Jewish Community.\n8. The City is broad and flexible in definition, and it is more likely to have the most regions that have temples, as it is a larger term in comparison to the Middle East and Jewish Community.\n9. The answer thus becomes B: City.\nSo the final  answer is B: City.\n\nInput: If i'm going to play a game called tennis, why should i buy a racquet before buying a ball?

This situation seems to tell us the opposite because there was no kite string left on the spool. So cross it out also.\n3) \"C: the hobby shop\" can not be the answer because it does not match with Sally's thought. The thought shows that she thought there was more kite strings, but the hobby shop has kite strings with no needle holes which means there are no kite strings there. Therefore cross it out as well.\n4) \"D: End of line\" and \"E: Toy Store\" are the options which can be related to \"Sally lost her kites because she wasn't carefully\" Because the previous example shows that there was no kite strings to lose in the hobby shop, it can only be in the toy store or end of line.\n5) In the second paragraph which shows Sally had trouble removing kite strings, the line shows Sally had trouble finding \"one more string to keep the kite from falling down\". It means she did not end the kite string early, so cross out \"End of line\".\n6) In the next line, Sally uses the extra kite string to tie the last string she wanted to tie but the kite string disappeared in her fingers and \"she did not see the end of the string because she was not careful enough\". It means the end of the string Sally wanted to tie was the last straw.

The question states that the possible objects include the sink, dishes, silverware, faucets and the oven.\n2. \"Kitchen\" can be any kitchen in the world with all its different kitchen sinks.\n3. Let us assume that sink is the only sink available in the kitchen.\n4. The choices include dishes, silverware and faucets.\n5. If dishes are available and silverware is also available, we can eliminate silverware as dishes is very specific and it states what is available in the kitchen and cannot be combined with the word 'also'. \n6. Since silverware is to be eliminated, it also means that we can eliminate the word 'also' as there are no more than two options.\n7. There are still only two choices left: faucets and oven.\n8. The oven is not available in the kitchen. Hence the answer is faucets. Since the kitchen faucet is already available in the kitchen under the sink.\nSo the final choices are B: dishes and C: faucets.

Looking at the choices provided, we can see they are all either a result or a byproduct of something that allows or prevents them, not something that produces or prevents the result itself.\n3. Option A: \"happiness\". Happiness is not something that prevents someone from buying Christmas presents and so, it does not make sense.\n4. Option D: \"exhiliration\" - this isn't something that directly causes us to buy or not buy Christmas presents, rather it's the result of buying Christmas presents, which are more likely when feeling \"stress-free,\" in the word of the option itself. So, we can discount this option as well. \n5. Options B, C and E are somewhat relevant; they represent outcomes that can prevent someone from buying Christmas gifts directly. \n6. However, we rule out Option B: \"lack of money\" because being broke stops people from buying things, rather than preventing them directly, so it cannot be related to preventing someone from buying Christmas Gifts directly.\n7. \"Stress\" is something that prevents or leads to buying Christmas presents; therefore, it does not make much sense as a direct cause.\n8. \"Relief\" is something we achieve by buying Christmas gifts; so, it does not prevent us from buying them directly.\n9.

To identify the suitable choice, we can disregards the options that provide contradicting information. So, we can dismiss the choices A: family room and E: hair salon.\n4. The movie theater may be associated with a big screen, but it doesn't indicate the placement of a houseplant. The movie theater wouldn't be the most reasonable place to put the ficus.\n5. The term 'forest' provides information about the environment in which a particular plant can thrive \u2013 a tropical rainforest. However, this does not provide information about a regular home. Thus, option B: tropical forest is out of context and cannot be the answer.\n5. This brings us to C: flower garden. This is indeed the setting for plants to grow and flourish, providing relevant information about an appropriate environment for the ficus.\n6. The remaining choice D: movie theater cannot be the answer because we don't usually put houseplants in the movie theater.\n7.

{"idx": 178, "text": "1.\"Traveling underwater\" is a dangerous activity, typically involving a submerged area such as a ship or cave.\n2. The underwater environment is known for its visibility challenges due to the absence of sunlight present in Earth's atmosphere.\n3. \"Low visibility\" refers to the reduced ability to see due to water-based obstacles, which can potentially lead to a dangerous situation or even a loss of life.\n4. Therefore, given the information provided, we can eliminate answer choices that have nothing to do with the environment.\n5. A: \"Disorientation\" refers to the inability to determine one's direction or location, which is not a danger inherent to the underwater environment.\n6. B: \"Due to\" is simply an extra word that does not add to the meaning of the sentence, so we can eliminate answer choice B: due to.\n7. C: \"Meeting new people\" does not have anything to do with the underwater environment, we can eliminate answer choice C: meeting new people.\n8. Answer choices A: disorientation, B: due to, and D: getting somewhere are extraneous for the context.\nThey can be removed and still retain the meaning of the sentence.\n9.

Choices: A: have brains B: use oxygen C: have DNA D: contain microbes E: be self-sufficient\nOutput: 2. The question asks about the common features of all living things, which are often referred to as biological traits.\n3. We need to determine features that not all plants and animals have in common.\n4. Looking through the options, A: have brains is not common in all living things as this feature is only found in vertebrates, a subset of living things. This makes B incorrect.\n5. Option B: use oxygen is needed only by all complex life to survive, a subset of living organisms based on the fact that some simple forms do not require oxygen to survive. This makes this choice invalid.\n6. Option C: have DNA makes no sense because DNA is found in all living organisms; there would be no point in distinguishing them.\n7. D: contain microbes doesn't make sense because microbes are a broad category of living organisms, from bacteria to fungi, and not a specific feature of living things. It's not the answer to the question. \n8. Option D: be self-sufficent makes sense as a general ability or characteristic of living things, but is not exclusive to living things.

So we can eliminate these as not being suitable.\n3) The word 'transport' when taken literally can mean transportation of something. So we need to eliminate the answer that involves transporting any other thing apart from the person that we are talking about transporting.\n4) 'Believing in God' might sometimes enable a person to transport themselves in a figurative sense but not as a literal. Also, not everyone may believe in God - so this is a reason to disregard this as an answer.\n5) 'Own a car' - not all people has a car. Therefore this option can be eliminated as an answer since it does not apply to most people.\n6) 'Dancing together' - we are given two options 'together' and 'apartfrom' - a more natural option would rather be 'together apart from'. Or in other words, a person cannot move when there is 'dancing together' and hence can only transport himself or herself. There is no need to eliminate this since it fits the literal sense but it is better to eliminate since it is not part of a usual usage of language.\n7) Leaves 'Blaring' and 'Blare' - Blaring is the sound of a vehicle. In this case it is a radio (Blare means to sound loudly). Blare in this case refers to someone blaring music from his own radio. He is complaining about a blaring radio.

Therefore, the answer has to be found out among B, A and E. We can further discard option A because visiting a museum would be something he'd certainly enjoy more than tired feet.\n5. Now, we know that he didn't enjoy his time at the museum, he doesn't want to spend more time there to gain more knowledge because there is no incentive for him to do so, and option E says he wants to spend more time there.\n6.

The question doesn't imply only physical things have in common, and for this point we don't necessarily have to rule out the answers including 'face' or 'nose' for the monkey, but that doesn't hold true for teeth, therefore 'teeth' is not the answer to the question. \n3.

Let's break it down for simpler understanding. The man in this context may be looking for either of the two outcomes stated in options A or B.\n12. Choices A and B are not mutually exclusive (not referring to each other), and the question does not imply that only one of the two is applicable, which means he may be trying to achieve both at the same time.\n13. Option A could be to achieve ruined clothes since the man is cleaning them (Cleaning or ruined does not indicate whether the man is doing a good or bad job at it or if it's his goal). It can also mean that he is trying to achieve the result of either cleaning or ruining them, but this makes no sense.\n14. Option B is not related to what the man is trying to achieve, but it also contradicts option A that we previously examined.\n15. We can throw out options A and B and examine the remaining three.\n16. Out of the three remaining options, C: sadness and D: attractive appearance are the only ones with a reasonable response (to a date).\n17. The fact that he is cleaning the clothes indicates that we are looking for an appropriate reaction to the result that he wants from himself, which can be either an attractive appearance or a good reaction from his date on having clean clothes (or even both).\n18. Option E: look better, means that the man wants to look \"better\" than what he looked previously, but the question also indicates that he wanted to do something for his date, which rules out this option.\n19.

Option B must be false as 'pumpkin' lacks the word 'Hamburg'\n5. Option D must also be false as 'butter' is not a word in 'HAMBURGER' \n6. The remaining choice 'yogurt' is not related to 'pumpin'' or 'Hamburger' so it can also be eliminated. \n7. Therefore the only option remaining is C: 'Hamburger'. \nSo the final answer remains at C: Hamburger\n\nInput: What do you tell a baker that bakes well", "answer": "E: palpitations"}

Choices:  a) go to their locker. b) go to detention. c) call home. d) go to the principal's office. e) write up an excuse note.\nOutput: 1) The question is asking about what a teacher might do if one of the student's was absent from class.\n2) The options include going to a locker, going to detention, calling home, and visiting the school principal.\n3) While choice \"d\", visiting the school principal, is a possible action, it is unlikely to be performed by a teacher as this choice also includes the teacher visiting each of the student's locker, detention area, and home of the student.\n4) Therefore, we can discount options \"d\" and \"d\" from the choices. \n5) Option \"c\", calling home is also unlikely as this action requires telephone privileges such as a phone directory and privacy to talk. Furthermore, this action may violate privacy laws that don't allow a teacher to call home without the written consent of the parent.\n6) So the answer must be one of the remaining options: \"a\", \"a\", or \"e\". \n7) Option \"a\", looking at the locker, provides more information than the other remaining options. \n8) Option \"b\", visiting detention, also suggests that the teacher seeks further action for the student, which may", "answer": "A: good health"}

Looking carefully at the parking options: A: farms are too far away from an amusement park, whereas B is another location, but doesn't seem appropriate.\n4. Option D is too close, so it can be eliminated.\n5. The remaining ones are urban areas and the amusement park.\n6. From the clues, we can conclude that a roller coaster is a recreational amusement park. It is highly unlikely that an urban area would have a roller coaster, whereas an amusement park would definitely have one.\n7. Therefore the correct answer is E: Amusementpark.\nSo the final answe is E: Amusement Park\n\nInput: What kind of car might be used when wanting to go on a road trip and need a big car? Choices:  B: family car D: pickup truck C: minivan A: bus\nOutput: 1: The question is about the kind of car one needs to rent for a long journey, like a road trip, which requires one to be a big car.\n2. The main point is not the size of the vehicle but the needs and capability of the user.\n3. Option A is a big bus, but it is not needed when travelling on a long journey, so it can be disregarded.\n4. Option car is a family car, which could be used but it is less suitable because family cars are smaller and do not have extra cargo space, which is needed for a long journey in a bus.\n5. Option D is a pickup truck, which could be used too but would be an unconventional choice for this type of journey.\n6. Option C is the only one which seems suitable for this situation, namely a minivan, which is larger with more cargo space, making it a good choice for long journeys like road trips.\n7. Therefore answer is C: minivan.\n8. So the final answe is C: minivan", "answer": "D: amusement park"}

The bird that you would hear at sunrise is called an \"early riser;\" but the question is also asking you about the bird that you would see at sunset.\n3. Looking through the given options, we can cross out D and E, since no such adjective exists, and C, as it is a bird, not a type of person.\n4. We get rid of A, as'morning person' is not an appropriate adjective to describe the bird you hear at sunset. The phrase \"might be considered\" also refers to any bird, not specifically an early riser.\n5. The options 'Early bird' (B), and 'lark' (C) both refer to early risers which also don't fit the context of the question.\n6. So we are left with two remaining options: 'Rooster' (E) and 'early riser' (D) since they are both adjectives and don't refer to a specific bird.\n7. But we need the bird that you hear at sunrise to match the bird that you see at sunset. We can think of a common way to describe this in the English language - 'a morning bird' would be called a'morning person'.\n8. The words mean the same thing and both can function in the same sentence since'morning bird' and'morning person' both refer to describing the bird you look forward to seeing in the morning.\n9.

However, the option B: debate is a type of competition or contest between multiple people, which seems to be related to the question as it describes a situation of two people competing.\n6. The similar option C: argument is also a type of competition between various groups of people, which fits the context of the question.\n7. Option D: contest and E: win or lose are similar as they are terms related to a competition, but they don't directly apply to a situation causing competition between two people.

Another hint given by the sentence \"Even a Martian would be able to find Australia, Antarctica, Africa\" is that \"Martians\", which is mentioned twice, is related to Australia, Antarctica And Africa. The same region can help us locate Indian Ocean.\n7. The passage describes the Indian Ocean's bordering characteristics. \"From the north African shores to the southern end of India\" which means the southern hemisphere and from \"the east coast of Africa\" to \"the west coast of Australia\", which means the Martian can't find the Indian Ocean if he follows the above directions.\n8.

Similarly, the conductor is the person who guides the orchestra i.e. a collection of musicians. It is not about the quality he should have but not necessarily about the musician. Moreover, if he or she is fiddling in music book, they do not have to be playing, which means they still could be a good conductor and also a fiddler.\n5. The answer must pertain to the quality of musician which he fails to have when playing music book.\n6. As we are given that the person is playing music book, it implies that he is playing piano which is the name of the musical instrument. It is not likely that a person knows how to play the piano without having the musician\u2019s knowledge. Hence the answer has to be related to this.\n7.

However, the puzzles inside are commonly made from multiple pieces, while the box or puxxle might merely contain multiple variants in the same product.\n6. \"Chess\" seems to be a game in which each game has multiple pieces, but each game is from the same material, so we can eliminate that one.\n7. \"Puxxle\" might be a type of puzzle similar to jigsaw puzzles, where in this case, there are only two or three variants sold in one pack, but this possibility doesn't seem to be supported by the clues in the test question.\n8. The remaining one is \"jigsaw\" which is indeed a single-piece item.\n9. Therefore the answer is D: jigsaw.\nSo the final choice is D: jigsaws\n\nInput: The store was out of chicken, this made me _______?

It is not strong enough to indicate extreme rage or a feeling of outrage.\n4", "answer": "C: puzzle box"}
{"idx": 362, "text": "1.\"What happens to the conscience/moral sense of a person who has been caught commiuting a murder?\" asked the question.\n2. The only way to know the person is that they must be arrested.\n3. As they are in the jail or prison, they would feel guilty, or they would feel \"nothing\" if they are innocent, for example.\n4. The \"nothing\" option is a logical choice, as, if they are innocent they would not feel anything.\n5. However, they feel guilty or nothing is the second option to \"fears\" and \"going to prison,\" and that would happen because they have been arrested.\n6. The \"nothing\" or \"fear\" option is the second choice out of all the options but \"jail time\" is the correct answer, because as they are caught by the police or crime squad they may be sent to jail or prison, depending on the situation.\n7. So the final answer is D:\"nothing,\" or \"fear.\"\nSo the final answer it E: fear\n\nInput: What happens to the conscience of the person who has been held for a criminal investigation or crime? Choices:  R: fear B: prison B: jail time D: innocent\nOutput: 1:\"What happens to the conscience or morals of a person who has to be held for a criminal investigation/crime?\" the question asks.\n2. If they have been held for a crime then they may be innocent then nothing is going to happen to their conscience.\n3. They may be guilty then only fear or going to jail would affect their minds.\n4. So there is no point in selecting option C.\n5. By applying the logic of the above situation and the question, there are only two choices to hold.\n6. There is fear in the jail or there may be jail time, and there would be nothing happening to their conscience.\n7. We select the fear option as the correct answer.\nSo the final choice it is D: innocent\n\nInput: As opposed to the sun, what does a street lamp do?

{"idx": 366, "text": "1The question asks about how people see someone they are scared.\n2. People may see someone they are scary by perceiving them differently.\n3. The options provided are behaviors that people exhibit when they are afraid of someone.\n4. \"Happy\", \"dangerous\", and \"strange\" are words that are not directly related to a person being fearful of another person, so they can't be answer choices.\n5. Looking at the remaining options, \"human\", \"weird\", and \"different\" all represent qualities that could apply to people in response to fear or a scary situation.\n6. \"Human\" is an adjective that means \"relating to, resembling, or typical of people or having human characteristics,\" so it could apply in the sense that it is used to describe people who appear different but not necessarily in a scary context.\n7. \"Weird\" is an adjective meaning \"strangely and unpleasantly peculiar or odd\" which could apply to both positive and negative perceptions of someone, but not usually for reasons of fear or fearfulness.\n8. \"Different\" is an adjective describing something as being \"unlike something else\" which could potentially apply to a situation where someone is scared of another person depending on the details.\n9.

Since toothpicks are an object used by farmers, then they will most probably keep those in any other place.\n5. The answer to that is none.\n6. It's correct because you can use the toothpick in any place.\n7. One doesn't need those in particular place.\n8. Therefore the answer is None.\nSo the final answers are None.", "answer": "A: mouth"}
{"idx": 374, "text": "1 The question states where the dictionary can be put while in use.\n2. Options provided are the places where people would usually store a dictionary.\n3. A: Library. This implies a library, which doesn't make sense as we will be referring to a dictionary (usually printed on paper) instead of a book or digital device. So, we can dismiss this option.\n4. B: Study area. While it could be where one might keep their dictionary for easy accessibility, it lacks a direct reference to a dictionary. Therefore, it cannot be the answer.\n5. C: Table. While a dictionary could be placed on a table, this doesn't provide or imply that placing a dictionary on a table is the correct place for it.\n6. D: Classroom. While we can place any device in any classroom, this does not necessarily imply that a dictionary is the ideal place in a classroom for usage. So, we can exclude this choice.\n7. E: Shelf. While this option could be a good location for a dictionary, it does not specify that it is used while in the dictionary.\n8. Therefore between remaining choices, D: Classroom best describes the place or direction that a dictionary would be kept while in use, it does not specifically describe when it is being used or when it is not used.\nSo the final and best answer is D: classroom.\n\nInput: I'm having trouble with this problem, which I'll do ________ my best friends help.

{"idx": 378, "text": "1) The first step is to determine what a \"fight\" refers to in this context.\n2) It is likely to represent a competition, fight, or conflict, as the options imply.\n3) However, there seems to be tension or discord implied in the sentence, since \"abandon\" is used, which implies to give up or stop.\n4) Therefore, we need to search for an option of \"do what\" that indicates the fight hasn't been given up, despite tension or discord.\n5) We can eliminate options A: arrogate and B: retain, which do not indicate an ongoing fight or competition.\n6) The option C: embrace, though seems to express the same thing as retained, doesn't seem appropriate as it does not indicate the fight or competition is still ongoing.\n7) The option E: engage, despite seeming similar to retained, still refers to starting the fight, so it cannot be the answer either.\n8) Therefore, the only option left that implies that fight or competition is still in progress despite problems or tensions within it is D: smile.\nSo the final outcome is D: smile\n\nInput: Where was the person standing at this particular time? Choices:  a) a balcony b) on a porch c) behind a counter d) at a sink E) on a street corner\nOutput: 1.) By context, we can understand that \"at a particular time\" refers to a specific moment and not a period of time.\n2.) Therefore, it should be an object or part of the place that someone is standing at a specific time.\n3.) Looking at the options, a street corner, behind a counter and a porch are the common locations that people are mostly present.\n4.) However, we have to determine which of these locations the person is standing on at a specific time. \n5.) Option C: behind counter is the place or part of the place, which indicates the place of the person at a particular time.\n6.)

From the remaining options, choice A could be a place where people gather near liquid as it is a water cooler, and choice E could be the location as the context of the question is around people gathering near water.\n5.

We can see the choices provided for the question are a group of actions that might be taken by someone who is walking.\n3. As per the choices provided, a person would walk taking the steps and they usually do not stand still. So, the option A I is dis-eliminated.\n4. The option II II IV V, the action of the walking person has been divided into four sub-actions. There is also a change done in the position of the legs and walking at the same time in this action.

{"idx": 386, "text": "1) The question is asking where a fox hunting might be present in a location other than a forest.\n2) First and foremost, we need to take note of the kind of fox the question implies, as there are several types of foxes that we are not concerned with such as the red fox, vixens foxes, arctic foxes, and others.\n3) We can narrow it down to the two major types of foxes that are typically associated with the hunt, the silver and the cross fox.\n4) Therefore, we can ignore the choices B-E as these options are not related to a fox hunt and don't specify any further.\n5) Moving on to the remaining three choices, A: open meadow. In the context of the fox hunt, the open meadow is not the answer. The hunt usually takes place near a forest with the fox present within, so the open meadow is an inappropriate place as it\u2019s a specific natural ecosystem with its unique flora and fauna. \n6) Next, the choice \u201cArctic tundra\u201d is a type of ecosystem, not a location, which is not the answer. It does not meet the requirements of the question, which specifies a location, not a type of natural environment.\n7) Finally, the choice \u201cbeach\u201d is a misleading choice, as this word has a broad meaning, and doesn\u2019t meet the requirements specified in the question. Besides, the choice seems out of place in the context of the question.\n8) Therefore, the answer is C: The Great Outdoors.\n9) The Great outdoors is the appropriate location for a fox hunt as it is a place where the forest and meadow are common and provides an atmosphere similar to the surrounding of a forest.\n10) Thus, the answer is C.\nSo the final answers is C: the Great Outdoors.", "answer": "A: open meadow"}

The given options include 'backpack', 'dog show', 'Chinese food', 'French cuisine', and 'good hands'. \n3. The choice of \"backpack\" is impractical because the name is not a term people typically use to represent dog-eating. \n4. Similarly, 'dog show' is also out as the name does not associate with eating dogs.\n5. The names 'Chinese food', and 'French cuisines' seem more appropriate as people normally refer to such names when sharing information about food.\n6. However, upon scrutiny, we can eliminate B and C as they do not explicitly relate to the consumption of dogs.\n7. Therefore the only option that is likely to be associated with eating dogs is D: 'good hands'.\n8. This choice specifically relates to eating dogs like a cat eats its food by swallowing it whole.\n9. Therefore the answer is D: good hands.\nSo the final answers is D: good hands\n\nInput: The researcher was surprised at how few people in his experiment spoke a second language after learning it in school.

Given this information, it can be inferred that the researcher is studying language learning in primary school children, who also have other subjects that require further learning. \n6. From this knowledge, we can eliminate options A and B. \n7.

The center means the Tardise was supposed to be in the center of the ship at one point and that location is the master control.\n6. The basement of a ship means it was at an unusually low location and that location could possibly be somewhere near to the master control of the Tardise.\n7. The master control office could be a place where people can have some control over the Tardise and can ask questions or suggest changes.\n8. The bowl of the ship in which the Tardise was once placed is not a good location for the master control.\n9. Therefore we can rule out option E: bowel of ship as the location of the master control.\n10. We can say that option C: the basement is probably a more suitable option as it is the location where the Tardise was located, and it is a close match to the description provided.\n11. The remaining options B: the middle office and D: the main office are not more suitable locations for master control as it is not possible to locate a device like Tardise in between the floor or office.\n12 Therefore option C: the basements is the most viable answer.\nSo the final option is C: the Basement\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following multiple-choice question. \n\nInput: The scientist wanted to learn more about the chemical composition of different substances.

We need first to eliminate options that do not represent typical responses after traveling, which would typically consist of physical, mental or emotional effects.\n3. Options B, C, D and E do not clearly represent a reaction to traveling, so they can be eliminated.\n4. That leaves us with two options A and E, which both represent an effect after long-distance traveling.\n5. While physically \"sickness\" is the result of a virus and thus not related to travel, it could be caused by \"motion sickness\" experienced by drivers and passengers while traveling.\n6. While \"fatigue\" is a by-product of prolonged activity, it could be associated with traveling more than other tasks like shopping.\n7. Looking at context clues within the question, we know that the travel activity can represent various aspects of traveling, like air travel, train travel, bus travel, etc.\n8. Therefore based on context clues, we can say that \"motion sickness,\" which is a result of vehicle travel, is the correct choice here.\n9. So, we can say the answer is B: motion sickness.\nSo the final answers is B: motion sicknes", "answer": "E: fatigue"}

The word \"on top of\" strongly implies that the object on top must be capable of supporting the weight of furniture.\n3. Options B: room and D: apartment are unsuitable as they are not objects that furniture can sit on top of.\n4. Option Floor is valid as it is typically a flat surface that can hold furniture securely.\n5. Option Roof is also valid as while it is a structure, it is relatively strong and provides a suitable surface.\n6. Option C: floor suggests a supportive floor surface, but the word is not \"a\" but \"to\", so this answer is misworded.\n7. The only remaining choice is \"on top of,\" but it is repeated and the sentence does not explain the context of the question. So, this choice has been eliminated.\n8. Thus, there are only two valid answers: Option A: roof, Option B: floor.\n9. Based on the context of the question, it is unlikely that a room or an apartment would be asked about, as these are not traditional structures that can carry furniture.\n10. Additionally, A and B are not used in the typical context of furniture placement in a home.\n11.

Choice \"bookstore\" suggests the store sells books, which in turn suggests either you are waiting for your transportation to take you to a library, museum, or bookshop, or that you are waiting there to buy one.\n3. Choose \"magazine\" would make sense if a magazine has content related to travelling or transportation, not necessarily just because you travel somewhere with that magazine.\n4. Choice \"newsstand\" suggests a shop that sells newspapers, so that would make sense if either you are waiting for a newspaper or a train to arrive at the station or newsstand.\n5. Choices \"waiting room\" and \"airport\" don't make sense since either choice would implied that you are waiting for a mode of transportation on rails, and since that isn't explicitly mentioned in the question or in any of the answers, it's safe to disregard both choices.\n6.

The choices provided include colours that we commonly see on traffic lights: red (not red-green), yellow, and orange, along with some colors we wouldn't normally expect to see on traffic lights, like green and blue.\n4. Let's examine each option closely: Green and blue are both often used as signals for different activities or situations, like for giving directions to enter a parking lot. But we don't commonly use these colors on traffic lights.\n5. Red and green are often used on traffic lights to indicate stop and go respectively, but on the flip side, we typically not see yellow or orange in a traffic light.\n6.

Since a birthday usually does not feature an occurrence of items in the sky, we can eliminate this as well.\n2-4. Similar to the previous point, since a birthday party usually isn't in the sky, we cannot determine the sky as the correct answer.\n2-5.

The question contains clues about parties and weekends, and it is likely to refer to the activities usually hosted on weekends.\n2 - 1. Looking at choices B - E, we can deduce that these parties usually take place in backyards, homes, or private properties.\n2 - 2. In contrast, baby showers usually involve a limited number of guests and are not hosted in a backyard. Therefore, we can eliminate option A: \"baby shower\" as the answer.\n2 - 3.

Looking closely at the options B: break, and D: tire provide the functionality or capability of a safe driving experience, which is imperative while approaching a traffic light. But we should determine which one is the most crucial.\n4. This can be done by observing the words in the options more closely: \"break\", and \"tire\" are singular, implying one component is solely focused on stopping/driving a vehicle safely. So, we can rule out option D: tire.\n5. Let's look at the option B: brake, which consists of breaks (plural), which would allow multiple stops to avoid a crash at a traffic light. So, this option can be eliminated as well.\n6.\"Seat belts\" are meant to help protect an occupant from the force of an accident or a collision. But are not directly related to a fast driving experience or a traffic light.

The places provided in the options are: bathroom, purse, drug store, hand lotion, water.\n3. We need to determine a suitable location for buying moisteners based on their nature and purpose.\n4. Looking into these options, we can eliminate purse and hand lotion as they are not places commonly found in a retails store.\n5. Option B: bathroom, this is an unlikely place to buy a moistener as it would not be likely to be used here.\n6. Option C: Drug store, this would be the most likely place to purchase a moistener, as it's a general store that sells a wide range of goods.\n7. Option D: Hand lotion, we can eliminate this as it is not a suitable location to purchase moisteners.\n8. Option E: water is also not where one would typically purchase moisteners as it is usually found in household.\n9. Therefore the answer would be C: Drug store.\nSo the final outcome is C: Drug store\n\nInput: To keep warm after getting dressed, you'd put on the? Choices: A: sweater B: socks C: hat D: jacket E: underwear\nOutput: 1: The question is asking which piece of clothing one would wear after getting dressed.\n2. We consider various options that someone might wear after getting dressed and decide which option is most likely to be worn to stay warm.\n3. Starting with option A: sweater, we can eliminate this since the question does not imply that the clothing is worn right after getting dressed. Similarly, we can eliminate options B: socks and C: hat due to similar reasons.\n4. Options D and E are not clothing items, so we can eliminate them as well.\n5. We are left with only option D: jacket, which is a common clothing item worn in cold weather to keep warm.\n6. Therefore the answer is D: jacket, the most likely option.\nSo the final result is D: jacket\n\nInput: To get their point across with force, the speaker used which of the following?

The terms have been used interchangeably, with the same or varying definitions in different contexts.\n3. With that in mind, let's examine the choices provided.\nChanging society through an action or demonstration is not necessarily done through violent conflict which can easily be ruled out as the answer.\nChanging society using an understanding is also not usually done through a form of forced violent conflict. So, this is also not the answer.\nThe same goes for changing society through a vote or a revolution. \n4.

Choices:  a: tell b: try to hold c: laugh d: yell e: say nothing\nOutput: 1.) The question is asking how would someone react if they saw someone, or someone was about to fall over. \n2.) The reactions that the question states, \"try to hold\", \"say nothing\", and \"hold\", do not always coincide, so we can only focus on the more common, predominant response. \n3.) \"Say nothing\" can seem irrelevant as it is hard to determine if a person who is about to fall would be yelling or saying something, but \"say nothing\" gives credence to the notion that there is no reaction, \n4.) \"Hold\" can have a broader range of interpretations as a person can hold a situation or hold something, so let's focus on the implied meaning in the question as this is how we can accurately determine the answer provided. \n5.) The answer \"holding\" or the option \"try to hold\" seems to better explain the context, as a person may react by using their strength to hold up someone who seems to be about to fall. \n6.) The option \"try to hold\", although more specific and specific to the context, does not clearly refer to strength or the use of strength in the answer provided.\n7.) Therefore, option \"try to hold, but not because he knew", "answer": "E: revolution"}

The question was about what humans take in, while breathing, and this doesn't provide the same answer.\n3. B: oxygen: Oxygen is the main component of air, so it is the most logical answer.\n4. C: abdominal Muscles: The abdominal muscles may be used in breathing, for instance, during intense exercise or physical activity. But they aren't the primary muscles involved in respiration.\n5. D: air: The air intake, though essential, is not a component taken in, but instead, the main element taken in during respiration is oxygen.\n6.

{"idx": 522, "text": "1.\"What does this make him feel?\" is asking what impact John's situation has on him.\n2. We can search for other details in the sentence to help us form a conclusion on this.\n3. Clues suggest the situation is something John needs to have and would make him excited or happier.\n4. We can immediately discard options like B: headaches and E: wanting more because they can't be related to a situation that makes someone feel better.\n5. It is not likely that someone can have feelings like being stoic and being happy simultaneously. So, option B: headaches is also eliminated.\n6. It is also difficult to get a feeling like being happy or wanting more if you are not able to get something \"important\" to you. Thus, option C: stoic is also eliminated. \n7. Option D: being happy could be a possibility provided John is able to receive the \"important\" thing he has wanted.\n8. Option E: wanting more seems an appropriate choice, though there might be slight confusion as it implies wanting more than one thing, not just one thing. But we won't disregard it. \n9. Looking at the possibilities for the whole situation, John is getting something \"important\" so he is happy, as he is getting what he wanted. He wants more because he didn't think he would get what he wanted.\n10. We can also consider other possibilities like option D: being happy may be a part of John's overall process because once he gets what he wanted, he will remain happy, although he also wants more as he wishes to get more things he is looking forward to. But we will focus on option C: stoic.\n11. When John is stoic, he is generally calm, so he cannot be happy since he already has what he wanted. But he may wish to get other things, for example, money, so he does not remain happy but also remains calm. However, option E: wanting more is not the answer. \n12. Now, our search returns option A: then have, which means John is able to have what he was looking for, hence, he can be happy and not be stoic. So, A: then have is the correct answer to the question. \nSo the final answer will be A: then have\n\nInput: What makes someone lose their balance? Choices:", "answer": "D: being happy"}

This is vague and unrelated to the question, so it can be eliminated.\n5) Option C: underwater, suggests that all fish spend their whole lives underwater, but that's false. Furthermore, it does not state where and what kind of water fish prefer. So this option is also vague and can't be trusted.\n6) Based on the above, the answer is B: body of water.\nSo the final answers is B: body of natural water\n\nInput: There is a small box outside the library what is it? A: a lunch box B: food C: books D: papers E: newspaper\nOutput: 1: The question contains a clue that the box provided is a small box outside a library.\n2: Based on the information given, the question asks what kind of box there is outside a library. Therefore, we need to eliminate all options except the most suitable one.\n3: Looking at the options: A: a lunchbox, B: books, C: papers, D: newspaper, and E: box - we can eliminate all options except for lunchbox (A) and box (E) since all other options could not explain what is inside the box and what the box is made of.\n4: It looks more probable that the box (D) is a lunchbox as it is described to be \"small\".\n5.

Choices:  a: football fans B: people C: children D: parents E: adults\nOutput: 1: The question asks about how to describe a large group of people involved in or attending a football game.\n2: We could use the term \"fans\" to describe those who are attending a football game but this can apply to a wide range of sports.\n3: Using the context of the question, the options \"children,\" \"parents\" and \"adults\" are invalid since these types of categories can refer to the parents or other related people attending a football game, but the question is specifically looking for the term to be applied to \"ALL\" attendees, not just that specified category. \n4: The other options \"people\" and \"children\" are too generic.\n5: Therefore, we are left with term \"football fans.\"\nSo the final answer will be a: football fans\n\nInput: The best thing about the concert was the music, was the other songs in the album any good?

The remaining choice D: Zoo is suitable as the first part of the question indicates what the monkey was doing.\n5. The second part mentions the conductor's comment that the monkey works in the zoo, therefore we can eliminate E: South Africa as well.\n6: Answer D: Zoo is the right choice as the conductor's remark indicates the monkey does in fact work in the zoo.\nSo the final solution is D: Zoo.\n\nInput: Where do you place a check mark once you fill it in?

This is a common saying that is sometimes attributed to Thomas A Quincey, a literary and legal scholar.\n4. Choice A: \"learn about subject\" is the act of gathering knowledge and understanding to gain depth and context. Since the person who speaks this phrase is concerned about the crime committed, this is not a suitable choice.\n5. Choices B: \"learn new\" and C: \"find truth\" refer to the gathering of information and knowledge, which is not the issue, rather the use of ignorance as a legal or morally binding defense.\n6. Choice E,\"judge\" is a choice that cannot be interpreted as the speaker of the quote in the question, which rules out this option.\n7.\"Ignorance is bliss\" is a mis-quote. The original statement is \"ignorance is not bliss\", meaning it is not in the best interest of a person if they choose to stay ignorant. \n8.

The options are not specific to the equipment, as to whether they are related to the circuitry or power, although they do contain a variety of words connected to electrical supply: company, telephone network, airport, cables & wires, freeway.\n4. But they don't contain the word \"connection\" or any words that can be defined as a \"connection\" between power (such as a connection between phone lines or airports and electrical grids)\n5. There only option that comes close to fitting the bill is D: wires. The connection between the circuitry and the power is done with wires, therefore the only option that can be eliminated as it contradicts the question is A: company.\n6. However, there's another issue with this answer: company refers to an organization that provides services in various sectors. We can't say for sure that an \"official connection\" within a company is the circuit within the device that is not powered on, rather than say a connection to another device that also fails when it's operating on internal company power.\n7. That narrows our options down to just two: C: airport and B: telephone network. There is a connection between the phone lines and the electricity as electricity powers the equipment that creates the phone lines, but there's no connection between an airport and an electricity power source.

Choices B:Pantry and E: cellar, are areas in the kitchen where food can be stored, especially canned foods, but we haven't yet seen any issues in relation to storing such food there.\n6. In the last choice, D: pantry, we can directly related problems to canned food storage in the pantry. For example, excessive humidity/wet conditions may create mold in canned food, and rodents can be attracted to canned food which may cause damage to the pantry.\n7. Therefore by process of elimination, the answer C: Grocery store is the most suitable answer to this question.\nSo the correct answer is C: Grocery Store\n\nInput: When should you check a car for flat tires, it is when it has been?

Therefore, the choices that are left for consideration are B and D: socialize, talk, and meet people.\n9. The question is asking what a simple or trivial interaction is called.\n10.

Restaurant does not fit as it seems unlikely, we are dealing with a reception setting, and a restaurant is not usually the venue.\n6. The word churchbasement is spelled correctly, and it matches the word reception, therefore we can assume that a churchbassement is a place where receptions are held which makes this a correct choice.\nSo the final choice is C: church basement.\n\nInput:What is the main difference between a doughnut and a donut?

C) Doing it in a different way.\nOutput: 1- The choices imply a number of actions, namely 'doing as asked', 'doing it better' and 'doing it in a different/better way'.\n2-Doing as asked is not a guaranteed method to obtain success, as it depends on factors beyond our control such as the competency of the person in charge. It doesn't guarantee the best result. \n3-Doing it better, implies that our efforts should be to enhance the original result by improving on how the task is done. This would increase the chance of getting the best result and therefore is the preferred choice.\n4-Doing, it in a different/ better way is not preferable over doing it better, as it merely indicates doing it", "answer": "A: fast food restaurant"}

Choices:  _A_: have a name that stands out _B_: have a tall height _C_: have a loud voice _D_: have bright clothing _E_: have knowledge on the subject\nOutput: 1) The question's context revolves around a group of individuals, and there seems to be an emphasis placed on finding a specific individual amidst the crowd.\n2) The best option will require the use or application of the given statement: A boy was searching. There is no mention of the boy finding the friend, but instead, he was searching for the friend.\n3) The options provided are the characteristics of the friend who was being searched for.

{"idx": 782, "text": "1 The question is about a situation in which John bought products for his swolleding testicles.\n2. The sentence suggests that he felt something due to buying the products, which is probably a pleasurable sensation.\n3. The answer has to align with the sentiment and context of the question.\n4. A: pleasure - It could be a joyful feeling, but the context suggests that it could be a pleasurable feeling, and we can easily use the synonyms to solve the question, so this can be an answer. We can eliminate the options C: bankruptcy and E: owning.\n5. B: delight. This can be a synonym for pleasure, which we have already considered as an answer. However, delight is a less probable answer as it is an adjective and not a noun, so this can be eliminated as incorrect\n6. D: agony - Another synonym for pleasure, we can rule out this option.\n7, The remaining option is A, pleasure.\nSo the final and probably the only answer is A: pleasure\n\n#### 3.

The options provided in the blank are - analyse -predict- develop-evaluate.\n5. analyse and predict are too broad to match the context of the sentence, and develop isn't", "answer": "D: agony"}
{"idx": 786, "text": "1: The question asks about the reasons for competing against someone. \n2. People often compete in order to prove their superiority, hence the desire to win (C), or to achieve recognition or success (D), or as a way to show off the things they can accomplish for themselves (E).\n3. However, people usually don't compete with one another for friendship sake (B), and because someone has a particular skill (A) they feel needs competition.\n4. This leaves us with the answer as \"C: desire to win\", as being recognized or celebrated for their superiority or competitive edge (A) is more likely to motivate someone to compete than anything else.\n5. Therefore the best answer is \"C: desire to Win\".\nSo the final answer if \"C: desire to WIN\"\n\nInput:What type of creature does a lion mostly fear? Choices:  Tiger Bear Elephant E: all of the above\nOutput: 1 and 2: The question asks what kind of creature a lion mostly fears. \n3. The options are: tiger, bear, elephant, and, E, all of the above, which implies more than one choice.\n4. Lions are typically solitary animals, meaning that they don't often face a situation where they fear a large group of animals.\n5. Therefore 'all of the above' is not an accepted answer since the lion is not threatened by other options, including elephant.\n6. We can immediately eliminate 'E: all of the above.'\n7. Looking at bear and elephant, bears don't live in densely populated areas, and elephants are mostly herbivorous and often avoid conflict altogether.\n8. Hence, we can eliminate 'bear and elephant' as unlikely answers.\n9. Thus, the only answer that meets the question is 'tiger.'\n10. Therefore the question should be changed to 'What type of creature does A lion mostly fear?'\nSo the final answer would be 'tiger'\n\nInput:What does a vampire use to suck blood?

They were? Choices:  the ones experiencing death and loss. The ones who experienced death and loss. The people dying in the war. The people going into war. The people who wanted to go into the war.\nOutput: 1.) \"After hearing about the event,\" the person who heard it is impacted by the news either directly or indirectly. 2.) All of the choices that have been given are statements of people who want to do something. 3.) Out of all of them, \"The ones who wanted to go into war.\" makes sense only when they didn't get that chance, 4.)

It cannot be them. 5.)

Option C: The people going into the war - People who want to fight or join the war is not their answer as the sentence talks about people who wanted to go but didn't get to. 7.)

Option E: The people who wanted The people who wanted to fight in the event can easily be narrowed", "answer": "D: surface of earth"}
{"idx": 794, "text": "1, The question is asking about what a satisfied person might do after having a fruitful experience.\n2. The various options that the question presents are actions that a satisfied person may perform to denote satisfaction with their experience.\n3.

Crossing the street seems unrelated as it has nothing to do with the previous scenario, leaving only three options: feeling happy, shouting at, and feeling satisfied. \n5. Feeling satisfied does not denote happy feelings, and is not an immediate action after a satisfied act. The two choices, feeling happy and shouting at are not relevant in the sense of the options provided.\n6. Therefore we can conclude that the best possibility for the answer is feeling satisfied.\nSo the final possible answer is feeling satisfied\n\nInput: What country won the 2022 World cup? Choices: 1.

The meaning of the sentence relates to the harmful effects of drinking too much beer over a long period.\n3. Let us assume that someone is addicted to beer. For this situation, the most common reason why someone consumes too much beer is that 'it's a liquid that gives them a buzz.'\n4. This statement will also have a common effect which we can see in the following options: \"water,\" \"foamy,\" \"intoxicating,\" and \"harmful.\"\n5. The options \"water\" and \"foamy\" are not applicable here as beer is not water or foam.\n6. Similarly, the options \"intoxicating\" and \"harmful\" can be related to beer. This makes it difficult for people who abuse it as they may consume more than the required amount that can have devastating effects, such as addiction or liver damage.\n7. Let us look through the options \"liquid\" and \"alcoholic.\" The option \"liquid\" is a general statement that does not apply only to alcohol, so we will disregard it.\n8. The option \"alcoholic\" is more specific and related to beer, making it the most suitable answer to our given context.\n9. So the final answer is E, \"alcoholic\", but if none of the options satisfy, we can assume the option \"it's a liquid\" is a more specific version of the option \"alcoholics\" because it refers to beer and its effects, rather than to alcohol in general.

Choices: A: the car B: the repair C: the accident D: the mechanic E: the mechanic's service\nOutput: 1: The question seeks information about the car repair shop where the car goes for the repair. It describes the car as \"damaged in an accident\" and thus requiring a repair.\n2. There are several locations that repair cars: a garage, mechanic's service and automobile shops.\n3. Choosing the garage would provide the wrong information because there is only one garage mentioned in the question - \"the owner's garage\".\n4. \"The repair\" is not a place of repair - it is a process in which the repair will be done. So, this is wrong.\n5. Choosing \"the accident\" as a location of the repair would be incorrect because accidents can be of different severity and the accident described in the question resulted in severe damage to the car. It's not clear whether the repair shop is the place there was an accident or it's a place where the car goes for repairs.\n6. Choosing \"the mechanic's service\" may not be wrong, however, it's not a logical answer, since there is just one mechanic mentioned in the question - and that is the person responsible for the car damage.\n7.

Similarly, \"exhaustion\" does not imply any increase in overall strength or endurance. Both options seem like a negative reaction to physical activity, not an ensuing improvement. \n5. The final options are \"become stronger\" and \"use energy.\" These options are appropriate because they suggest a positive outcome of exercise, i.e., either greater endurance or increase in strength. \n6. Therefore, after considering all the options, the answer is: D: become stronger or B: energetic\nSo the final answer would be B: exercising leads to increased energy and become stronger.\n\nInput: When someone is not ready to leave they will what?

There are other qualities that might make one suitable for a circus-related role, but fitness is the key consideration when the question asks for a physical requirement to work at the circus.\n3. So, looking at the list of options, \"fit\" and \"prepared\" are physical qualities and are suitable for the question.\n4. The choice \"ready\" does not mean physically fit but refers to being ready for something or someone who shows up.\n5. Therefore \"A: ready\" is not an answer to this question.\n6.

The next option A: smell smoke is not related to cooking and doesn't apply in this context, it would be associated with a burning food smell, which is unlikely to happen with a pizza in the oven.\n5. This also means C: burnt is not applicable either, it is now redundant.\n6. Option B: catch cold: a person can catch cold at any time, and a person can also be burnt at any time, so B is not a suitable answer either, because it is not specific to being in an oven for an hour.\n7. So we are left with the choices remaining, D: look angry and E: bank savings.\n8. Looking at the options D: look angry could be true if the person is angry about a pizza in the middle of the table or about smelling smoke, which could occur during the entire oven time.\n9.

The options provided, A: pretty flowers, B: hen house, C: natural habitat, D: storybook, and E: dense forest, all seem unrelated to a fox looking for a new home.\n5. Looking at the clues we have, we can guess that our fox was not looking for pretty flowers, a hen house, or a storybook.\n6. Moreover, D: dense forest, in spite of its relation to forests, is more related to the type than to any physical characteristic or aesthetic.\n7. C: natural habitat seems more likely as we know foxes live in forests and have an instinctive sense of where they are from. However, this does not immediately suggest that the fox is in search of a particular habitat.\n8. This narrows our options to two - A: pretty flowers and B: hen house.

Between the choices left, we need to compare in depth the choice of \"excitement\" and \"anger.\"\n4. First thing, we notice that \"excitement\" is a good aspect to have after playing a sport, and we can also eliminate the choice \"anger,\" for the same reason, which can lead to some conflict or hostility, for sure, but not to a physical hurt.\n5. Another important thing is that we can disregard the choice \"hurting,\" because the game of soccer involves a bunch of physical contact, which happens all the time, and getting hurt is inevitable.\n6.

Therefore, it suggests that Sean was concerned about something other than being caught by the police and was worried about it.\n4. The choices given include \"The reward money\", \"Hurt feelings\", \"being found out\", \"Problems\" and \"trouble\".\n5. Since the sentence implies that Sean is worried, it cannot be \"Reward Money\", because he does not feel any benefit from hiding the body.\n6. Similarly, \"Hurt Feelings\", which refers to what someone thinks of themselves, is not appropriate either, since here, Sean is more concerned about escaping problems caused by others, not about how this would affect him personally.\n7.

They are raptors that nest in trees, on the ground or in water and they often move around in search of food.\n3. Options that are more likely to be used based on natural behaviour can be eliminated.\n4. \"Pine tree\" is likely not used in natural behaviour and the only option left to choose from is \"Forest.\"\n\"Open country\" would not apply as this is more common in open, grassy areas and open landscapes.\n5. Bald eagles would not be seen near washington as this is not their habitat.\n6. \"Wildlife refuge\" is not a suitable place to find a bald eagle.\n7. \"In the sky\" doesn't qualify as a habitat or home location and is also incorrect, given that bald eagles are frequently seen on the ground, trees or near water to fish.\nSo the final correct answer is: B: open country.\n\nInput: What term is used to describe a group or mass of fish? Choices:  B: school C: shoal E: swarm F: pod\nOutput: 1: A group of fish traveling and feeding together is called a school, and a large mass of fish is referred to as an aggregation or shoal.\n2. There can be different names and terms to describe a group or a cluster of fish.\n3. Shoal is different from aggregation in that it describes a larger group of fish, usually made up of many species and larger than a school.\n4. A group of fish is not necessarily a colony as this term would refer to other groups, such as fish inhabiting the same geographical area.\n5. A group of fish of different sizes is not a pod as this word is used to describe the term pod in reference to a smaller group of closely related species living together.\n6. Thus, the appropriate choice in the questions must be either C or E.\n7. While it is correct to say E: swarm is used to refer to a large mass of insects or other living creatures, in this context, the term C: shoal seems to be a more suitable choice as it was used to describe a group of fish.\n8. Therefore the correct answer is C: sho", "answer": "D: wildlife refuge"}
{"idx": 45, "text": "1- The question is asking one specific reason for which a person may indulge in conversations with friends.\n2. The answer can be inferred from the context and the following clues: \"a\" and \"likely\" in the first option suggest that information is also not the only goal, while \"chat\" in \"chat with friends\" is a conversational activity and is used as a replacement for communication, and can be used for multiple things such as passing time, creating a fun atmosphere or even expressing feelings. \n3. Out of the given options, we can cross out A,B, D.\n4. As mentioned earlier, the question is asking not necessarily for the one correct purpose of the conversation but can also be based on the specific conversation.\n5. There are multiple options based on some of given statements, for example, conversation can be used for bonding.\n6.

The first thing we should notice in these choice options is that none of the choices contain the phrase \"survivor finally.\"\n2.) While the options can be seen as somewhat general, this is not how the given clue is used in the sentence: \"Knowing how to read the land\".\n3.) So if we go down this road, we would have to include the clues left by weather and the movements of the sun.\n4.) In my opinion, the best answer is choice B. Since the only mention of a movement is in the air, which is in the weather.\n5.) All other answers are too broad and can even be applied to many other situations where an \"oriented\" person could get information using these other senses, not just weather", "answer": "E: social bonding"}
{"idx": 49, "text": "1. The question asks about the type of sensor which measures the distance between objects and sets off an alarm when a certain distance is reached.\n2. The only sensor that can do this is the proximity sensor, and the expert correctly called it by this term. \n3. Explanations regarding the function of a proximity sensor typically include the term \"proximity sensor\" and it's most likely they were referring to this type of sensor as well.\n4. From this reasoning, we can eliminate options A: near B: here C: closeness D: this E: this.\n5. The term \"proximity\" is synonymous with \"near\" and \"this\" is the noun form of the word \"this\", so both these are not the answer.\n6. The term \"this\" can also mean \"these\" in the plural form, which could refer to two or more things, but is not relevant to the question.\n7.

Robots are capable of performing tasks that human cannot or would not want the perform themselves, so these provide a benefit.\n2) We can eliminate option A: do a better Job, because this option is redundant or unnecessary.\n3) Option B: don't need rest. Robots do need breaks or periods of rest, because they are machines and can operate consistently or over long periods, but they need to stop and rest as well.\n4) Option C: be cheaper This option is not directly relevant to the question, rather is a general attribute of any automated equipment.\n5) Option D: being more efficient is correct, as automated tools can efficiently perform repetitious tasks, which people would not.\n6) Option E: do not require breaks, so we cannot consider this.\n7) therefore, the only choice remaining is option D: more efficient. \nso the correct answer is option D : more efficient \n\nInput: How", "answer": "D: proximity"}

The second option, \"dance hall\", can have fiddles but is not where one can typically hear a fiddle playing.\n4. The third option, \"orchestra\", is a place where a string section can typically have fiddles playing, but it's not a place one can typically hear a fiddler playing.\n5.

Choices:  I: Amazon II: Bed Bath and Beyond III: Staples IV: Target V: Walmart VI: JCPenney\nOutput: 1) The question is asking about an ideal retailer to buy a new toastable.\n2) The first three options are retails stores - Toasters are kitchen appliances which can be purchased from stores that sell such kitchen appliances.\n3) The fifth and sixth option are other clothing and houseware stores respectively.\n4) The rest of the options are online stores.\n5) All stores can sell toastables, so it is crucial to determine the best choice based on relevant criteria, as well as the convenience of having it delivered to your home.\n6) Looking at the other options, Target (IV), walmart (V), and Amazon (I) would be good choices. These stores offer both in-store and online delivery services, and are convenient for delivery in case you aren't available during store opening hours.\n7) However, Target (IV) and Walmart (V) are less likely to offer better deals as compared to Amazon (I), so it's best to buy the toaster from Amazon or Bed Bath and Beyond (III), as these stores usually have better pricing and", "answer": "C: orchestra"}

As they are night animals, many insects depend on them for food.\n3. Many insects are food for animals. So bats are an important link in the food web.\n4. Many fruit-bearing trees depend on bats for pollination.\n5. All these points make it clear that bats are important to many humans.\n6. The last sentence implies that although bats often scare humans, the answer lies in what is good for us, and not what is scary.\n7. Insect-eating bats consume up to half of their own body weight daily. This is one of the reasons they scare us.\n8. Insects can sometimes spoil fruit or cause loss of fruit.\n9.

From the choices provided, there are two sports that come to mind, which would answer the question.\n3. Basketball is a sport that utilises a ball as well as uniforms worn by participants. So, it can help us answer the question.\n4. We also have to consider the context of the question, such as the places where people in uniforms playing with a ball are likely to interact.\n5. A \"hole\" can be an underground tunnel or some other confined space, where people in uniforms would not necessarily play with a ball as part of the activity.\n6. Watching a \"television\" might include people wearing costumes that are not uniforms, and they are unlikely to play with any ball.\n7. A \"pool table\" is used to play a game where people usually play with a small cue ball, not a ball used in sports.\n8. Finally \"Sports events\" may involve people wearing uniforms and playing with balls, but the event itself wouldn't allow for direct and close interaction of people in uniforms with balls, and the question asks us to specifically mention where people in uniform play with the ball.\n9. The most plausible answer would be the combination of C: \"sporting goods store\" and D: \"sporting event\" for people in uniforms to play with a ball. A sporting goods store would offer products that people in uniform might require in a sporting event. This is likely where they would shop for the items they require. In addition, sporting events occur where people wearing uniforms play with a ball, thus providing a place where people in uniform play ball with a ball. Both options answer the question.\n10.

The rest could be a period of rest such as in class or office, or sleep, in which people feel rested or alert after a period of rest\n4. The other answer options are not related to the feeling after rest as they describe the aftermath of rest, such as \"active,\" which refers to an action that occurs after rest like getting out of bed, or \"hunger,\" which describes the desire to eat after rest.\n5. \"In motion\" is the only option that accurately describes the feeling of alertness and activity after a rest.\nSo the final option from the four choices is to select \"in motion\".\n\nInput: I was thinking about going to the store to get some food and then I realized that my apartment complex didn't take cash so I couldn't use the ATM machine that was conveniently sitting outside the store.

The given options are ways of finding a name in a library, which are: use the phone book, find the author for the name, look at the table of content, or ask for help. \n3. The options: 'use the phone book', 'find author with the name' and 'look at the table of content' are ways of finding books and authors with a name. We need to choose an option which relates to finding a certain name in the library. And this is 'use the phone book' option. \n4. The only option left to choose is: F 'ask for help'.

Flowers are not emotions. \n3) Like might be used in the context of something with aesthetic value. \n4) All choices are negative. \n5) Person can't just pick flowers for sake of flower picking.

Choices:  a: at the door b: in the bed c: under the chair d: in the kitchen e: in the backyard\nOutput: 1 The question is asking about a cat's daily activity patterns.\n2. The answer should be an activity that the cat often does at a single location.\n3. Option A: at the door, though it refers to a location at which a cat can often be found, it is not a specific activity that the cat performs during the day.\n4. Option b: in the bed, if the cat is often found in the bed, it may indicate that it is one of its regular activity. But it is not a single activity, so it cannot be a correct answer.\n5. Options C: under the chair and D: in the kitchen, are not frequent activities of cats, so they are out of the question.\n6.

The first 2 have a connection or association to the learning of uplight piano but the other two are unrelated, so we eliminate A: music room, B: music store.\n4. A music class can be associated to uplight piano, but not necessarily immediately after learning it. So, we can dismiss E: house.\n5. A music class can teach people to play the piano but a music store cannot. So, we can discard C: music class.\n6. Let's consider D: medium: a place that connects uplight piano and learning is medium, which can be interpreted as a person. Thus, D might be the answer.\n7, But a person can be in many places and we are not given specific details about \"somebody\", so we can discard D: medium. \n8. A medium might have been previously associated to uplight playing, but it's not an accurate answer. However, since D: medium is not the right answer, D: music class might be.\n9.

Choices:  I: inventory II: hiring  III: buying IV: selling V: all of the above\nOutput: 1). The question asks about when this company was selling so much stock. \n2. The stock in a company is not bought and sold every day, and so the company might have made a purchase of too much stock that it can't sell.\n3. The options are a mixture of actions that a company could take regarding its stock, including hiring employees to help sell it, buying it to increase stock levels, and selling it to make money. And it was the act of selling that caused the issue of \"too much stock.\" \n4.

For buying, the company was already doing that by buying the stock. It just bought more than it could sell. \n6. For hiring, the more employees it has, the more difficult it is to fit everything in to manage sales.\n7. We're left with selling. This is the correct answer. \n8. Therefore, there are no other options, and the answer is the one marked \"for selling.\"\nSo the final answer will be in option III: selling\n\nInput: What type of food did the caterer say would be served at the party?

The blowfish's \"life\" refers to his character or nature as a wild animal rather than his physical existence as an aquatic creature. \n3. The answer to the riddle is \"on his own\" (the blowfish lives \"free\" and \"on his own\").\n4. Blowfishes are mostly found in rivers and the ocean, with only a few known to be inhabited in some pet shops or fish farms. Therefore, they do not live \"on his own\" in a pet shop.\n5. Moreover, a blowfish is a marine animal that lives naturally in the open ocean, where they are free to roam and survive as a species, contrary to the answer that states they live in a pet shop. \n6. Another key clue is that blowfish \"lives on his own\"; this suggests they are free creatures and not a part of any particular community.\n7. Considering the context of the question, we can eliminate C: great outdoours (where does he live), and E: little mermaed as a logical answer choice. \n8. Blowfish are found in rivers and the sea, not a great outdoor area, or a fictional area in the little mermaed fairy tale.\n9.

Option B, reproduction, and option D, propagation.\n8. After some consideration, Option C doesn't seem to be the solution as it seems generic, and doesn't relate to both birth and propagation since it deals with any type of present. So, it'll be eliminated.\n9. If we eliminate option C, there only remains reproduction and propagation. Since both these options relate to new life and the continuance of the species, the answer should be either of them.\n10. Since the question emphasizes that it begins and ends with new life, the answer should start from new life, and end with new life, which in this context can be interpreted as reproduction.\n11. Therefore, option C, reproduction, is the correct and most appropriate answer to the question. \nSo the final answer would be C: reproduction\n\nInput: Why do you often wear a seatbelt? Choices: 1.

We're looking for an answer where the words themselves indicate that the person becomes alert after doing the action.

B: Volunteering 3.C: Blood work 4.D: Diagrams 5.E: Blood work 6.F: Blood work 7.G: Volunteering 8.H: Education\nOutput: 1: This question asks to distinguish between a few alternatives in response to the statement, \"What can lead to someone becoming an engineer?\"\n2: This can be clearly eliminated since the correct answer was Blood work at the end and education is not the result of blood work.\n3: Similarly, if you do not have blood work you cannot become a doctor. Hence the answer can be ruled out after first two letters.\n4: The question states that a person becomes a doctor for a person is through education and Blood work is the correct option and not education.\n5: If you want to become a doctor through blood work, then this option is also out of the answer choices available to you. Again, education is not a prerequisite for a doctor.\n6: This is quite similar to above since Blood work is chosen before education.\n7: Through blood work itself, a person can not become a doctor, Blood work is an eligibility criterion but not a process.\n8: This may not be considered a direct link between Blood work and education.\n9: The correct answer was Blood work and was chosen earlier than Education.\n10: Thus, we can reasonably conclude that Education means Education that precedes blood work.\nSo the final answers are C.Education.F.B", "answer": "A: botanic garden"}

The question includes several clues about states and locations which is the typical context and criteria for determining where to locate someone.\n3. However, options A: at the zoo, B: south caroliana, and C: the hen house, are not relevant to the question, so eliminate them.\n4. In this, we are looking for the state in which the person has seen the fox. \n5. Thus, the only options left would be D: louisina and E: arkansas.\n6. The state of louisiana is landlocked, and located in the southern part of the US.\n7. The state of arkansas is also landlocked, southern, and borders both west and north, which suggests that louisiana is also at an elbow state. Since the person in the question is probably there visiting someone they are meeting at a new place, the elbow state rule suggests they are probably there to meet someone at a given destination.\n8. Therefore the person is most likely in the state of arkansas and the answer choice is E: arkansas, which is the only state remaining, compared to all other options.\nSo the final answered is E: arkansa\n\nInput: People love it when someone goes to the store to buy something specifically for them!

We expect to find contraceptive in a health center, but we don\u2019t assume we would go to get a contraceptive immediately at a health center \u2013 so, C is a more likely option.\n5. In option B: Vagina, a contraceptive is a device we insert or place into the vagina. So that option is incorrect.\n6. We can ignore option D: drawer, because a contraceptive is small enough to be kept in a cabinet or drawer, and we do not expect to get one from there directly.\n7. The last option E: medicine cabinet, is a place where we would likely keep a contraceptive, if we had one. We can therefore eliminate all other options.\n8.

The term \"cliff\" is used in this question as a kind of structure or shape of land, thus cliff can't be the answer as \"plain\" is used in this paragraph. \"Mountain\" and \"sandplain\" can be excluded as they don't match the category \"hole\" in a plain.\n3. \"Gorge\" is another form of a cliff, it is a wide and deep valley formed by a river and it's usually associated with cliffs, which can't be the hole in the plain.\n4. \"Hill\" can be excluded from the question as this term refers to relatively small land formations that are much lower than mountains. Furthermore, this word isn't included in the sentence.\n5. The remaining option is D: \"hole\"\nSo the final answer for 1 is D: hole.\n\n1. It has a man-made hole in it\n2. It is a plain\n3.

The word \"any time\" in Option D implies that accidents happen at any time, anywhere and to anybody, not specifically to their area.\n7. Therefore the correct answer is E: happen anywhere. So the final answer is E, happen anywhere", "answer": "E: happen anywhere"}

Choices:  A B C D  E\nOutput: 1.) The question asks about a type of store that a grandmother is likely to frequent.\n2) The options provided are stores that cater to different age groups or have a unique appeal to a specific type of audience.\n3) Since the person referred to in the question is a grandmother, we can rule out choices A, B, E. These do not serve the elderly or people in that age group.\n4) Choices D: a store near one's college and C: a store that sells books, might be frequented by people over a specific age group but don't fit the criteria of a grandmother. Hence, these can be eliminated as well.\n5) Hence, looking at the remaining options we can conclude that most grandmothers go to either E: an old people's home, or F: a grocery store.\n6) Grocery stores, like those in F, can cater to the necessities of a wide demographic with different age groups so they cannot be eliminated as a suitable answer.\n7) Therefore, we can conclude that the most likely place for grandmother to shop at is a grocery store since it is a place she would likely want to go to meet her basic nutritional needs.\nSo the final conclusion is F: a Grocery Store\n\nInput: One reason to visit a hospital is to?

It's a question that asks about being disrespected.\n2) The options provided are disparagement, contumely, disrespect, and contempt and are things we give to something and to someone.\n3) So, this means we are not talking about the word disrespect.\n4) If we use the logic of the question, she faces a lot of what, if there is a sentence in which she is disrespected and this statement is true, we mean what.\n5) Looking at the given options, contumely means a lot of being rude, and disparagement, meaning a lot of contempt or disrespect.\n6) Both these options are disrespect or being disrespected. Therefore, it is better not to focus on the choice of options but on the logic or reasoning behind answering the question.\n7) If we go by the reason, the logical answer is option B: being rude because it means that Jill is a rude person and thus faces a lot of being ruder or being rude.\n8) In this way, the answer is B: being rude.\nSo the final is B: being ruder\n\nInput: After she received all the money, she was happy.

Let' get rid of the options which don't match the treatment the old-timer would have done. \"Let blood\" doesn't seem to be the right option; neither does \"distance himself.\" It is out of context. We can easily dismiss these two.\n4. Since the question revolves around the past when no heart transplant was done, \"perform surgery\" also cannot be chosen.\n5. Therefore \"study medicine\" is our only option left, as old times it was the only way to study medicine.\n6. The answer is E: study medicine\n\nInput: Which of these was usually the goal in college?

The options provided comprise a list of probable goals for a person attending college.\n \n3.) These goals are in general terms. For example, while A: becoming an engineer, B: becoming an accountant, C:becoming a teacher, D: becoming a doctor, or E: becoming financially independent are each goals associated with college, they do not describe any particular goal which a person would hope to achieve.\n4.) Looking at the options, only D: becoming a doctor and E: becoming financially independence both seem to describe desirable goals.\n5.) If we are looking for the better goal, we have to choose the one which is more useful and valuable. In this case, we can eliminate B: becoming an account and A: becoming an engineer as while accounting and engineering can offer a steady income, neither provide much job security in most cases, nor are they considered fields which are of high value.\n6.) Similarly, D: becoming a teacher and E: becoming financing independent can equally be eliminated as one isn't particularly useful for most students and the other provides less value overall.\n7.) There are two viable options which are left:\nD: becoming a doctor and becoming financially independent.

{"idx": 425, "text": "1: The question is asking about what the goal of the basketball competition is.\n2. We can eliminate Option A: bounce the basketball as the question specifically asks about goals instead of actions; bouncing a basketball is a basketball action. \n3. The remaining options are all related to achieving a goal. The key is to decide the most probable option based on the context of the question.\n4. Looking closely at the options they can be broadly classified into two areas: \n5. Firstly, fun aspects of completing the goal: having fun (C), competing (B) and race (E). \n6. The second set has more specific aspects: scoring points (D).\n7. Option A: \"have fun\" doesn't match the scenario of competing, so it can be left out. \n8. Option B: \"compete\" is a fun or playful activity, which can be combined with the goal. So it can be ruled out too. \n9. Option C: \"race\" or \"race against time\" is a similar situation and is also used by some players to increase the fun of the activity. So, this option can be eliminated too. \n10. Option D: \"score points\" is the only explicit goal set for the competitors; it is a specific goal of the sport and would be the likely choice when choosing between multiple goals.\n11.

{"idx": 429, "text": "1. The question refers to the intent behind listening to an expert speak.\n2. The six choices provided include learning, fatigue, mercy, empathy, anxiety, and attention.\n3. Let us take each choice in turn and rule out those that are clearly not relevant.\n4. 'Attention' is a broad term that is not specific enough to indicate a specific meaning or motivation.\n5. 'Mercy' is a noun which refers to a feeling of kindness, not directly related to the intent of listening to an expert speak; therefore, not relevant to the question.\n6. 'Fatigue' is commonly associated with exhaustion, but not so much with listening to an expert's lecture or speech.\n7. Choice 'empathy' and 'anxiety' are mental states which may be associated with feelings in response to events or lectures, but these are not the main concerns here. We can eliminate these two options.\n8. Thus, the only options worth considering are 'learning' and 'attention'. Let us see if there is anything in the content of the question that may suggest that 'attention' might be better choice than 'learning'.\n9. No. The question is asking what you are 'hoping' to do, not what you might be doing. Thus, the most logical interpretation of the intent is 'learning'.\n10. Therefore, based on logic and consideration of all the choices available, the answer is A : learning\nSo the final answer B: fatigue is incorrect.\n\nInput:Why do bubbles when placed in a solution pop when being agitated? Choices: 1. B: because water is a good conductor 2. C: bubbles need oxygen 3. E: because of the solution 4. D: because water is lighter than bubbles 5. A: because of the vapor\nOutput: 1.) If the question refers to bubbles containing air that are placed in a solution and agitated, it is likely the question is asking why the bubbles pop.\n2.) The correct answer is that the bubbles pop because they contain air, the solution contains water, and there is no oxygen in the mixture.\n3.)

The most likely is the answer that makes sense in the context of the \"American cotton mouth\" phrase, which is the third piece of \"American\".\n5) The third option, \"from\" is used because it refers to the \"American cotonmouth\", not the entire snake.\n6) There are two options left, \"snake\" and \"tree\".\n7) The only word that could be used after \"tree\" is \"snake\", which provides more context to \"cottonmouth\" and \"American snake\" not \"tree\".\n8) Thus, option E: \"snake\" will be the answer.\nSo the final sentence is E: snake\n\nInput:A giraffe is a large animal, is a giraffe a mammal?

Let us explore the options; The options A and B don't follow the logical course of action to place the check; \"Cash registers\" and \"desk drawers\" hold money, not checks.\n4. We can safely eliminate \"Pay envelope\" and \"Box\" as these do not make sense to place a check in.\n5.

We can exclude option C because it can't be done before one goes to the party.\n5. Option D is not applicable because getting drunk and having sex can't be done together, so it can be rejected.\n6.

So the total number of hair bottles isn't pertinent to the question.\n4. We need to identify the place where the delivery man delivered a whole bottle of hair shampoos.\n5.

{"idx": 473, "text": "1) The phrase \"What would you normally expect...\" refers to the norm that is generally used by people, and not cats.\n2) This suggests that we will be providing the expected phrase that a cat might use.\n3) Hence, the appropriate choice to select would be one that does not resemble what a cat would say.\n4) Option B: See king, option C: Meow, and option E: Live many years are not appropriate responses, as they do not resemble the sound a cat makes or the time a cat lives.\n5) Hence, we can conclude that the expected response would be in options A: hello and D: Drink water, as these are appropriate responses, resembling what cat would say, and the amount of time a cat lives. Hence, the answer would be D: Drink water.\nSo the final question is D: Drink water\n\nInput: A man saw a large flock of seagulls in a local park, what was he thinking? Choices:  I was thinking about going to sea I was thinking about getting a bird I was thinking about sea gulls I was thinking about flying to the park I was thinking about the bird park\nOutput: 1.) The question asks about what the person, who saw the flock of seagulps, was thinking.\n2.) Among the options, both I was thinking about going and I was thinking about flying were not the possible thoughts, because the person had already been to the park, so a park can't be flying too. Also, I am going/I'm going has two different meanings and doesn't fit well with the other sentences.\n3.) Hence, the second-best fit is I was thinking about my bird.\n4.) However, the third sentence contains an \"and\" meaning it is still incorrect as there are multiple meanings.\n5.) Hence, the best answer for the question can be I was thinking about seafood. \n6.) The correct answer can be found with the process of elimination. So, the final answer to the question is 'I was thinking about seafo\n\nInput: What do you think is happening in this scene?

{"idx": 481, "text": "1 The question relates to the question about the nature of Turkey.\n2. The mainland of Turkey is placed on Asia minor, so the options A, B, C, and D are all plausible answers.\n3. We need to consider the options, which would most likely describe the nature of Turkey. \n4. Option B seems out of context, since the Balkan peninsula is located in the southeastern Europe, so we discount it.\n5. Option A, \"middle east\" is a broad term that cannot be narrowed to one location.\n6. Option C \"Asia\" also covers a wide area, and so we discount it as well\n7. \"Asia minor\", however, could possibly be a valid option as a location within Asia, although it does not precisely cover Turkey.\n8. So based on the clues provided, the most accurate answer is likely C: Asia minor\n9. Therefore, we can conclude that the most probable answer is C: Asia minor\nSo the final answer: C: Asia minor\n\nInput: The man wants to learn something new, what is the name of an educational activity to accomplish a task? Choices:  a: learning b: knowledge c: teaching d: information e: education f: skill\nOutput: 1: The question asks about a definition of the terms related to learning.\n2. The list provided includes learning, knowledge, teaching, information, education, and skill.\n3. Most of the words are already defined or are too generic to be used as a definition. \n4. The phrase \"task accomplishment\" is a clue to the meaning of the answer which is about education or acquisition of new skills.\n5. Therefore we need to focus on words that can describe educational activity.\n6. The term most directly related to task accomplishment is education. From the options, education is the only one that can be directly related to the definition as a process to acquire new education or skill.\n7. Therefore the answer is E: education.\nSo the final choice is E: education\n\nInput: A man is always on time. What is this adjective used for?

{"idx": 485, "text": "1.\"Fight over money\" can refer to actual combat between two people where fists are exchanged and maybe punches are thrown.\n2. Alternatively, this can refer to the verbal exchange of competitiveness, threats, and unpleasantries between two people.\n3. The question is asking \"What might he choose to do?'\n4. This indicates that Johnny wants to put an end to the fight with money in any way he can.\n5. The options presented are to \"control people\", \"settle everything\", \"buy food\", \"increase power\", and \"kill bill\".\n6. Since \"control people\" doesn't relate to Johnny getting control of the money but rather trying to be in control of the people in the household.\n7. The question is asking what he wants to \"do\", not \"be\". \n8. Therefore, we can rule this option out.\n9. \"Settling everything\" sounds like a positive goal, but in fact, it means ending the dispute and not getting much money.\n10. The answer, therefore, is \"buy food\", as Johnny would like to end the fight and the \"fight\" part of the question refers to a verbal exchange and therefore is not literal but refers to a disagreement\nbetween two people.\nSo the final  answer is D: buy food.\n\nInput: What might someone be doing at a baseball game?

Since the question is asking about what a person may or may not be doing, we can rule out option E: screaming as it refers to yelling.\n4. Since we have to look for a suitable option that can apply to any baseball game, we can rule out options B: singing and D: drinking as the actions are specific and not generic of a person at a baseball game.\n5. The possible action here can be, \"cheering\" or \"dancing\", as both can apply to any person attending a baseball game. 6. We can rule out option A: cheering. This option refers to shouting encouragement", "answer": "B: settle everything"}

The question requires the student to find out which European country has been historically associated with a significant potato industry.\n3. Options B,C or E are not accurate as they are either not European countries or do not have a notable potato industry.\n4. Option A, however, is the correct answer. Idaho is known for having the largest potato industry in the world, and is located in North America, not Europe.\n5. Option D, on the other hand, is neither a European country nor known for its potato industry.\n6.

It is essential to note that the answer for this question must be based on the premises posed in the question.\n3.) Pain relievers are drugs that are usually consumed after a meal, whereas a large plate, acream-based sauce, an eating disorder, and a salad bowl are items that can be consumed as part of a single meal.\n4.) In other words, pain relievers cannot be taken if you are having trouble with eating, whereas a large plate can be consumed when having trouble eating.\n5.)

B: Imprevist, seems like an interesting option and one would typically expect a surprising event to break up a boring routine but it does not seem to suggest a particular solution.\n5.C: Arcane, although a word, is a bit vague, and can be misleading for a solution.

{"idx": 497, "text": "1. The context of the sentence explains that the \"he\" mentioned refers to David.\n2. \"Getting what he needed in a while\" implies that David didn't eat or drink for a long time.\n3. Therefore, David can't have been overeating because he had been suffering from headaches. Hence, David was fatigued.\n4. Fatigue is the feeling of weakness or exhaustion, which can arise from too much stress.\n5. This is also apparent from the context: \"He was tired, he was in pain, and he hadn't gotten what He needed in a long time\" All of these signs indicate fatigue.\n6. Furthermore, in the previous questions, David was under stress, and fatigue is usually associated with excessive stress.\n7.

Choices:  * A: the color B: its size C: the flavor D: if it's effective E: its cost \nOutput: 1) The question states that a choice is available between two pills and two of the pills are red and blue. It can be reasonably concluded that there are four choices in total and this is likely for the following reasons:\ni. If there are four choices, that indicates that the problem has two possible solutions, which makes logical sense if one looks for a solution to a common query.\nii. Additionally, \"pill A\" or \"pill B\" can be interchanged with the four options (A, B, C, and D).\n2) For deciding which of the two best applies here, it's important to look at each element closely and consider the various factors. \ni. The first option is A, which is colored red. This doesn't offer any advantages over the other two pill options: both pills are red in color.\nii. Option B is of a different size and is also colored blue. Option B's advantage of being colored blue must be considered along with the pill's size, which neither of the red-colored options have.\niii. Option C is a flavor, so it's flavor and ingredient are irrelevant.\niv. Option D is whether the pill is effective, hence making the", "answer": "A: addiction"}

Jukebox (E) is a device that can play music, but we are not looking for the device itself here, but the term that refers to it.\n4. Musical is a broad term that is often used to reference songs that are played in a movie or TV show.\n5. That is why 'a musical', makes more sense as the correct answer to the question. This is a term that refers to songs often performed in movies or shows. \n6.

Choices:  Wrong Answer, A: bar B: restaurant C: full D: empty E: menu\nOutput: 1 The question asks to identify whether or not a restaurant has a full menu. \n2. The term \"full menu\" can be taken in two ways, either regarding its literal meaning or metaphorically.\n3. Regarding the literal meaning, a full menu implies that the restaurant has all the necessary sections listed on the menu, all of the dishes that are possible to order, including side and dessert dishes.\n4. In this context, all the given options except D can be considered as 'full menus'.\n5. The term \"full\" is broadly used to refer to something that is complete, that has all the necessary parts, or fully contains the features.\n6. Therefore the answer should be \"full\" or \"full menu\" as the term applies to all but one option.\n7. Looking at the options again, bar (A) doesn\u2019t have a full menu as it doesn\u2019t hold the necessary sections of food that a restaurant needs in a nutshell. Restaurant (B) can be considered a full menu, but so can full (C), menu (D), and full menu (E).\n8. Thus, the answer would be, \"full menu,\" which accurately describes all the answers except bar (A).\nSo the final answer would be E: full menu\n\n Input: In a fight between a group of people, how many may not have participated in", "answer": "C: musical"}

The fifth option, 'evil,' can also be ruled out since it doesn't imply innocence but simply signifies maliciousness.\n4. The word 'evil' is not used to refer to being innocent or pure, nor does it convey guilt.\n5.

We can eliminate option a: check which only requires inspecting a room and doesn't need to be concerned about leaving things in messy state. \n3. So, we have to focus on three action options that could relate to cleaning a room, specifically the action of cleaning it.\n4. If we want to clean a room, we will need supplies to do so, as we will not have time to get them after our friend calls with a late arrival alert.\n5. Option c: spray which means to clean a room with a spray bottle is incorrect as the task involves more than spray cleaning. \n6. Similarly, option e: bring along is wrong as you don't bring things to complete the act of cleaning. So we can eliminate options c: spray and e: bring along.\n7.

The third option, cats need food, cannot be the answer as food is not something cats \"do every day\" as it does not reflect their behavior. \n6.

Science experiments often involve different individuals working on segments simultaneously. Movies are completed mostly by a small group. \n4) Coming to the end together doesn't tell us about the nature of the project and doesn't necessarily indicate that everyone should come to the end together. \n5) Hence, the answer is a book and a sport.\nSo the final option is a sport\n\nInput:  At 46 degrees and 10 degrees which of these are the same?

Other options- London (C) and gas stations (E) are specific locations and aren't often places for things other than what they are.\n6. Thus, options D and B are considered and the option D is the best one as London is located in England and E is a gas station, not a city.\n7. Therefore the answer is C: city.\nSo the final decision would be A: city\n\nInput: Where do you get free wifi from an airport? Choices:  B: cash machines C: the front office D: coffee shop E: public restrooms\nOutput: 1- The question is asking which location in an airport gives internet.\n2. There are many options to choose from and are given in the choices.\n3. Firstly we can disregard all the other options except for C, as those are clearly not providing internet. \n4. Secondly, in terms of B & D as they may or may not be providing a free service, it may or may not be a public place, thus, they are disregarded too. \n5. So the main options to choose from are A, C, and E. \n6. Out of this, option A: front office can be eliminated as they are not giving internet for free. \n7. Then we have 2 options- C: coffee shop and E: public restrooms. \n8. Both give you free wifi in the form of the internet and are in public. \n9. This makes option C (coffee shop) the best choice. \n10. The public restrooms are in public and also give you the internet through wifi but, you will have to pay for this, so the best answer is C: coffee shop.\nSo the final choice would be C: coffee shop.", "answer": "C: london"}
{"idx": 549, "text": "1- The question asks about how someone unintentionally causing harm to another person may be feeling. \n2. Unintentionally hurting another person is usually unpleasant and may cause them to express different emotions, such as sadness, regret, embarrassment, or guilt. 3. \n3. One of the most significant emotions likely to arise in such a situation is feelings of sadness or regret because it's an act that may cause another person pain or discomfort. \n4. Feeling guilty or shameful for causing someone else to feel unease or suffering is also a common emotion that a person may experience following an accidental act of harm.\n5. If the person who caused the unintentional harm to another has any remorse for their actions or regret for causing harm, feeling upset would be natural.\n6. Therefore the answer is either D: glee or E : Sadness. But sadness will be the obvious answer\n7. Another thing is that if she is feeling gleeful or happy at the incident of hurting others, then it will also be her feeling but as per given question she feels guilty. \n8. So the correct answer is E: Sadness\nSo the final answer sadness\n\nInput: Why would a person get in a car accident driving on the highway if their car were new? Choices: 1. A: The driver was distracted 2. B: Bad roads 3. D: The car was overloaded 4. C: The car was too old 5. the car is not made for highway driving\nOutput: The driver might assume that driving on the highway is more dangerous than driving on roads where there are fewer traffic jams and traffic congestion, which could make them drive carelessly and cause accidents.\n1. This is often due to a lack of preparation or inadequate knowledge about safe driving on highways.\n2. The roads might be narrow or uneven, causing cars to overturn or get in accidents. \n3. This is often due, again, to a lack of preparations or adequate knowledge about safe travel on highways.\n4. Perhaps the driver has not acquired the necessary skills to safely drive on the highway, or lack of caution due to lack of preparation.\n5.

But we can cross out this choice because it doesn't directly relate to Sally or her senior status.\n6) Therefore, the answer could be B \"Old People's home\", because we don't know anything about Sally's involvement with organizations, and this one is the only possible correct answer of all choices given.\nSo the final choice is B: old people' s home.\n\nInput: When did the train set depart?

This can be disregarded, too.\n8) 'late' is not related to the question directly and can be disregarded.\n9) Thus we are left with'mistakes' and 'annoyed' as the remaining options.\n10) We can eliminate'mistakes' from the candidate set as the word choice implies some additional or secondary action related to mistakes rather than as a primary action itself.\n11) Considering the remaining context and the description of an annoyed response, we can dismiss 'annoyed' as well.\n12) So,'mistakes' are eliminated as an invalid. \n13) With'mistakes' removed, 'late' becomes a valid option.\n14) But the question still expects to know what happens to the next appointment in response to the grooming taking more time.\n15) Thus, to answer the question accurately, the word choice should capture what directly occurs at the next appointment, not the additional consequence after the grooming takes longer than usual.\n16) With this consideration, 'late' isn't the suitable choice because 'late appointment' doesn't exist in standard practice. \n17) Therefore, the only remaining option is'missed appointment'.\n18) So, the final answer is E- Missed Appointment.\nSo the final answers is E: missed appointment\n\nInput: What did the man say to the woman?

The question suggests that Sarah was at home earlier in the day since she is assuming the only time she could have gone out is that evening.\n3. After elimination of the incorrect options, the answer will be between night, day time, and afternoon.\n4. Since these are time-related, the correct answer should be a time, instead of a time range.\n5. Since the correct answer should not have a time range, we can eliminate daytime.\n6. Next to it is the option night, which is already eliminated.\n7. We are left with afternoon; However, the options provide very different descriptions of afternoon.\n8. The first two options are about the afternoon time period, i.e., between 12 pm to 3 pm.\n9. The latter two options refer to the time range afternoon, meaning between 3 pm to 8pm.\n11. Therefore, by logical elimination, the final answer is E : afternoon.\nSo the final result is E: afternoon\n\nInput:If you use a microscope, you can see very small things.  What are three things that can't be seen with a microscope? Choices:  \u2022A: the ocean \u2022B: the world \u2022C: the solar system \u2022D: microorganisms \u2022E: DNA\nOutput: 1 It states that using a microscope you can see very small items.\n2. The following choices are items that can't be viewed with a microscope.\n3. We don't have to view the entire word to be able to answer the question.\n4. We can exclude 'A: the ocean' as it is the biggest collection of water and couldn't be seen with the microscope.\n5. Likewise, 'the world' as it consists of many different items and couldn't be viewed.\n6. We can cross out the option 'the solar system' as well because it consists of multiple planets.\n7. 'B: microorganisms' could be observed through a microscope, but their existence couldn't be confirmed as they are too small.\n8. By the elimination method, the answer is the correct one - 'D: microorganisms'.\nSo the final answer to this question would be D: micro", "answer": "A: early morning"}

There are five choices offered: ignore the problem, be able to write, learn new things, be illiterate, and have fun.\n3. We need to figure out the reason why the child is so eager to teach his grandpa about reading.\n4. We can look at whether the problem he wants to solve is related to the act of reading, and find that it is not, so we can discard options A: ignore and B: write.\n5. We also realize that the child wishes to teach his grandfather a skill or knowledge, which would imply that learning something new is the answer.\n6.Option C: learn new things matches this description, so it is the most suitable choice.\nSo the final choice is C: learn new things\n\nInput: The two doctors decided the best way for the patient's recovery, what had they learned? Choices:  (A) The cause of the tumor (B) The treatment for the condition (C) A new technique of treatment (D) The correct diagnosis (E) The patient's age\nOutput: 1 The patient has a tumor, and the doctors have been trying to diagnose/treat it. There are several choices. Choice D: The choice is incorrect. We only have the option of four choices. Choices C and D have nothing to do with the tumor, so we can eliminate them.\n2 The reason that choices (A), (B), and (E) are wrong is that they do not help us answer the question \"What had they learned?\" \n3 The main concept in the question is related to cause and treatment rather than diagnosis, so we choose option (C) as the right choice.\nSo the answer is (C): A new technique of treatment.\n\nInput: Why doesn't the book have many pictures in it?

The options A, B & D refer to locations, of either public or private types, so let's exclude them.\n5. Looking at the options E and C, these both represent meetings or gatherings where chairs will be present; one can even say the gathering was planned just for attending to a meeting.\n6. For this reason, choice E, C, or both should be sufficient choices.\n7. However, option C is not sufficient because it could be a smaller meeting, too.\n8.

Choices: A: talking to a colleague B: teaching lesson C: chatting with students D: taking attendance E: handing back papers\nOutput: 1) The question concerns a scenario where the teacher was doing something other than teaching, either because they were not present to teach the class or for other reasons. 2) The teacher has to be either teaching lesson, giving attendance or handing back the papers. Therefore other options have to be excluded. 3) The choices provided are A-talking to a colleague, B- teaching lesson, C-chatting with students, D-taking attendance E-handing back papers. 4) Option B - teaching lesson has to be the choice since it is the only choice that involves the teacher educating the students. (Option A - talking to another colleague is not suitable as the scenario does not indicate that there was any other teacher or professor present in the class.) 5) The same is true for option E - handing back papers as they have to be handed back by the teacher. 6) Option C - chatting with students is suitable as the teacher would not be doing it while they are teaching a lesson and option D -giving attendance is also suitable as the teacher would also not be doing it while teaching the lesson. 7", "answer": "C: meeting"}

Choosing the right preposition can determine the context, meaning and clarity of a sentence, so it's important to get it right.\n4. Choices A and B are article (A) and adjective (B), not prepositions as they aren't words or phrases that combine two or more words.\n5. Choices C and D are interjection (C), pronoun (D), neither of which is a preposition.\n6.

Choices:  a: greet the other animals because the zoo is a large area b: go to the front entrance c: meet the lions d: go to the bathroom e: walk around first\nOutput: 1.: The question is asking about what someone would expect a person to do when they first enter a zoo.\n2. This would depend on various scenarios, such as whether they had visited the zoo before or this is the first time in the zoo.\n3. Choicing a: go to the front, is probably not the first thing anyone would do because it requires more information, such as if there's any place to pay for the ticket, or if the ticket includes seeing other animals too. This is not known from the question.\n4. Choice b: go directly towards the lions is obviously a possibility unless that person is scared of the lions or it's not allowed to go there.\n5.

{"idx": 633, "text": "1.The question is asking for a storage place near toothpaste for birth control pills, where they can be easily and comfortably accessed. \n2. The options given are specific places where toothpaste is either kept or sold; they may not be ideal storage places for birth control pills in this context, which is more about convenience than necessity.\n3. Let us examine the options; A medicine cabinet would typically contain medicines such as first aid supplies and analgesics but may or may not keep birth control pills depending on the house. Similarly, a chemist's shop, or a drugstore, would not contain toothpaste at a home. Therefore, we eliminate A and E.\n4. Looking a the options that remain, C: kitchen is not necessarily one of the best places to store birth control pills, as it would not be practical to access them easily.\n5. We can also eliminate D: drug store as toothpaste is not necessarily a product sold in a drugstore, and this answer is not in harmony with the other answers.\n6. We are therefore left to C - the kitchen and D - the drug store.\n7. Both these options are not ideal for storing birth control pills since both places are commonly used for storing and using food items. Hence, it's better to eliminate both C and D.\n8. Therefore the answer is B: medicine cabinet.\nSo the final answers are B: medicine cabinet\n\nInput: If you are getting dressed for a fancy dinner, what should you wear? Choices: 1. A: Dress jacket, C: Dress shirt, D: Dress pants 2. B: Boots, C: Heels, D: Sandals\nOutput: 1: We can eliminate A and C as both are dress pants and dress shirts, respectively.\n2. Dress pants are more similar to B, boots, than any other option.\n3. The most similar option to the dress shirt in B and C will be C, which makes sense as it is a specific kind of dress, the dress shirt, mentioned twice.\n4. Hence, the answer is C and the final answer is C.\n5. Thus, the final answer is C\n\nInput: What would you wear at a wedding? Choices: 2. a. B: Tuxedo c. D", "answer": "A: medicine cabinet"}

The school can be located in various places, but it is unlikely that we would find a school in a residential (B), mosque (C) or community (E) neighborhood.\n3. Prague (D) is on a very large map in the world. Unless we are specifically looking for schools in a particular city, we will probably not find a school here.\n4. So the only possibility is to look for a school in a city (A).\n5. If one knows that a certain city has a school, it would be much easier to identify a school in it.\n6. Therefore the answer cannot be anything other than A: residential neighborhood.\nSo the final result is A: residential neighborhood\n\nInput: \"No, we will not be late!\" is often a response to, what? Choices: A: an invitation to a party B: a promise to meet C: being asked where you are from D: a threat of harm E: a request for an address\nOutput: 1The question describes why a common response to a query is \"No, we will be late!\"\n2. Based on the response, we can identify the question that the answer should accompany.\n3. Considering all the questions, we can eliminate B: an invitation to the party. This is irrelevant to the answer.\n4 We can also eliminate the other choices, because they are not the responses to any of the inquiries.\n5.

Let's assume options A: bookstore, B: backpack, C: abraham lincolns grave, D: desktop, E: classroom are valid options. Then by looking at the question, it suggests the answer cannot be either A: Bookstore or B: backpack.\n3. This is because a backpack is generally not where one would purchase a notebook, and bookstores don't sell a lot of notebook in the first place. And one would typically not purchase notebook at Abraham Lincolns grave.\n4. Option D: desktop is disregarded as it makes no sense as a possible answer because it's a piece of hardware, not where one would typically buy a notebook.\n5. Likewise, option E: classroom may include a few notebooks, but it's not an exclusive destination, and thus, doesn't fit the context here.\n6. Hence, the answer choice that remains valid is C: abraham lincons grave.\nSo the final choice is C: abraham Lincoln's grave\n\nInput:The police officer needed to get something into the car, what was it? Choices: A: car key C: wallet D: handcuffs E: his radio\nOutput: 1 This question asks what the police officer needed to get into his car.\n2. We can eliminate A: car key as a possible answer choice because it does not require any special action to get into the car.\n3. We do not need E: his radio as the police officer may carry a radio around but does not need to keep it in the car.\n4. D: handcuff is not needed because it cannot be a primary item that needs to be stored inside a car or something commonly found in a car.\n5. Let us consider C: wallet. This is a small object and is often forgotten by the person. A wallet is a small personal item, but not necessary for driving a car. So it is not a valid answer.\n6. Therefore the only answer choice that remains an appropriate choice is B: keys.\nSo the final and correct answer is B: keys", "answer": "A: bookstore"}

Therefore, A is not the right answer. \n4) Option B: flown would refer to the money travelling and moving from one point to another, but also could mean the money has changed its ownership when it was transferred over or given out as a gift for example. This doesn't refer to a loss or depletion of money.\n5) In addition, Option C: disintegrate does not indicate a loss of money, nor is there an exchange of ownership of money being indicated. So, disintegrate cannot be the answer.\n5) Option D: fall apart indicates that the money has already been spent or lost and there is nothing left, so this cannot be correct.\n6) Option E: ultimate. This might refer to the last payment that is made, so might not necessarily mean that the money has already dissipated. This option is unlikely and can be disregarded.\nTherefore, we can narrow the options down to B: flown and E: penultimate.\n7) Option E: Penultimate. This means last but one.

Looking for the answer choices, option A: 'I want to eat some nice pudding'. Pudding has nothing to do with news or any other kind of information of note.\n\n5.

Next, option C: 'to strain my eyes', this option is not relevant to the context.\n\n7. The option E' though, can be considered as well because of the following reason.

Anything which is thrown at the bear is likely to be caught and tossed aside. For your life, if not thrown at your side.\n2.

Option \"Bullbleep\" might be a word or term not commonly associated with the description of bulls, but it doesn't seem to describe bulls and can also refer to anything that has no relationship with bulls and is not what the question is about.\n6. Option \"Cow\" is a female bovine (cow, or bull), making sense of the context of the question.\n7. Option \"Female\" refers directly to cow, which is female bovine, making sense of the context. If we replace cow with bull, the sentence makes no sense because \"female\" is more related to cow (females) or people in general than bulls.\n8. Option \"Charging prey\" (meaning \"an attack or assault, especially sudden and aggressive\") doesn't seem to make sense referring to bulls, which are not known to do this.\n9. Therefore the only correct answer is \"Cow\".\n10.

{"idx": 677, "text": "1 The question states that some stores market products to women, specifically, to trick them and convince them to buy more things than necessary.\n2. Since the stores are tricking the women, it is logical to look for a word that would mean the opposite of what they are trying to convince them to do.\n3. The first option- \"get money\" doesn't seem likely since the question doesn't suggest that women get more money when they buy more products.\n4. The next option- \"pay money\" could be relevant, but it doesn't seem logical that the store's intention is to convince women to pay more money.\n5. The idea of \"losing money\" does seem like an adverse effect of buying more products, if the products are of low quality or overpriced compared to what they are.\n6. Thus, the option 'lose money' seems potentially relevant.\n7. The remaining options'save money' and 'go shopping' do not convey a negative effect when women buy more.\n8. Therefore the option that makes sense is 'lose money'.\n9. The option most likely to make people lose money is to convince them to buy things they don't really need, as they won't get the desired utility from it.\n10. The option 'go shopping' can be disregarded as it is a side effect of losing money, not a relevant outcome.\n11. Similarly, the option'save money' is also a consequence of buying something.

The following two options were clearly not implied at the start of the sentence:\na) Option A: \"work in life\" can be a literal or figurative phrase for \"God wants people to work at life\".\nb) The action of option B being \"speak to people\" is not only irrelvant, but it also changes the order of the sequence words, making it incorrect.\n4. The two following options, although they can be considered \"actions\" in the broadest sense, can also be considered a description of the expected behavior rather than a literal action:\na) Option C: \"everywhere\" could mean that God expects people to show a presence in life, to be able to meet the needs of others or share something of value rather than being specific to location.\nb) Option D: \"sitting ideal\" is vague and does not describe a specific action, and could be understood as a general state of being, and not a literal action performed by someone.\n5. The two remaining options, C and D, describe how God expects money to be made, either through providing value for others in a variety of settings or through making a concerted effort to address the needs of others and providing a needed service.\n6. So, the most fitting answer would be D: siting ideal, as it is both a suitable interpretation of the sentence and a specific action that can be performed.\nSo the final one is D: Siting ideal\n\nInput: How does the author want you to feel after finishing the book?

A person with more experience tends to have more knowledge and ability than someone with less experience.\n5. A person with lower or no education lacks a certain amount of formal education or knowledge which may limit their skills.\n6. \"Well educated\" suggests a higher level of education and more knowledge, so the answer that best answers the question is a person with higher qualifications.\n1.

The words used to describe each option may be literal, as in going to the opera could also induce a physical sensation like feeling sick. But we're looking for an emotional response like a feeling.\n3. Options B: headache and D: relaxation seem to be emotions that could result from watching an opera.\n4. Option D: relaxation is not the answer for the question, since, by definition, an opera is a type of performance that elicits deep emotions, usually in the form of music. So you cannot relax when watching an opera!\n5. Option B: headache is possible since an opera can be loud and contain disturbing moments which might cause a headache.\n6. Option E: sick is not the answer either. This could be possible if a person attends a bad performance of an opera which was subpar or not particularly well-done. So, this is an unlikely thing, and it is not a feeling.\n7. The answer should include emotion, not a physical sensation like sickness.\n8. The answer should also be for watching an opera, not for going.\n9. So the only valid answer should be C: boredom. We could have boredom or not enjoy ourselves at an opera.\n10. Therefore, the option C: boredom is the best match.\nSo the final option is C: boredom\n\nInput:What does an apple, an orange and a ____ have in common? Choices: 1.A: apple 2. B: strawberry 3.

The context of the sentence suggests that a man has appeared to be depressed, which gives an idea that the person needs to respond to this man.\n3. We need to respond in a way which would not further aggravate his condition but show concern for the depressed man.\n4. Looking through the options, A: Cheer the man doesn't show enough compassion for a depressed man who is seeking emotional support.\n5. The second option, B: Be concerned for what he say's next, has the right idea but it's not explicitly conveyed. So, one shouldn't ask a depressed man what he wants to say next.\n6.

Option B: sorrow, is a feeling often experienced with committing suicide. So, it can't be excluded as well, even if it's not the strongest option. \n7.

Option A, ordering dog food online, is not necessarily representative of someone lying or being hesitant to tell the truth.\n5. Option B, avoiding eye contact, can be a sign of lying, but there are also other reasons why someone might avoid eye contact, so it does not indicate dishonesty as a standalone fact.\n6. Similarly, Option C, feeling guilty, does not uniquely represent someone who lies, as there are other situations that can lead to this feeling.\n7. Option D, falling asleep, can be indicative of lying, as when we are tired or sleepy, it may be difficult to continue lying, but it is not the only cause of sleepiness.\n8. Option E, blushing, can be an indication of lying as we often feel self-consciousness or embarrassment when telling a lie.\n9. But, blushing may also occur when we are unwell or emotionally charged due to other stressors, so only being blushing may not be sufficient to verify someone's dishonesty.\n10.

Looking at option C: table which is an item of furniture, this too is not likely, nor an answer for the question.\n6.

The phrase \"cashing in\" implies a financial motivation, which is the main difference between selling out and receiving money, and also the reason for eliminating choices B and C as they do not share the same meaning and purpose, respectively.\n3. The options \"Happy\" and \"Getting paid\" would have been valid reasons for the artist to create something for his audience, but the wording in the question implies there is a sense of regret about it. This makes it clear that the artist felt the act of cashing in is not entirely acceptable.\n4. To justify his regrettable action, the artist could have chosen to do what is suggested in the question: sell out or receive money. However, these are two words with different meanings, which are confusing about the intention of the artist.\n5. Therefore we need to eliminate these options since the question suggests something is wrong with his decision, which is not possible if the artist intended to benefit from it.\n6. Option A, \"Selling out\", presents the motive that is most accurate and true to the problem described in the question, since it refers to a negative connotation of giving up one's principles to succeed in business.\n6. The artist most likely feels bad about his decision to sell out for profit, which is why the question asks about him \"cashing in\". This suggests that the artist had an alternative option to profit without selling out his beliefs, which is option D.\nSo the final choice is D: receive money.\n\nInput: What would cause the fish to fall from the tree?

Though falling from a tree seems to be a consequence of gravity, it is not possible for the fish to get up the tree in the first place. \n4.

Of course you can't take your razor into shower with you? you can even take a towel into shower and keep it on your head, but not on your pocket, right?\n7. Options C+D: chemist/drugstore is actually the place to buy it in the first place. It makes no sense to put your razor somewhere you just bought it. This eliminates the two options.\n8.

The word 'primary' is used to highlight the fact that although the combat is the primary aspect of war, the goal is the conquest of the enemy, or the defeat of the opponent.\n3.) The words 'combat', 'enemy', or 'opponent' can be replaced by 'fighting', 'female soldier', or'man', respectively, to emphasise the gender/sex of those characters. Furthermore, 'your' denotes that the subject must be a person, so we can discard the option 'join army', which is a plural noun.\n4.) Option C, 'join army', also presents a problem of gender identity as the subject cannot be the adjective'male', as it is already a pronoun.\n5.) The answer to the question is Option A: 'conquer opponent', as conquest is the ultimate goal of war.\nSo the final correct answer for the question \"In war, your primary (one & only) method is combat, butyour goal is to do what?\" is: Option A = \"conquer opponent\".\n\nInput: If a woman wants to go into a room full of soldiers, who would be the first to enter the room?

Therefore, A: University cannot be selected.\n4. - B: Concert: This can cause security issues and concerns in a venue, but the word \"highly \" doesn't seem to be relevant in this case. So B: Concert cannot be selected as it isn't highly criticized.\n5. - C: Home: Security at home must be top-notch and highly qualified, skilled experts as they guard a place where valuables and assets are stored.

We can consider a person putting on make up for a variety of reasons, ranging from making themselves look attractive and pleasing to the eye to feeling joy.\n3.

They can be a secondary reason for applying makeup, but they are not the ultimate goal.\n5. The same reasoning applies to an interesting experience, where a person can experience joy while getting compliments for their makeup. And this can be the ultimate goal of applying makeup. So, both answers C: compliments and D: interesting experiences can be eliminated.\n6. The goal for applying makeup might be to look more attractive.\n7. However, we can again apply a reason within the question, looking pretty can potentially result in getting compliments, and these compliments are what make people feel happy and joyful while they are looking attractive. So, looking pretty can be considered a secondary goal for applying makeup.\n\n8. Hence, the ultimate goal for applying makeup would be to look pretty to get compliments and feel pleasure.\n9.

Once we eliminate the options that aren't suitable options or are irrelevant, only \"tomato and slices meat\" and \"bacon\" remain. 5.) \"Tomato and sliced-meat\" wouldn't be a suitable choice because it wouldn't really make it possible for people order salads. 6.)

This answer is also not enough to be considered a solid answer.\n5.) Option C: wet clothes. This is the most obvious reason why someone should not walk barefoot on wet streets or surfaces.

Therefore, all we are left with is A: den and C family room which may constitute the reasons for complaining.\n11. The only one that can be eliminated is family room as it refers to a place in a house. This is similar to the family room itself, in that it is a place with a certain furniture arrangement.

While none of these options offer all possible locations where isopropyl alcohol and safety glass could be found, we do get a range of possible options.\n6. Pubs: can be anywhere where people gather. Even though pubs are mostly found around beer, they may well have a supply of isopropyl and safety glass. So, we can rule out pub as a choice,\n7. Restaurants: are places where, apart from having food and liquor, there may be other needs people have where they come out looking for supply and so they are not an outlet for isopropyl or safety glass. So, too, we can rule out Restaurants from being a possible choice for outlets looking forward to providing these items.\n8. Park: this is an unlikely location where isopropyl and glass would be available as this is neither a retail outlet nor a place meant to provide these items to the public.\n9. Supermarkets: usually would have these two items for sale. One could argue both are part of medical equipment where we could think of a chemist or pharmacy but the words safety and alcohol would be of little use to them for their supply.

Option B: box: Although a box could include a radio, it isn't necessarily a radio that can reach base.\n6. Option C: transistor: Although a transistor could perform as a radio to send signals to the base, it is a more general function. It can also be used for other purposes.\n7. Option D: submarine: A radio used in a submerged submarine can transmit signals to the base, but it is an accessory that isn't specifically referred to in this question.\n8. Option E: lamp: A lamp is not a radio that can reach the base. It is out of context.\n9. Therefore the only option left is C: transistor.\nSo the final option is C: transistor\n\nInput: In which sport might you score a field goal? Choices:  a) ice hockey b) field hockey c) basketball d) rugby e) American football\nOutput: 1a. There are various types of hockey that do not involve scoring field goals. \n2b. American football is known as gridiron football in other countries.\n3c. Basketball and field hockey have nothing to do with scoring a field goal.\n4d. Rugby is a sport where points are awarded for a touchdown. A field goal is not a common scoring action in rugby. \n5e. American football in the United States is known as gridirion, but it is still the same game.\n6f. Field goals in gridiron football in the USA are scored when a player kicks the ball between the goal posts.\n7g.

Among the options given, if we consider:\n\nC) Save money:\nThis doesn't exactly solve a problem since it will take time until we have a lot of money, and it is not possible to save too much. Also, it wouldn\u2019t help if there is a problem at work (if we are not at work, the money won\u2019t solve the problem).\n\nD) Become Rich:\nThis is a bit different from the original context that we can observe (earn more at our job). Also, in order to become rich, a lot of work needs to be done. We cannot say (at least with this choice) that we can become rich and have the money to help solve the problem. Becoming rich does not mean that we have all the money we could ever need to help solve a problem.\nE) Feel Safe:\nThis option is not relevant to the situation since it refers to general aspects of our life and not only at the workplace.\n\n5).

C: Food is not a suitable drink as Brad ordered what was described as something to drink.\n4. There are other options to a drink with breakfast that could fit the context. Let's eliminate ones that don't apply as options to consider\n5. Options B: Throw up, E: Wine, do not apply and aren't relevant.

Option C: Coffee is quite commonly offered as a breakfast drink. The fact that \"something to drink\" is mentioned, makes C more likely than other options. \n7. Therefore, most likely Coffee is the answer to the question. \nSo the final answer choice is C: coffee\n\nInput: What happens to the price of a food item when its quality improves? Choices:  Q: price increases Q: remains the same Q: price decreases Q: it has no effect Q: we can't tell\nOutput: 1 The question asks about the effect of improving the quality of a food item.\n2. There are different ways to improve food quality which will cause various effects on the price.\n3. Generally, if a food item's quality increases but stays the same for a long period, there is not much of an effect on its price.\n4. There will however be an effect if the quality of the item decreases or increases. So looking at the options, Q: price decreases and Q: price increases will be ruled out.\n5. Therefore Q: price remains the same and Q: it has no effects could be the answers.\n6. Q: price remains the price is the most obvious answer and Q: it has effects is the least.\n7.

It would be highly unsafe to throw things high enough for long enough to cause a big splash.\n4: Similarly the bridge is also not the suitable location as it would not achieve a big splash as it is unlikely to cause a significant reaction in the surface of the river itself.\n5: The mountain countryside gives us two options, either the mountain ground or surface of earth. In the first case, it would be hard to hit water as the surface of the ground would stop the splash while the second case would have more or less the same effect.\n6: Thus, we can conclude that the correct answer is surface of earth itself.\n7: Therefore the final answer is, Option E: surface of earth.\nSo the final answers is E: surface of earth", "answer": "C: bridge"}

Like, choice A: opera, it is not known for being a place with food availability. Choices C: building and choice D: conference do not provide information about accessibility of food.\n4. Therefore, the only options left are choices B: supermarket and E: apartment.\n5. The Supermarket is not difficult to reach as it is usually located in a nearby area, and food available in it too is fairly reachable.\n6. Option E: apartment is probably the case in a few locations, but not at all places and thus is not the probable answer option.\n7. Option B: supermarket is a convenient place for accessing food. \n8. Therefore, it seems that the answer option is choice B: supermarket.\nSo the final option is B: supermarket\n\nInput: Where is the most convenient place to get a cake for a birthday? Choices:  [A] local market [B] bakery [C] grocery [D] corner store\nOutput: In the question provided, we are asked to determine where in the context of a birthday celebration is the most convenient source of purchasing a cake.\n1. 2. Given the question and choices, we need to find out where is the most feasible and simple place to buy the cake for a birth celebration.\n3. 4.

{"idx": 139, "text": "1) The question is asking where the ticket booth buys tickets.\n2. The question isn't providing any specific details, so we can look for general references to places where ticket booths can be found.\n3. The options provided are: train station, cathedral, metro station, fairgrounds, and amusement park.\n4. We will eliminate the least likely choices out of all options to help us narrow down. \n5. As amusement parks are places that sell tickets to their facilities, amusement park is a wrong answer here.\n6. Similarly, cathedrals serve as religious infrastructure, so cathedral is not the correct choice.\n7. Metro stations are locations on a subway system, so it doesn't necessarily imply their use at ticket booths for purchasing tickets. \n8. Therefore, between two remaining options, the ticket booth is generally placed in fairgrounds, and not in train stations, so the answer is C: metro station.\nSo the final answers is C: Metro station\n\nInput: If there is no butter, what would be the best choice to spread on toast? Choices:  breadcrumbs A: salt B: peanut butter C: jam D: almond butter E: sardines\nOutput: 1, The question is asking if there is no butter on hand.\n2. The goal is to find the most likely item to be used as a substitute for butter as it is clearly stated that \"there is no butter.\"\n3. We need to consider the nature of the food items and evaluate the most likely choice from among the options provided. Choosers include: breadcrumbs, peanut butter, jam, almond butter, and sardines.\n4. The option, breadcrumbs, is a coating or mix of flour or bread flakes that can be used to thicken food and make it crunchier. It is not a spread nor is it a dairy product. We can exclude it.\n5. We can also disregard the option, jam, as it isn't a spread and is not a dairy product.\n6. One item we can eliminate is sardines. They contain fish oil, so they're not a spread and can't be used to substitute for butter", "answer": "D: fairgrounds"}

The four choices are about places people might have electric fans: home, hardware store, hot room, and office.\n3. We want to determine what places people might have more than one electrical fan, so we should consider what each location offers in terms of electric fan usage.\n4. Home: people generally have more than one fan at home as the need to regulate temperatures can arise throughout the day, and a fan can only be useful if it is not too far away.\n5. Hardware store: people may buy electric fans at the hardware store, but this is not a location where they might have more than 1 fan in use as the climate may not require it.\n6. Hot-room: electric fans are useful in hot rooms, so they might have 1 or more fans here, but not because they like cool temperatures.\n7. Office: offices generally have air conditioning for regulating temperature control. However, electric fans can also be useful in such places and people may have more than one electric fans when they need to regulate temperature, especially if work requires staying overtime.\n8. Since option D: office has the most viable and correct response to the question, the correct answer is option D: office.\nSo the final is answer is D: office", "answer": "A: home"}

Choices:  a parent and their parent b parent and offspring c parent and child\nOutput: 1.) We understand the relationships between parent and parent or parent and child and parent and the offspring.\n2.) But we should be careful to consider that parent and child can be used for any biological relationship between two individuals. Here, the question relates to all biological relationships in general.\n3.) The relationship between a parent and child would be called parenting.\n4.) Parenting can be biological or not.\n5.) But the question specifies parent and their parent.\n6.) But we know of only one biological relationship between a biological parent and their biological parent. It is called parenting.\n7.)

For example, we know a carpenter's work is not part of any city, it would not contain levels. So option A: carpenter shop is eliminated too.\n5. Option B: A video game may involve a multiplayer mode or various levels. It could be part of the city but not all levels have to be part of the city. So it's eliminated too.\n6. The choice options left may be either multiple buildings in the city or multiple levels of a building itself.\n7. Building (D) is something we build and is made up of multiple levels that belong to one building. So this is not the answer we're looking for.\n8.

We have to think not just of actions that the two of them took, but decisions that they made which resulted in the desired effect.\n3. John and Jane could have taken a variety of actions, but these questions require us to take a look at our options closely to see if any of them match the intended purpose.\n4. Let's have a look at the options:\n\"Make sex\" is an action that the couple may or may not have taken. Regardless, it doesn't directly lead to any kind of commitment, and is not the answer. \"Plan to marry\" is similar in that it has little to do with any commitment, and is likewise a less probable answer.\n\"Dance\" could be in reference to a physical intimacy, like touching or holding hands. This is certainly a possible outcome of an act of commitment, but it doesn't directly imply a decision to commit to one another; so it is not the answer. The option \"row about\" is not a likely reason for them to do anything, so we can disregard it.\n5. Let's try examining the remaining options: \"Electrical circuit\" is simply an analogy. It does not refer to any action or decision. So, let's discard it. \"Row about\" is an activity we can undertake with a partner or others that can have many intents, some of which may not be beneficial towards the cause. However, rowing is not an activity likely to be done together by John and Jane, and is also not directly applicable to their situation, so we can discontinue it also.\n6. There's only one option left, \"plan to marry,\" which provides the desired answer to the question.

Option \"B: accidents\" does not accurately describe the cause of a violation. People generally do not get in accidents for not parking their car in the designated parking lot or not moving their car after the required time. So, this choice can be eliminated.\n4. Similarly, \"C: driving\" is a cause of violation related to driving, not parking the car, and is therefore ineligible for the answer choice.\n5.

{"idx": 199, "text": "1 The question is asking about a decision James made to print/not print his cards.\n2. He chose to not to print his cards, so the only option applicable here is Option E : handwritten.\n3. Option A : cursive writing, is another form of printing, which is different. And is not what James chose to do.\n4. And option B: Hand writing, means he wrote the cards himself, not print them.\n5. So the only valid options left are D: online media, and E: handwritten.\n6. Both online media and handwriting are forms of delivery, but they are not printing. So we can disregard these as options.\n7. Finally, online media is out of context as James wants to be more personal and online media cannot provide that in such a case.\n8. This leaves us with handwritten.\n9. Therefore the answer is E : handwritten. So the final answer is E : handwriting\n\nInput: What type of paper is the one you most often use? Choices:  (1) A: typing B: typing and printing C: writing D: drawing E: painting\nOutput: 1-2: The answer to the above question is not A, as typing isn't the most common form of writing. (3-4): The question is talking about paper, and so an option relating to a type of paper is what is required for this answer. (5-6): There are many different types of paper, including construction paper and drawing paper, but painting paper is only one, whereas the question is about writing, not drawing or painting. (7, 8): The answer to the question is not C or D, but is instead E. (8-10): The question is about using a paper, whereas the options are not about paper to be used in any particular way, but simply about different ways of writing, so none of the options provided are valid. (11-12): The answer to the above questions is E.\n13) This question appears to be referring to an actual use case with the following information: * You are printing an order sheet and need to know how many items to order per product. * You have the quantities of each item in stock * All customers buy at least one item of this type per order * Each item in the order sheet is an option for a specific customer * You have a lot of customers", "answer": "E: hand written"}

It could be a field belonging to a club, or a stadium with seating capacity.\n3. The options provided are some kind of establishment related to the field. The options are college, campus, players, and yard. \n4. The first two options are related to the field's association with higher learning institutions or a local sports team, they provide no concrete answer to the question. \n5. The question seems to imply that something related to the players are involved so discards college and campus.\n6. So, the answer is between the remaining options: players and yard.\n7. Players are in the game so the option is disregarded. The option left is yard. Yard is indeed a place where football matches take place, so this is the correct answer.\nSo the final and reasonable answer is E: yard.\n\nInput: What are some types of people one can't find on the Internet? Choices:  C: nerds A: celebrities B: athletes D: scientists E: journalists\nOutput: 1 & 2: The question indicates that some people, not found in the Internet are also mentioned.\n3. The option \"nerds\" is out of context as the word \"nerd\" is more commonly used to describe someone who is socially awkward.\n4. The option \"celebrity\" is not commonly associated with the Internet as such people are well known, and their lives are typically documented by news channels and tabloids.\n5. The answer \"athlete\" fails as sportsmen are commonly found on the Internet nowadays.\n6. The answer \"scientists\" is a suitable answer to the question but might seem too general or specific.\n7. Therefore a suitable answer is \"journalists\" that would provide adequate clarity to the question.\n8. Thus, the final answer is D.\nSo the final appropriate answer is D: journalists\n\nInput: This question asks about how a pig can go from farm to market.

But it does not say that he disliked any other race.\n2: So, 'peace' doesn't mean that he will always get along with humans but that he doesn't have strong feelings ('feelings') of hatred or animosity for non-humans as well. \n3: The options A, B and C, are irrelevant. 'Peace' is not necessarily indicative of a lack of hatred or anger. \n4: Choice D, 'hatred', clearly describes a mental state of being 'angry'. So 'hatred' and 'anger' are unlikely to capture 'peace'. \n5: And finally, choice E, 'feelings', is related to a mental state of peace, so it's the answer.\nSo the final is E: feelings\n\nInput: A man wanted to give a gift at a party, what was the party? Choices:  a. Christmas b. 4th of July c. 125th birthday d. A wedding e. A funeral\nOutput: 1.'Christmas' is likely for someone to celebrate with presents and a 'wedding' also has presents. But in a 'wedding', gifts are more traditionally given to the couple celebrating the matrimony, not just for the occasion, while in a 'funeral' there are usually no gifts. Since a 'funeral' is not likely a 'party', the answer is C: 125th Birthday.\nSo the final answe is C: 185th birthday", "answer": "E: feelings"}

Anxiety or emotional distress (Option B) that could happen when someone becomes upset or worried due to the embarrassing thing brought up by someone else.\n5. Riot (Option D) that could result could occur when a group of people is upset over the embarrassing situation that was mentioned by another person.\n6. Bad dreams (Option E) that could occur due to having the embarrassing situation brought up may result in the person to be distressed.\n7. Annoyance (Option C) means the person may become irritated by the person talking about the embarrassing situation with many other people.\n8. Based on the question, telling many people about an unpleasant experience would lead to some form of negative result, and the response should not be to notoriety (B) nor bad dreams.\n9. Therefore the most likely result would be a feeling of irritation or annoyance, which would be \"Answer Choice\" C.\nSo the final anser C: annoyance\n\nInput: What job does a pigeon do in addition to finding food and shelter?

VII. search for food and search for shelter.\nOutput: 1) The question asks about the other job that a pigeon does other than finding food, feed, and shelter.\n2) It is a multi-choice question, thus the correct answer is the one that meets all the options listed.\n3) Let's start from the beginning:\n4) A Pigeon is a bird that finds food and shelter. \n5) Option I reads as \"clean windows\"; windows are physical structures that can't be cleaned by Pigeons as it is an animal.

The choice A: bike, means the purchase of a bike which could be bought in a variety of places, including the bike shop itself or other places, which the question doesn't specify.\n3. Option C: building is not an item James could spend money on as it is not a type of building related to his house or property.\n4. Option E: car refers to a car purchase that could have been done at stores like car dealerships but does not specify the garage; therefore, option E can be eliminated.\n5. Option B: Downtown does not offer a place where James could spend money on other hobbies or leisure activities.\n6. The only remaining option among the choices is D: Tool Storage.\n7. Therefore the answer is D: Tool Storage\nSo the final answer.\n\nInput: Who is the king of the jungle? Choices:  Giraffe A: Monkey B: Leopard C: Lion D: elephant\nOutput: 1) The question is asking about an animal from the jungle that is considered the king. The choices provided are animals in different categories.\n2) When considering the choices, it is logical to start from A: Monkey.\n3) We can eliminate A: monkey as it is a small animal in comparison to the other animals in the given choices.\n4) Looking at the rest of options, they are animals that are bigger than a monkey, so we can eliminate A: monkeys.\n5) Let's look at the rest of options:\n6) Option B: Leopard is an animal from the cat family, but is not the largest member of the jungle, thus can be eliminated. \n7) Option D: Elephant is the largest animal in the jungle with a weight up to 25 000 lbs and is not a king, and thus can be eliminated too. \n8) Thus, there is no other option left but answer B: leopard.\nSo the final answers are leopard\n\nInput: Do you use the washing machine and dryer for the same purpose?

The question indicates that the animals can either be running, which necessitates an area, or can be sitting down.\n3. Let\u2019s see what options are available and cross-check what makes sense.\n4. Among options A: bookstore and B: house, it\u2019s clear that that there\u2019s no race track there and it\u2019s not a building either.\n5. We can eliminate options C: race track and D: friend\u2019s house.\n7. Atop of all of this, option D is likely going to be incorrect because there are not likely four-legged friends at a building unless the building is huge with some large outdoors.\n8. Therefore the most viable answer will be C: race track.\nSo the final conclusion is B: a race track\n\nOutput: 1 The question is about the nature of the environment that the student is in when she can experience a four-legged friend to compete, and we get to know that there is a building or a race track, and nothing happens or is there to enjoy. It seems to imply the environment itself as she can see the four-legged pet running and walking.\n2. When the student mentions what four-legged pets are there, it\u2019s hard to infer where the student is. The question doesn\u2019t make mention when the pets are indoors or in outdoors, and we have to figure out the place from the context the question as a whole.\n3. When the student mentions the pets do what they can to complete, the options become very limited. When the student can be a race track and a building, the option \u201chouse\u201d should be eliminated because it only refers to a place where animals sit. If the student cannot be in any building or a race track we have the option of a bookstore, but the question is not a place for animals to sit.\n4. Therefore the option of A: bookstore and option of D: friend\u2019s place won\u2019t match the intent of the question as the pets have to be running and competing with each other for the student to enjoy the show.\n5. Only option B: a race track can be the place where the student is and she can enjoy the racing show of animals. Therefore, the answer will be", "answer": "C: race track"}

Balalaikas can be played at musicians' shows or sold in a music store.\n5) A balalaika typically has a rounded shape and is a stringed instrument, which matches the description \"symphony\" as it is an orchestra that has many members and makes use of string instruments like a balalaika. Therefore, the answer has to be either B or D.\n6) The option A doesn't really apply to a balalaika, so we can eliminate that.\n7) Option E also isn't related to a balalaika'\n8) Option C, \"happy singing\", describes a person, not a musical instrument, so we can disregard it.\n9) The only two remaining options, B and D, are symphony orchestra and a music store selling balalaikas, respectively.\n10) Therefore, the correct answer is either D or B.\n11) The final answer would be D: symphony orchestras.\nSo the final ansnwer is D: symphony orchestrr\n\n## [Advanced](./advanced.md)\n\nInput: What happens when you throw a rock into water?

From the clues given, the word \"happiness\" does not match the given context. \n4. Option B and D: Pleasure and Grief. From the clues in the options, the phrases \"Pleasure\" and \"grief\" seems to be the best match for the given context and are plausible choices. \n5. However, given the context of the question, the phrase \"grief\" is more likely to fit into the correct option.\n6. Option C: Happy. \"Happy\" is quite different from the phrases \"PLEASURE\" and \"GRIEF\" and seems very unlikely to fit correctly. \n7. Option E \"Isolation\". From the context in the options, \"Isolation \"doesn't seem accurate. A husband may feel sadness or grief due to his wife's demands, but not because of their \"isolation\".\n8.

Based on this, we can ignore the options A: control computer and E: go out.\n10. Option B: Separate things refers to categorization of something into different types.\n11. Option D: cross street refers to a place of intercrossing.\n12. Since the person is looking up airline or hotel prices to plan out a vacation, options that make sense are: Option A: control computer, because the person is searching for the options to get better prices or options like Option C: go on vacations, since they are related to going on vacation.\n13. Option B: separate things, seems irrelevant, so this option can be omitted.\n14. Since option A: control computer, doesn't directly relate to the purpose of planning a vacation, we can eliminate this from the options.\n15.

{"idx": 263, "text": "1  In a sealed room or cupboard, air is usually recycled and remains the same. But in a sealed container, air can only become stale if a sealed room is filled with foul odour. Air is neither stale nor fresh from recycling alone.\n2. The air inside houses, as well as offices, are also enclosed and recycled, but they are also well ventilated so they are clean and fresh.\n3. People rarely go in airplanes while remaining unaware of passengers that came before them. Airplanes are usually sealed but are also well ventilating and provide fresh air.\n4. The only environment left is outdoors, where freshness and cleanliness remain dependent on the surroundings, including people in the area who influence the freshness of air.\n5. Cricket stadiums usually have poor ventilation, so even if some previous people breathed there, air is unlikely to be stale, as it may have gotten replaced with new air.\n6. A surface of the earth is not a place where people usually breathe. Also, surfaces of earth are never sealed because they continue exchanging with the atmosphere on their surfaces. Therefore the only environment left is indoors, within buildings that can be either sealed or open-vented.\n7. Indoors are often well ventilated, so air inside them cannot be stale unless the air is filled with odour, which is not the case with many interior enclosures.\n8. Therefore based on all the points given above, the only possible environment which can lead to stale air can be C: cupboard.\nSo the final the answer is C: cupboard", "answer": "B: house"}

For example C: roadblock is more likely to have signs informing people not to enter.\n4. E: city is another unlikely candidate as cities are large cities, and their large size would make it hard to use street corners for advertising.\n5. D: fast food drive through is another possible place to find a sign, as it is meant to advertise food products by displaying the options that the restaurant has to offer.\n6. Let's look at the remaining choices.\n7. A: bus stop would likely be a place to find a sign of a nearby bus service, not a sign lined up next to a group of people.\n8. We find a possible answer B: street corner, as street corners tend to be prime spots for advertising products in the form of signs.\n9. However, while street corners are often used to advertise products, they don't typically use signs alongside or with a group of people. Therefore, the best choice is to go with one of the other options.\n10. In summary, the best choice is E: city which can be the solution due to the fact that cities are densely populated, allowing for a great deal of advertising, and street corners are prime spots for advertisements.\nSo the final answers is E: city\n\nInput: How do you take your coffee?

Therefore, it is not likely to appear in the list as our answer option.\n7 Since Austria is not an often-listed destination in Europe, the answer choice is unlikely to be \"Austria\".\n8 Therefore, the answer option that makes the most sense given the facts about planning a trip to Europe is D: England.\nSo the final answe E: Austria is D: England\n\nInput: He found some money on the ground. Did he tell? Choices: \nA: No\nB: Yes\nC: It doesn't matter\nD: He is a person with money\nOutput: 1 There are multiple types of money on the ground. This implies that the question is asking whether the character has the money in hand.\n2. 'He found money' is grammatical, and it implies that he is probably holding it.\n3. The character is probably not telling anyone about the money he has found, which is a behavioral choice.\n4. Looking through the options, 'No' doesn't seem to be the best answer as it is not behavioral.\n5. Option D is a generality about the character, not directly related to the question.\n6. The options left are B and C, which imply a binary choice between 'yes' and 'no'.\n7. Both have the option of 'Yes,' which is the most suitable answer given the character's tendency to hold the money.\n8.

Let us look at the options:'middle east', 'palace', 'a dictionary' and 'pots'. These options don't describe the placement of the ficus plant.\n4. Choice 'palace' is not a specific location where ficus plants are typically placed.\n5. The next option is'middle east', which is not a location at all, but a geographical region.\n6 'dictionary' is not a place to keep or plant a ficus plant.\n7. The last option 'pots' is the only choice that describes a location where ficus plants may be kept, however, this location itself needs context.\n8. Therefore only choice option E: Apartment can be the answer because the ficus plant should be displayed on the table or inside a window since it requires sunlight to grow and thrive.\nSo the final choice is E: Apartment\n\nInput: You have to be at least __ to be admitted to this university: Choices:  A : 18 B: 17 D: 15 E : 12\nOutput:1: The question asks minimum age limit required to get enrolled into a specific university.\n2.

The question talks about space-based, rockets as it indicates that a vast complex (a rocket launch pad) will involve several parts.\n3. The options can be categorized into four types:\n   1 - A movie or film is one medium that can feature a vast complex. However, this doesn't apply to the question since it references an actual place and not a movie.\n   2 - Cape Kennedy or Cape Canaveral is a reference to a particular location, and it can be the site for a launch pad; however, it could also be another aspect of the vast complex, which would be out of context and inconsistent with the question's line of thought.\n   3 - The Kennedy Space Center is an actual place, and one can speculate about the inclusion of other parts beyond its borders; similarly, The Military Spaceport is another possible location for the launch pad; however, these are also different elements and not a part of the vast complex in the case of launch pads.\n   4 - The actual center that houses the launch pad. So, the options can be discarded to determine \"spacership\" centre. But it is not likely an answer as it doesn't follow the general trend of all other elements associated with a launch-pad, it doesn't belong to the other elements of the phrase \"a vast complex.\"\n4.

Based on common understanding, the one of the options must be related to the ill-fitting shoe that caused one to have these effects.\n4. For choice A: \"exercise\", the context provided doesn't support \"exercise\" as the outcome. While wearing incorrect shoes can lead to walking all day and exercise can also be a cause of walking all day, the context provides more evidence for the other options that the incorrect shoes caused this.\n5. For choice B: \"moving forward\", we can see that one moves forward as the context explains that \"He wore the wrong shoestring while walking\". While not as common as the other contexts, it is possible to move forward due to ill-fitting shoestoes.\n6. For choice C: \"blisters\", they are most likely related to the ill-fit shoe, as there's no other explanation for the occurrence of blisters due to walking.\n7. For choice D: \"blisters\" and E: \"locomotion\" are essentially the same. The \"blisters\" choice is written in a way that makes it seem like it refers to movement, but they are just a consequence of a walking event.\n8. Therefore the only answer choices are C: \"blister\" or D: \"walking\".\n9.

In general, a ticket only provides someone access to a specific mode of public transportation, such as a bus, plane, or train.\n3. It's unlikely that someone would purchase a bus ticket to travel to a different country.\n4. We discard the option \"train station\", as it's a destination, not a place where someone can buy a ticket.\n5. Since we can't \"purchase\" a movie ticket to go to another country, we can remove it as an option.\n6. The remaining options are a baseball stadium, a lottery ticket, a bus, and a movie ticket.\n7. So, baseball stadium is out of the context, we would have to buy a ticket to travel to a ball game.\n8. The lottery option is not relevant to travel abroad, we'll discard it.\n9. Similarly, we can eliminate a movie ticket since one would have to watch a movie in another country.\n10. In conclusion, the only option left from the remaining valid options is a bus ticket, as it's the most appropriate way to travel to a different nation.\n11.

Option A: look at is incorrect as the detective is analyzing what he has found and cannot use the evidence itself to gain an insight.\n4. Option E: discovery of new is also incorrect as that can be done by the criminal and is not required for evidence to be collected.\n5. From this it can be deduced that the remaining options B) write down, C) learn new and D) think about are relevant to the task.\n6. Option C: learn new is not necessary as the evidence can already be read as it is written down, thus making it an unnecessary step.\n7. Option B: Write down is required to get the correct information in the right format as the evidence has to be used to make inferences but it is incorrect to use the written down information of evidence for doing this.\n8. Option D: Think about would be good but not necessary as it already appears in the question, thinking about the information.\n9. Option E: Discovery of new would also not be needed in this process as he will already have available to him the correct information.\n10.

Also, the theater is not the place where one goes to buy things but to view things. Thus,'restaurant' can also be eliminated.

First is the \"someone who fills the bag with clothes,\" and second is the \"where do you get a bag after it is filled?\"\n3. Based on the given choices, we can dismiss the \"someone\" aspect of the question by eliminating options A: shopping cart and B: cashier. A shopping cart usually has its own bag or bags to carry all the things. There are no clothes in the cart to fill up a bag for this purpose. Also, it is not common for the cashier to handle cloth bags.\n4. Thus the given options for getting \"a bag\" are D: supermarket, or E: bookstore.\n5. Now we have to figure out what kind of bag does a supermarket typically sell, which would be the most viable option.\n6. In a supermarket, we typically sell only plastic bags. There are no cloth bags available. So, the most applicable option is E: bookstore. \n7.

The word \"handle\" refers to a tool located at the end of an object, with the purpose of lifting or carrying it, such as a frying pan, briefcase, coffee cup, or carry object.\n3. The phrase \"you want to bring it with\" implies the person is bringing the item with him or her while traveling or doing an activity.\n4.

The choice B: coffee cup is only suitable when the person has the handle of the cup in hand and is drinking coffee.\n7. Choice C: carry object is a suitable answer when the person carries an object with a handle. \n8. Choice D: frying, is a suitable answer when a person performs an action involving a frying pan.\n9.

Choices:  city A: outskirts B: people C: on the streets D: within city limits E: downtown\nOutput: - The remaining options refer to various aspects of the city, such as streets, outskirts, and areas within city limits. - The clue in the question refers to the residents of the city, and not the city itself. - Therefore, the answer must refer to a specific location where people live. - The remaining options refer more generally to areas within the city, so answer D (Within city limits) is best.\nSo the final the answer is D: Within City Limits", "answer": "D: carpenter's shop"}

One might consider many places to put a shed but can rule out a few because they might not be common to where most houses in a town are located.\n3. Looking through the given options, starting with the first \"A: next to the house.\" A shed could theoretically be located here, but this option would likely cause extra cleaning work because it is closer to the house.\n4. Option \"B: keeping things in\" also isn't a common location for a shed.\n5. For the farming-related options \"C, D and E\": \"ranch\" and \"farm yard\" are a little too specific to the context of the question to use, since they only apply when one is farming.\n6. So we can eliminate these. Finally, all that is left is \"backyard\" that could be any backyard from any location in a town which seems the most likely answer for the question.\nSo to summarize this thinking process we can say that the answer to the question is E, and in simple words, we can say the location of the shed.\n7. Therefore the final answer is E backyard\n\nInput: A group of students were out to lunch at a local restaurant. What was their name?

Team is what would be the common choice here and most likely to answer the question.\n3. Team is the one most fitting in this set of options to suggest that they were \"out to lunch\" at a local restaurant.\n4. In this case, the students went to lunch together and were all in the same group and so were a team but in a simple way.\n5. Therefore the most likely answer is \"T\" and in short, we can call this group \"teams\".\nSo the final answer to the question is T", "answer": "C: backyard"}

Choices:  a boy b: his dad c: his mom d: his son e: another swimmer\nOutput: 1). This question asks about a family the man saved by knowing how to swim, to which he would have provided the answers.\n2). If the man is capable of saving the entire family, it would be impossible for him to not know all their information.\n3). The information available about the family indicates that one child saved by the man was a boy (a).\n4). The man couldn't have saved another person if the rest of the members of the family were swimmers.\n5). If the man could not swim, then his actions would not have saved the family.\n6).

This indicates that the listener is looking for a specific place to find the lizard without knowing the lizard's exact location or country of origin.\n2. The question also specifies that the listener knows only basic Spanish. \n3. Options A, C, D all refer to Spanish speaking countries but the listener lacks basic understanding of Spanish language.\n4. Options B and E are excluded because \"where would I go?\" implies that the listener has the knowledge to go to a particular place.\n5. The question implies the listener does not have prior knowledge of the general location of the animal, and therefore the answer is not based on this information. \n6. There are thousands of languages in South America, and not all of them share the same Latin roots that English and Spanish do, implying the listener doesn't have specialized knowledge of their languages either. \n7. A knowledge of Japanese geography alone is unlikely enough to be the correct answer without knowing its other characteristics. \n8. New Mexico shares some similarities with Baja California, where the Gila monster is found. \n9. With this in mind, the correct answer appears to be New Mexico.\nSo the final is: E: New, Mexico\n\nInput: Where is the toothpaste made? Choices: \tA: in new york B: in china C: in japan D: in the house E: in florida\nOutput: 1: The toothpaste is a brand, not a location or specific item and this question does not provide enough context to determine where it is made.\n2. The toothpaste could be manufactured in a location that has no bearing on its origin or source, therefore making this question impossible to determine. \n3. For example, toothpaste that is manufactured in New York may have originated in China, or vice versa. The same goes for toothpaste manufactured in any other place, which shows that identifying where toothpaste is made isn't straightforward. \n4. The location of the company that manufactures toothpaste may not be relevant to its manufacturing process, making determining where it is made even less likely.\n5. Therefore there is insufficient information to determine the true location of where in the world the toothpaste is made and, based on the given", "answer": "A: utah"}

This is a generic term that does not directly refer to a system of electronic devices, or a specific use of them.\n6) Option A: Nature is not the best answer to this question. Instead, one would assume that a system of electronic devices in a school would have more direct applications to learning, and not to the environment itself.\n7) Therefore, we need to eliminate answer A: Nature.\n8) That leaves us with the following options: B: toilet and C: computer science.\n9) If these electronic devices are to be used to monitor toilet use, the devices would be installed in the bathrooms. They would provide a record of who used which bathroom and when they used it. B: toilet seems the logical choice here.\n10) But if these electronic devices are used to teach computer science concepts to students, we have the answer choice C: computer science as the devices would be used to perform these tasks, and not to monitor toilet usage.\n11) So the answer to the question is C: computer science. \nSo the final answer \nis C: computer science\n\nInput: At 5 AM, I was woken up by, an alarm, the phone, or my wife?

Choices:  a: a seat b: the door c: the bathroom d: the lobby e: the restaurant\n Output: 1. The word \"convenient\" in this context refers to ease of availability.\n2. The question asks about the best place on a train to change from coach to first/upper class in an emergency situation.\n3. The term \"elegant\" usually describes the upper class or the first class on a train, and the rest are considered common.\n4. We want to identify the \"easiest\" way to change, among the choices provided.\n5. The \"seat\" on the train is the place in which the passenger sits; as far as it's concerned the seat is the place to seat in upper class.\n6. \"Door\" is the entrance/exit to a coach, which may be locked and not suitable for changing classes on an emergency occasion.\n7. The choice \"the bathroom\" is implied to be in a coach, and not available to the upper or first class.\n8. The choice \"the lobby\" is usually referred to a waiting area at a train station and not accessible on board.\n9. The choice, \"the restaurant\", is a common expression for a train dining car. Therefore, it wouldn't work in an emergency situation to quickly change to the upper or first-class.\n10. The only remaining choice is C: The bathroom, which is both close and convenient, referring to accessibility.\n11. Therefore, the best choice is C: The Bathroom.\nSo the final Answer is C: The Bathoom\n\nInput: Why would you want your kids", "answer": "A: original"}

The options for the given answer are \nA:  Unfeeling B: Negligence C:  Antipathy D: Indifferent E: Rapport\n1. Unfeeling denotes a lack of empathy or sympathy, which suggests that someone who wishes for another person to fail is not necessarily indifferent towards you. \n2. Negligence refers to showing deliberate disregard or carelessness, which suggests that someone can be negligent in a variety of situations and not wish someone to fail.\n3. Antipathy indicates a dislike or aversion, suggesting that a person who doesn't care enough to succeed someone and actively wishes them to fail is not necessarily negligent.\n4. Indifference refers to lacking interest, care or enthusiasm, suggesting someone can be indifferent without necessarily being negligent. 5. Rapport denotes a connection or familiarity, indicating that a mutual dislike or indifference does not necessarily imply an absence of care for the other person's well-being. \n1. However, the person who doesn't feel emotions like care, pity, empathy, sympathy, etc. for the other person may have an antipathy towards them. Still, antipathy doesn't necessarily imply a lack of care or any feeling for the other person.

Choices:  Came out A: Played pranks B: Slept C: Created chaos D: Fished E: Scared people\nOutput: 1.) The question asks what the monster does during the daytime, while the other three answers ask about what the monster does overall.\n2. The monster is referred to as the word,'monster' that is part of the context of the question.\n3. Now looking at the answer options, since these options are about what the monster did overall, it is a possibility that the time of day was irrelevant.\n4. We can dismiss answers B and C, which are about the sleep schedule of the monster, if any.\n5. Option choice, E: scared people is out of context, as it doesn't say anything about day or night, and is thus eliminated.\n6. Choices A and D seem appropriate, as playing pranks and fishing generally suggest the daytime is not important (though these things could be done at any time). But one of these answers would work, because they both could imply daytime activity.\n7. Based on the question's context, the answer which could also apply to daytime is choice C: created chaos, since the monster causing chaos could be either during the day or at night, so it fits the intent of the question.\n8.

A \"religious\" upbringing seems too narrow, focused and specific as it focuses on one specific religion. \n6. An \"unpredictable\" upbringing isn't the type of result James wants. An unpredictable upbringing may cause an abnormal, undesirable and unexpected result. \n7. An \"holy\" upbrining again refers to a particular religion, so we can eliminate that option as well. \n8.

We are given five options or ways of doing something which allows us to do something different for the same intention, but we need to consider the main intention: to listen to music.\n3. From the list, we exclude options: A and E, which have the same intention, so we want to eliminate them out of the scope of thinking for a better alternative answer.\n4. So, the choices that remain are: B, C and D, but we can also exclude B, as it doesn't serve the main objective directly or has no relevance to 'listing to music.'\n5. It's worth mentioning that we exclude a valid option, but the reason is that it just doesn't fit the description or purpose of the question.\n6. Since we are only left with option C and D: play piano and have fun, we need to understand the context of what a piano offers versus what having fun offers to the intent of listening to music.\n7. The options are directly related to listening to music, and we can eliminate option E: to have fun as this would just distract from the intent of the question and only serve as an option to enjoy doing the act.\n8. But an instrument doesn't serve the same purpose, and the only instrument mentioned in the question is a piano.

The phrase \"showing signs\" indicates it is a visible instability, which is easily identifiable.\n3. Since carpenters fix things and their primary job is carpentry, the answer is likely to be \"repair\", which is what they do for a living.\n4. Now the question is about the \"signs\" of instability which are not limited to the instability. The signs can be anything else on the shelf. If this is true then the option \"Roof\" is not very relevant. Similarly for options C,D and E.\n5. The signs could be of a weakness on the shelf, which could mean a break or damage on the shelf, either internally or externally. The sign could also be a visible break or dislodgement of a shelf's element.\n6. Choices \"Corner\", \"School building\" and \"Cupboard\" does not answer the correct options. The option \"Wall\" can be the correct answer if the shelf has fallen from the top of the wall, so the choice \"Wall\" should be considered.\n7. The signs of instability could be the shelf sagging to one side or getting dislodged. It could be any of the two possible issues.\n8. Finally, choosing the \"correct\" option, the answer should be Wall.\nSo the final sentence is Wall.\n\nInput: If you put your arm in a cast, what part of your body is it covering?

The question asks about the physiological effects of this act, implying the potential presence of biological reactions or emotional implications from engaging in this activity.\n3. Looking through the options, we note that the options \"competition\", \"blood\", and \"medals\" do not seem to fit the requirements, as they refer to more than simply playful wrestling.\n4. \"Blood\" might happen if the two people involved in the activity suffer from severe injuries but it is not clear from the question so we can leave \"blood\" also.\n5. The options \"competition\" and \"medals\" also don't fit the activity as they are related to more specific pursuits rather than just playful wrestling. \n6. This leaves us with options \"erections\" and \"wins\" which can be biological in nature.\n7. Looking further, we notice that \"erections\" doesn't seem to reflect what is mentioned regarding \"wrestling\" as it suggests more physical force and intensity compared to \"wrestling\" which is presented as a playful activity.\n8. So, our only remaining option is \"wins\" \n9. Therefore, we have established that the answer is C: wins.\nSo the final sentence is: The man was playfully wresting with a women he was enamored and the physiological result would be wins.\n\nInput: What could you take to get a message in an envelope?

Although this can be considered a villa by a specific definition, it would not be common in a hotel/hostel/resort context.\n6. \"Spacecraft\": This option is typically related to advanced travel technology and is not something commonly found in accommodations.\n7. \"The hall\": This option refers to a large open space used for formal gatherings or ceremonies, but it is unlikely that it will be used as a room.\n8. The remaining options, \"Cabin\", \"Palace\" and \"Hotel\", have clear contexts, and are commonly used terms for types of accommodation.\n9. Among these options, the option that seems to be the most suitable answer to this question is \"Cabin\" which most likely denotes the room that was not available.\n10.

Since choices C and E do not appear in the context of the story, these two options can be ruled out. \n4. Next, let's analyze options B and D further. \n5. The clue that the 'audience laughed' indicates that there is something that is causing amusement. \n6. Choice D, 'Conference', is a general term not necessarily related to something funny, so we rule it out.\n7. Choice B, 'Theatre', can be used for comedic shows as well, like musicals or cabaret. \n8. Since there are multiple ways that a theatre could be used to amuse an audience, we can't eliminate choice B.\n9. To summarize, the only possible answers to the question are choices B and D.\n10.

We can eliminate C: off-Rhythm. Although it does describe the condition of someone singing off-key. It does not reflect the negative outcome of a person's singing error among a group.\n2. B: a cappela. This does not provide any insight into the negative impact of an off-key performance or any of the negative outcomes described in the question.\n3. D: Bad vibe. It is possible that the person's off-key singing might give the listener a negative feeling, but this does not necessarily imply that they will be bothered by it.\n4. E: Harmony.

However, looking at the words closely, the container we are looking for includes different parts of speech; for example, \"port\" is a place while \"refrigerator\" is a thing.\n4. To identify a solution, we need to cross out options that contain inappropriate elements of speech, such as places or time period.\n5. Starting with option E: port is a place so it is not a possible container to carry other items.\n6. Similarly, option A: food is not a thing so it is not likely to be put in a container.\n7.

The first option available to us is C: Count. This can be illegal because casinos don't want players to use counting/mathematical strategies to advantage themselves over the house.\n4. Let's disregard any options that are not related to the act. If you take the time to think about the context of the casino, it's pretty implied that any illegal activity that goes on in a casino wouldn't involve anything like remembering, dealing, helping, or winning.\n5. The question is most probably focused on using strategies to count (or memorize) the cards. With that assumption, it narrows the options to B: Helping (which is implied as being something illegal) and D: Dealing. \n6. We know that Dealing isn't what you are asked about as it's not the end of the act and there's still the \"when you play cards at a Casino\".\n7. Therefore, we have to eliminate the option D: Dealing and focus on the final option which is left now- B: Helping. \n8. The option B: Helping is not entirely irrelevant either. Sometimes in casinos, people help/assist/coach/mentor each other on how to play, which is illegal and can lead to the act mentioned in the question.\n9. Therefore our final answer is B: Helping.\nSo the final correct answer is B: Hel\n\nInput: Where do people commonly keep a picture in their house?

So, it can't mean what the project should be.\n5: Option B: They do not have to: Indicates that it is not mandatory for them to use wikipedia. So, it cannot mean that they be able to do it since that would imply that they had to do it.\n6: Option C: They should be able to: This is not indicative of a restriction as the students should be able to access wikipedia.\n7: Option D: They should be able: It is a bit confusing because the word'should' appears in both options. However, when'should' is used in D it can mean that something is likely to happen. So, this is also not applicable.\n8: Option E: They shall be given access to wikipedia: This is also not an indication of a restriction since this would indicate that we are giving access to wikipedia.\n9: Thus, since no option fits the requirement, option E is the best choice i.e. they", "answer": "A: wear shoes"}

For example, libraries are not typically places where tables are stored.\n3. Furthermore, a demonstration refers to a form of presentation that involves equipment such as a table.\n4. Likewise, both corners and football fields are places where tables probably aren't stored.\n5. Hence, it is safe to eliminate choices A, B, C and D.\n6. However, the possible choices are likely to be specific places within these locations, and are therefore still not valid options.\n7. Thus, we are left to choose between E: rug or E: room. \n8. Since a rug is a floor covering, it cannot be a \"place\" to put a table.\n9.

The choices provided are indications of the weather that indicate the temperature rapidly rising or dropping.\n3.) So, options C: cooling down and D: dropping quickly are the most apt answers.\n4.) Both C and D imply more rapid changes in the temperature. So, we might assume C or D may give the most accurate answer to this question.\n5.) But, let's check with option choice B: increasing in temperature, which does describe a sudden increase in temperature.\n6.) We may need to take B as a possibility, especially since B is a common occurrence with regard to the sun, where the sun can heat up rapidly.\n7.) Now looking at B and D: dropping, it seems that B and D may equally well describe the same situation, as both are related to a decrease in temperature.\n8.) If we take A and B as potential answers, then we can conclude that option A: dropping to zero can be disregarded because it's not implied that the temperature will necessarily drop to zero in the question.\n9.) Likewise, option D: dropping quickly would also be excluded as it may still mean merely a gradual decrease in temperature.\n10.) So far, C and B make a feasible pair of answers, though neither one specifically tells us why it's happening.\n11.) This brings us to look at the second and third sentences: the sun was out, and the temperature was changing rapidly.\n12.) The presence of the sun could very well be indicative of an increase in temperature.\n13.) Thus, it may also be possible that the sun's activity causes the temperature to rise rapidly and this is why B and D make a good pair of answers.\n14.)

{"idx": 623, "text": "1: The question asks about his wife's location of the deodorant when he complained of being unable to find it.\n2. As a deodorant's main purpose is to prevent body odor, we have to first look for the location where it was likely kept.\n3. The options provided are locations people usually store deodorant: grocery store, nightstand, armpits, own bathroom, and medicine chest.\n4. Let's eliminate the first two locations - grocery store and own bathroom. \nFirst, it's highly unlikely that he would leave an important item like deodorant at the grocery store, even if he only purchased it there once. \nSecond, although the question says that his wife asked him to look in his own bathroom, it does not say he actually went into the bathroom.\n5. Similarly, the question does not imply that he only used his own bathroom to store deodorant, so we will not disregard it.\n6. Since the question states that he asked for help in finding it, it indicates that he has been unable to locate the deodorant for quite some time, which implies that he didn't look in his own bathroomearlier. So, this leaves us with the other remaining locations- armpits and the nightstand.\n7. Since we can infer that the person frequently used the deodorant on a regular basis and usually has it nearby, we eliminate the option \"armpits\" as an impractical location.\n8. Let's look at \"nightstand\". An \"evening stand\" is an inadvertent misspelling of \"end table\" that indicates that the table is put at the end of a bed (or couch) and is meant to be used at night.\n9. Since it's nighttime at the moment when the question is asked, and the question is framed in a context that implies that his wife saw the deodorant there when she came up to the bed, it is likely that his wife saw deodorant standing at the end table and asked him to look there\n10. Therefore, the answer options would be either (B) grocery store or (E) medicine chest.\n11. However, option (E) medicine ches is more likely as the question specifically states that his wife asked him where", "answer": "E: medicine chest"}

Option C: look for is not an action expressing gratefulness. \n8. Option E: show of appreciation: is an action that expresses thankfulness that can be related to the question. \n9.

Choices: A: better B: worse C: best D: perfect E: in bad shape\nOutput: 1: The question asks about the characteristics of people who are good at solving problems.\n2. From the options, good at solving puzzles refers to a person's capacity for finding solutions, which is not the same as being best or best at solving puzzles.\n3. The word'solving' can be interchangeable with 'doing' according to Grammar rules. \n4. There are options that imply the person is better, or worse, or best at solving puzzle as opposed to merely being good at solving puzzles. \n5. When we look at the options, we understand that B: better, C: best are implications of'solving' the puzzles, so we can eliminate these options immediately. \n6.

It would be inevitable for anyone to get exhausted/tired/fatigue if they were to keep jogging the entire day. \n6. This also matches with shortness of breath, since it could happen from excessive exhaustion to the body as well as brain. \n7.

So, we can remove it from the list of options.\n4. We rule out poors countries (E) because slaves wouldn't carry out labor in these areas.\n5. We also eliminate ancient Rome (B) as it is not a southern institution or related to slavery in any way.\n6. We disregard the farm as it makes no logical sense as the answer to the question. Farmers work in farms.\n7. This leaves us with: Plantation (D). As it was stated as an institution in the question, this is the only choice that makes sense as the answer to it.\n8.

Therefore, its inclusion as a choice contradicts our answer.\n5) B) 'Cupboard' seems like a fitting place for spiders to exist, given its abundance of places to hide from view. Therefore, this answer is unlikely to be a choice for a home item which a spider-phobe would avoid.\n6) C) 'The Shed', also known as \"the shed\", is a structure that is often used for storage, but spiders are commonly found in this location. Therefore, it does not represent an item that a spider-phoh would avoid owning.\n7) D) 'The mail box' is not typically a place for spiders to live. They are not attracted in large numbers to an enclosed space with openings that provide easy access to their desired locations. Therefore, it's not a suitable place that a spider-obsessive would avoid owning as a home item.\n8) E) 'The Cellar' is one of the common places where you can find spiders, such as their homes found in corners near water and dark areas. So, E is not the answer.

The key to understanding this question lies in understanding what constitutes a yard. The phrase \"made up of\" implies that several units, or elements make up a yard. \n4. Thus, we can eliminate options A: city (a city does not refer to a single place, but rather an entire geographical area or territory); B: michigan is a state and not an individual component to a yard; \n5. C: three feet (three feet do not constitute an entire yard by themselves); \n6. D: subdivision (a subdivision could refer to a group of houses in a neighborhood or a specific division or section of a larger area); \n7. E: three arm span is an unnecessarily specific and impractical answer, furthermore not describing one of the main components to a yard. \n8.

While it would be impossible to exclude D (school child) as the primary duty of a parent since it includes the education of a child, the question seems to be asking for the most significant duty of a parent.\n6. The primary purpose of a parent is to provide care for a child in terms of food, shelter, safety, etc. Thus, the most important duty of a parent would be to provide such care, which falls under care (E) (or the parent's child).\n7. We can also consider the definition of a primary duty as \"the most important\", which would indicate that the primary duty is that which requires the most amount or extent of time or effort. As a parent is ultimately responsible for the well-being of the child, we could rule out D (school child) because a child's education falls under the duty of a school or teachers.\n8.

The question is asking what might happen if inflation fighting is not managed well.\n3. This implies we are looking for problems that inflation might create if not addressed adequately.\n4. When we think about this, the first problem that comes to our mind is economic instability, and this is indeed a consequence.\n5. This leads us to eliminate Option A: 'problems', as it can be applied to any problem that inflation might create.\n6. Similarly, our initial guess of economic instability does not apply to Option C: 'deflation', which is the opposite of inflation, as it occurs if the rate of inflation gets too low. Additionally, deflation does not usually create problems, making it an exceptional case.\n7. Our guess is further eliminated by Option E: 'cake', which is unrelated to the topic and therefore not a viable option.\n8. Looking at the given options, it can be concluded that only Option B: Not noticeable does not fit the context and cannot be the answer.\n9. The remaining options are: Option D: Economic instability and Option B: Not noticeably. \n10. Comparing and contrasting, economic instability can create problems, resulting from inflation's failure to be brought under control. On the other hand, not noticeable is not likely to cause any problems for not being noticeable. \n11.

Therefore, the options we need to compare and contrast are inflation (D) and economic instability (E). \n13. In comparing these two options, economic instability has a better chance of being considered the answer because it is more specific than inflation. \n14.

From the four options, only A and C are related to people getting along.\n3. Option C: disagreements cannot be avoided doesn't seem to be related since it doesn't speak for whether or not people should agree, but rather argues that arguments will occur regardless.\n4.

We first need to eliminate the \"false choices\" like B and E, because although those choices may be valid locations, they do not apply to this situation and are not \"logical results\" of the scenario provided.\n4. We can eliminate choice A, a department store, since it is very unlikely that Sam would go to a department store to wipe mud off his shoes.\n5. Option B, school, does not seem to be a logical choice because the time of day is probably not appropriate and it is most likely that he left them there in his hurry.\n6. Option C, garden, can seem like a logical choice because he wiped the mud off his shoes with newspaper and he may have been headed out to the garden to do some gardening with it.\n7. Option D, office building, might seem like an appropriate place, but we have to ask if anyone might come to his office to check on Sam or see the newspaper-covered shoes, which seem a bit out of the ordinary.\n8. Sam may not be comfortable leaving the muddy shoes in his office.\n9. We can eliminate choice E, the house.

Speed depends on the type of car and the condition of the roads, among other factors, and there is no single ideal speed for each vehicle in all situations and environments.\n3.) To reach a destination as fast as the car can travel safely, one must drive at the fastest speed that one can safely maintain, not necessarily the maximum speed the car can reach.\n4.) Option B, \"speed limit GPS\", is not a necessary requirement to reach a destination as fast a car can safely travel, and is not the answer to the question. \n5.) Option C, \"speed limit\", can refer to a legal constraint set by the authorities for a particular area. So, it is also not answering the question.\n6.) Option D, \"traffic speed limit\", typically refers to the speed which other vehicles are travelling. This could mean a higher speed or limit, but doesn't clearly indicate it. \n7.)

It does not have a beach with shallow waters, it is not a bathe and not a children's pool.\n4. The options remaining are the bathe in, the pool, the children's pool and the lake.\n5. If we are looking for a beach with a lake, it would mean we would have to include a swimming pool to make the beach.

So, what we have left to look for are the actions in the scope of a salesman and not a customer.\n6. A customer visiting a dealership to purchase a car, doesn't need to be a salesman, so all these have to be eliminated.\n7.

But in the given scenario, which requires a fruit to be used along with tea toast in the morning, this doesn't seem to be the appropriate answer.\n5. Options like cinnamon and 16-ounce Juice could not be used as they are not fruits. Moreover, they are also not used along with the tea toast to make it suitable for the scenario.\n6.

We can think of any action Mark can perform with the question of the truth and how it is important to him that he knows the truth.\n4. The options provided in the question are choices related to understanding, but they do not present a specific reason for why he wants to know the truth. If we take the choice 'understand', then why would he want to understand, this could be because he has doubts about the truth that he wants cleared.

One choice that makes the most sense to the question is option C: in-between.

This suggests that the person is unwilling to go to a particular place to address an issue with the car.\n3. The choices provided are places where a car may or may not be fixed.\n4. Looking carefully at all the possible choices and their relevance, we notice that repair shop and parking lot fit well as there are not happy with the state of their car they could potentially choose to take it to such a place.\n5. The phrase the person is \"not happy\" suggests that the car is not functioning properly or needs some repairs. This would be the case if the car had been to a mechanic for checking or fixing the problems, therefore eliminating the need to go to the mechanic at all.\n6.

If the agent was merely using charm to help her clients, she'd be incompetent or not gaining her clients' trust.\n6: C: deceive is the best choice as it directly supports what deceit can be used for.

Choosing a garden is unlikely to be considered when describing a place where plants will grow, so we will discard this choice.\n3. The jungle contains many trees and vegetation, so we can eliminate jungle.\n4. Looking for a place that does not contain plants, a park is an option where plants will not likely grow.\n5. Thus, the correct choice has to be in the other three places, namely desert, and grass.\n6. A desert does not have any plants at all in it and will not be considered as a place with plants growing.\n7. A grassy area has grass growing at it, however, it is still a place that will likely have plants as well, so we will discount this option.\n8. Lastly, there will be a large number of plants growing in a desert, even though not all of them would be grasses, the word grass suggests the exclusion of these plants, therefore we can discount the phrase: grassy area.\n9.

There is no specific place or characteristic that makes one of the options better suited for carrying such a bag than any other.\n3. From the provided clues, we can deduce that the bag is a large sack to carry items, not a small case to keep jewelry.

Option A: Humidifier is the device used to add moisture to the air, so it's a good choice by definition.\n4. Option 'B: surface of the earth' doesn\u2019t make any sense, so we can skip it.\n5. Option 'C: skating rink' is implying freezing an arid and dry air, which is the complete opposite of what is said in the question.

The answer to this question may lie in the two answers, however, only one of them is correct.\n4. One may find cows living on farms, so the answer to the question is not A: farm.\n5.

Looking though the options, some of them mentioned in the question are not a substitute for meat, as lentils (one type of legume) and walnuts are not considered to be similar to meat.\n4. Broccoli and cheese are foods eaten with meat dishes and are not considered substitutes for it.\n5. Corn is mostly eaten as a side dish with meat and not as a main course, so it also does not count as a meat substitute.\n6. This leaves us with two choices between E: cheese and B: broccoli.\n7.

Options A: pond and B: underwater are clearly not rivers. Option C: aquarium is a body of water, but probably neither an ice fishing destination nor something we want here.\n3.) As for Options D: lake superior and E: body of water, Lake Superior is the biggest lake in Michigan, not a river, so this can be eliminated.\n4.) We are left with two options, Lake Superior and the body of water where ice fishing can be done far. \n5.) Looking at these two, Lake Superior is more appropriate because it is a body of water. \n6.) So, option D: Lake Superior is the correct answer. \n7.) So, the final answer is D, Lake Superior.\nSo the final answers are D Lake superior\n\nInput: If you know how to perform the song, can you be considered ___? Choices:  Lucky! A Blessed! C Talented! E Unlucky!\nOutput: 1) The question asks whether a person who knows how to perform a song is necessarily talented.\n2) The options given are \"talented\", \"lucky\", \"blessed\", and \"unlucky\".\n3) One is not a synonym for the other as Lucky and blessed are not associated with performing a song.\n4) Unlucky is not applicable, since knowledge of how to perform the song is not necessarily disadvantageous. So A, B, and E are eliminated.\n5) The option left is C. Talented person are generally considered lucky, given their talent; however, they must work to refine and improve their skills. So they are not necessarily blessed, although they are probably better off than someone who doesn't have the talent or knowledge of performing the song. Thus, the most likely answer is C \"Talented\".\nSo the final answer to the final question is C: Talented", "answer": "D: lake superior"}

It is also vague as it does not describe any concrete location.\n6) Option C: cupboard appears to be about the area and location rather than the source of, or what the cause of, the smell is.\n7) The choice D: space shuttles has no bearing on the smell in the air of someone's kitchen, so this should be rejected.\n8) Option E: surface of earth is also too general and vague, doesn't answer what might be causing the smell.\n9) The final choice left is C: cupboard which implies a closed location of the kitchen in which smell is originating.\n10) Therefore, the answer is C: cupboard.\nSo the final  answer is C: cupboards", "answer": "C: cupboard"}

We know that this option implies a specific store for purchasing musical instruments.\n4. We know that vinyl comes in the form of records, so we are looking for something that makes a reference to purchase of record albums.\n5. We can eliminate options C: Records Store and D: Vinyl, C doesn't talk about record and D simply refers to vinyl in general.\n6. We can eliminate option E: Vinyl, because it gives the same effect as Vinyl itself.\n7. We can eliminate option B: Sawfway, because they sell music, but not vinyl, and B sounds more like a brand name like Safeway stores.\n8. We can eliminate option F: Store, because it's not very specific and doesn't really contain any information we're looking for.\n9. This leaves us with two options left: Record Album and Car.\n10. A: Record album, fits the need well. But Record store and car also fit the need well.\n11. Car is definitely ruled out as it doesn't provide a place to purchase records.\n12.

We need now to think about the possible purposes for such a cabin.\n3. We know that the cabin is inside an airplane that flies. It therefore follows that the cabin has to do with travel. So, we can rule out all options that are not related in some way to such travel, like'slow down', 'carry people', and'speed up'.\n4. The options \"crash\" and \"live on the plane\" seem unlikely, and therefore, we can rule them out.\n5. The question does not seem to be asking about 'carrying people' so, this option is not the correct choice.\n6. The question does not mention 'crashing the plane' as a purpose for the cabin so, this also does not seem to be a potential answer.\n7. The question does not ask \"What is the purpose of living on the plane?\" so, we can eliminate this too since that's not necessarily a purpose for having a cabin inside a plane.\n8. We are left with only two options: \"carry people\" and \"speed up.\" \n9. The cabin is used to carry people. In other words, it is used to transport passengers to their destination.\n10. However, the cabin is not necessarily used for speeding up, although that is a benefit of using the cabin. In other words, speeding up may be one of the side benefits of having the cabin.\n11.

Options C and D are negative responses, pointing to a less than positive opinion on the visit. \n4. Among these choices, it is unclear if 'without a doubt' is a stronger form of 'it was a shame'.\n5. However, it does not seem plausible to argue that the Canyon was shameful, as it is one of the most visited places in the US, and is generally accepted to be a beautiful natural attraction.\n6. Therefore, it seems to us that 'without a doubt' was probably meant to represent a very negative opinion, and 'it was an amazing visit' would be the more appropriate response.

The second option does not make sense because it mentions \"symptom\" as if the glass of wine contains symptoms. Since the wine is the poison, the scientist is not actually studying symptoms that will indicate the glass of wine is poisonous. Instead, the wine is poisoned, and any symptoms experienced are a result of drinking the poison.\n    3a. The third option does not make sense for determining if two glasses of wine are poisoned because the scientist does not have all the glasses with them. If they are drinking two glasses, they are not able to measure both glasses at the same time.\n    4a. The fourth option makes sense as the label would reveal the type of wine and its ingred", "answer": "B: exchange of ideas"}

However, to match the answer in this question, one's emotion before divorce must indicate that they are unhappy.\n4. To identify a suitable emotion, let's break down each option. \n5. The choice A: harder, can be used when one feels more difficult to do work, which doesn't match the given context. Therefore, it can be eliminated.\n6. Choice B: anguish can be a suitable option that indicates a sense of hopelessness and intense dissatisfaction. Although it indicates an unhappy situation, it's not necessary for the emotion to occur before marriage separation.\n7. Choice C: bitterness is defined as the state of being bitter and it indicates a sense of emotional resentfulness. Although it indicates an emotional state of being prior to the event, it doesn't necessarily indicate unhappiness and its occurrence requires careful consideration on the person's situation.\n8. The choice D: tears is a possibility for this question. Tears can be an outcome of any happy or unhappy event. Therefore it's not necessarily a feeling experienced before divorce.\n9. The choice E: sadness is similar to B: anguish. It can be a suitable emotion if it is experienced prior to divorce.\n10. Therefore, to choose between B: anguish and E: sadness, we have to determine if E is a more likely option than B, since they describe a similar emotional state.\n11. While E: sadness doesn't require a specific circumstance for the emotion to emerge, in our context, it can indicate an emotional state prior to the event.\n12. Moreover, the context is about the wife in a marriage, so it's more likely that the emotion is felt by the wife than by the husband, since the word \"she\" is provided in the question.\n13.

But we are looking for a foot operated vehicle in the air that has a foot interface to control motion.\n9 Therefore, the correct option is C) Accelerator as \"to operate an engine is to accelerate the vehicle\".\nSo the final answer in C: Accelerator\n\nInput: The scientist measured the weight of the object, where did a mass scale read the weight?

The'snake' is the animal of interest, and the demand for 'exotic snakes' is related to the popularity of this type of animal among pet owners.\n3. Let us examine the options.\n4. A: Ditch: This does not seem plausible as it is unrelated to the demand for exotic snakes. The word 'ditch' suggests an intentional end to a relationship or involvement in something.\n5. B: Shop: This indicates that the people buying the snakes are doing so in a store, which could be a pet store or another establishment where these animals would be bought or sold.\n6. C: North America: This is an extensive geographical area, covering several regions and multiple countries. \n7. D: Pet Shop: This is a specific type of store where pets, including exotic snakes, could be bought.\n8. E: Outdoors: This is an unspecified location or area, which could be indoors or outdoors somewhere.\n9. Thus, the answer is likely D: Pet shop.\n10. This option specifically refers to a specific place, as opposed to general terms like geographical area or broad terms like outdoors or ditch. \n11. Additionally, 'pet shops' are known to sell snakes, which is directly related to the demand in the question.\n12.

The individual can consider neighborhoods, subdivisions, city, suburbs and streets. \n3. Choice A: neighbourhood is most likely to be ruled out as it is ambiguous regarding the location of the property being fenced-off from other places.\n4. Choice B: Subdivision is most likely to be rejected as it doesn't directly provide fenced-off areas from the other places. \n5. Choice C City sounds more specific and can be used as the place where the individual needs to start looking for such properties.\n6. Although choice E: Street provides narrowed-down options of areas that can meet the individual's needs, it doesn't provide a complete answer. If one thinks about it; streets are a part of many different locations, so not only cities, they can also be in sub-divisions, suburbs and neighborhoods. They can also be within towns and other locations. \n7. Therefore, among all the choices, the best choices is C: City.\nSo the final choice is C: City\n\nInput: How many steps would it take if I start walking up this huge mountain? Choices: 1.

We are looking for an effect that could be caused by the close watching or an alternative related to it and that can cause pain.\n3. The options are: brain problems, laziness, get fat, headaches and laughter. We can discard those options that don't directly cause pain.\n4. Of those that cause pain, laziness is not a physical pain but a mental one, and that is not answered in the question.\n5. Get fat is also not a pain itself, but the cause of another type of pain that is not related to the question, so we can discard it.\n6. The options Headaches and brain problems cause pain, so we need to determine if they are related to sitting too close to TV.\n7. Brain problems: No. In this instance it is unlikely that the person watching the TV would get brain problems due to it or as a direct result.\n8. Headaches: Yes. In this instance we can say TV sitting is an easy option for people with headaches.\n9. Therefore Headaches is the best choice.\nSo the final choice is D: Headache\n\nInput:How does a stomachache develop? Choices:  I have had a stomachache 2 times a week all my life. Choices:  A.

The five possible choices presented are consequences that a person can experience by eating too much dinner.\n3. We need to find one of the three choices to identify the one and only cause and effect relationship in the options based on the question.\n4. The first option \"tiredness\" does not provide a reliable link to eating too much food, and therefore we can eliminate this choice.\n5. The second choice \"living longer\" is not a definitive result of eating too much, and therefore we can also disregard it from the options.\n6. Similar to \"tiredness\" and \"living longer\", the third option \"stomach ache\" is also not directly related to eating too much, so we exclude this choice of the options as well.\n7. The fourth and the fifth options provide a reasonable link to eating too many or too much food.\n8. The fourth choice \"illness\" is a natural consequence of eating too much food.\n9. \"Acid reflux\" is a condition connected to the digestive system and therefore the likely answer to what is eating too much likely to result in.\n10.

The impacts on the season must be relevant and consistent with the concept of \"successful skiing.\"\n3) This can be achieved by either eliminating invalid or incorrect options or by selecting the only valid option from the ones available (known as a \"restrictive condition\").\n4) Choice (D) \"Chapped lips\" is an irrelevant impact as skiing will not result in chapped lips.\n5) Similarly, Choice (E) \"Healthy body\" is a redundant impact as being healthy is expected of a season of successful sports, and it cannot be a result.\n6) Choice (B) \"Broken bones\" and Choice (C) \"broken legs\" do not stand correctly with the concept of successful skiings. Broken bones indicate a failure, but \"successful skiing\" means getting more goals than the previous one. So, \"broken bones\" would not be a good result of a season of skiings.\n7) Thus, Choice (D) is the correct answer as it clearly stands out with the concept of \"skiing\" being successful, which leads to chapped lips as an impact on the season while skiing.\nSo the final answers is D: chapped lips", "answer": "E: healthy body"}

Choices: A: near counter B: near sink C: near pantry D: near freezer E: inside fridge\nOutput: The question asks about a location for butter in the kitchen.\n1. Butter typically should go in the fridge, because if not used immediately, it can spoil.\n2. All the choices except option C are near the fridge, so option C stands out by isolating butter to the fridge.\n3. Option E, inside the fridge, is misleading because butter is not stored inside a fridge but in a separate compartment. \n4. Option D, near the freezer, is a logical choice because the freezer could contain frozen food in need of defrosting.\n5. Option A, near counter, isn't applicable for butter because butter is placed in either the pantry or the fridge, not on the counter. \n6. Option B, near sink, has the same issue as Option A in that it is not an appropriate place for butter. \n7. Option B, near pantry, could be a good choice, but butter is usually next to the fridge and not in the pantry. \n8.

If it can wait until we're finished with what we're doing, it probably should. However, if this coworker doesn't know we're busy, then he or she might hang up anyway, expecting us to call back.

A Lion could eat a gazelle without having to go through all the steps that the Gazelles\u2019 other predators go through. \n7) The reasons for this are that being at the top causes the lion to hunt less frequently, because they aren\u2019t so hungry that they", "answer": "D: being bored"}

Choices: \tA: A common background B: Similar personality C: A family resemblance D: A unique coat of paint E: The same breed\nOutput: 1 We can conclude from the context of the question that people, the question is referring to is a crowd as people do not \"walk\" in a group.\n2. Based on the context, it is evident the question is asking about a dog in the group, so choice B: similar personality is not applicable.\n3. Choose E: The same breeds is likely to be the correct answer, given the context.\n4. Choice D: A unique coat or paint is also not likely the correct answer, given that there is a diverse group which implies diverse appearance of the dogs.\n5. However, choice A: A common background is an appropriate option given the context.\n6. Therefore the answer: A. Common background\nSo the final answer will be: A. Common background.\n\nInput: What would you do if someone said to you \"I can only use one word to describe our class.\" Choices: A: Use this information to get to know that person better B:", "answer": "A: violence"}
{"idx": 96, "text": "1 The question is asking, \"what do cats get into\" when \"they are ripping things apart\".\n2. Choices A and B can be omitted because the cats are ripping things apart, not taking bite or walking.\n3. Chooses C and D can be omitted because the nature of cats cannot be ripping things apart on their own.\n4. Therefore, options B, E, C, and D can be eliminated.\n5. Now, considering options A and E only two possible reasons for cats getting into trouble.\n6. Option A can be eliminated because it can only occur when cats get into a dog's mouth. However, we are looking for something that is more broad. In addition, the word \"trouble\" can also refer to the problems caused by other animals, making this option implausible.\n7. And, option E. If cats are ripping something apart, what could they get into? The obvious answer is \"nature\".\n8.

If someone would ask this question, the person probably would have the intention of answering. (The question implies that \"How do you cello?\" is a question with an expected answer which has a reasonable length and is not very trivial.)\n3. Considering C:\"how\". The question is asking about Cello. So we can eliminate C because C doesn't answer this question.\n4. Considering D:\"How?\". How about Cello is an obvious answer. So we can eliminate D as well.\n5. The question says \"How\" does someone play Cello?. So, the person needs to use a tool. Based on this logic, it seems the person needs to use the bow to play Cello.\n6. Therefore the answer is E:\"You use the bow to play back the strings\".\nSo the final answer to the question is E: \"You use the bow to back the strings\".\n\nInput:What is", "answer": "D: trouble"}

When it comes to doing housework, however, it is more about endurance and hard work than actual pressure or worry.\n4. \"Feeling boredom\" is also an inappropriate option since it is unlikely that heavy housework could cause boredom as it tends to be more of a physical activity rather than something that relies on mental stimulation.\n5. \"Feeling anxiety\" is a possibility, but it is unlikely since doing housework doesn't cause an immediate sense of danger or apprehension.\n6. Considered together, the best answer is choice \"A: anger.\"\nSo the final answer in anger", "answer": "C: stress"}

The option \"France\" is the French nationality, implying that Sam is a French person, who went to Paris.\n4. So, this option has to be eliminated.\n5. Similarly, the option \"fish market\" seems to be the opposite as mentioned before, and does not relate in any way to the place Sam was likely to be in.\n6. Option \"Atlantic ocean\" is also ruled out due to context. Sam could have been anywhere near the French shores, not in the atlantic ocean.\n7. Option \"Cuba\" is also not a fitting answer to the question, as the question does not mention anything about Cuba, nor does it seem consistent with the answer \"France\" to be the nationality.\n8. The remaining choices are \"D: atlantic oasis\" and \"E: Paris\". The choice \"Paris\" is the most logical fit as it is the French capital city located in France, which Sam was likely to visit.\n9. The choice \"Paris\", however, refers to the nationality of Sam as a French person, who had probably visited Paris before.\n10.

{"idx": 160, "text": "1-2. The question is asking what emotion one may feel after getting paid.\n3. There is no doubt that we feel at least one, if not multiple emotions after getting paid for our work. However, based on the options, we need to find an emotion that is most likely to be felt after getting paid.\n4. Looking carefully at the options given, we have: Sorrow, paying bills, happiness, frustration, and spending money.\n5. However, we can easily find that option A, sorrow, is not something we are likely to feel after getting paid. Hence, option A is not the answer and can be rejected.\n6. Option B, paying bills also has an outstanding probability of not applying. It is unlikely that feeling sorrow would lead to spending money, which is what paying our bills entails. So, option B can be rejected as well.\n7. Similarly, option C, happiness, is unlikely to be a cause of an emotion. Happiness most likely is a result of emotions we feel. And based on the context of this question, happiness cannot be an answer. Hence, the option C, happiness, can be eliminated.\n8. It's clear by now that feeling paying bills is not the answer as well. Now that all other options have been rejected, option D, frustration, is our only remaining response. Frustration is most likely to be what we feel after paying bills. So option D, frustration is our final answer.\nSo the final answers are: 7. Option D, frustration\n\n## 9th Question\nInput: Which of the following do people call 9-1-1 for?

Choices:  Selling fastest Selling expired Expanding stock Storing it Selling it\nOutput: 1 The question is focused on the best solution to save money on buying something out of season.\n2. The four options listed refer to different aspects of purchasing something: buying products, stocking them, selling, and disposing them.\n3. Buying at a cheaper price is generally the objective we want to achieve.\n4. Out of these four options, 'Selling fastest' is the most suitable option for saving the most on our purchase, as there are fewer overheads or storage costs after it's sold. \n5. 'Selling expired' is also a realistic option and can work well if the product you desire is perishable and you are willing to settle for a smaller discount.\n6. 'Expanding stock' and 'Storing it' are not suitable options here as it is unlikely we want to store the product or hold onto extra stock to wait for the normal season.\n7.

In sports, stadiums exist for multiple sports and can be divided into separate stadiums according to the size of the sport or location. These are typically called 'Stadia'.\n4. A football stadium and baseball stadium are commonly used terminology but not for all stadiums, a stadium can be defined by its location, or simply a stadium could also be a'stadium' for many sports.\n5. Among the options, the choice 'Pulman Laboratory' is incorrect as it isn't a stadium. Nor there is any laboratory that is used in the baseball stadium.\n6. 'Pharmacy' is incorrect as it provides the wrong connotation of what the child was enjoying.\n7. 'Soccer Play' is incorrect because it describes a sporting event rather than enjoying a sport and is another stadium with wrong connotation about what the child was enjoining.  \n8. Amongst the remaining choices, the phrase 'first game' hints at the child playing the sports himself. \n9. Thus, 'first game' denotes that the child played at a football stadium.\n10. The remaining words can also be re-arranged as 'first' was earlier mentioned as 'child played'.\n11. Therefore, 'first game' could be 'baseball 'played, but this changes the rest of the words and doesn't make sense as bleachers exist only for football, and not baseball, they are not related to baseball stadium.\n12. Also, baseball is a different game to football and a baseball stadium is not similar in appearance to football stadium.\nA more accurate representation of the phrase 'first game on the bleachers' is 'the child pounded his mitt enjoying the first game at football stadium'. \n13. The phrase 'at football stadium' is more relevant, and doesn't modify the first game.\nThus, the answer is A, 'football stadium', which is where the child pounded his mitt while enjoying", "answer": "C: baseball stadium"}

Possible reasons people have for going for a jog include losing weight, running away, getting tired, feeling proud, and heavy breathing. \n3. \"Losing weight\" and \"running away\" are both uncommon reasons for going jogging, so we can eliminate these options.\n4. Furthermore, feeling pride or \"getting tired\" can also be a positive result rather than the main one. The option \"running away\" is not realistic in this context as running away isn't an end goal but a means of escaping from something undesirable.\n5. So, we're left with two options: \"losing weight\" and \"feeling tired\". The latter could be a side effect of jogging, but it's unclear if this is the main goal of jogging.\n6.

Choices:  a: bread B: carp C: shrimp D: worms E: oysters\nOutput: 10. The question is asking us to identify a food that can be used to catch fish that are not interested in the offering of bait.\n11. Typically, it is not necessary to use a specific type of bread when fishing as most fish will readily accept bread as bait.\n12. Choice B is invalid as \"carp\" is a type of fish that is typically very inactive and difficult to catch.\n13. Choice C is invalid as \"shrimp\" also refers to a type of fish that are not typically interested in bait.\n14. Choice D is invalid as \"worms\" are a type of bait that is not preferred by all types of fish.\n15. Choice E is invalid as the question requires the use of a specific type of food that is not typically associated with the word \"oysters\".\n16.

Although they could both be used for the question, they generally refer to different sets of ideas.\n3. Celebration means commencing and performing special activities to mark some kind of event. \n4. In contrast, an occasion commonly refers to a momentary feeling or feeling at a given point in time. \n5. As we are looking to identify a specific reason for the celebration, the options B and C would not be applicable as they are more related to the way we engage in a celebration, not the specific thing that we celebrate.\n6. Therefore we can rule out options B and C.\n7. Now, considering the rest of the options A, D, and E, choice A: drinking would seem to be the answer as drinking can be a reason for celebration.\n8. As an explanation of choice A: drinking, option D: happiness seems to cover the same ground - celebrating happiness. However, option E: enjoyment seems to contradict the reason for celebration. Drinking should not be enjoyment or a reason to enjoy.

The given question presents a single choice as an alternative spelling of the word 'organize' followed by four additional choices that clearly exhibit flaws and aren't a suitable alternative to 'organize'.\n3. The word \"organize\" is a multi-syllable word with multiple phonetic pronunciations; hence one letter can sound like another.\n4.

Since we know that \"toy store\" has \"toys\", that indicates that they sell toys at that location and not RVs. \"Basement\" indicates that there is a house that has an RV for plug in, but no option for cooking. \"Rest area\" is probably the best choice for the question, because rest area generally has rest rooms (toilet) and they also have a cooking area/room.\nSo the final is E: rest area \n\nInput: If your friend is late to the meeting, what would you most likely say?

The question states that the animal cannot do something because they cannot fulfill one of its requirements (swimming).\n3. We can eliminate A, B, C, and D because they do not relate to swimming, and therefore, do not provide the correct answer.\n4. This leaves E: reproduce asexual. Animals that cannot swim cannot reproduce asexually because this is primarily dependent on water, which is not available to them.\n5. Therefore option E: reproduced asexually is the most suitable answer to this question.\nSo the correct answer is E: reproduce asexuallly.\n\nInput: What kind of game is called \"Go Fish\" Choices:  A. fish B. turtle C. snake D. monkey\nOutput: 1) The question asks about the name of a type of game referred to as \"Go Fish\" which may be playing by children and families. \n2) The name of the game refers to \"fishing,\" which implies the game involves searching for cards among those already on the table. \n3) Looking at the options, the game \"Bug Fish\" which is only an adult-oriented card game does not apply as the question specifies a family-friendly game played by children.\n4) The name \"frog\" for a fish is an incorrect term for people, frogs do not swim, so there is no possibility of calling a fish \"Frog.\" So that option has been eliminated.\n5. Similarly, calling a turtle, snake, or monkey \"fish\" is incorrect, so we can eliminate B, C, and and D.\n6. Now all we have is A: fish remains as its only possible outcome at this point.\n7. That's why \"a fish\" is the correct answer to the question. The question asked for a popular game among children, and the answer would be \"fish,\" as it is the most common name for a child to call a fish.\nSo the correct option is A: fish.\n\nInput: How was the man in the cage?

Options D and E: falling down, locked, not relevant unless specifically requested in the question.\n4. The owner does not need to keep the bedroom door \"open\" or \"closed\" just in case the kitten, which is new to the house's property, climbs onto them.\n5. The owner does not also need to \"fall down\" after discovering the kitten climbing on their possessions, nor does the owner need to keep the bed door \"locked\" so that the kitten does not enter.\n6. It can also seem slightly harsh to ask the owner to restrict the places the kitten can stay to the shower, especially since showers are typically small enclosures and may not be suitable.\n7. The only remaining choice seems to be E: found at shower, which doesn't directly or literally mean that the owner will have to keep the bedroom's door closed in order to prevent the kitten from climbing onto his/her possessions.\n8. The statement \"The new kitten hadn\u2019t gotten used to...\" and its usage in the previous sentence seems to indicate that the kitten is not used to \"everything\" around the house, which \"may\". \n9.

So it is ruled out.\n4. \u201cMiddle East\u201d is a region but not a city. so it can be ruled out the same way \u201cJerusalem\u201d was.\n5. \u201cIndia\u201d is a country with many cities but it is not a temple in a name of the city. So it can be ruled out also.\n6. All this conclusion means \u201cChina\u201d, with two or three letters, is the only option that is left.\n7. Finally, the answer is therefore \u201cChina\u201d\nSo the final answer in \u201cChina\u201d\n\n Input: What did the carpenter try to do, but couldn't?

The masts on these types of boats are not moved, so B is not the answer. \n5) The last option E: \"ship\" or \"motorboat\" also cannot be the answer because both of these types of vessels are described as \"headless\" and have masts that are moved by using a helm.\n6) Therefore, the only two choices A or C remain. \"Ship\" is not the correct answer because it has a head on it. \"Bateau\" is also a type of boat but not one that is used for moving masts on a helm. \n7) Looking at the choices left, we can discard choice A as it is not a \"ship\" and is not a \"helmsman\". And we also cannot discard choice C because it is a \"ship\" and a \"helmsman\", but it is not \"headless\" because it does have a head. Therefore, the final answer is C(Ship): Helmsman.\nSo the final choice is C: helmsman \n\nInput: What might a person with a cold use that someone who got the flu uses, yet is used to treat arthritis as well?

Considering these reasons, the following factors are common among all: having fun and winning money.\n3) Other factors can include specifications of the game including type, numbers of players, and game rules. But such factors don't change the overall purpose of playing.\n4) Thus, we should eliminate choices that involve these factors. A: Amusement refers to fun and playing but it doesn't refer to a specific type of game, so it's not the best.\n5) B: losing money implies a game with monetary goals which is different from general playing, and therefore its not the correct answer.\n6) C: charmed implies a game played under special circumstances, like to be charmed or to break a record, but generally doesn't refer to the overall reason. Therefore, charmed is not the best choice.\n7) D: having fun doesn't refer to more specific purposes for playing cards, it just refers to playing cards in general.\n8) E: win money can be a direct reason, but it can also be a result of losing money, so it's both.\n9) So the only remaining option that meets the criteria is E: win money as it refers to the common outcome of any type of general playing, and it is also the most straightforward one.\nSo the final answers are: Win money.\n\nInput:You could order a pizza from a takeout store or make it yourself at home.

{"idx": 604, "text": "1.) The question is concerned with figuring out the opposite of joy.\n2.) When reading this question, the use of \"the woman experienced great joy\" could be confusing as to the level of the woman's happiness versus the level of great joy; for example, the woman could be suffering from a major depressive disorder. \n3.) However, according to the context of the question, the woman's level of joy is likely high.\n4.) Therefore, despite the level of joy, the woman's emotional state would most likely not be sadness or sorrow which have negative connotations and are not the opposite of joy in this case of extreme happiness.\n5.) If the woman really were suffering from depression and the joy she experienced was low despite being great, the emotional opposite would most likely not be sorrow or sadness.\n6.) For these reasons, it can be safely assumed that the woman's joy is high, so B: Sadness can be immediately disregarded.\n7.) A: misery and E: play time are not opposite to joy in this context as they have different meanings. If the question had been asking for the opposite of misery, choice C: bad time could be a valid answer, or as an option to consider, until it can be determined that the woman is not experiencing misery.\n8.) D: sorrow is the opposite of joy because they are both emotional states that refer to feelings of happiness and unhappiness respectively. However, sorrow is the opposite of the word 'joy.'\n9.) Option C: Bad Time implies that the woman is experiencing a difficult situation, so it cannot be the opposite of joy because joy is defined as \"a state of happiness,\" and bad time is not related to or is not synonymous with happiness. The phrase \"but despite that this was\" indicates that the woman is experiencer extreme joy, so despite the situation, the woman is experiencing an extremely high level of joy.\n10.) The only possible answer is D: Sorrow. \nSo the final answer was D: Sorrow\n\nInput:If you were the janitor, what would you want for Christmas?

Based on the context of the sentence, the options provided could indicate various acts which the scientist recently avoided or refrained from doing. These may be general activities, or related to his study or work.\n3. When we look at the options, the most reasonable answer is 'Work' as it's a general act which can indicate any recent activity.\n4. 'buy' is a general choice but it doesn't fit the context of'scientists'\n5. 'Eat' is again a general option but doesn't match up to the context.\n6.

We need to select the option that most accurately describes the activity of only specific types of police.\n4.) Looking at the options, directing traffic is a commonplace task for most types of police, but not exclusively applicable to a particular subset, so we can eliminate Direct traffic answer B: board vessels. This is a task that typically applies to a particular subset of police. Similarly, finding drugs is a commonplace task performed by police of different kinds, and we're looking for what only some of them do. So, Option E: find drugs is eliminated. Arming themselves is a task that falls under the broader umbrella of protecting the local community and is not necessarily specific to what police of any particular type do. So, Option C: Arming themselves is eliminated. Option D: Helping people is an umbrella term within which many other tasks fall like directing traffic, board vessels, and protecting the local community that all apply to different types of police. So, Help people is eliminated. This leaves us with option A: direct traffic. This is primarily what only local police, and sometimes traffic police do. In cities with heavier traffic, the traffic police are often responsible for directing it, while police of other kinds handle other issues at that time.

They were waiting for a person to return. Their wings were. Choices:  A fluttering B sleeping E pecking C twitching F stretched\nOutput: 1: The group of birds is a subject while the verb \"were waiting\" is an action. To find out who is waiting, the action should provide a clue to the subject.\n2. \"resting\" is an adjective describing the action, not an action of its own.\n3. \"waiting\" is also an action, not a verb.\n4. \"twitching\" and \"sleeping\" are both nouns, a verb modifies a noun, not vice versa.\n5. \"Fluttering\" is defined as a \"rapid quivering movement,\" which generally does not apply to birds, so we can disregard it.\n6. \"c\" in \"were c.. \" should be \"waiting,\" which is an action.\n7. Also, \"pecks\" is defined as a single act of pecking (noun).

Looking closely, the personality traits specified for C: own house are in line with the personality of one who is outgoing. \n11. Also, since outgoing people may be looking for new experiences, they can be searching for owning their house, which can provide that.\n12. Hence, the answer is C: own house. \nSo the final answer C is own house\n\n###### Leave a comment if you find a problem with my solutions.", "answer": "A: new experiences"}
{"idx": 652, "text": "1, The question is asking about a type of sporting event where spectators might be particularly vocal.\n2. Various sports have different personalities and cultures which can be attributed to their fans and spectators. Based on this information, we can eliminate options we know are not suitable. For example, option A: show, and option E: event, neither include a sporting event.\n3. Option A: theater, is not generally known for spectators being very enthusiastic or vocal or having a high energy level.\n4. Option D: movies, is a different type of event and does not have as much interaction or excitement as a sporting event. The crowd is still present during movies in theaters, but not to the extent of a sport, and rarely are they vocal or active.\n5. Therefore we have options B: hockey, C: football, or D: basketball. \n6. Hockey is most commonly known for fans being rowdy, but they are not usually considered the loudest crowd as they have a lot of movement in the stands and during intermissions, so we can disregard hockey.\n7. During a basketball or football game, fans are generally more loud, active, and sometimes violent. In addition, spectators can become particularly vocal or rowdy at special or important events like a championship game or holiday or anniversary events, so we can eliminate these.\n8. Therefore the only remaining choices are basketball and football.\n9. Basketball game fans may be more vocal and energetic for certain games. In addition, fans may be more vocal during a key game like in championship or high-profile games, or a game between rivals such as an intense match-up between opposing schools or rivals.\n10. Also when there is a high-stakes game or a rivalry, fans may become particularly loud and active in their behavior. Based on this, we can eliminate football.\n11.

Also, it could be an incorrect representation of a goverment and its motive.\n4) Another suitable option would be the \"trouble\" since this means a form of disturbance, which could be a cause for seeking control of the people the goverment governs.\n5) The option \"sun\" is quite unusual and may not have any connection to a goverment seeking control over its people, so it can be discarded. \n6) The option \"control\" seems too obvious to be considered as an answer, and it fits well with what is stated in the statement of the question, it seems like the best choice.\n7) Hence the answer to the question is \"control\".\nSo the final answer Choices: \"control\"\n\nInput: Why does a pencil have an eraser? Choices: A: to keep a record B: make mistakes C: corrects itself D: makes you smell E: correct mistakes\nOutput: 1.) Our questions asks us \"why does a pencil has an eraser\".

This question says that the eraser is to \"keep a record\". This seems unusual and out of context, therefore an erroneous option as this is not what the purpose of the eraser is.\n4.) The option B.) says that the eraser \"makes mistakes\". This seems logical because the eraser is used when you make a mistake while writing, by erasing it, right? \n5.) The option C.) says that the erased makes corrections to itself. This seems a bit confusing as when you erase something with a pencil, you leave a mark, and erasing that mark again with the eraser would leave another erased mark. Hence, an erroneous option. \n6.) The option D.) says that the erase makes you smell. This", "answer": "E: control"}
{"idx": 660, "text": "1 The question is asking about a specific route of a car journey and the places it might pass through, such as developed land, united states, beach, countryside, and atlas. \n2. The choice of 'The people wanted to take a scenic route' indicates that the journey is likely a scenic route for its beauty rather than for convenience.\n3. To determine the most suitable answer for the question, we need to consider how 'the people' might choose a route that passes through scenic areas.\n4. For the choice 'They chose the highway that cuts through the united States', this suggests that 'they' were perhaps American people, and the United States has both city and countryside areas.\n5. The choice 'They chose the most highway' does not really describe a route that cuts through scenic areas. \n6. The choice 'The people wanted to stay in the country' does not really mean a whole country.\n7. It only suggests to stay in scenic countryside places.\n8. 'They travelled through the atlas of the country' seems out of context as a route usually requires a road or highway pass through it and an atlas doesn't really fit.\n9. Therefore we can eliminate most of the options. So, we now can determine the answer to the question. \n10. The statement refers to the option D: 'The people wanted to go through the beach'.\n11. So, the answer is D. \nSo the final answer D: The People wanted to go through the Beach", "answer": "A: countryside"}

Choices:  Mom, Dad, Sis A: Sis B: They need to socialize C: TV's not good for kids D: Kids are smart E: Parents should protect them\nOutput: 1: This question asks why parents should not let their children watch TV.\n2. The answer should not be based on personal observations or biases but needs to be a universally accepted reason.\n3. Options A: Mom, Dad are parents, and although they may have reasons not to allow their children to watch TV, they may not be universally valid.\n4. Option E: Parents should preserve their children, while an acceptable parenting strategy may not be necessarily provide grounds for this question as it refers to protecting from harm from unsuitable materials.\n5. Option B: They should socialize implies the need for children to have interactions with their peers which can be done outside of the watch of TV.\n6. Option C: TV's, not good for kids is a matter of opinion, and the question does not ask for reasons for opinions, but rather a factual reason.\n7. So, the only option left that doesn't seem to be a generalizable reason is Option D: Kids are too smart. However, this refers to a skill rather than TV or its contents.\n8.

Among the choices, \"heartburn,\" \"gas\" and \"food poisoning\" are the only ones that can be directly related to their eating experience.\n4. Based on the context of the question (these people are having fun), option A: \"heartburn\" can be eliminated\n5. Option B: \"enjoy\" and option C: \"have fun\" are vague and ambiguous, and while one can have a good meal and then be unlucky enough to get a stomach bug, it is still a random occurrence and too general to be assumed. They may need to return to the fun on the next ride instead of being out for the rest of the day.\n6. Therefore the answer would have to be \"gas\" or \"food poisoning.\"\n7. Between the two options, \"gas\" seems more likely given the specific details in the question, so the only answer is \"gas\".\n8.

Options A: house, B: fast food restaurant, D: conference and E: paper don't fit the context. \n3. The word \"conference\" isn't associated with the meaning of purchase and eat food. Moreover, it refers to a specific type of meeting that does not necessarily involve food or tables.\n4. Similarly, option C: library suggests an institution rather than a place where one typically purchase and eat food and use tables. \n5. Thus, the options to be disregarded are C: library and E: paper.\n6. Option A: house, and option B: fast food restaurant refer to two specific places where one can purchase and eat food.\n7.

A: more people watching a movie indicates an increase in popularity, which might result in a greater audience and more fans. \n4.

Option A: more people watched the sequel indicates that more people watched it because it may be more popular.\n8.

D: antidote - Makes the second most sense when combined with the word accidentally.\n6. E: nutrient - Makes very little sense when combined with the words accidentally and cabinet.\n7. So, the answer is C: medicine. But this can't be considered without the word accidentally. This eliminates option D: antidote.\n8.

It describes a location or region or an area of a place where there are usually a lot of people coming, going, and going on, like a place where people move from A to B, it can be found in a city or in the suburbs.

Now we need to find the correct answer from the options provided\n\n5. So let's check the two options left, what connects \"wires\" with \"walls\", the answer is \"computer Network\", this way means that both of them are connected by wires, we don't need to search for the exact connection, we use general knowledge about how a computer works to understand that there is a connection between them, the computer generates electricity, we use the wire to connect to the circuit or the battery that charges the computer and it goes through the computer network in the network to charge the battery and start the computer, therefore the answer is \"freeway\"\n\nSo the final answer from what was stated before is \"freeways\"", "answer": "E: freeway"}

Choices: \tA: don't engage B: tell them to be quiet C: point out their flaws D: remind them of their responsibilities E: remind them of what they can accomplish\nOutput: 1.) The question asks about what is the best response to whining, which is a repetitive complaint given in a complaining way.\n2.) One option can be discounted as a word choice issue. The words \"tell them\" instead of \"say\" makes it obvious that the \"tell\" here is meant to instruct, not in any way meant to be an actual verb. So, the option \"tell them to be quiet\" is eliminated.\n3.) The option \"point out their flaws\" is likely meant to be a general option, but the question asks specifically about whines, not a more general complaint. So, although an option, we can eliminate this as well.\n4.) The options \"remind them of their responsibilites\" and \"remind them of what they ca accomplish\" make the question even more confusing, so again, these options are not the answers.\n5.) It turns out there is only one option left as the correct answer: E: remind them about of what they can accomplish.\nSo the answer turns out to be E: remind them what they can accomplish.", "answer": "C: chicken"}

Let's consider if any of these options is relevant to our requirements.\n5. Choices A, B, C, and D can be eliminated as they are out of context with the question based on the clues provided.\n6. We can eliminate E: Gross since we are looking for a term that does not sound offensive and is rather simple and straightforward.\n7. Option Foolish seems suitable as it refers to deceptive or misleading behavior, which is exactly what the speaker is saying.\n8. Option Sleight also seems relevant. This is a word that means trick or deception done on someone. So, these two options seem most likely to be the answer.\n9. Choice C: FOOLISH can also be considered an appropriate choice because it refers to foolish behavior, in addition to deceptive or false.\n10.

Suffix trees can find substrings in a text in the logarithmic time of the length of the substring. Suffix trees are usually much more compact than the equivalent dynamic programming. Suffix trees provide a search method of O(\\unicode{\"1f176\"}) for substrings in the set of input strings instead of O(n), in the worst case where n is the length of the set of strings. If the input strings are sorted, the best worst-case bound is O(log\\unicode{\"1f3b1}n), where log\\unicode{\"1b1} is the length of the input string with the fewest characters.\n\nAs a data structure, a suffix tree maintains a binary tree of nodes each labelled by an alphabet character which is being searched. A suffix tree for English text uses a letter with most alphabets to represent the most frequently occurring character at a leaf node. In this case, the suffix tree structure allows retrieval of common substrings. Thus, while an optimal solution is one that searches through all substrings, a suffix tree enables the searching of only those short substrings that are frequent as compared to their counterparts.\n\n## **Tree**\n\n### Question 1\n\nFind out the difference between a binary tree and a", "answer": "D: step forward"}

These options are not 'fun' in general and 'a knack for entertaining' are used with the same meaning.\n5 However, the options 'Talent', 'knowledge' & 'Recognize' cannot be used as substitutes as they cannot be used to describe 'Entirement'.\n6 Therefore, the options remaining are 'B' for 'Fun' & 'c' for talent.\n7 'Knack' refers to an aptitude for performing a task, for instance, 'an ability or a knack to find shortcuts', so the option 'a knack for performing a task' is also an apt substitute.\n8 However, all the options 'fun', 'learn', 'intelligence' &'recognise' cannot be used in this way as they do not involve performing a task and are not suitable as substitutes for 'Knack'\n9 Therefore the best option choice would be D: Intelligence\nSo the final answer would be : D: Intelligence\n\nInput: They should have known what to bring to the picnic.

{"idx": 796, "text": "1. The question asks about the outcome of eating breakfast with the family.\n2. The question implies that there is an undesired outcome which is what would lead to a pile of dirty dishes.\n3. We need to consider the choices in terms of their relevance to the given context.  There should be no restriction on the possibility of a dirty dish resulting from breakfast.  The choices provided are fullness, underwear, bad breath, and a better day.\n4. Based on our understanding, bad breath is something that could be an issue after eating breakfast with a big family, while a better day might be the result of a good morning with family, not a bad one.\n5. Therefore the best answer would be a choice that would fit into the question well.\n6. Based on our analysis, options C: bad breath and E: dirty dishes make the most sense in the context of the question.\n7. Option C and E have two key words, bad breath and dirty dishes that are specific and relevant to the given context.\n8. While option B has the word fullness, it doesn't relate to the cause of eating breakfast with a lot of people as it is merely related to what you can eat. Moreover, its meaning is too general and not specific enough to find a corresponding outcome with our given context.\n9. Option D has the word better day but also the word'might', suggesting a possibility of the outcome being anything. Moreover, its meaning stands to relate to an experience rather than a specific outcome which would fit the question well. Additionally, the word \"worse\" in the context implies the outcome of the question is negative.\n10. Thereby, option C or E would be the answer.\nSo the final answers are E: Dirty dishes, and C: Bad breath\n\nInput:Where should you put new furniture after putting it together?

{"idx": 908, "text": "1: The question asks about the opposite of foolish behavior. The word 'foolish' implies carelessness, making the 'opposite' a word referring to caution.\n2. Therefore, we want to find an option that is more likely to be used when describing caution instead of carelessness.\n3. Looking over the options, we have to consider that the context of the sentence is an office.\n4. In an office setting, words like 'careful' and 'cautious' may be more appropriate to describe an action that is more likely to ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n5. 'Thoughtful', meanwhile, suggests a person giving careful consideration to a specific issue or decision, while 'discreet', a word used to describe a person's behavior in a particular situation, can suggest that they are aware of the potential for gossip when talking about sensitive or embarrassing subjects.\n6. These words likely would not be appropriate to describe someone who is more likely to be cautious regarding their actions in a workplace.\n7. However, 'calm', while synonymous with 'careful,' can convey a feeling of stability and control that is more appropriate to describe a person who is more likely to exhibit caution in an office environment.\n8. We can eliminate other options like 'careful' because that is the opposite of 'foolish,' which is the opposite of 'careless.'\n9. Option A (thoughtful) can describe caution when considering another person's feelings or when taking into account their specific situation, while option E (careful) can refer to someone who tends to be more risk-averse when making decisions.\n10. Both 'discreet' and 'calculated', though not exactly similar in meaning, could relate to describing a 'careful' person.\n11. But Option D, 'cautious' most accurately describes someone who is more likely cautious in their actions than 'calm' while also describing the same type of characteristics as 'discreet.'\n12. Therefore, the answer to the question is D, 'cautiously.'\nSo the final answer to the question is: D: cautious\n\nInput: Which of the following is an instrument that could be heard playing when walking in a cemetery?

However, it's uncertain if this was done to hurt someone in the first place. We need to eliminate this answer.\n4. Similarly, option C: cross the street does not directly relate to hurting someone else. Crossing a street is mostly done for safety and not hurt someone intentionally.\n5. For the remaining choices, option D: ride the bike is an indirect reference to hurting someone. If you ride the bike and hit someone, it does hurt someone.

Next, let's look at the choices that do end in \"s\": \"old ladies\" doesn't seem likely since a person won't likely wish for their seniors to go away. It is more likely to wish for their annoying kids, younger siblings, etc. to go away.\n5.

The options provided for choices A, B, C, D, and E include emotions, beliefs, and motives that may be influencing a person to confess to murder.\n13. However, some options don't provide sufficient evidence to lead us to the answer. For instance, option E: \"find god\" isn't a valid motive since the question requires a specific reason for confessing.\n14. In addition, some options are not directly related to the question. For example, option B: \"fear\" and option D: \"problems\", are not related to committing murder nor reasons for confessing to it.\n15. We can cross off these and other irrelevant choices to find the answer.\n16. Now, let's move to the options that have some relevance. \n17. Choice B provides an emotional reason why someone might confess to murder: \"fear\", which is an emotion associated with punishment or fear of legal consequences.\n18. This reason indicates that fear of punishment or the legal consequences of committing murder could lead someone to confess. \n19. This suggests that the answer is B: fear, as it provides a reason that someone might confess to the crime of murder. \n20. However, it's critical to distinguish between a fear of punishment and the motivation to confess.\n21. It's also important to note that fear of punishment might play a role in a person's decision to admit to murder, but it\u2019s not the only reason or sufficient to cause someone to confess.\n\nSo the final answer would be B: fear.\n\nInput: How are a pear and strawberry similar?

Based on the context of the question, it's clear that the question intends to discuss a possible outcome or result regarding being unable to learn. There aren't any other options provided.\n3. Option A: an intelligence suggests we may not learn at the same level, but it doesn't directly mention an inability or ineffectiveness in learning.\n4. Option D: distress means \"feeling distress\"; someone not being able to learn something isn't necessarily distressing.\n5. Option B: education is about learning and educating; we can eliminate this choice based on the limited context of this question.\n6.

Choices:  heart pain A: heart attack B: heart failure C: heart burn D: heart beating E: heart thumping\nOutput: 1.) The question is asking about a person having a heart attack might experience:\n2.) Heart attack is an event where the blood supply to the heart is severely reduced. Heart pain is a symptom of cardiac issues and is also associated with the heart attack.\n3.) Heart failures, burns, beating and thumping occur in different organs, not necessarily the heart\n4.) The options are either symptoms associated with heart attack or organs where a similar problem might arise, but they don't directly relate to the attack or the event.\n5.) So, only heart pain appears to be an appropriate answer.\nSo the final correct answer is D: heart pain\n\nInput: Why was the clown on strike? Because his job was to make people happy? Choices:  C: clown's are not happy by definition A: the clown's job requires happiness B: the clown is not well D: job is to entertain the audience E: his job requires being sad\nOutput: 1) The question is asking about why the clown was on strike.\n2) The strike is usually caused by working conditions or pay discrepancies and not just happiness or mood.\n3) Clowns are not defined as moods or emotions, and even if clowns appear angry, they are likely meant to be comic, thus clowns are not sad by definition.\n4) The jobs of entertaining", "answer": "C: office"}

Choices: A: take off clothes B: throw punches C: hit back D: punch at E: kick\nOutput: 1). The question involves an individual's reaction following a physical altercation. \n2). The choice of action the person undertakes post-altercation is relevant to the question which includes, \"take off clothes,\" \"throw punches,\" \"hit back,\" \"kick,\" and \"punch at.\"  \n3). \"Throw punches\" and \"hit back\" are two of the options for acting post-altercation. \"Kick\" only applies when fighting back. Also, \"hit back\" makes more sense. \n4). This narrows our choices down to \"throws punches,\" \"hits back,\" and \"punches at.\"\n5). The options describing fighting back are more applicable to the question. 6). So, the answer is B: throws punches.\nThis answer is also correct because the question does not specify who causes the altercation", "answer": "C: jar"}
{"idx": 960, "text": "1.[1][1] The question is implying that James was experiencing stress due to the competition, and he wanted to stop competing until he felt better.\n2. There are different reasons for competing, but the question is narrowed down to only one perspective. James might be feeling competitive for something good or he might have been competing and was trying to stop it because he was not successful in something.\n3. The choices offered have a variety of perspectives and none of them directly align with the situation being asked in the question.\n4. This requires us to think outside of the box. \"Trying harder\" does not directly relate to wanting to stop competing, and neither does \"failure\" in \"trying harder\".\n5. The choice of \"death\" has nothing to do with a situation where someone needs to stop competing and instead represents the opposite of quitting.\n6. We will now consider \"Winner or Loser\", and it does seem to relate to the question when someone does not find satisfaction in their performances.\n7. However, this choice does not include \"feeling better\" as a motivation for stopping competing, making it irrelevant.\n8. At this point, we are left with the option of \"winning or losing\", which can indeed cause someone to want to stop competing until they feel better because a failure can make someone quit.\n9. Therefore the answer is E: winning or losing.\nSo the final explanation is E: winning or loosing\n\nInput: When someone is depressed, they feel ___: Choices:  A. good B. better C. badly D. wrong E. no emotions F. no pressure\nOutput: 1.__[1][1] The context of the question implies that someone is sad. The person does not feel depressed in this context to the first option in the blank, \"good\".\n2. People normally feel sad if they are sad, so \"better-\" in the second option does not fit.\n3. Likewise, the option \"badly\" is incompatible with the choice in the context of the question.\n4.\"Wrong\" does not seem to be a suitable choice either.\n5. The last three words \"no emotions/no pressure\" don\u2019t connect to the context or reason for the question. Moreover, feelings of sadness can be accompanied by emotions and press", "answer": "A: pressure"}
{"idx": 964, "text": "1. The question is asking about a man putting his luggage in his car while driving to the airport.\n2. Choice A: closet does not relate to driving, therefore it does not make sense as a valid place where the man will put his luggage.\n3. Choose B: at the hotel does not make sense as the man is not in the hotel, rather he is driving towards the airport.\n4. Choice D: bus stop does not relate to luggage rather it relates to the man's journey.\n5. Choices C and E: sidewalk and trunk do not make sense for the question as they are not direct places where one normally puts their luggage while driving.\n6. Thus the best choice is B: at hotel.\nSo the final choice is B: at the hotel\n\nInput: What happens after a ball hits a wall at full steam? Choices: \tA: bounces on the wall, traveling faster B: bounces on both the floor and wall, traveling backward C: breaks on the wall, travels up D: stays on the wall E: breaks on the floor, traveling forward\nOutput: 1 : The question focuses on the actions of a ball hitting the wall.\n2. The question asks about an action that takes place when a ball hits a wall.\n3. The options provided are what happens after the ball hits the wall.\n4. Based on the given question, we can eliminate all the options aside from A, for the ball hitting the wall and travelling faster, as they don't pertain to the actions of a ball, after hitting a wall.\n5. The other options do not make sense as the action will still take place only after the ball has completely hit the wall once.\n6.

{"idx": 968, "text": "1. The question is asking about a hidden force that comes into play when being forgiving.\n2. Given the choices, B and C apply only partially to forgiving. Forgiveness involves an act of overcoming a grudge, holding malice and moving past an offense.\n3. Considering this, Option A: good feeling is not specifically linked and may not accompany one's act of forgiveness.\n4. OptionC (good karma): is not an independent hidden force, but a consequence of forgiveness, hence is not a suitable answer choice.\n5. For Option B: goodwill implies and encourages being forgiving, so it could apply for the answer, but it should also be included as a choice.\n6. For Option D: new freedom is not implied in this question, so it doesn't apply.\n7. Considering the remaining options, all words in the list apply to forgiveness in some ways, but we need to consider specific word meanings and context, as \"freedom\" can refer to the freedom an offended person gains from forgiving or to the new freedom they gain after being forgiven.\n8. So, the answer cannot be found within the choice list.\n9. Therefore we must consider meanings outside the choice set to choose an answer.\n10. The word \"forgiveness\" shares the same origin in the English language with words like forsake and forbearance. \"Forsake\" means to leave something, as in abandon. So by being forgiving, one may be \"forced\" (as in in a similar way) to freeing up resources, time, energy, will, etc. that were held before when the offense occurred.\n11. Forgiveness is like a \"release\" or \"relief\" that the forgiver feels when they let go of their grudge and let go of the need for punishment or retribution. Thus, the word relieft may be the appropriate answer as it best describes that feeling of relief that the forgiver gains when overcoming their grudge.\nSo the final and only answer is B: goodwill\n\nInput: When did the Vikings become a European group?

However, the question asks about a \"cause\" rather than a \"result\", so we need to consider this factor.\n\n8) Considering all the options, only option B: 'Problems' and D: 'Intoxication' could be related to the goal of buying beer: either as a solution, or the intended outcome.

The options are: A: eat cake: this option is not relevant to an object when it is taken with an intention.\n4. B: buy: This option also doesn't suit the situation as buy is the action done for the object when it is purchased. Purchasing a cake doesn't necessarily reflect a specific intention or behavior. \n5. C: interests: This is an abstract concept and doesn\u2019t mean anything to the object being considered. So, it\u2019s an exclusion option.\n6. D: complex: This idea may apply to the object because an examined object may require analysis or analysis may be part of its intent. It's too broad and vague. It\u2019s an exclusion.\n7. E: learn about: This is an action for an object or something about the object rather than an action that is done to it.

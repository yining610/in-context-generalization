{"text": "1: The question asks us where to find a specific jewelry item which does not seem to be in a typical jewelry store or boutique.  It can be assumed that someone is trying to locate such an item and this question is meant to test one's knowledge of such a place.\n2. We can eliminate options A: jewel stores, B: jewel boxes, D: Jewelry box E: Boutiques since they do not match the required description of location.\n3. Option C: Neck is irrelevant to the intended question as necklaces are not the subject of the enquiry.\n4. Thus the options must be eliminated and one is left with option E: Boutique which matches the question.\nSo the final choice is A: Boutique\n\nInput: 1) What was the greatest disaster of the century? 2) What was worse: the BP oil well explosion in Deepwater Horizon or Hurricane Katrina? 3) 2. 2. What was worst: the BP oil spill or 3) the Titanic disaster? 4) 3. How many passengers died in the Titanic disastrer? 5)) 2. 2 6. Worst Hurricane 7) 3. Oil spill 8) 4. 1500 9) 4. 9 10) 3. New Orleans\nOutput:1.The question begins by asking us to identify which disaster in modern times was the worst (and not in general). \n\n2. Based on the answer to 1 above, we now have to compare and answer what disaster is worse?\n\n3. By looking at the choices, it can be observed that the first two are two separate disasters but the last three are similar as they all involve oil spills and the same number of victims, respectively.\n\n4. The Titanic sinking happened in 1912, while the rest happened within the last 10 years thus, if we exclude hurricanes which occur frequently, it can be inferred that the Titanic was the greatest disaster or the greatest human mishap of this century.\n\n5. The answer for 2 can then be:\n\n(A.BP Oil Well Bl", "answer": "A: jewelry store"}
{"text": "1) The question asks for the location where the woman placed her bag.\n2) The term \"baggage\" in the sentence refers to a person's belongings, so the question is asking specifically about baggage, and not other forms of luggage.\n3) The terms \"garbag\" and \"airport\" are irrelevant within the context of the question. The latter term could suggest that the woman was heading to the airport with her bag, but this is not the question that is asked.\n4) It is logical to exclude the term \"military\", as the context of the sentence does not suggest this is happening. It is also unnecessary to answer \"military\", since the question asks for the bag's location.\n5) According to the question, the only baggage the speaker checked was a drawstring (backpack type) bag.\n6) So, the bag would have been transported to a safe (bank vault style) where the speaker could put it. Therefore, the answer to the question would be \"D: Safe.\"\nSo the final answer if D: Safe", "answer": "E: airport"}
{"text": "1.) 'Grapes' refer to a specific kind of fruit.\n2.) The question asks, 'where do you put your gapes', so we need to identify which grapes it is- not apples, oranges, pears, plums. We can eliminate the choices that do not refer to grapes.\n3.) The question states, 'checking out' which can either be interpreted as checking out of a super market, or checking out of a shopper's purchases before paying. \n4.) Now, we examine the remaining choices, and'mouth' is highly unlikely as it is not where food goes prior to being paid for, so, option 'D' can be eliminated. Similarly for'super market', as the location of the grapes is not significant to the question.\n5.) 'Grocery cart' could be the item to put the grapes in prior to paying, but also is not significant to the check out.\n6.) 'Fruit basket' would only work if the question was actually asking where to put the grap e in a fruit basket, hence it cannot be used.\n7.) 'Fruit market' is the term closest to the question 'check out', and as there is a clear 'fruit' connection, the choice is most likely to be a fruit market.\nSo the correct answer is Fruit market\n\nInput: 27th of April 2021 is in which month? Choices:  All Months\nOutput: 1. Month is a time period, usually of 30 or 31 days.\n2. We can eliminate 'All Months' as it does not refer to any specific month, as opposed to the others, which do.\n3. April is the 4th month of the year.\n4. There are 12 months in a year: January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December\n5. Thus, 27th April 2020, is the 12th day of the month April.\n6. So 27th April (2021) falls in the month of April, which is the 4th (12/12) month of the year.  So the answer is A: April.\nSo the answer is A: month of", "answer": "B: grocery cart"}
{"text": "1) The question states that \"of all the rooms\", in reference to a house, we should specify further details about this person's favorite room.\n2) The options indicate that there are \"kitchen, basement, living room and garden\" choices.\n3) However, there is no indication for what is the main objective of each of these rooms, which is why we cannot identify their relative values.\n4) The yard seems to refer to the outdoors, whereas the living room and kitchen seem to deal with indoors activities.\n5) This person might have an interest in nature, but then the basement, as well as the garden would be his favorite.\n6) Finally, the living room seems to be the most common option, but the scenario states that it was \"his favorite\". This also tells us that it was not in the yard, basement, or garden.\n7) Hence, the best answer is \"D: Living room\", because this seems to be the room where the aromas drew him to.\nSo the final answeer is D: living room\n\nInput: In order to solve the case, you\u2019ll want as much information as possible, and you can find the answer to questions like what in a book entitled Elements of Reasoning?

All of the questions are asking \" what\".\n3-5. None of the options provide a correct answer for questions containing \"what\". \n6. This choice can be inferred from the phrase \"like\".\n7.  Hence the only correct answer is \"E: Questions\"", "answer": "C: kitchen"}
{"text": "1.\"Where would you expect to...\"? is a question that implies a particular scenario where the shoppers would be searching for pizzerias.\n2. One can interpret the question as either \"where would I find the best pizza place?\" or \"where would I find one easily?\"\n3. We can get rid of the options that do not answer the intentions of the question.\n4. A: a chicago is neither an expectation nor a location to find a pizera. \n5. B: street does not say anything about its availability either.\n6. C: little italy is also not expected or a location.\n7. D: food court could be an expectation if one would like to buy it in a shopping mall. But it only says the location which is not what is expected, the shoppers still haven't found one and hence still looking for it.\nSo the correct answer must be \"E\" because from the choices it is the last one. \nSo the final answer must be E: capital cities\n\n## Next Question", "answer": "D: food court"}
{"text": "1, the question is asking for a connection to a medium of transmission.2. From the choices given, it is obvious that only \"B: radio\" and \"C: computer wires\" can be used to transmit files.3.  The other choices are irrelevant to the question as, as it's describing a situation in a physical scenario and \"A: freeway\" and \"D: electrical circuit\" refer to physical mediums, and the question is asking for \"a connection to a physical medium of transmission\".\n4. Therefore, the answer is \"B: radio\"as it can be used for the transmission and reception of sounds and signals, unlike the other items.\nSo the final choice is 'B: radio'\n\nInput:The word \"challenge: is made up of what two words? Choices:  a. chal cen b. chal len g e. chal lench g f. chal l e n g g\nOutput: 1) the question's word form is \"Challenge\" which has two syllables, or more specifically, \"chal lench\"\n2) the choices given show every syllable, but to find a correct combination, each letter needs to fit in each syllable, so the most likely option being tried will be the only one with more possibilities.\n3) For a letter in the first syllable, 'c' is already correct, however, a letter in the second syllable would have two options, but it should be combined with at least one of the letters in the first syllabus.\n4) so, 'e' could be combined with 'c' to get 'ce' for the second syllabus, or 'l' could be combined with the previous combination, resulting in 'len', which is correct for the first syllabic combination of 'chal'.\n5) for the second syllable, 'eng' would not be a correct option, and 'cheng' and 'cheleng' would be the only choices.\n6)  hence, \"g is found in chal lench, but only as a combination of e,l,n,g, and chal len chg is the correct answer.\nSo the final conclusion is that the answer is 'chal len chg'\n\nInput: A person who can't eat is said to suffer from what", "answer": "D: computer network"}
{"text": "Question: Though he could've kept on keeping on, his body was pleased he finally stopped, it had been constantly doing what during the day?\n1. The question is quite informal, thus the correct answer should not require complex vocabulary.\n2. The sentence structure is indicative of a question.\n3. The question may be stated in a simpler manner.\n4. The sentence suggests that the man could carry on, he's not in pain, but he's choosing not to.\n5. At this point, the sentence refers to the mans body, not mind, and thus the answer must be in regards to the physical body.\n6. It could be the body was working, moving, or exercising, but the sentence concludes with the body appreciates him finally stopping.\n7. He didn't take much rest, but this doesn't correlate with the statement that he stopped; the body appreciates him stopping.\n8. The word appreciates, in the same sentence, is the indication of the rest, the body appreciated him stopping.\n9. So, the word appreciates means the answer is 'happy'. \n10. 'Resting' by definition means 'to sit or lie in a place with no work and relax'. \n11. Therefore, the answer is 'H', happy.\nSo the final the answer is H: happy\n\nInput: \"The man who wrote 'War and Peace' never won a Nobel Prize\".

The sentence is giving information about an author, his work, and why he did not win a Nobel prize, though he achieved great success with his book 'War and Peace'.\n3. The question is asking what the Nobel prize represents in that situation.\n4. The author, Leo Tolstoy died about 50 years before the awards began, so winning in 2019 would be unlikely.\n5. This may be the reason the author didn't get one, he died many years ago and would not be able to receive the prize.", "answer": "D: moving"}
{"text": "1.(Based on previous answer we can assume that this is a different sentence) \n2. Again we have the question, \"what ways can I do that?\" \n3. We can start the process of eliminating options in the same manner as before:\n4. If our end goal is to organize thoughts or summarize main points, neither option A: Write an essay nor option C: speak information is relevant in this respect.\n5. As for option D: have information, it could potentially be a requirement, such as in passing a test, but this isn't the meaning of the original sentence or subsequent question.\n6. Option E: speak information, although perhaps the least-preferred choice if we're seeking to express our thoughts, it is potentially the closest to our goal of how we could share our thoughts.\n7. Thus, option E: speak information is the best answer to this question.\nSo the final answers is E: speak information\n\nInput:You had to get an A on your report to get in the course. Did you get it?

Option B: 'ripped': This could be correct, but not very specific to the question, so we can rule this out.\n7. Similar to option B, this answer might not be relevant to our question.\n8. Option C is similar to Option B, but states that 'it saturates with water.' While this could be technically correct, it does not imply that the paper would become crumpled, which is what the question asks about.\n9. Option D is similar to Option B and C, but implies that 'One dimensional' meaning it could only move in one dimension.\n10.Option E states that the paper will 'crumple up.'

{"text": "1.\"The president is the leader\" refers to this being a person's role, so it must be either \"the white house\" or \"the government\".\n2. The second two options are the names of an actual building and nation, so \"B & C\" are no good.\n3. \"The president is the leader in my opinion\", is irrelevant, so we can drop \"D: corporation\".\n4. If the government comprises a single person, it must be called the president, so it is \"E: government\".\nSo the final answer we get is E: the government\n\nInput: The president is the leader of the government.

We can thus eliminate the last five options.\n2. We can also rule out the option \"B: $40\", as we are unable to interpret a situation in which a president is paid a salary that is half of their age.\n3. $250 could refer to something with two digits, which is what we require for our number. The same reasoning applies for $900, $2500, and $4000.\n4. We can eliminate the options $20, $400, and $202, because we are not given a specific value in US Dollars.\n5. $200 is not close enough to our number and also the last two digits do not match ours.\n6. Of the remaining three options, $25 is only one digit higher and lower than our number, so it will not be our final answer.\n7. $1,0000 is clearly the only number with two digits that is equal to our number, so this is our final answer.\nSo the final chosen number after answering all the questions is 25\n\nInput: The President is the leader of", "answer": "E: government"}

This implies it is a commuter train and that the options refer to specific types of transportation, not a particular speed or number of passengers.\n2. B and C do not make sense as a response since commuter trains normally are either light trains or buses. It makes no sense to suggest the train is a commuter light or commuter bus\n3.

{"text": "1) As per the questions \"what/want\" the answer should focus on actions not words. The question is asking on what action steps you can take to accomplish your wish.\n2) We can eliminate \"pass course\", this indicates an individual is at a level where they are able to play with a concept and are not really focused on making money or earning it. A course is for the development of the individual not for earning. Hence, this should be excluded.\n3) Now the question asked what individual can do and earn money. Here the main action to earn is either \"apply for job\" or \"take care of proposals\". \"take care of proposerals\" is an activity under the umbrella of \"apply for job\".

What do the metaphorical scars mean? The figurative scars are referring to being cut as a school student and being rejected in this case. We want to know what is going to happen to these scars. \n2.We can eliminate all options excluding \"C:Heal\" because literal scars can never heal. We can also eliminate D:Paste as this is irrelevant. \n3.B:join is used to refer to two things coming together as one, it therefore cannot be used as a reference to a scar coming together. C:put together means to gather items into one whole.

Choices: A: the washing B: the dishes C: the lunch D: the wiping E: the cleaning\nOutput: 1 The question is asking us to identify what he asked her to help him do. 2 \"Washing\" is irrelevant here because that term can refer to anything from the washing of clothes to kitchen cleaning. 3 \"Dishes\" is the wrong answer because it refers to the act of washing the dishes and not cleaning the kitchen along with the dishes. 4 \"Lunch\" refers to the preparation of food, but that is not what he asked her to do. 5 \"Cleaning\" seems like the obvious answer because it refers to cleaning the entire house. 6 However, the sentence states specifically which part of the kitchen that she should clean: the wiping.  It is not asking her to clean the whole kitchen. This option is the best choice because it fits the description and suits the context of the sentence.\nSo the final anser is E:the wiping\n\nInput: How did he decide it was wrong?  Choices:  A B C D E\nOutput: 1 \"He decided it was wrong\" is too unclear. 2. \"He noticed it\" could be referring to the fact that he \"noticed\" it was wrong when the teacher made everyone clean up, or he \"noticed\" that it was wrong to make his friends clean up from his mistake. 3", "answer": "C: subordinate"}
{"text": "1: Although \"tennis racket\" in this context would suggest an instrument which is used in playing tennis, the question actually asks about the requirements to play the game successfully; therefore, this option has no bearing.\n2. \"Little skill\" is also not a requirement, as even a beginner can play the game if they have the correct equipment.\n3. \"Competition\" is not necessarily a requirement either, as it is only necessary for those who aim to succeed within the sport.\n4. \"Tennis court\" is also irrelevant to the question as the only requirement is that of skill, which does not require a tennis court to practice on.\n5. The final option left is \"Legs.\" The question states that people must be \"good at playing tennis,\" which suggests that being skilled and athletic is a requirement. These requirements necessitate the use of physical skill and ability, which is best demonstrated through the use of legs.\nSo the final choice is B. The correct answer is Choice: skill.", "answer": "B: skill"}
{"text": "1\" James knew that his life was at the brink of an unexpected ending, it seems like there's no escape.\n2. His life at the edge made him nervous enough to think that it's going to be taken away from him.\n3. So, for the last option, we need to choose from the three available options.\n4. Among these options, one option is mentioned as an outcome of someone losing consciousness. \n5. That option is: \"scare of coma\"...\n6. While the remaining three options might be in conflict with his situation.\n7. In the sentence \"He was scared of what?\"  James wants to know what will happen to him when he loses consciousness, he could only speculate this when he's conscious. \n8. Also consider that dying is not the only outcome of losing consciousness.\n9. As a result, we eliminate the three options that are related to losing consciousness: death, coma, and forgetfulness.\n10. We are left with only two options: Life and peace.\n11. Therefore, \" James was really scared that death will come for him\" and therefore the answer is A: death.\nSo the final answers is option A: death", "answer": "A: death"}
{"text": "1.The question asks what happens when you play around with your pet dog. Option a, \"Alive\", the dog will always be alive, no matter what you do to them.\n2. Option b,\"Health\", the health of the dog depends on the way you treat them, it doesn't have to do with \"playing around\", the way you play around with the dog.\n3. Option c states that when you play around with the pet \" they will have fun\", but that would be the same even if you don't play around with them.\n4. Option d state that playing around with the dog would \"cause them to play dead\". This might seem like an option, but the phrase \"will have\" states that the dog will be doing that even if you don' t play around with them. The answer cannot just be a passive verb.\n5. Finally, option \"e\", \"black\" is also disqualified as it cannot be a noun describing the result of playing with your dog.\n6. The answer is therefore \"D: playing dead\" as when you play around with a dog, they would have the tendency to play dead just because they would want to get more fun and play from you.\nSo the final answers is D: playing dead\n\nInput: What's the first step that you would take to build more confidence in someone who isn't really very good at his or her job?

{"text": "1.\"The question\" does not clarify what \"getting paid\" refers to, i.e. what it means to get paid, so we cannot be certain that any particular \"feeling\" is required or expected.\n2. Eliminating the obvious non-answer choices, we are left only with A, C, and E.\n3. These choices cannot all be \"answered\" for us because \"paid\" is a general term which could refer to many monetary transactions. However, to find the correct choice, we must apply logic and use the given information to narrow this generality down.\n4. By elimination, we have identified that \"different types of payments tend to cause different feelings\". This suggests that the type of \"getting paid\" that gets the intended result must be of a particular type.\n5. \"Income tax\" is a payment. \"Ocean\" is neither paid nor unpaid. \"Happy\" is not an appropriate reaction to getting paid because we know from later in the dialogue, that it is not happiness that our professor desires.\n6. So \"Sorrow\" would not make sense. \"Bill collectors to happy\" would also not be a good response. So \"Satisfaction\" must be the correct answer.\nSo the final choice is 2. Answer A) income tax \n\nInput: I've learned that when you don't know what direction to go, Choices:  A) a plan will always give you some direction B) you can simply think it over in silence C) take some time and make some progress D) take a lot of time because it would give you direction E) I don't like any of those\nOutput: 1: \"I've learned that when...\", suggests that there is something learned that can be applied in the situation. This eliminates options C and D which appear to be based on opinion alone, as well as option E, which seems to be merely a declaration of distaste.\n2. It also must logically exclude option A - plans will not always give the desired direction, if at all. Not only is it very likely that any specific direction will not be given, but \"I've learned\" suggests that a lesson has been learned that was used directly in some other context.\n3. The final two options then make sense, where B would be most appropriate here because \"Silence\" does", "answer": "B: satisfaction"}

Choices:  C: In the ads D: In the clearance bins F: at the checkout line G: In the back room H: On a sale\nOutput: 1.'Where do you look for a\" indicates some place to search. 2. \"good deal\" as opposed to any deals indicates there is a particular good deal to look out for. \n3. Option C should be eliminated because although it indicates a place to search, it is not a 'good deal'.\n4. Option D is also an unlikely choice as \"clearance bins\" are not necessarily places with a good deal.\n5. In the sentence \"at the checkout line\" there is no specific offer that is being referred to as just 'a deal' so E should be eliminated.\n6. Option G should also be eliminated because on 'a sale' is not necessarily 'a good deal'. \n7. Option F should be eliminated as 'a sale' may be in any place, however it is not necessarily 'a deal' that is a 'good deal'. 8. Option H should also be eliminated as it is also simply 'a sale' and may not offer 'a good deal'.\nThus we are left with two choices, A, B or D, however, as both A and B also indicate a place to search, and none of them are a good deal, option D, indicating the back room should be chosen as the answer because this implies a place to search, for a good deal. \nSo, the final Answer is D : In the back room\n\nInput: Which of these statements most clearly shows how much of a difference in size there was among the babies who took part in the experiment?

{"text": "1.\"What did they demolish the city's community garden for?\" This is asked by the question. \n2. \"Yet another\u2026\" is redundant as this already suggests they had demolished it before.\n3. \"D: parking lot\" was the last place this sort of land was developed before, meaning that they are incapable of developing it further as it is already used for other purposes. Hence, the answer cannot be D: parking lot.\n4. \"B: ocean\" is the answer, given by most dictionaries, as it is the largest body of undeveloped land on Earth.\n5. However, the question is asking \"\u2026yet another\u2026.\" implying this wasn't the first time, so the only answer that could be selected as the answer is \"B: ocean\".\n6. \"A: wasteland \" is also impossible as \"\u2026community garden\u2026 was torn down yet again\u2026\" clearly indicated it was being developed before.\n7. \"C: desert\" is also not right because even in deserts vegetation exists; an ocean's area is about 362 million sq km which is larger than a desert's size. Moreover, most of these deserts (like the Sahara) have lots of vegetation.\n8. Hence, the correct answer is B: ocean.\nSo the final answers is B: ocean\n\nInput:The people of New York have always prided themselves on their style, it\u2019s the reason why we have such a what?

This suggests that the people of New York are proud of the way the city has progressed, despite the setbacks and obstacles.\n3. \"Wide variety\" and \"large artistic talent\" are irrelevant terms, in this context.\n4. Further, \"Dense population\" doesn't necessarily mean being proud. Moreover, \"Dense population implies a crowded area.\n5. Thus, we are left with \"A. Wide variety\" and \"C. Large artistic [etc]\" which can describe a", "answer": "D: parking lot"}
{"text": "1) The scenario provides context for the question. \"The skin was cut while cutting onions.\" \n2) The skin was cut in a 'chopping' motion, so it must be cut on the onion, itself.\n3) This conclusion is made clearer by the use of pronouns in the sentence. \"The skin was CUT while chopping onions.\" \n4) Therefore, the answer is \"B: fingertip\". As the skin was severed, it must be in a finger-tipped location due to the chopping nature of the action.\nSo the final sentence is B: fingertip\n\nInput: The first time I saw the movie _Hard Days Night_, I was what? Choices: A: entranced B: shocked C: horrified D: perplexed E: terrified \nOutput: 1.) The question is essentially asking which word best describes my emotional reaction in such a context.\n(2.) \"The first time I saw...\" implies that the reaction occurred the first time of seeing the movie.\n(3.) \"I was\" implies it was a reaction made directly after viewing it.\n(4.) The word \"seen\" implies the reaction occurred as a result of seeing.\n(5.) \"I was what?\" implies it was a reaction, as opposed to an action.\n(6.) \"I was...\" is asking us to describe our reaction.\n(7.) \"Horrified\" is an adjective, so the question is: \"Horrified\" or \"What?\"\n(8.) \"What?\" Is the opposite of the question asked, so the answer is \"What?\"\nSo the final sentence or answer is E: What?\n\nInput: You should read the directions carefully before assembling the bicycle as they explain what?

{"text": "1-The question asks \"What illness may you have\" and not what illness may you be having, as indicated by the present tense of the words \"you are\". \n2- We can disregard options A and C, as it is clear these terms are not illnesses that we can fall into. \n3- Option B: \"downcast\" refers to a person who looks or moves in a dejected manner.  It's a more extreme manner in which an individual can be described as depressed.\n4 - Hence, this is the better fit and is the only true illness in the group that can be considered.\n5 - \"downcast\" may be associated with depression and it often follows that people who become depressed are downcast, but these terms are not synonymous. \n6- \"downcast\" is a state of being that we can enter into, while depression is an illness that can afflict a person and is not necessarily caused by other people acting in such a way.\n7 - Therefore, to be depressed is to be in a state of dejection, and it can be caused by external means, but can also occur through a genetic predisposition.\n8 - So, the answer must be D:  unhappy as this is a far more accurate way of referring to being \"downcast\" than \"depressed\" and is the only option that may be caused by other means.\nSo the finalanswer is D: Unhappy \n\nInput:Their dog, Shadow, lived a quiet life as a farm animal until what?

Even though the tool is described with \"hands,\" they could be simply an extension of a head, and used instead of a nose and to be held by fingers.  This would defeat the purpose of being unable to hold a tool to make the hole in the wall \n7. So as the other options do not capture the essence, the Answer must be D: hands because he was not able to make a punch in the wall\nSo the final answeris D: hands\n\nInput: The student is always in the library when it what?

Of the two remaining options, 'kitchen cupboard', or'refrigerator', a'refrigerater' is more likely to preserve food than a 'kitchen chupboard'. One can reasonably leave food in a fridge for longer before it spoils as it's a cold, airtight environment. \n4. Similarly, if one isn't going to be using the food for a while, it can be stored away to avoid it spoiling, and the refrigerator is the choice here.\n5. The fridge is preferable when left for an extended period of time as it will not spoil as quickly as food left out in the open air.\n6. Based on that, \"D:pantry\" would be the main answer.\n7.  But also consider that the jar may contain something perishable, so the answer is D.

To improve yourself requires an understanding of what will work, so to have tools is right.\n5. To persist requires a level of knowledge, and persistence is a skill, so to learn must be wrong.\n6. The last statement is that one must have the right book. We already know from the other answers that to have more knowledge can\u2019t be wrong and to have tools can\u2019t be wrong, so we can\u2019t select A or B as right answer.\n7. When we know this, then it\u2019s easy to see why to be knowledgeable cannot be right. We know knowledge and tools are correct.\n8. Why can\u2019t it be right? Because to be knowledgeable is not about using knowledge, it\u2019s a way of being oneself, so to improve yourself cannot be right.

Thus, the correct answer is C: bridge, but don't get too excited, there's another answer: D: mountain range.\n3. Mountains of various sizes exist all over the world, with some of them in conjunction, known as mountain ranges. In case of a mountainous range, if you threw the rock from any of the mountain peaks or summits, it will create a big splash.\n4. However, D is incorrect when compared to C,as throwing a rock from a mountain range cannot produce a greater splash as compared to that produced by throwing a rock with the same potential force in the same river, for instance in the ground, or with the addition of other factors such as the current speed.\n5. Therefore, C is the correct answer, as throwing the rock from a bridge will produce a bigger splash than throwing it from the ground.\nSo the final answers is C: bridge and D: mountain range\n\nInput:If two lines on a graph are perpendicular, how many degrees are between them? Choices: 1. A: 30 degrees B: any amount greater than 30 degrees C: 0 degrees D: 60 degrees E: some unknown amount\nOutput: 1This question uses the word \"Perpendicular\" and \"between them,\" indicating that the two lines we are considering are parallel and have the same length, however, they are perpendicular to each other.\n2. A perpendicular line extends up or down from a given point at a 90-degree angle, creating a right angle or a four-sided figure.\n3. So, in this case, we are comparing two parallel lines, which have the same length and direction, but form a 90-grade angle with each other.\n4. Therefore, option D must be true as it contains the most information, as there is no reason to provide a lower value for 60 degrees.\n5. It is also more likely to be true if the lines are parallel, as the angle between any two perpendicular lines is always 90 degrees.\n6. Therefore option D should be selected as the answer.\nSo the final outcome is D: 6", "answer": "C: bridge"}

It might be in some other places that are outside the home, but we know that it is outside the home.\n3. We know that the fan(s) would not be hot because the cool person would not want to sit in a hot place, and the question states that the cool person would prefer more than one electric fan because they like to cool off more than one area at a time.\n4. This leaves us with \"home, hardware store, and office\". Of all these options, \"home\" is obvious that it is not where the person is cool, because \"home\" refers to the person who is cool.\n5. From this, the answer is \"B. Hardware store\" because the question states that there are more than one electric fan, and the electric fan might be in the home hardware store.\n6. Hence, the answer is \"Home\" for the cool person, \"Hardware store\" for more than one electric fan.\nSo the final solution is : Home for the cool person, and Hardware store for more than one electric  fan.\n\nInput:It was too much for them.

If Bob tried to hide his anger, you wouldn't say that you tried to hide your frustration about it.\n2. It is best answered with this option as the other choices cannot. For eg: \"Anger\" does not fit the best as the question asks whether he could contain his \"Joy\".\n3. The rest of the options don't fit with the scenario described.\n4.

{"text": "1.) In the example that the question is asking about at an intersection, cars would be the likely place that people would stand.\n2. Other examples can be thought of to further rule out other choices.\n3. One example could be a fork in the road. Some people may stand at the fork itself, although cars would predominantly stand there.\n4. Also, people will not stand at the green light intersection as at that intersection, cars would likely be going.\n5. At a red light intersection, people are quite likely to walk at the traffic lights, to wait with the car.\n6. When crossing a street corner, it is rare for cars to park and make traffic difficult, so people are free to stand or cross.\n7. So, the choices that are not appropriate are \"A: cars, E: at a red lights intersection and D: fork in road,\" leaving A, C and B. \n8. \"B: city street\" may be true in some cases, but is ambiguous enough to be excluded.\n9. It is not clear in the example provided, if people would choose to stand at a city street, rather than the street corner or cars, so we remove this from consideration in our selection of possibilities\n10. So, the answer must be \"C: street corner\", as this fits the intersection scenario perfectly; people are likely to stay at a street corner rather than waiting at a car.\nSo the final result is C: street intersection\n\nInput: Many factors, including geography and politics, have caused why?

Choices:(A): the docks (B): a fishing boat (C): a farm and (D): a warehouse\nOutput: 1) The question is asking when fish are at their freshest, not just fresh. The \"best time of day\" would refer to a different day and not time of day.\n2) 'These have been shipped from the docks' is an incorrect usage of the past tense as fish are still being shipped from the dockets, and continue to arrive daily.\n3) 'Fishing boat' would likely refer to a fishing vessel, not a fish farm or where the fish are being shipped to.\n4) So 'Farm' and 'Warehouse' are the best choices for the two remaining options.\n5) Warehouse implies that the fish arriving on the boat are then transferred to where?'A warehouse'\n6) So, by process of exclusion, the answer has to be 'D: warehouse'.\nSo the final answer should remain as 'D: wareouse'.\n\nInput: The caravan turned to the right and entered the town square, which was bordered by a cathedral, a town hall, and a large clock tower.

This sounds like a comparative term, but is actually a general adjective. So the waitress is being specifically described as a 'good waitress'.\n4.\"The question refers to a comparison...who made the best **bread**?\" This suggests that we are going to be comparing the baker to the other two, who made the bread.\n5. Finally, there are other words that indicate a comparison may need to be made, such as \"the best you ever ate\"; but this phrase here is used to compliment the baker, and is not the wording that directly leads to the answer.\n6.Therefore, this answer will probably be 'B: Best' as the best job in the list was the bakery, followed by 'Very good' cooking then the 'tremendous job'.\nSo the final answer answe is B: Best", "answer": "B: names"}

We know this from the context as the sentence says \"the field is located in Norman, Oklahoma, United States\" and \"the field is the actual stadium, which is located on campus at the University of Oklahoma.\".\n6. The answer is only slightly incorrect, but would be understood. In real life, most people would not be able to differentiate between an actual field and the land around it.\n7. The next incorrect answer, \"B: university campus\" is slightly incorrect, because an university campus is a place, not a specific thing.\n8.

No, that's the answer.\n3. \"James bought a car.\" The question, \"James needed a garage...\" makes no mention of him needing a place to garage his car... If you read it like that, you'd get the answer incorrect.\n4. \"He spent a huge amount of money.\" This sentence referred to his purchase of a garage to store all the bikes he has now.\n5. The only logical answers are A, C, D, or E.  It could have been used to refer to any one of the three things, but since all three of the other answers are wrong, it can safely be assumed that the one they choose will be the correct answer.\n6. If it wasn't for this question, we'd be stuck with A, C, D as possible answers. We can now exclude D from the options. There is only one logical answer to this test - 'bike', as it is the only one that is used for any reason other than the correct. \n7. James is not going to store his downtown shoes or his tool storage in his bike.

They aren't the worst outcome - a worse outcome would be Death or Bleeding.\n3. If the patient falls down, they might injure themselves worse and bleed. As per the question, what is the worst outcome?\n4. If the injury is severe enough to require claiming insurance, death is definitely the worst outcome.\n5. It is not possible for bleeding to cause death - so if the injury didn't cause bleeding, it would fall under Death as the worst outcome.\n6. Now all that's left are \"A\", \"B\", and \"E\". \"A\" claims that the worst outcome is death - we already knew that.\n7. \"B\" is related to death, since it causes bleeding - bleeding can be deadly - but it is not \"the worst outcome\", since it can be stopped or remedied- if you didn't receive medical attention, bleeding can definitely cause death, but if you do, you can have a full recovery.\n8. So \"E\" is the only answer left- \"Claiming Insurance\". This is the worst outcome since it can be avoided - if the injury can be dealt with at home, it can prevent medical attention and claiming insurance.\nSo the final Answer is E: Claiming insurance.\n\nInput: This is not just another romantic comedy starring Adam Sandler (Actor, comedian) what?

{"text": "1 The question is asking what the husband will feel when the wife asks him to stop being married to him, suggesting that this is the main emotional experience, as opposed to other more subtle emotional experiences.\n2. The first thing we can eliminate is pleasure, as that is an emotional experience, but it is not as intense as the emotions specified in the question.\n3. The next option we can eliminate is happiness, which can be used in the same context as pleasure, so it is a more subtle version of pleasure. \n4. We then have four options which can be seen to be interchangeable: happy, grief, isolation, and pain.\n5. As 'pleasure' and 'pain' are quite broad categories, the answers would seem to be 'happy' and 'grief', which are strong and emotional adjectives.\n6. However, this analysis suggests a slightly different order, as grief and isolation are equally strong emotions and pain is often caused by grief, so it makes sense to include 'grief' as a substitute word for 'happiness' and 'pain'. \n7. We also have the adjective 'isolation' which is an emotional experience that is not covered by the choices given by the question.\n8. Therefore, we would conclude that the answer must be 'isolation'\nSo the final answer if isolation", "answer": "D: grief"}

The terms \"interesting\" or \"joyful\" are unlikely to satisfy a person who disliked learning, as they both suggest an exhilarating experience.\n5. Consequently, there appears to be no option, apart from option D: \"very important\" which implies that the learning process is significant, but is itself unlikely to be something that would satisfy someone who dislikes learning, as it is a \"process\" that must be engaged with.\n6.

And the question says \"the daughter of the minister\", which suggests that the father is Amy's father. So the answer must be \"C: in the eyes of his father\".\n2 : So according to Amy, she was (in the eyes of her father) both a 'great comfort' and a 'great sorrow'. As a child, being loved by your parents is usually a source of 'comfort' - but being the child of a clergyman means that you may bring 'great sorrow' to an unsuspecting parent.\n3 : So that should give you enough to narrow options A and B to 'great sorrow'.\n4 : But it's still not clear what Amy thought of herself.\n5 : So in the end we'd have to say that \"Amy, the daughter in the eyes of her own mother, was both a great sorrow and a great comfort\".\nSo the final output of the question is \"C: in the mother of herself\"\n\n### Instruction: Answer the following multiple choice question from the word", "answer": "B: woods"}

{"text": "1.\"Where is a good place...?\", the question is directed to me to indicate where a good place is for me to find a ball.\n2. This question asks about a ball and a location, so a person would most likely look for a ball in a toy store. Children's hands are places where they would play with their ball, thus it cannot be the best location for a ball.\n3. Similarly, the soccer field or game is unlikely to be the best place to find a ball, as it would be unlikely to find a ball there.\n4. The kitchen may hold some balls and in theory \"good cooking\" could involve the preparation of a dish that contains a ball, but a ball is unlikely to be found in the kitchen simply because the ball is not the food being cooked in the kitchen.\n5. It is likely that these reasons for being a bad place have already been discussed in the classroom, so the question can only ask where is a good place to find a ball.

No one will stole it in such a place\nOutput: 1: The phrase 'don't leave your car' indicates that the action is in the future, and is a negative command, so it is best to analyze each option by understanding what would happen if they were to park the car.\n2: \"You won't break down\" does not describe the consequence of parking a car, and \"You can't leave it\" implies that there is a choice between parking and otherwise- this is not the case.\n3: \"You'll burn a hole through the tires if you did this\" would be incorrect as burning through the tires would require excessive friction, and the options \"You'd break down\" or \"there is no possibility to leave the car where it is\" still apply.\n4: \"You may roll down the hill\" is unrelated to parking a car, the car that parks in the \"hill", "answer": "D: toy store"}

Given that, one cannot consider an \"approximate\" upper limit as a possible outcome. \n\n3. This leaves us with \"classroom\", which is inevitably more precise than the rest since \"classroom\" is a room for learning and it is highly improbable that 100 school children would overfill the room and exceed the upper limit of its capacity.\n\n4.

{"text": "1.The question gives us a context of a king meeting an ambassador, and the options tell us about possible locations for this meeting.\n2. \"The king was to meet...\" suggests that the king was already aware that he would be meeting the ambassador, and thus, the location for the meeting is important.\n3. By comparing the options to the question, we can eliminate some. \"The throne room\" and \"The monarchy\", although possible locations, are not relevant to the king meeting \"an ambassador\", instead they are relevant to the king meeting other royals, like the entire royal family for instance. \n4. \"Court\" is the location of many meetings, but the king doesn't have to be there, he just has to meet.\n5. \"The castle\" is the king's dwelling, where some important meetings like royal engagements take place. It's not necessary to meet an ambassador in his castle.\n6. The only remaining one to be eliminated is \"dining room\". This one is unlikely, as the main reason would be to show off the king's lavish dining room, but it's unlikely that an ambassador who has \"important\" concerns, would be asked to dine with the king.\n7. Therefore the answer is \"C: Throne room\", as the location of many important royal meetings.\nSo the final\nInput: John is learning Korean and Chinese, he is currently learning both languages but, he decided to stop learning Korean recently, is he doing the right thing?

{"text": "1 This question asks us about the possibility of finding yourself hurting while riding a bike through rough terrain.\n2 We can identify three possible answers that are relevant to this question: accident, hurt and falling down.\n3 These answers suggest that riders who get caught in tough terrain could potentially hurt/bruise themselves or sustain a fall from the bike. \n4 So, we can eliminate: A: pleasure and D: hurt.\n5 Pleasure wouldn't come from a hazardous situation, which we don't see here. Furthermore, hurt implies a state of unpleasantness, which we don'y see here. These answers don't fully fit the meaning of \"could find themselves hurting\" as in \"hurt in ways not deemed pleasing\".\n6 Similarly, option D is a vague answer that doesn't capture the essence of finding yourself hurt specifically while riding through rough terrain.\n7 So, by process of eliminations, option: C: get somewhere becomes the correct answer as it best describes the scenario.\n\nInput: You can find many types of tonic water at the local supermarket.

The only other person that can be Queen is a King and the Queen is the woman that holds her husband's title. Therefore, she is not the only person who can be Queen.\n3. 'English Castle' can have a Queen, but this is not as direct as in a 'Chess Game' where the Queen is the most valuable piece on the board (so more of a Queen than a King).\n4. As such, options 'A' and 'C' cannot be the correct answer as they already have a place that might not have a Queen. Thus, it has only been narrowed down to 'castle' and 'Chess Game'.\n5. The fact that the only other person that can hold the Queen slot in a Chess Game is a King, this can be a very important reason as to why the Queen spot might not always have a Queen, whereas this does not hold true for the 'Castle'. Therefore, the answer must be 'D: Chess Game'.\n\nSo the final answer must be D: Chess Game\n\nInput: Which of these are not real foods?

{"text": "1:The question suggests that 'place' is the one constant factor between all the choices. \n2. 'Classroom' is not mentioned again later in the options, showing that it does not belong. \n3. Similarly, 'toy store' is excluded as a possible candidate for 'place' as the context of the question makes it clear that 'dinner' and'school' will be more likely places visited by children.\n4. This leaves the options- 'dinner','school' and'soccer game' as possible responses, but none of their meanings seem to match with the context of the questions.\n5. From the options, the common factor between them is their suitability for children - 'dinner' being'something a restaurant provides to children', 'toy store' being an area where children can purchase toys as a commodity to play with, and'soccer game', an event which children attend and spectate at a pitch.\n6. However, the correct answer must not have to do with children being spectators. It must be relevant to their nature, their environment. \n7.

The options provide a range of possible motives, such as deception, altruism, stupidity, or aggression.\n3. However, none of these options describe a crime. For example, an aggressive person may attack but may not necessarily be engaged in criminal activity.\n4. A person may engage in deceptiveness in order not to commit a crime, which also does not fulfill the question's requirement of \"harming others\"\n5. Therefore, based on the specific description of the act, we can eliminate the options other than \"C: cruelty\", which refers explicitly to harming others maliciously.\n6.

{"text": "1.) The question seems to suggest that a man is laying on a beach, so therefore we can assume that he's not walking or doing any physical activity.\n2.) The sentence is ambiguous and can mean two things- That he's doing something which may include lying on a beach/ laying on the beach/ relaxing on the beach. The man may just be lying down for rest or comfort, it may be that he's just lying down to take a break. Hence, it depends on when he was doing the sun himself action.\n3.) It is unlikely that the person is laying in a sunny location, this is not the purpose of the sentence.\n4.) The context seems to hint at the question being a 'why' question or rather asking the intention behind doing something which suggests doing the sun himself is the doing of an action, and not a physical activity.\n5.) Thus the options which suggest physical activities or states (such as lying) are ruled out.\n6.) Therefore what does the sentence hint at? He's doing his sunning activity, which is done to do something in the end? He's laying, and then something happens after it. Hence \"A: sun himself is the answer\"", "answer": "A: sun himself"}

When hanging out with friends, being understood is not what one wants to do, they want to do what makes them feel happy and fulfilled. \n4. You would have to be pretty bored with people in general to say \"A: Being understood\", so it is easy for the student to select this option at the beginning of the problem.\n5. There are several ways that the word \"beer\" relates to a party situation, but the author is trying to get you to use some word play with \"beer\" and \"trying to fit in.\" \n6. The same question would also be true if you replace the word \"beer...\" with something more generic, such as \"a burger.\" \n7. To eliminate further options, consider the last sentence - \"trying to fit it.\" One does not \"fit in\" with a visit like they do with a party.\n8. The last clue is to try eliminating the options that fit with the question. \"Playing around\" and \"Hug\" are two ways to \"fit into\" a group of friends.\n9. Finally, \"A: Being understood\" is the only option left.\nSo the final answered is A: Being understood", "answer": "A: being understood"}

It might not look like it from the outside, but people are always in motion, and they move through the world in what manner? Choices:  a) fast c) quick b) slow d) steady e) careful\nOutput: 1 The question is asking for a manner in which movement through the world takes place. \n2. \"Everybody is busy in their own ways\" suggests that each person moves through the world in their own way.\n3. The question makes reference to \"the outside\". This is referring to the rest of the world that is watching others move through it. \n4. \"What manner\" is further asking about how others move through the world, by identifying the exact manner.\n5. So we can initially eliminate the options that are not necessarily manners in which one moves.\n6. \"Quick\" and \"Fast\" means different things here. Quick suggests a general speed whereas \"fast\" suggests speedy movement. \"Still\" means'moving very slowly' but not stopped or unable to move at all.\n7. So \"C: quick\" and \"C: fast\" can be eliminated. \"D: steady\" means a steady speed.\n8. \"E: careful\" could be taken as referring to careful movement.

The options 'B: feeling good', 'C: hyperventilating' and 'D: looking around' all involve physical movement or emotional response, which is an outcome of inhaling fresh air.\n4.) There is no need to move physically to feel better, so 'B: feeling good' is eliminated.\n5.) The action of hyperventilating is not synonymous with breathing in fresh air, so 'C: hyperventilation' is also removed from consideration.\n6.) Finally the remaining options can be evaluated in terms of whether they will further increase the person's enjoyment of fresh air. Option 'E: breathe deeply' is the correct answer as this is the only action mentioned in the question that will increase the pleasure one gets from breathing in fresh air - the other options would only increase their enjoyment to the same extent, or less and is not required for the purpose of the question.\n7.)

There are several types of the Ficus plant, though they are generally bright green and known for their ability to thrive in most settings.\n3. The best place for Ficus would be to put it either on a table or near a window. A ficus plant is not one that needs direct sunlight, it would be brighter than other types as it is green, and is a plant that generally brightens any room that it is placed in- but does not itself necessarily provide sunlight.\n4. All of the options given, except for a Ficus plant (in this case) would not brighten a room, so these must be eliminated.\n5. The question asks where the plant could be placed, and not what kind of plant it can be. So, if it doesn't specifically state Ficus plant, then none of the options B, C or D are correct.\n6. To be placed in a palace would be too large as Ficus generally are quite limited in size. \n7. Similarly, 'Dictionary' refers to the plant's appearance only, and the question specifically states that. Pots refer to size again and 'Palace' refers to an incorrect appearance.\n8. Thus, the answer would be either 'E: Apartment' or 'D: middle east' but since 'E' refers to specific physical location rather than being just anywhere, 'D and E' are incorrect.\n9. So the answer must be 'D: middle east'. Middle-East or Asia,'middle-way, 'place for living,' are all ways Ficus plants are traditionally planted- a place where one would want a fresh, green plant to brighten up the room.\nSo the final answers are D: middle east", "answer": "E: apartment"}

It must be noted that all the remaining options (except the correct answer) are activities performed by the listener and not the source of the noise.\n4. Option A: 'go to bed' can't be the correct answer as this refers to'sleep', meaning the listener is the one who is going to bed. The passengers need to be quiet for the listener to go to bed.\n5. An action that is to be done by the listener is a better bet and can only be option E: Stop worrying.\n6. It is this state of mind which is then referred to as'relaxing'.

Eliminating options, \"space centre\" does not make sense, it is not what Cape Kennedy is a part of, and \"movie\" is irrelevant as we aren't discussing how the complex is used in a movie.\n3. Similarly, military installation and spaceship centre are also inappropriate as they refer to separate concepts.\n4. \"Cape Kennedy\" is a name given to a place, therefore cannot be used to mean the same thing in a question about what it is part of, and thus is irrelevant.\n5. The remaining option: \"cape kennedy\" could be used to represent Cape Kennedy as part of a space complex, in much the same way that it is part of Florida.\n6. As \"cape kennedy's\" relevance is not so easily explained, we cannot rule out the possibility of being part of a space complex. It is likely that it is named after the complex itself, and therefore it could be used to refer to the complex.\n7. The only other possible option would be \"movie space centre\".\n8.

There are two clear distinctions of the two answers, \"before\" and \"after\".\n3. The other terms: Celebrity, baker, chef, famous person are irrelevant as the context is using and celebrity, baker and chef are associated with jobs that don't mention time.\n4. Then: Politician seems like a possible answer, because the term politician refers to a person who is \"before\" celebrity, so a politician is in the correct time frame.\n5. But the sentence also suggests that I used him before he became \"something\", which is problematic, there is no logical reason to use someone who is a politician.\n6. \"Rich man\" also doesn't work in this context because we have no evidence to conclude someone is rich before they are a celebrity.\n7. \"Famous person\" doesn't really make sense either.\n8. So there is no possible candidate", "answer": "A: toy store"}
{"text": "1.. The question is asking, after spending the time and effort to buy and maintain a car, which is the most likely location the car would end up being abandoned.\n2. By carefully reading the question, it is clear that the location chosen would be relevant to the owner only, as it is implied that other people would still find it necessary to take alternate routes to and from work.\n3. By ruling out all the other choices on this basis, we can deduce that the car would be abandoned in the'scrap heap'.\n4. The question also refers to the word 'commuting' which indicates that the car would be used regularly with some sense of regularity.\n5. Given that cars are purchased with the idea of regular usage, we can deduce from this information that a car would be more likely to get scrapped if it's no longer working.\n6. Since cars are bought primarily for transportation, having to make a walking commute, as mentioned in the question, indicates the car is no longer functioning properly due to various issues.\n7. Hence, the answer must be D:'scrap heap'. \n8. All the other four options do not satisfy the given constraints.\n9. So the final answer is D : scrap heap", "answer": "D: parking garage"}
{"text": "1) The question is essentially asking where a ticket could be used, within a different country.\n\n2) Considering all the choices, option B: baseball stadium is incorrect, as a ticket would not be used in a baseball stadium when travelling between countries.\n3) Option A: train station does not allow you to travel outside a specific country.\n4) Option C: lottery, although this enables you to travel outside a country, it does not specify a different country.\n5) Option D: movie, whilst this may be enjoyed in a different country, would not allow you to travel there.\n6) Therefore, we can eliminate options A: train station, B: baseball stadium and C: lottery and the only remaining answer is E: bus.\nSo the final answers are A: train, B: baseball stadiums and C: lotteries \n\nInput: A bird can't live in a cage too long without having any instinctive desire to break free out of what? Choices: A: the tree, B: the house, C: the street, D: the wall\nOutput: The whole idea of someone wanting to break out of the cage is the instinctive desire to break out, so 1. The question requires us to highlight a specific part of the cage and explain its nature, as described. 2. Option \"B: the house\" is incorrect as the cage is not necessarily in the same area as the house. 3. Option \"D: the wall\" is incorrect as the wall wouldn't be an \"instinctive desire\". 4. Option \"C: the street\" is incorrect as the street and the cage are not necessarily located in the same place. 5. Option \"A: the tree\" is incorrect as the tree may not necessarily be located in the area of the cage. 6. Therefore, the only remaining option is \"A: the Cage\". So  the Final answer is \"The Cage\"\n\nInput: A man who had always been a workaholic but one day suddenly changed and never wanted to work anymore.What had happened to him?

{"text": "1.\"The detective had to analyze all the clues,every little thing at the scene\" This sentence tells us that the detective had to be thorough in all aspects of his investigation.\n\n2.\"He had to\" refers to a situation in which one must do something, often due to external circumstances or constraints.\n\n3. Thinking is doing something. Thinking is considered an action.\n\n4. Thinking is not just a description about mind and cognitive processes, but rather, it involves a particular action.\n\n5. Therefore, thinking is part of doing. A person needs to think before he can act.\nAs we have concluded that thinking and doings are part of one action, they will have to be together.\n\n6. Analyzing the different options given by the author we can conclude that it will lead to a negative answer if it is related to writing or learning, because they are verbs which can be considered a means of action, unlike do or think.\n\n7. And it will lead to a positive answer if it is related with detecting, as it is considered an action. So,the correct answer will be \"D:thinking about the new\" since it is related to what the detective had to analyze, which was every little thing at the crime scene, instead of other things.\nSo the final answers are D: thinking about the new", "answer": "A: look at"}
{"text": "1. The first part of the question- 'Sam thought' introduces a main character.\n2. Sam then makes a remark about the common saying, which implies that the common saying is not actually a saying but rather something he heard from someone else, as he's pondering it.\n3. His contemplation leads to him formulating his own view of this common saying.\n4. In doing so, he applies his own unique perspective to the common saying in question.\n5. Thus, the actual question is referring to the expression Sam used to describe the common saying.\n6. Among the remaining options, only backwards, back and back and tally back refer to going backwards.\n7. Similarly, only Backwards refers to the common saying- to go forth/forth.\n8. So, when all other possibilities are eliminated, the answer must be Backwards; as Sam thought, 'this as well'.\nSo the final answer the final answer is Backwards", "answer": "D: back and"}
{"text": "1. The question states that a shower is an expected \"amenity when you reserve a ____\" which may be hotel room, motel room or bath room.\n2. So, the options given to identify this amenity will be options B: motel room and C:a bath room (hotel room may not be a suitable choice of the room as an Amenity)\n3. By looking at the options available, no hotel or bath room has any association with shower. Also, options B and C refers to different type of rooms i.e. a motel is a small hotel whereas a bath room is a private room and bath room has no any association related to shower.\n4. Therefore, the remaining option is E: locker room which has a strong association with shower.\nSo the final output is E: locker Room\n\nInput:A very wise guy who never missed a clue got so many clues that he was in over- what? Choices: A: his head B: his ears C: his hair D: his head E: his neck\nOutput:'A wise guy' is someone who is smart and street-wise. 'In over his head' is an idiomatic expression that means one is in too deep or in trouble.\n1.The question is looking for a word that describes a person (in terms of intelligence) who is smart and street wise (has a lot of intuition).\n2. A wise guy is someone who is a good judge of character but only gets a few good indications (clues) for every story.\n3. There is no such situation where a very wise guy gets so many good indications (clue) that he is in over his (wise guys) head.\n4.

Choices: A: a self-help B: an autobiography C: a comedic D: a thriller E: a fantasy\nOutput: 1 \"The book that gave my teensy cousin insight into what was what to him, was what?\" indicates that the book was important enough to give one insight into what was wrong.\n\n2.We can eliminate choices \"A: self-help\" and \"D: A comedy\" as these are not important enough to give one an awareness of how to deal with problems.\n3. We can eliminate choice \"C: a comedic drama\" as this would lead one away from the problem instead of allowing one to come to terms with the issue.\n4. Choice \"E: fantasy\" is the same, taking the individual away from real-world concerns.\nTherefore, the only remaining option is \"B: autobiography\".\nAccording to https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/autobiography, \"The genre that describes the writer's life stories and experiences.\"\nThus, autobiography is defined as a story about the writer's life.\nThis makes the correct option \"B: autobiographical\".\nSo the final answer should be B: autobiography\n\nInput: \"I think I might have to get the surgery after all.\" He said, what?

What would be a better word than \"actions\"?  Choices:  A. reactions B. movements C. deeds D. gestures E. motions F. gestures \nOutput: 1\"Actions\" would be an appropriate synonym for \"behavior\", \"behavior\" refers specifically to the actions one performs, which is accurate, but there could be better ways to express this.\n2The question doesn't specify the extent to which the actions are required in order to gain \"a lot of information\" 3Although \"Movements\" and \"deeds\" are more accurate synonyms for \"actions\", they imply more specific forms of action, such as walking, speaking, and performing tasks as opposed to everyday actions, which is what the question describes.\n4\"Gesticulations\" and \u201cMotions\u201d both refer to specific and exaggerated actions, therefore wouldn't be an appropriate synonym because actions can be small and unnoticeable.\n5\"gestures\" is similar enough to \"actions\" that it could be selected as an answer, but it doesn't capture the same scope or breadth of use.\n6There is only one option that could potentially be the correct answer\nSo the final choice would be F: gestures\n\nInput: You will receive a \"souvenir\" if you travel.

{"text": "1. The question makes it clear that the barn was old, damaged and beyond repair.\n2. It also states that the building had to be destroyed first before constructing a new barn.\n3. However, to repair something means to fix it, which requires maintenance or improvement using building materials.\n4. To entice / build / raise also suggests that the barn didn't need to be reconstructed, as repairs would suffice.\n5. Similarly, there is no mention of building a new barn, only repairing the old one. This means that the answer must be \"fix\".\n\nSo the final answer after a lot of work is fix\n\nInput: There's no way I can trust this test. The questions don't make any sense and I'm positive the what? Choices: A: instructor B: instructors C D: instructee E: students\nOutput:1. There is no question mark at the end of this sentence. The instruction to a participant in a test or exam is to answer questions as written, without any alteration.\n2. This means that any changes or alterations made to the questions in their original format can invalidate the accuracy of the test. Hence, the answer must be \u201cD: instructor\u201d, as modifying the questions on the test would not be a typical behaviour of an instructor. \n3. Since the sentence is in the first person, we can also eliminate \u201cinstructees\u201d/ \u201cinstructor\u201d. Additionally, the term \u201cproctor\u201d denotes someone who supervises a test.\n4.

From the options, \"Fastly\" is not one of the means. Also, \"Fastly\", if used to mean \"swiftly\", would sound unnatural here.\n2.) The phrase 'develop an ability' implies that there is a process", "answer": "B: raise"}
{"text": "The question is asking for the reason why they had to go 'what?' The options provide details that could help to identify the reason, rather than specifying anything.\n1. 'Cook dinner' suggests the lack of cooked food is the reason.\n2. 'Get food' suggests the lack of groceries is the reason.\n3. 'Go back to work' suggests the reason is time, as they would have worked all day.\n4. 'Eat' is also an unspecific term.\n5. 'Make food' is the only option that could be the reason, or the reason they had to 'go'.\n6. Therefore, 'Go back to work', though a strong indication of the cause of their eating outside their own home, is not directly related to 'having to go' anywhere, and is an indication of reasons.\n7. The reason they had to go must be because they had to'make food' so they could 'eat', not because they had to 'go back to work'.\n8. Option'make food' is also specific, meaning it is the only option directly related to the reason why they had no food in their cupboards. Hence,'make food' is the correct answer.\nSo the final answers are D: make food  and E: go back to work", "answer": "E: get food"}
{"text": "1 The question basically asks the reader to choose the most appropriate choice that would fit in the context of a person being curious yet unable to leave their house.\n2 We eliminate A&B as they both refer to witnessing testimonies, which does not fit the scenario.\n3. The phrase 'curiosity about something' suggests it is a question of interest towards something, as it is an emotion that can arise when a person is unable to fulfill their desire to see or witness things/concerts.\n4. Therefore it is safe to eliminate the remaining choices as they do not directly mention \"curiosity\".\n5. Hence, we have to conclude with the choice of 'C'. It indicates that seeing exhibits would satisfy an interested reader.\n6. Therefore 'C: See exhibits' would be the most appropriate choice as a fit to the scenario described.\nSo the final is C: See exhibits\n\nInput: You have to make decision on what subject to learn?

A means having appointments which might be a big hassle for people who need to be productive but this is not specifically work in the sense that it means some kind of job, B means people who have time to think but it will not necessarily help them do his/her work as this could mean doing some leisure activities and so E will be the correct answer for this reason that E states they are people who are impatient i.e they are always anxious in all aspects of life and not just in waiting for the doctor.\n4. People who are impatient will not be able to do their work properly because they will not be able to focus on their work, instead they will be constantly focusing on how long it will take for the doctor to come and they will have to keep going to the doctor again and again till the doctor fulfills their desire of not waiting for the doctor anymore.\n5. Hence the answer is E meaning impatients.\nSo the final answe r is E: impatients.", "answer": "D: time consuming"}

The answer will involve the name of the space where a customer can procure a bag from, after the customer selects the item and fills the bag with purchased items at the merchant stall.\n3. \"Shopping cart\", the first option suggests that bags are carried in carts by the customer to the cash point for payment. This would not be the space where the customer would need a bag, he is already carrying the bag and buying items, which is in contrast to the scenario provided.\n4. The remaining words refer to different retail settings but not those directly relevant to the question.\n5. So the answer choices could be A: shopping cart, B: cashier, C: shopping malls, D: supermarket, and E: book stores.\n6. The correct answer is E: book stores. This is not because of supermarkets or cashiers, but because books are the most generic item which can be bought, and the book store is the most generic retail space where a specific item can be bought.\nSo the final answers are E: book stores\n\nInput:It is not common for young people on the west coast to drink hot what?

The options B: coffee and C: coke suggests that the drink of the young west coast people include coffee and coke. This is not the case as those drinks are typically consumed by the people in the east coast.\n3.) The options D: chocolate and E: soup does not provide any relevance. They are simply names and types of drinks.\n4.) Hence, the correct choice is \"B: coffee\"\n5.)

Therefore the answer is B: Seed plants as this implies the plan to \"use of again\" the plants in the following year.\nSo the final is B: Seed Plants\n\nInput:What is the real meaning of the sentence \"Talitha cumi\", also known as \"Talitha Get Up.\" Choices: A: Go to the lake. B: Jesus's girlfriend. C: Jesus's servant. D: Little girl get up. E: Little girl wake up.\nOutput: 1: The question states Talitha cumi, or Talitha get up meaning something.\n2: All of other choices are nonsensical.\n3: In the middle of the bible, the disciples are saying \"Talitha Cumi\" and Jesus replies, \"Talitha Koumi\" meaning get up you girl. So therefore the answer is C for Jesus's Servant\nSo the final answer has to be C: Jesus Servant", "answer": "D: seed crops"}
{"text": "1:The sentence states that if you're betting a shark, playing place (the correct answer) is unlikely to be the \"pool hall\". \n2. The given choices indicate the five options that the question can use to give clues about this situation.\n3. We don't know what exactly a shark is betting for.\n4. Option \"pool hall\" doesn't really fit since the \"pool\" is playing the game and \"pool hall\" is where the game is played. So, the correct answer cannot be here.\n5. Option \"mediterranean sea\" is definitely a place where the bet can happen, since its a common fishing or diving spot.\n6. \"Aquarium\" would sound like an underwater tank but that's not correct. The correct place to be talking for a shark (the bet) is out of the aquarium, so its not correct. \n7. Option \"south pacific\" can be a location where we can find shark (the bet), but still not a suitable place.\n8. Option \"pacific ocean\" can fit here because it's the biggest ocean with the most kinds of sea animals in it.\n9. The final answer cannot be option \"Pacific ocean\" because the sentence is in past tense \"where are you likely...\"; this suggests the scenario is about a place where the bet happened, not is happening.\n10. Thus the only correct option is \"mediterranean seas\", as this describes a place where one's likely to play against a shark.\nSo the final answers is \"D:  Mediterranean Sea", "answer": "D: pool hall"}

This is the question and hence the answer that we seek.\n4.We can start by eliminating four options as they would not be up in loft in storage or attic in the garage.\n5.An option 'trash' could be symbolic for garbage, but this would indicate the existence of a loft or attic in the first place which would only be for storing things.\n6.An option `closet` would mean in an additional room in the house rather than the garage.\n7.An option 'box' would indicate a container which would not in itself suggest that the clothes have been stored up in a loft or attric.\n8.Hence the answer to the question must be from the options, `A: attic B: loft`\nSo the final answer to the question stated is C: Attic.", "answer": "A: attic"}
{"text": "1) \"How do you carry potatoes home?\" is the question asked. There's no need to explain what the question means but I'll write it down anyways.\n2) To carry potatoes home one must use some form of transportation. \n3) The options suggest four possible types of transportation.\n4)  Grocery store: This doesn't make sense if potatoes are bought in a grocery store because you wouldn't buy them in a grocery bag, you would get them from the grocery store which has to have some form of transportation and that option's name includes the word \"store\". There will always be means of transportation involved by virtue of the existence of grocery stores.  \n5)  Grocery bag: This choice doesn't work because it would involve carrying something other than the potatoes home. This choice seems to imply that the potatoes are already in a grocery cart and just require transporting from one place to another - in that case, the grocery cart itself would qualify as the vehicle.\n6)  Restaurant: This is irrelevant since it refers to a location, not a vehicle.\n7)  Farmer's market: The farmer's market is a place that exists, not a vehicle that exists. (It would be \"Farmers market\" if the vehicle itself were to be the farmers market, but it's not the market itself.) Rather, the market is a place where grocers may sell produce. Since the market is itself not transportable and since the potato is to be transported, it is a nonsensical choice as a transport vehicle.\n8)  Bushel basket: This is too narrowly focused. We need an item that can transport a potato to and from its place of purchase. The bushel basket would just be a container used to hold a potato after it has already been purchased.\n9)  Using that elimination method, we're left again with only one plausible transport method: the \"Grocery cart\" or \"Grocery trolley\".  So the correct choice is  \"D: Grocery Cart\" as that is the most likely method of transportation used in modern day society to transport groceries.\n\nInput: What could be done to improve the situation in Rwanda?

{"text": "1.\"Where do almost all people life?\" implies that there is a general location where most people live.\n2. The question is asking which option is the most appropriate when referring to where most people live. \n3. There are several reasons to exclude C: surface of the earth and H: a house. C: surface of the Earth is one location where people live, but the option does not explicitly describe where \"almost all people\" live.\n4. The option H: a house, refers to living arrangements that are not shared, which is not the same as where \"most people\" live.\n5. Therefore, the only option that can be used to complete the sentence is B: Apartments. \n6. Apartments are a location where people live that is widely used to refer and describe where most people live.", "answer": "C: surface of earth"}
{"text": "1.\"What is another term for...?\" means this word can be replaced with the one among the set of options. \n2. According to Dictionary.com, \"civil\" is (n) a suit in a superior court of law brought by one private person to obtain relief, as damages, for an injury to person, property or reputation, etc., sustained from another private person or from a public officer acting under color of office; an action of this character brought by the Commonwealth to enforce a legal right, or to prevent or punish a wrong. \nThis definition is similar to \"civil action\". By looking at the meaning of \"civil\" and the options given, we can eliminate some of these choices.\n3. We can exclude choices A and B, because in our context, civil action can only be referred to as either civil action or civil suit - these options don't refer to civil action. \n4. Also, we can eliminate choice D because although \"arrest\" refers to civil action, it can't be the best answer as 'instituting civil action' does not refer to arrest. In other words, the situation in the question is that of instituting civil action, NOT, \"that person was arrested as an outcome of civil action\". Therefore, the answer must be \"B: Complications\", as this refers to civil action in the way that it describes a situation where there are many things, problems or difficulties surrounding an event or situation. For our scenario, this seems appropriate.\nSo the final choice is B: Complications\n\nInput: \"They also like to go where the good weather is, which is what they're calling what?\" Choices:  A. Snow B. Gulf stream C. Summer D. Waves E. Winters\nOutput: \n1. \"Good weather is, which is\" refers to \"good weather\" - so this phrase can be replaced by one of the options mentioned, and the answer must be either B (Gulf stream) or D (Waves). The options given are as follows:\n2. A) Snow - does not make sense due to the context of the question\n3. B) Gulf Stream - does not make sense as there is a comma already between 'winters and \"are calling\" (see below)\n4. C) Summer - does not make sense considering the use 'because is what' which refers to 'good", "answer": "E: protests"}
{"text": "1. The question asks which location one should keep a rosebush in to avoid containers.\n2. \"Flower Garden\" (option A) could be somewhere where the rosebush would grow naturally without any containers.\n3. \" Garden Center \" (option B) implies where you get the containers to hold the plant, not necessarily where you put the container itself, so this option is not correct.\n4. The same reason applies to \"Pot\" (C) and \"Pot\" (D) (option E) as they both refer to the containers themselves where you would keep the actual plant.\n5. The last option left is \"Formal Gardens\" (option E), which could be where you would keep the formal plant container without a flower or plant in it.\n6. Hence, the final answer is \"E: Forma Garden\".\nSo the final answer must be E: formal Gardens\n\nInput: What is the best way to remove dirt from your hands? Choices: 1. A: Wash them in warm water\n2. B: Rub them\n3. C: Wash them in cold water\n4. D: Rub them in cold water\n5. E: Scrub them in cold water\nOutput: 1). The question asks what is the best way to get dirty hands clean and is looking for efficient ways to achieve this.\n2). From options A & B, cold water is the only option that is both efficient and time-saving.\n3). Options C & D are not time-saving methods, and option E might not be sufficient to get dirt off of dirty hands completely.\n4). Hence, the correct answer is \"D: Rub hands in cold water\".\nSo the final choice will be D: Rub hands in cold Water\n\nInput: How would you define yourself as a person.

{"text": "1- The options could be sorted at this stage by eliminating any choice that is non-physical, then looking to remove those that refer to'making','making even' or'making level'.\n2. \"His Home\" may well be where he should go to get a level, but it also gives us a clue as to what he must do to get one.\n3. \"Build\" may be a physical action, but referring to something being 'on' or 'in' something is irrelevant, we can therefore remove \"Build evenly\".\n4. There's no obvious reason why Bob would need to'make' a level, and he doesn't even need to do all the work himself, so \"Make evenly\" and \"Build\" are both irrelevant, and we are left with choices \"Carpenter's shop\" and \"Video game\". \n5. \"Video game\" is unlikely as there is no obvious reason why someone would use a video game to make a shelf level, when they could go to a carpenters shop to buy what they need. \n6. So the answer must be \"C: Garage\": the garage is where a carpenter's tools are placed and likely to contain a level.\nSo the final choice is C: The Garage", "answer": "D: carpenter's shop"}

You dislike \nOutPut: 1)  In this prompt, the first part asks us what's best not to do, and the second part indicates that there is no correct answer, and we will have to choose one 2) The last option is the best one, as it includes a possible way to address annoying tones of people- disliking such a tone. 3) The word \"dislike\" in the last option is synonymous to \"annoyed\". 4) Hence, the answer must be D: \"That dislikes\".\nSo the final answer must be D: That dislikes. \n\nInput:  I am not saying I am a failure, but as an actor, I have been in what?

The question is asking what the character was described as so the choices are options A-E are all incorrect, option D is almost a correct answer as it is describing what he was but the sentence says that he was quite good, it didn't say extraordinary.\n2.) The next choice is option A, this is incorrect because he was a natural talent for that type of thing, it doesn't mention that he was exceptional.\n3.) He didn't mention being an outlier, which the question is directly linked to, so option C is a incorrect choice.\n4.) He didn't also give the impression of being ordinary, so option B is also incorrect.\n5.) The question asked what he was and was quite good was a description of the character. He has been described as quite good which is why you should choose 'CAPABLE'.\nSo the final answer of what the character was described would be C; capable.\n\nInput: 15 years ago, Mr. Y. founded an insurance company in his living", "answer": "B: atlas"}

The options are the locations of the Entrance Hall (Except the hat rack, which is an item within the entrance hall).\n3. Options \"A\" (school) is irrelevant, we're after something to do with the house not a school.\n4. \"Large home\" could be an option if it has an entrance hall - this is not explicitly mentioned in any of the other answer choices and the question refers more specifically to a \"house\".\n5. Option \"D\" is again irrelevant. It is a word referring to the item rather than the location.\n6. \"C\" is therefore more likely to be an option as it refers to the location (house), although there still needs to be an entrance hall in order to make this option even relevant.\n7. The final option, \"E\" (Closet), could apply if the house has no entrance hall, but there is no requirement for the question to state that the house must have an entrance hall, this would be stated if it did not.\n8. Therefore, options \"C\" and \"E\" would provide a suitable location to Keep your hat. \n\n9. However, in context, the question states \"hat rack\", but this does not appear to be within the entrance hall, so in context \"E\" would still be a valid answer.\n\n10. So the final answer is;\nC.

{"text": "1.\"Sarah opened his/her chest\". This indicates that the patient is a male - possibly a man or boy.\n2. Her patient might not be a human being.The phrases \"second heart\" and \"might not be human\" are not contradictory terms; humans can have two hearts, for example.\n3. \"a bedroom\" is an unlikely location for such a scene, and \"an antique shop\" describes objects, not people.\n4. While \"an animal\" does not contradict the given phrases, the sentence indicates that the patient is human and that \"Sarah opened his (male) chest.\"\n5.

The first part of the sentence explicitly states that the cat, who was a dog, didn\u2019t go under the porch.\n2. Option B is not the reason that the cat fled to the porch. She fled instead of going into her den, not down into her den\u2014which is incorrect as an inanimate object that can\u2019t be fleeing\u2014and so B is incorrect.\n3.

It is obvious that \"diaphragm\" moves the lungs when breathing.\n3. \"Oxygen\" is important to breathing but it is not consumed while breathing, it is only the substance that is breathed in.\n4. \"Abdominal muscles\" plays an important part in breathing but it is only one part and air passes through the throat.\n5. \"Open throat\" is true but it doesn't actually breathe anything in, just causes someone to breath freely.\n6. This is why the correct answer is \"D: Air\". \"Air\" is also the most important part for breathing.\nSo the final ANSWER is D: air,\n\nInput: He is an artist and has been involved with drawing portraits since his childhood.  He says he can draw faces from what? Choices A: pictures B: memory C: images D: imagination E: models F: nothing\nOutput: 10. He has been involved with drawing for a very long time and he can see what portraits people look like in their mind. This may not be the only way to draw a picture but that's how he can see what people look like. \n2. So, to draw a portrait, one needs not only the image of what the subject looks like, but also, one needs to have imagination to re-create the subject's face.\n3. All other choices have some form of what is required to recreate a face, i.e. photos or models.\n4. The correct choice is \"C: Images\" as an artist needs to have a picture of the person he is drawing. This may not be a photo of the person, but some memory or experience with that person.\nSo the final Answer is C: Images\n\ninput: He is an artist.  When he can't remember what the object he is drawing is supposed to look like, he just starts sketching what he what? Choices: A: can visualize B: can imagine C: can remember D: sees in his head E: he knows is there\nOutput: 1: The artist cannot imagine what the object of the subject is not because he's not an artist.\n2: The correct answer is that he draws", "answer": "B: oxygen"}
{"text": "1.\u201cVeldt\u201d refers to an \u201copen plain\u201d; however, as the question asks specifically for lions (and not other plains animals, such as wolves), it doesn\u2019t seem to be the best answer to the question.\n2. \u201cOcean\u201d is likely too broad of a term to be considered. In the context of the question, the lion is likely to be found on the \u201cAfrica landmass\u201d, hence making \u201cSavannah\u201d the best answer.\n3. \u201cAfrica\u201d is, technically, Africa. However, Africa is an entire continent, and there isn\u2019t a specific continent (namely, Africa) referred to in the question. Additionally, the continent-level terminology \u201cAfrica\u201d may not match the smaller-scale term (ie: \u201csavannah\u201d), hence making \u201cSavanna\u201d the best answer. 4. Option \u2018A\u2019 doesn\u2019t make sense here. To give an example: Let\u2019s say that \u2018Jungle\u2019 is the answer to the question, the best answer cannot be \u201cocean\u201d (this would then mean that the lion lived at the ocean, not the jungle).\nOption \u2018B\u2019 seems to be a close answer\u2014though technically the other options could also be considered as the \u201ccoast\u201d, it should still be \u201cbeach\u201d. 5. Option D doesn\u2019t make sense either, especially considering the fact that the lion is likely not to live in the ocean. Additionally, Africa, which is stated to be the continent of the lion, doesn\u2019t just simply mean the African continent - it\u2019s a specific geographical region, hence why you need to make a distinction between using the terms 'africa' and 'africa landmass'.\n6. Thus, the answer would be \u2013 Savanna, making \u201cC\u201d the correct answer\nSo the final answer should be C: Savannah\n\nInput:What type of food comes from mammals?

{"text": "1.\"Everybody raised a drink...\" suggests that everybody is participating in a communal activity, therefore we are looking for an action to be completed collectively.\n2. \"and cheered\" suggests that everybody is pleased and cheerful, therefore we are looking at an emotional activity.\n3. \"they were doing\" implies an ongoing action, therefore we can exclude the options that require a single isolated act (A&B).\n4. \"what?\" is the final clue that clarifies that we are supposed to answer what everybody is doing together, and not what each person is doing individually.\n5. \"to get drunk\" does not match the other emotions of the action, so we can be sure to exclude this, and it cannot be collective.\n6. So \"they were celebrating\" is the only answer that matches all the given clues, as nobody is raising their drink to be drunk but instead to celebrate.\nSo the final answew is C: Celebrating\n\n\n## Part 2:\n\n### Instruction:Answer the questions below without referring back to the article.\n\nIn today\u2019s tech-driven world, businesses of all sizes have become increasingly reliant on technology, leading to a rapidly growing market for cloud computing services. Unfortunately, there have been recent reports of cyberattacks on cloud-based services, including Amazon\u2019s AWS and Microsoft\u2019s Azure. These attacks have compromised data and systems, leading to costly downtime and lost productivity. It is apparent that the increased reliance on cloud computing services leaves businesses vulnerable to cyber-attacks, and therefore, it is essential that businesses take proactive measures to secure their data and systems. One solution is to incorporate Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA), a security approach that applies security to the network regardless of a user\u2019s location or device. ZTNA is a network paradigm based on a \u201cnever trust, always verify\u201d principle, where users are authenticated and authorized before connection to a network is granted. This means that the user is only granted access to the resources they need and are verified before accessing the data and systems. With ZTNA, businesses can better protect their data and systems against cyberattacks by controlling who has access to the data and systems and when and how they can access the resources. By incorporating Z", "answer": "E: celebrating"}
{"text": "1. The question is asking what feeling or emotion.  We start by eliminating the answers that require two words.\n2. For example- \"have something\" is not an emotion, so \"B\" cannot be correct.\n3. Similarily, \"headaches\" is not an emtion, so \"C\" cannot be correct.  \"Headaches\" is a condition, like a migraine.  \"Stoic\" is a character trait, a disposition or behavior.\n4. \"D: headaches\", \"D: a headache\", \"D: having a headache\" are just examples of a word that cannot be an emotion.\n5. \"D: being happy\" could be an emotion, it is not clear.  If John would like to be happy, then he would feel a desire (\"wanting\") to be happy, he would not be \"happy\".\n6. In any case, if an answer has two words, the first word must be a verb and this cannot be \"have\".\n7. So, for the remaining options, \"B\" refers to a specific type of feeling. \"B\" is correct.\nSo the final answers are B: having something important  makes him feel. So the final answers are B- then have- that is, make him feeling.\n\nInput:  Why aren't you getting a chance to take a trip to Italy?

This question aims to identify why the speaker does not wish to travel to Italy despite an offer from her boss. \n2. Analyzing the question, it is evident that there are multiple possible reasons for the speaker to deny the offer of a travel to Italy.\n3. Eliminating all the answers that are not directly relevant, only \"A\" remains.\n4. From the options, \"B: because I am too *impatient to wait any  longer for the offer*. \" is grammatically incorrect with the addition of \"to\", since \"Impatient\" has no direct association with time, it is not something one must *wait for* a specific amount", "answer": "D: being happy"}

This leaves us with the answer being C) he said to an audience.\n3) Option E) he said to stage managers is wrong since stage managers have nothing to do with people who are booing at the singer, 4) and option B) he said to performers is wrong since the performers are the ones who are singing and not booing.\n5) The remaining options are both wrong and not suitable since they are not relevant with the singer and his audience. \n6) Hence, the right answer will be B)  he said to the performer\nSo the final answer to this question will B: he said to the performings.\n \nInput: At breakfast in a small town's only hotel, the guests complain about the sausage, eggs, and home fries.

There are no vowels in a.\n3. \"A\" has no vowels.\n\n## # Where are you looking? #\n\n1) \"His hands hurt\" is the first sentence (therefore it came first)\n2) \"Where are you looking?\" is the second sentence (it comes second)\nThe answer is B.\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question below by looking at some examples.\n\nInput: 1. Does someone like this help you?  A: yes B: no\nOutput: 1) There is no such name which starts with \"D\". So the answer is B. As the name does not start with \"D\". Therefore, the name is an example of the word in question. So, the choice must be B: no.\n\n2.) There is no", "answer": "E: desk drawer"}
{"text": "1.\"James is very interested in....\" refers to James' liking for other planets. \n2.The phrase is in reference to going to Mars and reading books about it.\n3.It is stating that James is interested in'space' as opposed to 'planets'.\n4. The options 'Love' and 'School' can be ruled out.\n5. The phrase \"going to\" refers to going to the planet.\n6. \"going to\" also needs to be replaced with an option that describes the act of going.\n7. So, the answer options that can be ruled out are \"Space Shuttle\" and \"Library\".\n8. The term \"School\" would be used to refer to Mars when describing it in detail, and can also describe anything you attend.\n9. The phrase \"library\" can be removed by replacing it for one that better describes going somewhere.\n10. Therefore the correct answer \"Space Shuttle\", is what takes one to space.\nSo the final option is D: space shuttles\n\nInput: His father was quite poor and he was an abusive bully.  His friend decided at that point to leave what? Choices: school, home, life, city \nOutput: 1 : We start with the options \"School\" and \"Home\".\n2 : These two don't seem to be the right options here, especially \"school\" because we're more than likely talking about a home situation.\n3: School can't then also be ruled out due to the wording.\n4: We now have narrowed it down to 3 options, i.e. \"Home\", \"Life\" and \"City\".\n5: We can eliminate \"Life\" straight away for the same reasons as \"home\", it doesn't seem be right here.\n6: \"Home\" and \"city\" remain the options.\n7: His father was also \"abusive\".\n8: This means that the choice between \"home\" and \"city\" must be narrowed down further on the basis of \"abuse\", as a home and city aren't the right choices unless the abuse was in the home or the city.\n9: Looking at the sentence, it seems as if this is about bullying and the friend decided to leave the city because of bullying.\n10: Therefore, the", "answer": "D: space shuttle"}
{"text": "1. The question mentions that james found a large menu, implying that multiple options exist. \n2. He is looking to buy bitcoins, so he is interested in sites that he can use to purchase bitcoins.  The options are, therefore, of no relevance.\n3. There is also nothing mentioned about ads, news, or cafes.\n4. Internet sites could include sites like coinbase and kraken.  They allow users to buy and sell bitcoins, hence the answer should be A: advertisement.\nSo the final word is A: Advertisement.\n\nInput:There seems to be some confusion over the difference between the words \"adversary\" and \"adventurer.\"  Is it true that the adventurer is an adversary but the adversary is not necessarily an adventurer? Choices: 1. Yes, A 2. Yes, B 3. No, A 4. No, B 5. No contest, C\nOutput: \n1. The question asks whether the answer can be \"yes\" or \"no.\" \n2. 'Adversary' per se does not necessarily mean an \"adventurer,\" but an \"adventurer\" does not always mean an \"adversary.\" \n3. We can eliminate choice C, which does not provide a correct answer to the question asked.\n4. Choices A and B each give a different version of the statement, which we can logically eliminate. \n5. Thus, the true statement must be \"No contest, B: The adversary is not necessarily not an adventurer\"\nSo the final answer option is B:\nNo contest, the adversary is not always an adventurer\n\nInput:The best way to get rid of unwanted pests is through extermination.  What is extermination? Choices:  I. elimination of a species II. the killing of insects III. ridding of a building of its pests IV. the removal of pests from a building \n\nOutput: 1.\"Extermination\" generally refers to the way something is killed, which makes sense, as we associate the term with the killing of insects. \n2. That makes sense as well as the sentence provides the specific context in which \"extermination\" is to be applied (killing \"insects\").\n3.", "answer": "E: internet sites"}
{"text": "1.'Where can you store a notepad on your perso?' the question asks, to specify the location or a place where a small notepad can be safely kept.\n\n2. The options are: back pocket, meeting, drug store, home, school.\n\n3. The question is for a small notepad, not a large one or a personal diary.\n\n4. If a person is reading the question, the options may be considered confusing and may divert focus away from the goal.\n\n5. The options contain many words starting with letters 'a' and 'c', which could be confusing to someone reading.\n\n6. We can consider'small' to be around 'hand-size/palm-size' and hence eliminate back pocket.\n\n7. 'Home' and'school' are redundant since most of the people keep their study time in homes or schools.\n\n8. We can rule out 'drug store' as they do not sell small notepads.\n\n9. 'Meeting' would be too general and hence 'C' is the best choice.\n\n10. 'C' is the correct choice since it is the most precise option.", "answer": "A: back pocket"}

Choices: A) capacity, capacity B) sense, sensibility C) capacity, capability D) great, great E) great, great F) sense of capaity, great G) capacity, capacity F) sense, sense G) great great sense of capability\nOutput: 1: We can eliminate choices F & G because the phrase: \"who has not a great...\" suggests \"whose is not large\" and \"the\" should be added at the beginning of the sentence.\n2. Choice A, \"capacity\" is just referring to this sense: \"not great\" because nothing was mentioned about a capacity that's great.\n3. Choice choice B \"sense of great capability\" is referring to the opposite of great capacity so we can eliminate this", "answer": "D: education"}
{"text": "1.'Nothing' suggests the options are what you could do in return to what you watch on tv.\n2. The question asks what you are expecting while watching tv.\n3. The options ask for what you could get and not what you 'expect' to get when watching.\n4. So the correct choice 'There is nothing else to do' in return of watching tv does not fit in for the question.\n5. The choice 'Entertainment' fits in as it's what you could get while watching tv and not what you are expecting.\n6. Hence, the final answer should be 'A: Entertainment'.\nSo the final answer should be A: Entertainment \n\nInput: He put up a good fight, though he died in the end.  They're talking about? Choices:  People, who won or war A: a dog B: an election C: the earth D: his father E: a battle\nOutput: 1:'They're talking about' suggests the options are the people/objects the text refers to.\n2.'A good fight, in the end' clearly suggests that there was a fight, but the person was still alive at the end of it.\n3.'Died' indicates a person with someone dying.\n4.'He' indicates a person, so the remaining options are ruled out.\n5. There is clearly a person/object that has died, but the war is irrelevant so the battle is the only other option.\n6. This means that the text is talking about the person, and the question is asking us to identify the object/person that fought the battle.\n7. Based on information we've established, it's clear that not all of the options are what it's referring to, and we've effectively narrowed down a list of possibilities.\n8. We can consider the most obvious choices, like a dog and election- these wouldn't die in a battle, and wouldn't be described as 'good' or 'won'.\n9. Similarly, the earth would die, but the text doesn't tell us anything about it's personality and wouldn't be classed as 'good' in a battle.\n10. This is consistent in that the only other objects that would die and could be considered 'good' in a fight are people (since that's what the text is about).\n11. This makes 'D", "answer": "B: entertainment"}
{"text": "1.\"After attending school for 12 years, what do you do?\" is a question asking what next activity people might take after such long study.\n2. As there are no specific options provided, the correct answer could refer to what most people do after long study, or a common activity taken by most people.\n3. Excluding the option 'After attending school for three to six years' (which makes the question pointless), what would a typical person (without exception) choose to do?\n4. Choice B: \"much work\" can be a common choice but not the most popular one.\n5. Option D: \"graduate\" is the most popular answer, although it might not be the true answer. An example of someone after graduating from college (which is generally 4 years of study) would be to get a job to earn a living.\n6. The other options are not popular enough, yet too popular to be ruled out. After thinking about the question, the choice \"D: graduate\" was the most likely answer as more likely to be true, yet the other answers can still be acceptable depending on the scenario. As such, the answer could also be \"C: boredom\"\n7. To summarize, \"D: graduate\", \"C: bored\" and \"D: graduate E:  degree\" are likely answers for that question, though they aren't the only answers that could be accepted.\nSo the final answers are  D: graduate, C: bored and D: graduate E : degree\n\nInput: The teacher gave the students a good test, but they still didn't know what?

Moreover, it is not the teacher\u2019s fault if students don\u2019t know so much or anything. We also can exclude the option \u201ceach\u201d because it is too specific to explain in one word.

The options do not include all possible home locations, nor does they include general public places.\n\n3. The only one which might be considered a public place is the grocery store.\n\n4. Therefore, an ideal answer may be from the options which are locations inside the home (bathroom not included, as morning paper delivery is not typically to bathrooms).\n\n5. This allows eliminating the synagogue, as morning prayer is a morning service at synagogue.\n\n6. As such, the grocery store is further eliminated, given that morning delivery is rarely conducted there.\n\n7. So, option D: front porch is the only choice left from this category of options.\n\n8. Front porch may refer to the front porch of one's house, so option C should also be eliminated. A porch could also refer to the porch of a public library, but as the questions is for home deliveries.\n\n9. \"Grocery store\" can still be eliminated if it turns out that the correct answer begins with the letter 'A.'\n10. As such, option A: classroom is also eliminated, because morning paper is commonly delivered to classrooms at school.\n\n11.

Option A: world is unfaiiable cannot be the answer as lottery winning has nothing to with the unfairness of the world.\n2. Option B: future is unpredicatble cannot be an answer as the question is asking to understand how lotteries work, not predict the future lottery outcome.\n3. And option D: people are predictible cannot be the answer as probability is concerned with predictions and lottery is a game of chance. So lotteries have nothing to do with whether people are predictable or not.\n4.

It will not be the area with the largest village. 6: \"Rural area,\" is a countryside area. However, this question is worded specifically to mention a \"large\" village, and a rural area is not necessarily guaranteed to contain the largest village. 7: Therefore, the most likely answer is \"B: Big city.\" 8: A big city is likely to hold the most people within its borders, and therefore is likely to contain the largest number of people within its borders who could be a village. 9: As such, \"Big city\" is the correct answer to the question.\nSo the final ans is: Answer: B: Big city\n\nInput: The doctor decided to leave his patient's bones alone instead of operating.

This question is based on the fact established by the last sentence, Shane was supposed to speak in the funeral, and he acted ridiculously. \n3.) This sentence expresses how this ridiculous behaviour ruined the funeral.  By answering this question, we would be able to determine how to identify and avoid causing a similar situation.\n4.) We can eliminate A, B and C and E since these are simply descriptive terms not relating to the scenario, and D since Shane's comedic behaviour is contrary to its use. \n5.) So the answer that stands out the most in terms of relating to the scenario is E: somber since being somber is defined as 'formal in an unsmiling or serious way' which is the exact opposite of what Shane did. \n6.)

Cage could potentially be the answer, however, it doesn't follow that monkeys are brought to, and kept in a cage.\n4. Treetops and Africa could both also be possible answers, though both of these options are rather vague.\n5.

From these options we can cross out parking lot and gym because these places are generally safe or accessible.\n3. The question states that you don't what to find your car in these places at night which means that the places are dangerous at night. So the options are street park or stadium.\n4.

Since the options are: Guide, Book, Television and Meeting, we should choose the option that is not commonly used nowadays.\n4. We can discard Option B: Meeting. The question contains the prefix tradition, which means that this option is not the correct choice due to the fact that people do not traditionally meet to get information as a whole group.\n5. We can also discard Option C: Television. Many people can get information through that medium, as it is available in almost every home.\n6. Therefore.

We can see from this sentence that Lizards need \"desert\" to regulate their temperatures.\n3. Option A suggests a completely different type of environment; Bushes are not normally used by lizards, it might be a different question.\n4. \"Books\" and \"heat lanterns\" are not things that are in the hot, sunny desert, like lizards.\n5. They usually live among dry, desert, craggy rocks.\n6. Thus, we can reasonably eliminate options D, E and C from being a suitable choice for an answer.\n7. \"Rocks\" is the only suitable option that we can eliminate, as they are the natural habitat of lizards.\n8. The choice is between \"Bushes\" and \"rocks\".\n9. If we take \"bushes\", then our sentence will be \"Lizards need heat of sun to regulate their body's temperature. This is why you'll often see Lizards still ON bushes\" which will be a misleading choice.\n10. If we take \"rocks\", then our sentence will become \"Lizards need sun's heat and rocks.

E.g.:\n4. -\"the shadow appears on the ground\"- which contradicts the given sentence as the shadow is actually above earth's surface (ground). In addition, option A is not correct, because the shadow appears above a \"surface\", e.g. on the surface of the moon/ceiling but not on earth's surface. The shadow cannot be said to appear on the bridge, because it does not appear on the entire bridge. It only appears above areas where the light source is blocked.\n5. The same goes for the buildings, as there are many rooms that have no windows or doors where the light source is present, thus causing the shadow. In addition, on a cloudy day, a building's shadow would not appear on its wall at all.\n6. So the only one that stands out is option \"D: ground\" because it covers any situation where the opposite of the given sentences is observed. Also, the shadow should always be visible because the light source has to be blocked to even have the shadow. \n7. Hence the answer is \"A.

The question does not specify the hiding of any objects, as it states \"ruined the surprise\", not hidden it.\n5: Option B: Accidentally is not the intended answer, as the ruining of any surprise would require intentional action.\n6: Option C: Expectation can be ruled out, as this would indicate some kind of prescience that ruined the surprise in the first place.\n7: Option D: Knowingly is a misnomer, as \"knowingly\" refers to intentional actions which, according to our analysis, the ruining of a surprise.\n8: The only option now left is option E: Planned as this is more likely to cause the \"Surprise\" to be ruined.\n9: Therefore, the answer to the question is \"E: Planned\".\nSo the final answeris E: planned\n\nInput:Having his job taken away was definitely no surprise; in fact, it was exactly what he was afraid of. Choices:  A : what he was afraid of B : no surprise C : what he expected D : afraid of E:what he was expecting\nOutput: 1..The question states; \"Having the his job taken away was exactly what he was\"\n-which is a \"what\" phrase.\n2. This tells us that \"Job\" refers to the specific occupation one has, in this case the job has been taken away.\n3. The term \"exactly\" can be disregarded, as it is not immediately linked to the other choices of the statement.\n4. The key phrase to note here is \"was afraid of\"; \"Afraid\" refers to the action and not the person who is afraid. In this case the person is \"Jack\", an indirect object.\n5. \"Jack\" is not a noun or pronoun, but his role is as a subject in the sentence. Thus, we are faced with a question of which subject the statement refers to, \"Job\" or \"Jack\";", "answer": "D: knowingly"}
{"text": "1.\"Where do fish spend the most of their time?\" The question asks where fish hang out in large numbers where they live.\n2. The sentences in this paragraph imply that \"the majority of fish do not spend their time in the aquarium.\" Therefore, the answer is D, \"Toilet.\"\n3. All the other answers do not fit well. \"A: Body of water,\" is incorrect because body of water refers to a large and continuous expanse of water, such as the ocean. The fish cannot live in every part of an ocean, and they certainly cannot live inside it. \n4. Similarly, \"C: Underwater\" refers to a smaller expanse of water than a body of water, as it only refers to the part of the sea below \"a certain depth\" or \"at a particular depth.\" However, fish do not live only under the sea.\n5. Moreover, \"B: Lake superior\" is also incorrect because \"superior\" refers to higher or top, whereas we know that at least some fish must be living underwater. \"E: Aquarium\" means all the fish will be living together; where each fish swims to a spot that it owns is not considered \"a single spot.\"\n6. Therefore, we can see that all the other answers are incorrect, and therefore \"D: Toilet\" is the correct answer.\n\nInput: We can't just call it what it is, as it's a little complicated. Choices:  A. Blob B. Cube C. Folder D. Disk E. File \nOutput: 1.) The question wants us to know why we can't call it what it is. The answer should give us an explanation for that.\n\n2.) The answer should be specific and clear.\n\n3.) Options A: \"blob\" and C: \"folder\" don't give us specifics, and are generally terms that don't explain why we can't just call the thing what it is.\n\n4.) Option B: \"cube\" gives us specifics but doesn't explain why we are not allowed to call it what it is (cube).\n\n5.) Options D: \"disk\" and E: \"file\" aren't specific and aren't clear enough for us to understand why we can't simply call it what it is\n\n6.) Therefore, it needs to be option", "answer": "C: underwater"}
{"text": "The question is essentially asking us what Friday's activity was, implied by \"as she loved to host and\". \n1. The sentence also tells us that \"She a deep love for...\" which tells us that she was willing to make sacrifices to make sure her friends had a good time. \n2. She clearly did a lot for her Friday visitors, so we must be careful not to exclude \"waiting for\" in our choices and assume that she did this instead. \n3. \"Every Friday\" explicitly mentions what day of the week she had guests, so it would be reasonable to assume that her guests would be returning the same day, rather than the next day. \n4. If we assume that the visitors were returning the same day, then she could have \"waited for\" her visitors, rather than having them come back the next day.  So, if the visitors came back on Friday, it would make sense for her to \"wait for\" them. \n5. We now can exclude \"paint\" as the question implies that she invited her friends over, without any mention of doing any chores herself, or painting a room.\n6. We can now consider the answers that are still on the table. \"Entertain\" and \"Host\" are both viable choices, but neither one includes the detail that \"She loved\". \n7. Since the question directly asks what her Friday activity was, we cannot disregard the presence of the word \"dear\". Using the information given, and eliminating the unnecessary details - we must be careful not ignore the information which helps narrow down our answers, such as 'deep love' - we finally conclude that the correct answer is \"D: Entertain\" as she was willing to host guests in return for their deep love.\nSo the final answered was D: Entertain\n\nInput:We have come up with a design that is practical, affordable, and beautiful. Choices:  A:(all of the above) B:not practical C:not affordable D:all of that E:not beautiful\nOutput: 1) The question asks us to select the right option for \"all of the above\", and asks us to choose the answer that best fits all of the categories. \n2) We can deduce that the criteria for answering the question, is by comparing the answer selection based on those criteria.\n3) Using those criteria, we can begin our analysis by eliminating", "answer": "C: entertain"}
{"text": "1: The question asks us to choose one of the given statements which makes sense as a reply to the circus monkey's white flag.\n2. We can eliminate the options that aren't consistent with the given scenario.\n3. We can also eliminate 'French Government', as the question states the monkey would not have worked in the government.\n4. 'Madagascar' or 'South Africa' would make geographical sense, since these are common places for monkeys; however, they do not explain the 'white flag-surrender' statement.\n5. 'Friend's house' or 'Zoo' would most likely be the next options we'd eliminate considering the statement that the monkey already works there.\n6. 'French Government' or 'Friends' house' are probably the answer since these two options would be the most common for animals to work.\n7. Hence, from the two options left- 'French Government' would be a common reply; however, 'Zoo' is a much more common place to work and would be more likely to give this impression to the audience.\nSo the final answered is the zoo\n\nInput:A large number of the homeless people live on the streets in one part of the country.  They may not be what? Choices: A: natives B: lawyers C: illiterate D: unemployed E: poor\nOutput: The question is asking us to identify one of the options which fits in the given scenario in terms of education.\n2. A \"large number\" of those on the streets are homeless, which indicates a large range of ages and education levels, from those who are unable to read and write (illiterate) to natives who grew up in that geographical region (natives).\n3. This indicates that \"natives\" should not be an option.\n4. From the question stem, it is clear that the homeless population includes lawyers, doctors, etc. which suggests that \"illiterate\" would not be the right option.\n5. Therefore, it is most likely that the homeless population is composed of unemployed people who live on the streets in the given country.\n6. We can eliminate \"native\" and \"illiterate\" from the list since we have already narrowed down these choices to options which could be possible but do not", "answer": "A: french government"}
{"text": "1.\u201dWho said ignorance is not an excuse?\u201d the question is asking what someone said, so no one said these exact words, but this phrase can be interpreted to have these words in it. \n2. There are three options, which we eliminate based on the context of the conversation. \u201cWho said learn about subject?\u201d, \u201cwho said learn new\u201d?, and \u201cWho is ignorance not an excuse?\u201d They do sound similar, but it makes no sense to say learn about a subject when the question is about ignorance. \n3.\u201cWho said learn new\u201d is too short to be spoken in a conversation.\n4. \u201cWho is ignorance is not an bliss.\u201d is incorrect grammar.\n5. The last one seems to be the most appropriate, since it makes grammatical sense. But, it is also incorrect since bliss is an emotion, not an action. \n6. So the correct grammatical version of the sentence is \u201cWho said ignorance is an excuse for the bliss?\u201d.\nSo the final sentence is Who said ignorance is not a bliss as per option D.", "answer": "E: judge"}
{"text": "1: The options presented are of varied entities of similar name.\n2: Option 'A: jewelery' is not a single entity (it is not a place or building).\n3: Option 'B: fort knox' is not an entity (it is not concrete, but rather a historic site).\n4: Option 'C: church' and 'D: jewelry' are entities, but have a wide array of varieties (like the U.S. Treasury, individual religious sites of worship, etc... for church, and individual shops for jewelry).\n5: Option 'E: treasure chest' is not an entity - it is not a single place or building, but rather an object (a chest).\n6: The key to the question is \"in the U.S.\" - this rules out option 'D: jewellry store' - as the U.S. is the subject, and not jewellry or stores.\n7: Hence, 'E: treasure' is the correct answer.\nSo the final answers are E: 'treasure'; and of jewelry or jewelery, either entity is correct.\n\nInput:How many days are there in 12 months? Choices: 1. A: 360 2. B: 365 3. C: 364 4. D: 366\nOutput: 1- Since the question is about months, not about days, we can disregard 1 (which mentions days) as incorrect.\n2- We can eliminate 3 and 4 (which state, in their entirety, 364 and 366).\n3- From the remaining options, A and B (365) is the correct answer, since that is the number of days in a year.\nSo the final two answers are A: 365, and of B: 366.\n\nInput:What are five common causes of death?

{"text": "1, The question asks where we would store canned food.\n2, The options given are: \"cupboard,\" \"oven,\" \"grocer store,\" \"pantry\" and \"cellar.\"\n3, To eliminate all but the correct option, we can eliminate certain key words that have already been mentioned within options \"grocer store\" and \"cellar\". The words \"grocer store\" tells us, it was a grocer store rather than a super market, which we have already mentioned \"grocery store\".And so the phrase \"grocer store\" may be eliminated. Similarly, the phrase \"cellar\" implies location of which is lower than the location of kitchen, hence may be eliminated.\n4, The options \"cupboard\" and \"oven\" can both be used to store canned food. So we may infer the option \"cellar\" isn't the correct answer because if it was, we would not expect the kitchen to have access to food in its pantry.\n5, This leaves us with \"Grocery store\" and \"Pantry.\" The grocery store can be eliminated as it's already stated in question. So the only remaining option is \" pantry.\"\n6, This indicates that \"Pantry\"is the correct answer.\nSo the final  answer is E: pantry\n\n\n\nInput: The book contained a lot of interesting information, including some useful tips, but was difficult to read. How can you explain that?

Therefore, the answer must be C: useful; tips. 4) This rules out options \"Difficult\" \"Difficult to read\" and \"difficult; information\". Now, the available options are: \"Useful\"", "answer": "A: cupboard"}
{"text": "1: The question asks where a road is known as the motorway.\n2. The first word \"Where\" can be translated to \"where on Earth\" and \"Where is\" to \"where is a\"\n3. There are many countries around the world, and there are different road names. \n4. For example, while driving in England a motorist may drive on the A or B roads while in Scotland, drivers can drive on the A, B, or C or motorway. This can confuse people that are used to driving on the American highway system.\n5. Also, New Jersey and Scotland have both built sections of \"Limited Access Road\"\n6. However, Europe, England and New Jersey may not have these but they still have motorways with restrictions, just different names\n7. Therefore, the answer must be the Motorway, which is also a common road name in England\nSo the final answer can be A: scotland\n\n## [597.

{"text": "1: This sentence is ambiguous, so the best strategy to solve the riddle is to eliminate the irrelevant options first.\n2. \"Human\" and \"Stupid\" are irrelevant because it refers to a word, and not the definition itself.\n3. \"Weird\", \"Kind\", and \"Disingenuous\" are out because they seem logical based on literal thinking, but actually have no relevance to compassionate thoughtfulness.\n4. \"Thoughful\" is already defined in the sentence, so \"kind\" and \"stupid\" are not correct. That leaves us with \"kind\" and \"disingenuous\", but \"disingenuous\" means \"dishonest\", which contradicts how it is normally used.\n5. Therefore, the correct answer is \"kind\". \n\nInput: How many bones are in a human hand? Choices: 1 Answer: A: four B: two C: six D: sixteen E: none\nOutput: 1) As soon as we begin to analyze the statement we notice the word \"are\" instead of \"has\". (A)\n2) The structure of the statement follows a typical sentence structure which in most cases requires \"has\". (A, C, D and E)\n3) \"Hand\" is an irregular word, but in the common definition the hand has four bones (Used by majority). (B)\nSo the final answer (as the correct answer) is B: four\n\nInput: We will have a new President, soon (2017) who?

All the other possible answers are insufficient to meet the specific requirement of the question.\nSo the final choice is E: D: answering questions\n\nInput: They don't allow cash from ATMs inside the store, because they charge customers a fee for using what? Choices: A: an ATM B: a credit card C: a debit card D: their services\nOutput: 1: The question is asking what an ATM might charge a customer who wishes to obtain cash, and to what the ATM fees will be applied.\n2: Cash might be given to customers from an ATM, and would thus represent the cash, or source of revenue for the store. The ATM fees would therefore be applied to the customer's expenditure on purchases, in order to cover the cost of the ATM.\n3:The mention of an ATM, implies that both an ATM and a card might be capable of being used to gain cash, and so debit cards and credit cards can be eliminated as probable answer options.\n4:ATMs are unable to process cash purchases, and so the question can be narrowed down to determine whether ATMs charge a fee for cash, or for non-cash purchases.\n5: The sentence continues, suggesting that the fee \"Would be", "answer": "C: open boxes"}
{"text": "1) The sentence begins with the statement \"If you socialize by...\" indicating that the answer will follow by specifying the result/action of socializing.\n2) We can eliminate the wrong phrases by using the synonym of \"meet\".\n3) Option B: \"mingle\" cannot be the phrase here as it suggests that socializing by having trivial conversations can result in \"mingling\". Which means that they are doing it together.\n4) In option C: \"meet people\" cannot be the phrase as it implies that a person has not met the person before and this is not what is asked in the question.\n5) Option D: \"small talk\" cannot be the phrase because it is not talking trivial conversations.\n6) In option E: \"meet new people\" can be the phrase because it seems reasonable to have meaning of talking with trivial conversations and socializing at the same time.\nSo the final Answer is E: meet new people.\n\nInput: She was a very successful boss and would often stay late for work at what? Choices: A: home B: supper C: dinner D: office E: lunch\nOutput: 1: The use of the word \"at what\" implies that we are looking for an answer for the location where she would frequently remain late for work.\n\n2: Eliminating the options (A: home), which is the location of residence, and (C: dinner) which makes no sense as \"late\" would be an uncommon time for dinner.\n\n3: As we can see that remaining late for lunch is a common expression, the answer which is common and does not need explanation is (E: lunch).\n\nSo the final answer: E: lunch\n\nInput: If you eat an unbalanced diet your health will suffer as a result of what?

{"text": "1: The question is asking about how a person feels, once they are experiencing or seeing new things. \n2. Analyzing the answer choices, it can be seen that, \"excitement\" and \"boredom\" cannot be correctly described in this context because a person is more likely to feel a range of diverse emotions instead of just one.\n3. Furthermore, the options \"curiosity\" and \"wonder\" don't accurately convey how someone might actually feel. A person might be curious or wonder about new experiences, but that curiosity would not necessarily be constant and consistent.\n4. Therefore, the best answer is the one that corresponds closely to a person's most likely response, which is \"D: wonder.\"\nSo the final answer will D: wonder\n\nInput: He tried and tested the experiment before he carried it out with his class.

Hence, the only answer option that fits best in terms of general tendency is C i.e. overspending to stay longer.\nTherefore, C: overspending to Stay Longer is the correct Answer\nSo the final answer set is P-D-C, i.e., pleasant thoughts, overspending, debt.\n\nInput:Which of these words is the only English word that ends in the letters \"-mt\"?

{"text": "1. The question asks about where certain items of clothing can be bought.\n2. All the options are different types of clothing retailers, so we can rule out those that do not sell the items in question.\n3. Option A: Washing machine, is a device which uses water to wash and clean clothes.\n5. 'Closet' only stores clothes, it does not sell them.\n6. 'Shopping mall' is a large, commercial building for shopping, not necessarily containing all clothing products.\n\nWe are left with 2 possibilities: 4 and 5. \nAs option 5: Clothing store has \"clothing\" in its name, we would assume it to contain and sell socks and jeans. \nThe other possibility, 4, is also a specialty retailer, selling only clothing, in all forms, not only socks or jeans specifically. \n\nTherefore, clothing stores, can be a place to buy socks and jean\n\nSo the final answer should be E: Clothing store\n\nInput:It has been several centuries since we developed the method to prevent the what? Choices: fire, spreading, spread A: fire from spreading  B: spread of fire\nOutput: 1.) The question asks us to clarify the method to prevent the spread of fire.\n2.) \"have been developed\" implies in the past and \"several centuries\" implies a long time.\n3.) The question is referring to \"the method\" specifically, rather than \"the methods\".\n4.) Therefore, the answer must be a singular noun.\n5.) We have to exclude options A: fire from spread and B: spread of fire because fire from spreading and spread of fire would be incorrect if we were referring to a singular method.\n6.) All three remaining options are correct.\n7.) They all refer to keeping the spread from fire from happening.\n8.) However, it would be the first option, A: fire from spread, because that would keep fire from spreading by not spreading.\n9.) Therefore, the correct answer is A:  fire from spreading.\nSo the final option is A: fire from spread\n\nInput:What word is missing from this sentence? \"The first thing I bought was the ______. Then I bought a lot of food,", "answer": "C: clothing store"}
{"text": "1. The question refers to where biologists actually found the shark, and not the general environment or location where it resides.\n2. We can eliminate option A: fresh water and option B: the gulf of mexico quickly, as these refer to where the shark actually resides and not where it was located. \n3. In terms of the ocean, option E: coral reefr is simply not realistic, considering what a coral reef is. \n4. This leaves us with three options: \n open ocean, TV program, and Option D: the actual location of the shark's residence\n \n5. Considering that we must be specific to TV program or open ocean, option Open ocean looks like the clear favorite. Examining the options, \"the TV program\" doesn't make much sense as finding a live shark would be difficult on TV.\n6. So the question remains, which ocean is it in?\n7. Option D is the definite answer here as the question clearly refers to where the shark was located and not where it resides, so what matters is where it was found and if the shark was migrating - the answer must be \"D: the actual location of its residence\".\nSo the final answer are D: the actual location, of its residence\n**Note: this answer requires a basic understanding of the biology related to sharks\n\nInput: The man asked an authority figure what the word 'would' meant and was asked to pay no attention to what? Choices A: its suffix B: its prefix C: its roots D: its plural E: its adjective\nOutput: 1) The question is to choose what the word 'woud' means. And the choices that can provide the correct answer are A, B, C, D, and E. However, we can quickly exclude some of the options. \"Its root\" is irrelevant to the word. Since prefix and suffix of a word are a part of its root, the question \"would\" cannot have the suffix B: its prefix. \n2. \"its prefix\" is irrelevant. So by omission principle, we can eliminate C: its prefix. 3. \"Its plural\" and \"its adjective\" are irrelevant. \n4. Thus, the answer must be A: its suffix B \"the man asked an authority figure how the suffix of", "answer": "C: open ocean"}
{"text": "1 The question asks you what one is chopped for (not a person). What one is chopped for is what the sentence is referring to.\n2. All the terms mentioned are inappropiate. \"Fresh fruit\" cannot be choped in the first place, it's food.\n3. \"Wine press\" does not seem to be referring to anything edible.\n4. \"Fruit basket\" is not what is being chopped, it's the basket that is being referred to.\n5. Similarly, \"Fruit cocktail\" does not seem to refer to a physical object.\n6. Hence, option D is correct as it mentions a picnic basket being choped.\nSo the final answe is D: fruit picnic basket\n\nInput: They wanted to make sure they got a place at the big show because of what? Choices: A: their previous experience B: their name C: their talent D: their recommendation E: their friends\nOutput: In this question, the people want to make sure they got their place in a show. The options that explain how they would do it are given below.\n1. Their previous experience- There is no mention of previous experience in the options, although there is no direct contradiction.\n2. Their name- This does not seem to be appropriate since there is no mention of name in this question.\n3. Their talent- This directly and explicitly refers to their skills, which was not the question stated.\n4. Their recommendation- This directly refers to a letter of recommendation, which is a form of recommendation.\n5. Their friends- This does not directly refer to their friends, there is no mention of it anywhere.\n6. There is no negative statement against option \u2018E: their friends\u2019 so it can still be considered as a possible answer.\n7. The correct answer must be \u201cD: their recommendation\u201d as this means they used a letter to explain why they deserve a place in a show.\nSo the answer is D: their recommendation\n\nInput: John has a better sense of what?

The Library: It seems like the best one for him because the library is a place where study/ reading is done. \n8. A: James would want to find place where he can focus on his work as he need to spend most of his time on his report today.\n9. B: In addition, the library has quiet study areas where students can concentrate on their work.\n10. Therefore, the answer is \"A: library\" because it combines the best of both places, a quite place & study area.\nSo the answer is A: library\n\nInput:The word \"in\" usually means \"not\" in what kind of sentence? Choices:  a. negative b. positive c. interrogative d. imperative e. all of the above\nOutput:1. The word \"in\" usually indicates the opposite of it.\n2.

Choices:  a) mimic b) imitate c) look like d) be reminiscent of e) be similar to\nOutput:1. \" resemble\" means \"have the same features as\" or \"look like\"\n2. \"resemble\" does not require the subject of \"look like\" to have the exact same features as it.\n3. \"reserve\" means \"hold back\".\n4. \"relish\" means \"take great pleasure in something, especially when tasting food\"\n5. \"remark\" means \"make an interesting or unusual comment, typically on a person or situation\".\n6. \"reprieve\" means a respite or postponement of something, especially a legal penalty.\n7. \"relay\" can be a noun or a verb.\nAs an adjective or noun, \"relay\" means \"bring about or transmit (information) from one person or thing by or to another", "answer": "E: library"}
{"text": "1.\"Steakhouse\", as implied by the question mark, refers to a restaurant specializing in cooking steaks. \n2. \"outside of South\", implies that there is an inner South where James would be living.\n3. Therefore, the only possible location for \"best steakhouse\" is within the South, excluding James being at \"dairy farm\", \"Texas\", \"building\" and \"Michigan\".\n4. Option \"Florida\" is located outside the South, but it's unlikely that he would be in a restaurant outside of the best possible South.\n5. \"South\" and \"Steakhouse\" seem to be important factors in the question, as without it being in the Southern United States it would be unlikely that this steakhouse is \"the best\".  Thus, it is reasonable to conclude the final answer to be E: Florida.\nSo the final  answer is E: Florida\n\nInput: When we make food we usually make too much for ourselves, and eat the rest with what? Choices: A: the family B: a friend C: nobody D: a date E: someone\nOutput: 1: When we make food, we always make, by default, more than we need. \n2. This over-supply can be \"ate\" meaning eaten by the maker, but this doesn't directly apply to the question.\n3. Option \"a Friend\", could apply to a scenario where a friend came and the maker made more than they asked for, but this is outside the stated parameters of the question.\n4. The remaining options \"b\"-\"d\" have their implications for the remaining options, as it's specified we can eat it with someone else.\n5.

{"text": "1 The question is asking what activity was good for the friends to get involved in. \n2 The options presented are all different things that the friends could be involved in.\n3 It is suggested, by the usage of \"friends loved competing\" that \"A: friendship\" would be an appropriate choice.\n4 However, if friendship is the only choice, why would they need to compete to build their friendship; surely, friendship can simply be built. This does not support the scenario.\n5 This leaves \"C: aggression\" as potential candidate, however aggression can be simply destructive in a relationship, and it is best to eliminate aggression from the question.\n6 The statement \"work their victory or defeat\" makes obvious that the friends do not want to be involved in aggression, and \"competing to defeat one another\" is not a good way to get closer friends.\n7 So, the answer must be \"Work their sweat\". This is because the question asks them to work for a victory or defeat, or win or lose. Sweat is the only option that is a requirement for this, and it is also the only option that is not destructive to a relationship.\nSo the final conclusion is that: \n7 The answer must be \"Work sweat\". This is only because the question asks them, to work for a victory that is the only option that requires the sweating and is not destructive to the relationship. It is also the only option because the statement \"work their victory\", makes the question that they do not want to simply get involved in aggression. That also indicates that \"Competing to defeat one another: is not a good way of getting closer, but sweat to defeat is the only option left for them.\n\n---\n## [B-26] The New York Times (Medium - Hard) \n### Title: New York Times\n\n\n\n\n\n###### Keywords:  New York Times, Medium, Hard, Logic, CAT, Wordplay, Coding Interview, Codeforces, Hackerrank, Hashnode, Interview, Question & Answer", "answer": "B: aggression"}
{"text": "1) The correct answer is E: Row boat. 2) The options available are: A: Turn Away, B: Let Down, C: Have To Sleep, D: Run, and E: Row Boat. 3) This question asks \"What Type of Water Transportation is Human Powered\", the options provide some type of water transportation, so \"Let Down\" is eliminated. \"Turn Away\" is eliminated because it is a verb not a water transportation. \"Run\" is eliminated because although it is a type of water transportation (i.e. canoe), it is not human powered. \"Have To Sleep\" suggests the idea of taking a nap, not taking a water transportation. This leaves us with \"Row Boat\" and \"Row Boat\" is the solution. 4) In order to answer this question, we need to identify the verb of the options available. The verb \"Rowing\" can be used to provide power to a water transportation like the rowing of a \"Row Boat\". Thus, Row Boat must be selected. 5) What is the opposite of Rowing? This question can be better answered by a related question, that is, \"What is the opposite of Water Transportation?\". The options available are Water Transportation (Water Boat), Turn Away (Row Boat), Let Down (Turn Away), Have To Sleep (Both), and Run (Both). From this, it can be deduced that Rowing is opposite of Water Transportation, Run is opposite of Have To Sleep, and rowing is the opposite of Turn Away.\nSo the final question is \"What is the opposite/replacement for Row Boat\" and the correct answer is \"Turn Away\"\n\nInput: The best-selling book \"The Shining\" is a horror tale that tells the story about what?

{"text": "1) The question states that what the customers in a store do. It's clear that they spend money by purchasing products, but the question doesn't directly ask about this activity. Also, the term \"spend money\" isn't used.\n2) This narrows down the options to hunt, mail, pay merchants and demand satisfaction. \"Spend money\" and \"pay merchants\" would only occur if the merchants were given money.\n3) The sentence structure is unclear as to whether the customers do these things first or last. A good way to solve this is to test for specificity.\n4) When we go to the shelves, we first demand (the staff respond by handing over the item for free), then we spend money (the cashier scans the item at the checkout). Then if we get change, we also spend money, which we give to the merchant.\n5) However, this is not the case for mailing an order. We demand satisfaction first (by contacting the company directly), second we mail the order and finally we pay merchants. \n6) Thus, we can exclude \"mail order\" because it does not follow this sequence.\n3) Now, we are left with \"hunt\" and \"demand satisfaction\". However, we can eliminate \"hunt\" as the sentence structure does not allow for it.\n4) Hence, the final answer is \"D: demand satisfaction\", because it is the only activity listed that fits the general structure of \"first paying merchants and then spending money (too late to mail an order)\".\nSo the final answer to this is D: demand satisfaction\n\nInput: Why does the author of the book \"Courage to Change\" insist that we can't make a difference?

Choice A: \"airplane\", is expensive for shipping goods, since airfare is very expensive.\n3. \"Airplane\" might actually be the fastest method for sending small cargo, but it is by no means inexpensive.\n4. Choice C: \"boat\", is one of the most expensive ways to ship products, especially for smaller, more compact cargos.\n5. \"Boat\" might be an effective transportation method, especially for longer distances, but it is not necessarily the fastest or most affordable way, and it is not effective at all for small cargos.\n6. Choice D: \"truck\", is a cheap method for transporting small cargos, as it only costs about 6 USD to ship something via truck between cities.\n7. However, it is not the fastest method, as it would take several days to ship small cargos via truck.\n8. Therefore, the correct answer must be E: train, since it is both the fastest and the most affordable option, making it the most effective method for shipping small cargo.\nSo the final answers is E: train\n\nInput: The more things you own, the more _____ you have.

Liquor is not a \"useful activity\" to those who experience lonesome; nor can it \"meet a need\", which is not a requirement to be considered \"useful\".\n5. \"socialize\" could be useful to those who don't currently feel lonely, but cannot be used to combat loneliness.\n6.

Choices: A: case B: table C: shelf D: desk E: cupboard\nOutput: 1) The Bookcase is solid - it is dense, stable, strong, stiff or 'hard'. 'Bookcase' is only the physical product, 'case' is its verb conjugate and is used as a transitive verb - so E is the only option that makes sense.\n2) 'Stiff' = inflexible, 'Firm' like in a Firm case, 'Solid' like wooden chairs.\n3) Like in B: A shelf is a 'flat horizontal thing used for shops or a storage place near a wall', C: Shelf is not used in its noun form, 'Desk is used as an office accessory and is not the same level as bookcase.\nSo the final conclusion is E: Shelf.\n\nInput: The only difference between the two dogs is that one has short legs and the other has a shaggy what?

However, none of the first three are likely to be suitable for Sam, as they would entail a financial or logistical cost that he might not be prepared to or able to bear.\n4. Furthermore, they have no implications that would indicate an emotional state of loneliness or feeling trapped.\n5. Thus we can conclude that options C and D are the most likely to fit the scenario, as they reflect the emotional state of the character.\n6.

{"text": "1: We know that the person who sits at the center of a table receives guests at a wedding, so the question must refer to the wedding reception rather than the wedding itself, because a reception does not have a church basement.\n2 and 5: The other choices are specific contexts that would be attended by restorant, church basement, and corridor, but there is no reason to assume that they must be present and relevant to the answer at the reception as the question is asking who sits at the  center table.\n3: Wedding party would receive each other, but we already know who the person at the center of a wedding would be: the bride and groom.\n4: The person at the center of the table at a reception must be a significant and influential guest, so church cannot be present, because \"wedding party\" would be receiving and it should not be confused with \" wedding reception\". Also \"church basement\" would be irrelevant in a wedding reception.\n6: We can discount the corridor as the wedding reception.\n\n\nSo the final answer to the question is \"A: The Restorand\" as the center table would receive the restorand at the wedding reception, which is someone who works at a restaurant or is an established guest at a fine dining restaurant- not a wedding party or wedding itself.", "answer": "B: wedding party"}
{"text": "1: The first thing you need to identify here is that this is a question on the definition of KFC. It's not a question on its service or any of their products, which they are famous for. So the answer has to be from that category... 2: It is interesting to note that KFC started as a chicken restaurant with many outlets. However, as time went by, other products were added to their menus (and still others removed) so that now chicken is just one of many things served at KFC. 3: This is why a dictionary is not enough to define KFC. A dictionary will simply list the words and their meanings, and that will hardly suffice, because as any fast food business goes, customers will want to know what else is on the menu rather than a definition of the name only.", "answer": "A: fast food restaurant"}
{"text": "1: The question gives us a choice set that covers every possible scenario within which a person will not be able to get sleep. \n2. It can be eliminated that option A: relax is not the answer because the question does not focus on what actually keeps a person awake, but the reason they're unable to sleep.\n3. Option B: dreams is an alternative reason people don't get sleep, but if so, then they wouldn't be asked 'what prevents someone from getting sleep' as the answer is already implied.\n4. Option C: have nightmaras is probably not the right option, because nightmaras aren't an actual thing, as they're 'bad dreams', or dreams that are not so pleasant. \n5. Option D: restlessness isn't the correct answer. If a person is so restless that can't sleep, they probably wouldn't be in this situation.\n6. It's left in the form of'someone', rather than 'the person'. So, the answer can't be one person. This eliminates option E: snored.\n7. Therefore the answer must be D: have nightmaras as this will prevent them from getting sleep.\nSo final answer is: D: Have nightmaras\n\nInput: Which one of these animals is considered to be intelligent. Choices:  A. Dolphin B. Cat C. Dog D. Donkey E. Cockroach\nOutput: 1, The question asks us to choose from various animals; so it's not about 'one of these'.\n2, The question then asks for the one we consider intelligent. The word 'intelligent' here refers to a high level of reasoning or thought. \n3, Therefore, it's not about physical features as the animal is 'intelligent'. \n4, So, it can't be a dog(a.k.a. 'Man's best friend').\n\n5, Next, the animal can't be a cat, as the word 'intelligent'here can't be directly compared to something like 'playful'.\n\n6, An animal like a donkey, or a dolphin(although both are intelligent) can be excluded from the answer as they don't refer to a high level of comprehension and critical thinking.", "answer": "D: restlessness"}
{"text": "10.\n2. The question is asking why John was feeling agony. This is shown by the fact that \"buying products for his swolen testicles\" caused him to feel agony.\n3. John felt agony because of what he had done- \"buying products for testicles swollen\".\n4. \"Testicles swollen\" does not appear anywhere in the question, which is a red herring.\n5. The phrase, \"buying products for\" implies that what John bought were products and not items, products being more specific than items.\n6. The context suggests something related to the body and health, so we can eliminate \"Bankruptcy\" \"Delight\" \"Pleasure\", as these mean either \"the condition of suffering extreme poverty\" or \"a source of happiness, pleasure, or amusement\" or \"to bring pleasure or satisfaction\" from dictionary source(s).\n7. This leaves \"Agony\" and \"Owning\", which does not directly mean \"something that causes pain\" or \"to suffer pain\".\n8. So, if we are to follow context, we could also rule out \"Owning\" for this same reason.\n9. Finally, we are left with \"Agony\", which is the correct answer.\nSo the final question is John spent too much money bu\u2026", "answer": "D: agony"}

A second look, however, and it becomes clear that people may compete against someone to better their skills. Therefore, you can't say for certain that it has to be a friendship or a rivalry.\n3. B: desire to win is a suitable answer. \"Desire\" indicates that people can compete without the need for a rival.\n4. C: friendship is not directly related to winning competitions, even though it may affect the rivalry between them.\n5. D: rivalry is an appropriate word as it suggests a competition between people.\n6. E: skill is a suitable answer that may relate to competitions, although it might not be one of the key factors.\n7. Therefore- the final answer is D.\nSo the final\nanswer is D: rivalry\n\nInput: A: a little or in small quantities B: a lot and without stopping C: much more than nowadays D: without any doubt E: many times larger\nOutput: 1 A) a little or in small quantity sounds weird since \"in small quantity\" implies there is something in a quantity, but if there is nothing then it is in zero quantity or in nothing.\n\n2 B) a lot, and without stopping says that without stopping is related to a lot and a lot here means \"a lot\", not \"a few\".\n\n3 C) this answer is not correct because \"much more than nowadays\" can mean there is too much more than expected. We cannot say no way that it is too much as much means the same. Therefore, it should be \"much fewer than nowadays\".\n\n4 D) without any doubt is not relevant to the question.\n\n5 E) many times larger isn't an answer, because it is not only a quantity but it is larger compared to something else.\n\nSo the final answer\nis C without\nany doubt that it is\nmuch fewer than\nnowadays.\n\n### Instruction:Answer the\nquestion that follows.

{"text": "1.\" Three quarters of what are...\" is the question, and suggests that the surface of the earth is not covered by the ocean.\n2. The question states that three-quarters are covered by the ocean, so this will be the highest number quoted.\n3. \"Waterfalls\" and \"Beach\" are the wrong answer because neither can receive three-quarters of the total being mentioned.\n4. \"Underwater\" and \"River\" contradict the statement that three-quarters are what, making them wrong answers.\n5. Therefore, the only relevant answers are A: waterfalls and D: beaches.\n\nInput: A large percentage of our country is what?

The percentage of desert is often more than the wilderness. \n5: In fact, the deserts in the USA cover almost half of the whole area of the country. \n6: So we can eliminate \"Beach\" from the options. \n7: Mountains usually take quite a large percentage of the whole of a country. 1/3 of Africa is desert, there is mountain and savannah. \n8: If mountain takes 1/3 or 2/3 of the whole, the rest is what?

We can immediately eliminate the two incorrect options as they are not places where people regularly go to watch movies.\n4. \"The bathroom\", while a place for viewing, is not a place where people go to watch a movie.\n5. The \"conference\", being an event with movies, can be used as a place to see them but is rarely the first or oftenest place one would go after their release.\n6. So we can rule out C: Bathroom and D: Theater.\n7. \"The town\" and \"The theater\" are both places where people often watch movies.  The theater is the first place most people go to watch movies so it is the most likely option among the choices given.\n8. So the answer must be A:\"The town\".\nSo the final answer", "answer": "D: theater"}

'Chair' refers to items of furniture commonly found within rooms of chairs, so no more options are suitable.\n6.

The same is the case with some options \"Auto repair shop\" and \"Kitchen.\"\n6. So, we have to select those options which are suitable for \"Treats for kids\", and provide them \"Over the counter\".\n7.

The choices are listed in a way to imply that you should be able to pick them out by analyzing the content of the sentence.\n4). You could easily pick out two choices, and eliminate three others as inappropriate based on the information given and the context.\n5). Food here refers to \"nutritious\" meals.\n6). People considering an item of food \"good for your health,\" for tastebuds, or for taste and health may be referring to a \"balanced\" meal.\n7). This would suggest the choices \"bad for you\" and \"bad for taste and health\" are more apt. \n8). Bad for you or bad for taste and health should both refer to foods for which we normally judge a bad outcome.\n9). Food that causes bad effects can also be a bad experience for tastebuds- \"bad for tastebuds.\"\n10).

This can be narrowed down to options B, D and E.\n3. These answer choices are about geography, and do not contain the word plain.\n4. Option B: landscape should be eliminated because, although it may be a 'landscape' that is described as plain, it is more likely that it is the artist's 'landscape' (i.e. painting) that is described in that way.\n5. Option D: countryside also should be eliminated, as this could simply mean that the artist is from \"the country\" (or rural region), without any association with plain style.\n6. Option E: middle america is perhaps an area of the country that is not seen to require much colour, however, it is also a place name, not a style of painting.\n7. This leaves us with one option: option B: east side. This answer choice makes perfect sense as it would be a region (albeit with a specific meaning, referring to certain side, as with the east side) whose nature/geography is seen as plain. It can also be read about elsewhere as it is not necessarily associated with the artist's work.\n8.

The word \"grocer\" is associated with a type of store that sells groceries. \n3. The word \"refrigerator\" refers to household appliances that are used for food preservation.  \n4. The word \"avoid\" suggests an attempt to prevent, or hinder the occurrence of, a particular thing, so option A: grocery must be eliminated from the choice of answer because it is where vegetables are bought.\n5. Option C: plate is not possible because Jim owns vegetables. An empty plate is placed in order to receive vegetables for eating, but one cannot place vegetables on the plate and keep it in a supermarket or fridge.

The word \u201cfreezer\u201d refers to a mechanical device that is used to preserve food, including vegetables, by freezing it.

The police man can still wave the flare despite of the danger he is experiencing.\n\n5.

B: arrest; The phrase \"convicted of a crime\" means that someone has been found guilty of a crime. This would be a mistake on the side of the arresting authority to assume such a person is guilty and to arrest them.  Furthermore, a judge has already conducted this trial, and someone was convicted.  So, if this was the case, it is unlikely that this person would be on trial again.  This option is also excluded because it is too literal.\n5. C: bring in ver: The phrase \"convicted in a crime\" means that a convict has already been convicted in a crime, but what is being asked by the question is what it is that a judge does once this happens.  This option is not suitable to describe this scenario.\n6. D: pass sentence: The phrase \"convict\" refers to someone who has been found guilty of breaking the law.\n7. A judge, by contrast, is responsible for ensuring that justice is properly served, and has nothing to do with convictions.\n8. So, this does not answer the question.\n9. E: serve justice: This has nothing to do with a trial or conviction of a crime.\n10.

[hospital] also may not be the best choice either because, [hospital] may be known as a place where disease, especially infection is spread- but [hospital] also has many measures in place that prevent disease and infection from being spread, so you should be safe as long as you have the proper hygiene.\n6. A great reason choice to choose is A, [ghost town] if disease is present, you will only find it in the bodies of people who died there, such as diseased corpse. \n7. So the final answer is A: ghost town\n\nInput: There's only one solution and it's not the same as what this is what?

Similarly, __C__ does not follow the correct structure of matching exactly with what this specific situation is.\n4.\"__D__the wrong plan\". [The wrong plan] is just an addition to the structure and does not change the situation.\n5.\"__E__other people's solutions\" is another addition to the structure that is not necessarily the same solution.\nSo the final Answer is A: this exact situation\n\nInput: How is the human race like ants?

Choices: A: no animals were to be allowed  B: no trash was to be allowed  C: no talking to anyone was allowed  D: no dancing was allowed  E: no singing in the street  F: no alcohol was to be allowed  G: no sleeping was to be allowed\nOutput: 1.\"One of the important rules he [sic]: laid down was\", so the meaning is 'A particular rule that someone has imposed'.\n2. \"Alcohol\" contradicts this since alcohol is forbidden in a place where it's legal.\n3. 'Sleeping' sounds strange since you typically need to be sleeping all night, not in a particular short amount of time.\n4. 'Trash' and 'dancing' have nothing to do with nightlife, and also, dancing in the street probably would not cause anyone to break an important rule.\n5. So, the correct answer is 'D: no dancing was to be allowed'.\nSo the final answe is D: no dancing \n\n\n\nInput: At the beginning of the 20th century, there was serious conflict between which two countries?

So definitely E (the last sentence of the option).\n2: State park is the most appropriate option: People visiting state parks would buy snacks such as popcorn, cotten candy etc. so that they would feel good. They would enjoy their meals at the parks, making it safe. The question mentions 'in the countryside', which means in the parks (because 'in the countrysisde' would mean in the countryside area rather than inside the park!)\n3: The question does not actually ask where the person might be, but rather where he is likely to be. The question should have been: Where was the person likely to find popcorn and cotton candy on a grassy area?\n4:: The answer cannot be (A, B or D) This is pretty obvious.\n5: Therefore, the answer would be: E, which would be the logical choice!\n\nInput: The batsman had been fielding his team from when he came down to bat?

It is clear from the context of retirement and dismissal that a batman can be a field player.\n3.: The word 'from' can be replaced with 'off.'\n4.: The question asks whether or not he was off when he came down to the bat. It could be inferred that since he might have been facing danger in the field, he chose to come down to bat and be safe.

{"text": "1.\"In war, your primary use is to combat\", in other words, your main tactic in combat. \n2. Analyzing the rest of the options, \"To conquer opponent\" seems to imply the purpose of battling rather than the outcome of the war as the question states that the main goal is not the outcome of combat.\n3. \"To fight enemy\" likewise implies battling, so we disregard it.\n4.\"To join army\" may not be a method, although it is a process of reaching war as a whole.\n5.\"To kill\" does not answer the question of the main goal of war itself.\n6.Hence, the answer must be either \"B: fight enemy\" or \"D: kill\". Therefore, we choose to accept \"B: fight enemy\", because \"fighting enemy\" means to defeat or to cause damage or injury to an opponent.\nSo the final answers are either B: fight enemy or D: kill\n\nInput:They decided to start all over after his death.   Was he what? Choices: A: alive B: deceased C: dead D: alive-deceased E: alive-dead\nOutput: 1\"They decided to start all the process over after his death\", as seen in the use of the term \"process\". So, it is unlikely that he was something other than alive and dead, given how they came to make this decision.2.Analysing the remaining choices we can further narrow it down. An example of someone who may not be alive would be deceased, as they are not present in one's existence anymore.\n3.\"Dead and alive-deceased\" refers to an existence prior to death.\n4. \"Dead\" is one of the remaining options. However, for the purposes of this question, we can rule this out too. This is because if \"he\" is dead, it wouldn't be necessary to start all over. The same applies to \"Alive-deceased\".\n5.\"Alive/Dead\" is probably the only remaining choice as both options relate to someone being alive, but only alive-deceased is more specific than just being alive.\n6.His death being the cause of this decision, combined with the fact that \"alive or dead\" doesn't give us much information from the context and \"Alive-dead\"", "answer": "A: conquer opponent"}
{"text": "1) A: \"Read\" refers to the action of someone consuming the material, thus we would seek for a place where someone could \"read\" but not write which is clearly \"bookstore\" as a store is defined as a place for buying a product.\n2) Another option for an alternative for \"read\" is \"look through the passage\" thus we seek for a place where \"looking through\" is possible and not writing.\n3) Now it is clear that the word \"not\" is present in the statement which would limit the options to places where we can't write the passage. This can only be a place where writing is not possible or a restricted place where you don't have the permission to write and can only look or read.\n4) This makes church the only place where we can look or read a passage but not writing or not being able to write. Another option is a court.\n5) The statements asks where you read a passage and not write it. Hence the answer would be church as a church is a place where you go to read a passage but can't write it.\nSo the correct answer is C: Church\n\nInput: How many times can a person change his or her name before passing through a third legal name change?

The two options, \"Two ears\" and \"One head\", each have a strong possibility of being the correct answer.\n6) \"Two ears\" may have a lot more truth to it than \"One head\", but in spite of the two being the most obvious choices, there are still some logical deductions to be made.\n7) The first is that \"Two ears\" are not what the question asks (or rather states); instead, it merely asks for what humans have. Thus, the answer given must be \"E: One head with two ears\".\nSo the final answer will be E: One head with two ear\n\nInput:Which of the following is the most difficult step in completing a Rubik's Cube?

The question seems straightforward at first, but upon further inspection we can see that all five choices are equally difficult in their own ways: All edge pieces must be rotated, all center pieces must be rotated and all corner pieces must be rotated. None of these steps can be completed until the previous steps have been completed.\n2.) Therefore, the first step is the first step, so \"One\" is the correct answer.\nSo the final step will be the First Step", "answer": "B: two ears"}

{"text": "1) The question is asking about people who put on make-up as a way to express themselves and achieve a particular outcome.\n2) The choices include pleasing one's self, getting compliments, and having interesting experiences.\n3) Option B does not reflect the correct answer because it is incomplete. People who get a high rate of compliments after putting on makeup are unlikely to do so to feel pleasure, but pleasure is still part of their goal. Furthermore, the objective to feel great has nothing to do with the act of putting on makeup.\n4) Option C is less about putting on make-up as an expression of oneself and more about getting other people's opinion. \"Compliments\" is a byproduct of the goal to look attractive and is not the same as looking attractive.\n5) Hence, we can rule out Option A because it does not refer to what is the most likely goal for people who put on makeup which is to look attractive. Option B refers to being complimented, which is by-product of looking attractive.\n6) The same argument is used against Option D as putting on makeup for the purpose of gaining interesting experiences does not mean that one necessarily looks attractive.\n7) Thus, the only option that makes sense is Option E, which refers to the act of putting on the make-up itself and the result of looking attractive. Hence, \"look attractive\" is the closest option to what is the likely goal of people who put on make up.\nSo the final option is E: look attractive\n\n---\n\u00a92022 <a href=\"mailto:info@codelicious.com\">Codelicious</a>", "answer": "B: look attractive"}

D: Yard is an option for a horse to live but, as the sentence indicates the location is likely an area in Arizona, horse yards cannot be located in Arizona.\n5.

So, A- Its super sweet would not be the correct answer as it would not be about the ice cream, but its nutritional value.\n4. Option B- Its really thick would not be appropriate because it is the ice cream that is thick and not what the ice cream is about.\n5.

The options suggest that all of them can be followed to avoid a consequence, so the answer must be one that provides a consequence that can be avoided.\n5. We can eliminate options A: shoes and B: wet ground. \n6. A could be answered by saying, \"In the rain, not to get wet.\" but this doesn't provide a meaningful consequence that can be avoided (i.e. is just advice.)\n7. Option B is irrelevant as the focus here is on walking barefoot rather than walking in shoes.\n8. Option C, although relevant, can be explained more simply by a consequence such as to avoid a cold, i.e. it would just be said, \"Don't get soaked.\"\n9. Option D: water garden is irrelevant as it provides a scenario for getting soaked (walking in a garden), not a solution to why one shouldn't get soaked while walking barefoot in the rain.\n10. Option E: water garden also could not be selected as an answer choice, as the question states \"walk bare\" rather than \"walk in water.\" \n11.

We should choose the option that seems to be \"the best thing money can buy\".\n\n2. The best thing cannot be obtained from money alone, as it is something beyond the scope of mere materialism.\n\n3.

The game has never been in Lisbon, so this option is incorrect. 6. Finally, we are asking how 1582 could watch in Madrid, but a city does not have eyes. So our answer must be E which is \"Madrid\".\n\n##Input: A: As you grow older, you will realize how stupid B: You're young and will probably learn from C: It seems to me that you are young and stupid D: You seem to be very young and stupid E: You have lived a long time\nOutput: 1:\"As you grow older", "answer": "B: bamboo grove"}
{"text": "1: The phrase `where was the apple tree said`, implies that there was more than one apple tree.

Thus, they can be eliminated.\n3: Option C `nil` literally means `never` so this too is excluded.\n4: Option D `Great outdoors` literally means `forest` thus, it does not qualify as a place of forbidden fruit.\n5: Hence, option E `garden of eden` must be correct for it is a specific location described in the bible as the location of forbidden fruit.", "answer": "E: garden of eden"}
{"text": "1.The question is asking what Billy's mother may have yelled at him. The answer should be descriptive enough to suit all possible scenarios.\n2.We start by eliminating options that are too specific. As we eliminate them, we should choose according to the common denominator.\n3. If you follow the logic of the sentence with this mindset, you would only be left with option E \"fairgrounds\".\n4. The sentence starts with \"Billy's mother..\" followed by \"tripped over\" which means there was more than one object she tripped over. So there must be a reason for her choice between the options she could have tripped on and she has to do with \"stuffed animals\".\n5. \"A \"stuffed animal\" may be a toy, but the word in the sentence is used as a place where the children store those toys. So it is a \"stuffed animal store\". Hence we can eliminate B \"toy store\" as well.\n6. Option C \"hall\" is eliminated as there is no specific location mentioned in the context.\n7. Option D: \"amusement park\" doesn't seem to be the choice she would make.\n8. Hence we have a final option as E \"fairground\".\nSo the final answer would be E: fairground\n\nInput:Jeff gave the dog an alien chaser.  After eating it, the dog was completely stoned.

{"text": "1 - The first key indicator that the question may be a trick question is when it states: \"What are adult people usually *expected* to do?\" and the fact that the options can be used as both action verbs and adjectives suggests that the answer may not be as straightforward as one might think.\n2 - The options given seem somewhat contradictory, e.g. \"own\" implies responsibility while \"shake hands\" would indicate a non-binding agreement etc.\n3 - Thus, it is reasonable to expect that the correct option must be \"c\" - which is a noun referring to \"bills\", these are responsibilities that adults are expected to act upon while the other options may be things that adults are *normally* expected to be capable of, such as \"talking\", \"paying\" etc.\n4 - Option \"c\" may seem unappealing, however option \"b\" is used as a noun referring to ownership but used as an adjective meaning that adult people should be willing to take responsibility for things they have a degree of control over \"own property\" whereas it would be incorrect to describe adults as \"owning\" things which is option \"A\"\nSo the final answer should be C: pay bills\n\nInput: What does the word \"e.g.\" stand for?

In the sentence, the right choice is getting in line.\n7. Dan said that getting in line is the best choice because it will result in doing the right thing (getting in line). \n8.

The two did not have to what? Choices A: die because they were saved B: die because the water was only 5 feet deep C: die because of cold water D: die because they could have drowned E: die because they wanted to be saved\nOutput: 1.\"If they had not been saved\" means \"if they did not escape from death\". \n2. \"Knew that they would die\" means \"knew that escape was impossible\". \n3. Therefore, \"they did not have to\" cannot mean \"they could not\", but it must mean the opposite because without a rescue, these two would have escaped from death.\n4. The remaining options cannot answer the question as \"die\" is an unavoidable end result.\n5. Thus, \"because of cold water\" should be the answer if the two did not want to be saved, so the two did not die from cold. \n6. Otherwise, it must be \"The two did not have to die because they could have been saved\". \n7. Otherwise, they would have escaped from death if not rescued.\nSo the final choice was E: die because they could be saved", "answer": "B: less confusion"}
{"text": "1.. The question is asking us which long saga we will be watching on TV. Long saga can refer to epic adventure, story or play(opera, drama, etc). So this is how A.

Option B: opera can also be a long saga like any classic plays (Drama, comedy), the same applies for long plays (Comedy, thriller). Same case for option E: TV.

{"text": "1) The sentence expresses the problem of a question.\n2. We can eliminate all options that are not logical.\n3. We can exclude \"A: table\" because silverware will not go on the table until after they are used.\n4. The usage of the word \"after\" means that \"table\" would not be an option.\n5. The question refers to a situation in which silverware is not dry and can not be \"After\" the situation in the question.\n6. We can remove \"B: restaurant\" because the description states \"silverware\" and \"after they've dried\" so would not go into a restaurant. \"Silverware\" is also stated to have not been used (dry) and be ready to be used (clean from dry), which implies that silverware wouldn't be ready to go in a restaurant.\n7. The option for \"C: cupboard\" is not a logical answer because silverware is being asked to be located where it doesn't go after it has been used.\n8. If the option were \"D: kitchen and \"E: sink\" then this would not be the case of what is presented in the question as after they are dry but not used as it would be placed there after it had been used.\n9.

It is an emotion that is rarely a result of playing football.\n3. \"Pain\" and \"Death\" conveys a consequence to playing football, and the sentence is \"Getting hurt\" and the question is 'how do you feel'. So option E, the given answer, is incorrect.\n4. C: \"Getting hurt\" is a phrase that directly suggests a physical effect due to playing football, without conveying an in-depth detail on the feeling caused.\n5. \"Get hurt\" is a shorter version of \"getting hurt\" that is the closest fit to the scenario specified- getting hurt, without an implication of \"What do you feel from getting hurt?\"\n6. So, we can conclude that option D, \"Get hurt\" is the correct answer.\nSo the final correct answer for the question is D: \"get hurt\" because it is the shortest way to represent the scenario specified of 'getting hurt'\n\nInput:The clown wore clothes that were too big for him because he wanted to look what?

{"text": "1.The question asks us to determine what benefit was gained from finding someone ugly in comparison to being the only one who isn't ugly in a group.\n2.\n\"Knowing he wouldn't be sticking out\" indicates that sticking out was something that would generally be seen as a negative; something unpleasant or detrimental.\n3.Options A & B are not relevant, because \"gorgeous\" and \"handsome\" do not imply a negative meaning that is equivalent to'sticking out'.\n4. \"Pleasing\" might appear to be a relevant term for describing someone as ugly, however it is not relevant in this context as it's referring to someone or something being attractive and pleasant.\n5. Therefore, \"glorious\" and \"glad to be\" seem unlikely choices as well, as they aren't related to any negative connotations.\n6. So the choices of relevance are \"glorious\" and 'glad to be'.\n7. 'Glad to be' is an expression used when someone is happy to be around someone who is more attractive than themselves, as opposed to feeling embarrassed or uncomfortable around them.\n8. Hence, the options available are 'glorious' (not relevant in this context) and 'glad to'.\n9.\n\"knowing he wouldn't stick out\" cannot be a valid option as sticking out would be a negative in this case.\n10.\nSo the final alternative is indeed \"glad to be\".\n11.\nHence,\n\nSo the final answer  is :\nGlad to be", "answer": "C: pleasing"}

Medium does not seem to be an appropriate response, as it suggests a relaxed and casual situation, which is in contrast to the fact that the phrase, \"a formal place,\" implies that the venue is serious and formal.\n6.

{"text": "1) The phrase \"that is not common\" is very critical to the question, and is necessary in order to determine the answer.\n2). Option A: special doesn't indicate the recipient of the gift feels anything unique about the gift, just that it is important to them.\n3). Option B: personal is irrelevant since it has nothing to do with the gift.\n4). \"unique\" is also a word which expresses that the gift is different from others, this too doesn't express that someone would feel any particular emotion.\n5). Option D: \"Unique\" is a very similar choice, but unlike A & B, it seems unreasonable to assume the recipient of the unique gift feels an emotion, they probably are just thinking of the gift, not feeling a particular way about it.\n6). Option E: \"Rare\" refers to something that happens rarely, but it does not imply that the item itself will cause an emotional response in the recipient.\n7). So, in order to fully understand the question, one must look deeper at the critical phrase \"that is not commonly available\". \n8). This phrase implies that something which is common isn't very special or unique, it just means that it is widespread and thus easy to obtain.\n9). In this light, the recipient is likely to feel any particular emotion, just that they are more likely to be happy if it is something they usually don't get and it was just given to them.\n10). The answer will therefore be an emotion, and so, it must be an emotion that is generated when one doesn't expect to receive the gift, or has it in high regard (C): \"offended\". \n11). \"Offended\" means to be outraged, indignant, offended, or resentful of an affront or insult.

{"text": "1) The question is essentially asking where fungus could be found on milk product-related objects; biology laboratories and shower stalls are irrelevant here.\n2) \"Old cheese\" is a milk product, but by definition 'old' implies its rotted, which eliminates it from being an option.\n3) \"Decaying matter\" could be symbolic of fungus growth- however, the key phrase here is 'on something made from milk'. If the object is'made from' milk it will still contain it. This effectively eliminates \"Decaying matter\".\n4) The term 'Fungus' is specifically defined with'something made of milk' so, by extension, all answers contain this.\n5) \"Eyes\" are irrelevant- the question seeks to determine where fungus would grow, not physically grow within them.\n6) Lastly, we are essentially left with the following options: \"Biology laboratory\" and \"Something made from milk\". \n7) So, there is only one viable option here: \"Something made from milk\"\n8) This would be a milk-related item, such as a cup, jar, or vial, all of which would be consistent with the definition of fungus required here.\n9) Therefore, the answer is \"Something made from milk\", which could be a cup, jar, vial, or even a cheese slice!\nSo the final answer in this question is \"Something made from Milk\"\n\nInput: What should a person wear to impress others as being sophisticated?

{"text": "1\"Where would a metal rod be found in most people's (preferred) method of transportation?\" suggests that we need to identify a component of a method of transportation that would have the metal rod.\n2\"Most people\" suggests that \"us\" and people like us are intended. The intended answers are thus relevant to the question, in other words, they need to be commonly used transportation methods among most people.\n3. The options \"airplane\" and \"construction site\" refer to large vehicles and in general would not be travelled by most people. So the answer choices need to be relevant to transportation among people, in a sense, incapable of transporting the metal rod.\n4. \"Shop\" is excluded by the fact that the use of the metal rod is not described in the question.\n5. \"Engine\" is a component of a vehicle, whereas the metal rod would be found in larger pieces of equipment.\n6. \"Broken bone\" is a biological organ, which contradicts the questions aim to find metal rods. So the answer to this question would be \"C: Shop\"\nSo the final answer for this question is C: Shop\n\nInput: It wasn't easy to follow the arguments for several days because of what I assumed to be the cause of the problem? Choices:  a: bad English b: bad grammar c: poor explanations d: poor reasoning e: poor writing\nOutput: 1 \"It wasn't easy to understand the arguments for several days\" means that we need the cause for difficulty in understanding arguments, as stated by the sentence itself.\n2 Options \"A\" and \"B\" are not correct as the question is asking for the cause(s) of difficulties in understanding arguments.\n3. \"C: Poor Explanations\" means that explanation of arguments weren't sufficient, however in the sentence the cause for difficulties in understanding arguments is not mentioned.\n4. Similarly, \"D: Poor Reasoning\" means that reasoning was insufficient, which is not referred to in the sentence.\n5. \"E: Poor writing\" refers to the lack of grammar or spelling, whereas the cause for this is not mentioned in the sentence, and neither was the sentence's writing lacking in spelling or grammar.\n6.

Brad's preferences.\n3.\"something to drink\" is the clue here. \"Something\" does not indicate a particular type of drink, so it is a suggestion that Brad might drink, but is not limited to coffee.\n4. We can eliminate the food related question as Brad ordered it, so this implies that he ordered it and will receive it.\n5. \"Coffee\" and \"wine\" are not relevant to \"Brad\", so are removed from the options.\n6. \"Brad\" is likely not \"drunk\", the statement \"drinking something to drink\" does not make sense.\n7. \"Getting drunk\" is not directly related to breakfast, so is removed from the options.8.

B: the street, E: the street/ road are incorrect because the sentence \"The new car that is for sales.....\" indicates a road.\n4.

The question is asking us to identify which feature distinguishes Mark's semen post vasectomy, as well as differentiate this property from another feature.\n3. This means elimination of options that are similar in terms of description.\n4. 'Clear' may suggest that the difference is due to lack of semen in the testis, but this is not necessarily what the question is asking.\n5. There is an obvious inference that Mark's semen was thick post vasectomy, though this is not explicitly stated, but there could still be some sort of distinction between then.\n6. So we can eliminate 'Free flowing', as it's more likely that semen would be expected to flow more freely after vasectomy.\n7. 'Sparse' could mean the semen has been reduced in quantity, but we can eliminate this too.\n8. Mark's semen has still retained its thickness in spite of the process of vasectomy, which removes the seminal fluid.\n9. This results in the remaining options: 'Sparse' and 'Thin'.\n10. From the context of the question, \"Thin' is unlikely to be correct, as it's more sensible to assume he'd continue to ejaculate at the same rate.\n11.

As there is no context to the question, it can only have an outcome in reference to the skiing season.\n4: Skiing is a winter sport, thus, the answer could only refer to the benefit of the participant's body being healthy, because of the season. The sentence also indicates that \"the season was successful\", as a successful skiing season means that a large number of people participated, therefore, skiing is enjoyed which implies a healthy body. \"Broken legs\" may be a reference to a skiing accident, but it does not mention a successful season.\n5: \"Chapped lips\" could refer to a burn from the sun, but seasoned skiers do not need to worry about a sunburn, if they have been skiing during the ski season. \n6: Therefore, the correct answer is \"E: healthy body\".\nSo the final answer to this question is E: healthy body.

We can eliminate one choice'making love' as it is not often made to happen.

'happiness' is not exactly right. Most people experience happiness more from outside as compared to experiencing inside themselves and since sex is more an emotional expression rather than a physical action, we can discard it.\n\n4. 'wonderful thing' does not clearly reflect the situation as sex does not always make a feeling of goodness and we all have experienced many situations when sex does not make us happy and satisfied.\n\n5.

Choices:  A : intelligence B : charm C : goodness D : kindness E : beauty\nOutput: 1) Too many women marry a man thinking his man's goodness will change him. Here we are asked to find out which one is missing from the phrase for the better understanding of the situation.\n\n2) One choice is absolutely irrelevant and that is 'woman' which is not necessary to add as it could create confusions about the genders and there are other options too which are unsuitable to include in an answer for this situation.\n\n3) It should be easy to pick'man's kindness', which is the only one which creates confusion and makes not understand why so many women are thinking that his goodness will change him for the better understanding.\n\n4) The final one is the only option'man's kindess' because we already have a set of options which creates confusion so'man's kindnes' must be there to clear things up.\n\nSo the the final answer is B: man's kindness is missing\n\nInput: The best compliment that a person can receive is ____ Choices:  A | to be", "answer": "B: feel good"}

{"text": "1 We are asked to identify \"the state\" in which the John Davis Lodge Toll road Is found, indicating that the location of the Toll road is not a factual matter to be given a direct answer.\n2. \"John Davis Lodge toll road is in arizona\" is therefore a statement that is false.\n3. Therefore we can eliminate option \"A: new jersey\"\n4. \"John Davis Lodore Toll road is new jersey \" is incorrect, implying that \"John Davis Lodge Toll Road\" is in New Jersey\n5. Hence option \"B: Eastern United states\" is also incorrect, implying that the John Davis Lodge toll Road Is on the east coast of the United States.\n6. The question is specific to the state of the John Davis Lodge in which it is located, and \"Connecticut\" is specifically denied as being the answer to this question in the statement: \"John Davis Lodge is NOT in connecticut\".\n7. Hence, the John Davis Lodge is NOT located in Connecticut, therefore the answer must be \" C: Good repair \" as nothing else fits the scenario given.\nSo the final Answer is C: Good repair\n\nInput:What is a good use for chlorine bleach?

When we exclude the options that are not uses of chlorine blanche directly, the best answer is \"Killing germs\" as it is the main use of chlorine blanch.\n3. Another choice is \"whitening teeth\" as the whitening of teeth is often a result of \"killing germs\".\n4. Option \"Combining chemicals\" could perhaps be a useful use for chlorine blanch, however it does not directly kill germs as stated in the question.\n5. \"Cleaning clothes\" is not a use of chlorine Blanches as this implies using the chemicals as part of the cleaning process, and the question does not", "answer": "D: connecticut"}

From 'A': \"A closet\" could be used to store a book temporarily, but there is no time constraint.\n4. \"B: library of congress\" is again inappropriate, it is an inaccurate reference.\n5. \"E: desk\", although it refers to holding a book, again is not directly relevant to where the book may be kept.\n6.

{"text": "1. The sentence refers to the fat man's unwillingness to accept what was likely to be physically possible. (ie; \"He was unable to perform simple tasks\") 2. The question asks what the fat man was \"unable to do\", suggesting that despite his reluctance to accept physical limitations, he would have still been unable to do simple tasks.\n3. Hence, we can eliminate options B(Unlikely) and C(unable), as they directly contradict the scenario.\n4. The sentence says he wasn't able, not that he \"was unable\" which would imply something more complicated.\n5. It also states that he was complaining about simple activities, not that they were complicated.\n6. Hence, we assume that the fat man is refusing to believe that simple tasks are actually easy and not possible. \n7. So, to avoid this conflict, he must believe that it was impossible to do something, which would explain his complaints about simple activities. 8. The only remaining answer from the options given is \"E: Impossibility\" as it represents the most extreme and most believable possibility, when accepting something to be impossible.\nSo the final and final answer is E: Impossibility\n\nInput:The teacher encouraged each of his students to think for themselves, he didn't want them how?

{"text": "1) It's apparent that we're being shown a scenario where the speaker has worked on house cleaning for hours without any progress. There's a strong sense of boredom and laziness evident.\n2) The phrasing in the sentence \"His hands fell to his side exhausted.

Hence choosing an answer according to the speaker's perspective is the right approach.\n4) The speaker is clearly tired and bored, and choosing an answer that indicates \"feelings\" are more apt. \"Anger\" is an emotion that's more likely to be felt by the speaker who is very bored.\n5) Also, choosing a negative answer will be more appropriate because the day was a hard, long one for the speaker. Hence choosing \"B: not boredom\" would be a suitable choice.\nSo the final choice is B: not boredum\n\n\nInput: \"Too many cooks spoil the broth\" means to what?

This is because both are verbs that describe actions, which is not what the sentence is asking for as it refers to \"lives\".\n6. The sentence tells us \"when you do, you can hear testimony of spirituality\", so therefore we need a verb for \"spirituality\" to be modified. \"Changing\" is another verb that modifies this noun, so the answer is \"B: appear in church\".\nSo the final answer can be C:A.B or B: appear in court\n\nInput:The main character in the novel \"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\" was a brilliant man who had no time for what?

The scenario doesn't state that a roof already exists or exists, so this may not be the appropriate option.\n7: 'Garage' can mean several things. It could refer to a place to hang a chair, or a car park where you could leave it for a while, but the question describes a space where the chair is stored long term, so this is not an accurate option.\n8: To conclude, the correct answer is 'D: closet', as it is the most applicable to this specified scenario.\nSo the final 'closet' is the right answer.\n\nInput:I was in the kitchen and then I got a phone call where I thought we all said the same thing, but we did not.

From the use of the word \"outside\", we can say that it is not outside.\n3-We can tell that the dog is not in the dog park, because the dog park is not an indoor space. \n4-We can tell the dog is not in a basket because that would be unnatural.\n5-Based on these clues we know that these spaces are all indoor and inaccessible to the dog.\n6-Based on these conclusions, we can eliminate all but one.\n7-The word \"small\" does not make sense in this context. It should read as if the dog felt as if it has all the space it wants in a house.\n8-The last choice answers the question of what kind of space. It's clear that the space the dog is in is not a small apartment, but a big house.\n9-Thus, the answer is E. big house.\nSo the final choice is E: big house\n\nInput: The author's use of a particular metaphor gives the feeling of a what?

As a result, they're \"getting together\" with other people to watch/attend the game together, which means they're eating/drinking and conversing together.\n4. In this case, the question is asking us to determine where they're getting together. There's no mention of any other \"they\" besides the first singular \"they\"\n5. In all possibilities, an event is where they're getting but it's not stated what kind of event it is. So \"picnic\" or \"space shuttle\" are wrong choices\n6.

An 'auditorium' is a fitting location for 'a lot of people listening to a religious speech'.\n4) A 'crowded, noisy auditorium' would best reflect the description of listening to a'religious address'.\nSo the final answer would be H: \"Auditorium\"", "answer": "C: synagogue"}

Option B: \"arrest\" has some truth to it, but to fully answer the question we have to be specific, and \"going to jai is\" is the most specific.\n4. Option C: \"embarassment\" isn't an answer because this would not be the direct result of committing per jury, if someone is caught then they will be embarassed yes, but going to jail is not caused by embarassment.\n5. Option D: \"tension\" is probably the closest answer to the question, however, the question is asking what committing per jury is likely to lead to, not what tension is likely to lead to.\n6. Option E: \"jail\" is definitely the best answer to the question because it will likely lead to someone going to jail, if caught committing perjury, which is the main goal of committing perjury in the first place.\nSo the final correct answer is E: jail\n\nInput:He never really knew her husband and never asked them how they related to each other.

Option C is grammatically incorrect as \"entertain\" should be \"entertained\" and the word \"friend\" should be followed by an article, but there is none.\n4. \"Before going to play\" also suggests that the \"friend\" is different from \"a kid\", so the question can be answered as an individual kid.\n5. Since kids can be entertained by many things, we exclude A and E.\n6. This leaves us with two options: Option D: laugh and option B: sit.

Thus, \"school grade\" does not make sense here, because we are referring here to an exam, not a school grade or a school.\n5. \"homework\" is a correct answer, as the sentence does not say \" If you did well on homework, you might get an assignment \" or anything similar, but literally refers to an A only.\nSo the final word is E: homework\n\nInput: Everyone is entitled to what they have worked hard for.  To take what they didn't earn is what? Choices: A: wrong B: stealing C: borrowing D: bad E: evil\nOutput: 1:Everyone is entitled to what is says, everyone is entitled to. Entitled= having a right to something.\n2: Take implies action is needed to have something.\n3: Wrong would imply that the people that are not working hard have been put in some hardship.\n4: Stealing is taking someone else's that other person have worked hard to get, or it is taking without permission.\n5: Borrowing implies that you have something that you have borrowed is it is necessary for you, but not for the other person. It's in your possession but has not been earned.\n6: Bad is a moral term that is used to describe people doing something they shouldn't, but it doesn't say \"taking what wasn't earned\", only \"doing something which is", "answer": "D: school grade"}
{"text": "1.'Where is a fox unlikely to be caught?' essentially means where is most likely for a fox to NOT be found.\n2. Option A: tennessee in that sentence doesn't refer to a 'fox' but rather 'the tennessee area' in it's general context.\n3. Option B: inside joke is a colloquial term for something that is difficult to understand or appreciate. It cannot be taken literally to mean a 'fox in a fox hole' or 'fox hole'.\n4. Option c: the grassy field is most relevant because this is where the animal is most likely to be found. This means most likely to survive as well, hence the following statement: 'this means where a fox is likely to be captured'\n5. Option D: the forest is irrelevant and option E: england refers to the origin that the fox came from.\n6. Therefore by logical means, the correct answer is option c: the grassyfield\nSo the final answer  is c: the grassyfiels", "answer": "C: grassy field"}
{"text": "1) The word likely is an indication that there is no specific location in mind.\n2) The word a lot narrows down the possible answers.\n3) From our context, the sentence 'Where is likely to have\u2026' indicates a comparison between two places; in this regard, the answers could be either more or less.\n4) But the sentence states there 'will be' or 'is likely to have', which rules out both'more' and 'less'.\n5) The word fire extinguisher narrows down the possible locations even further.\n6) A garage could have only one fire extinguisher, but a hospital, boat, and house may have several fire extinguish-ers.\n7) Hence, hospital, boat, and a house will have a lot of fire-extinguishers.\n8) Similarly, a doll house will have a lot, so that eliminates option D.\n9) In context, a doll house can only be considered a house, so we have hospital and boat which have a lot of fire -extinguishers. Hence, the answer to our question is hospital and boat.\nSo the final answers are Hospital and Boat\n\nInput: In her career, Marla has met many famous people but never any real stars. What does stars mean in this sentence? Choices: 1. A: a celebrity B: a movie actor C: a politician D: a sports person E: a non-celebrity\nOutput: 1.)In the sentence, Marla has met a lot of celebrities. Hence, stars means she has met, the same as celebrities.\n2.)Hence, it means stars refer to any person whose fame/reputation is widespread.\n3.)As we can eliminate B, C and D and we can say that even E is possible. We need to choose the one that makes the meaning of the sentence most specific.\n4.)So the answer is A (a celebrity, i.e. a star). \nSo the final answer should be A: a celebrity", "answer": "B: hospital"}

There is no option referring directly to the \"master bedroom\", though such an option would be logical for the following reasons:\n\nIt is assumed the master bedroom is the key element of the \"new home\" as the reason to move away from the city. It is a key element as it would give the family a larger space for themselves to accommodate the master bedroom and the extra space it would provide. \n3. Looking at the options:  \n   A and B refer to house types which may contain several bedrooms - as per definition. Option A: large house could potentially refer to a house with a large number of bedrooms, but this is unlikely to be directly referred to by the family in this question. The same applies to option B: suburban home, which could be referring to bedrooms in general, but could equally be referring to the house as a whole. \n   C: big house is an ambiguous option as the word \"big\" is inherently vague. It could be referring to house size, or alternatively referring to bedroom size. \n4. D and E refer directly to personal and possession based concepts, and so are the most fitting to the scenario as it is suggested to be directly related to the master bedroom. \n5. The question is asking for \"kind of home\", which does not refer to a single feature of the type of house sought, and that the question is phrased in the third person, so the answer must focus on this.

{"text": "1-2. Firstly, it's clear that the word'sharp' refers to mental acuity (or, in a negative sense, the lack of mental acuity) and has nothing to do with the concept of precision and accuracy.\n3. It should be noted that the word 'calculations' indicates that it was part of a deliberate operation, rather than an accidental or unintentional error which would be more likely to affect a computer program's performance.\n4. Therefore, option D 'dull', whilst a valid conclusion of many calculations, is inappropriate for the present context which refers specifically to accuracy.\n5. 'Complimentary' could suggest a good relationship or connection, but does not necessarily indicate unavailability, as the question suggests.\n6. The same applies to 'inelegant' and, indeed, 'ocean', whose only relevance is that both are large, suggesting that accuracy was often unavailable due to its size.\n7. If the calculations were always accurate, it would suggest that it was unavailable to be accurate. Alternatively, the size of the calculations could have been part of the mechanism for the inaccuracy - either deliberately or not.\n8. 'Inaccurate' is the correct answer to which the question alludes in the phrase \"When it came to the details\".\n9. The details refer specifically to calculations rather than the overall program.\n10.

Therefore, we can only discard options A & C as incorrect options.\n 7. The phrase that follows, \"court\" does not imply the type of sport used in a given area, simply because most sports have courts.\n 8. This is why the answer must be 'a squash court'.

The question states that they returned more times during that night, which means that the number returned is not zero.\n2: The question states two possible numbers returned during the night. This implies that the ship returned two separate times during the night, as more than one time can be returned.\n3: The question states three possible numbers returned during the evening. This implies that the boat returned three separate times, as more than one trip can be taken during a single evening.\n4: The question states four possible numbers returned during the following afternoon. This implies that the vessel returned four distinct occasions, because this would amount to four trips over a period of a single afternoon.\n5: The question states that at most, five occurrences took place on the night following the original voyage.

Choices: A) to become an actress B) to become a director C) to be famous D) to become more disciplined E) to be successful\nOutput: 1.\"I had always dreamt...\", emphasizes her persistence towards becoming a rock star, but is not relevant to the scenario.\n2. The phrase \"I practiced every day\" emphasizes her commitment towards becoming a rock star and her dedication towards her musical instrument, guitar.\n3. Hence, the question requires us to choose the most suitable option that \"I tried\".\n4. Eliminating the non-descriptive answer, \"to become an actress\" as we have already established that she tries to become a rock star and the scenario demands us to choose any option which she tried to become more disciplined.\n5. The term \"to be famous\" would be a false and inaccurate interpretation of the scenario, if she", "answer": "E: sheet music"}
{"text": "1, 2. The question asks what you would do if you didn't want to bake a cake. The sentences describe a general scenario, where you don't want to baking a cake, but don't feel up to going to a specific location.\n3. Options A and B are ineffective because they don't refer to an actual location, they refer to other areas that could contain a place to bake a cakes.\n4. Options C and D would refer to a specific location to bake a cats, but don't fit into the time frame specified in the sentence.\n5. So the answer must be E: Oven, because it's a specific place to bake a cat, and the sentence specifies you'd go there rather than anywhere else.\nSo the final is E: the oven\n\nInput: He had no money to pay the debt, but he didn't want to tell anybody.  At what would his friends have to worry? Choices:  a: the bank b: the debt c: the bill d: the collection agency e: nothing\nOutput: The question is asking what would be worried about if he hasn't told anybody. Choices A, B, and E cannot be true because money always affects one's health.  He wouldn'ts have enough money to pay off the debts in case if he didn't tell anybody.  \nChoice D is wrong because a collection agency does not mean it's not his fault that he can't pay for the debt.  He would also have no idea what would happen to him if he didn't pay, and that would cause him worry. \nSo, C is the correct\n\nInput: I have a book that was sent by the publisher by mistake.

He has this book from the publisher to read and if he don't return it, he must buy it again and spend money. \nBased on the above, Choices, D, E", "answer": "C: bakery"}
{"text": "1) We know from context that the words \"concepts\" and \"hard\" are interchangeable as \"hard concepts\" refers to \"concepts that are difficult to learn\".\n2) Hard concepts are a subject of interest as they are difficult to learn, and so the question posed in the context of the passage is \"What do you need to learn them well?\".\n3) We can eliminate B: Intelligent as the author states that \"you don't need intelligence to learn concepts if you just take some time\" and D: Empowering as it's implied that concepts are already empowering enough for the reader.\n4) We can eliminate C: improved performance as it's a broad, subjective term which could mean a great many different things and is not immediately relatable to the context of the passage.\n5) Finally, we can eliminate E: Knowledge as this is only the result of learning and not the process in itself, and as it's already said that you learn concepts by \"taking some time...to gain more knowledge\", it doesn't work well as the answer. \n6) Thus, option A: A copy, is the correct answer as, in order to understand hard concepts, all that's needed is to \"copy\" them from a different source.\nSo the final question is A: copy", "answer": "B: intelligent"}
{"text": "1.) The question states that rich people like something in terms of bagels. This question is designed to challenge the interviewer's ability to draw inferences based on clues and data presented in the scenario.\n2.) The question asks about preferences and tastes rather than what rich people 'like'.\n3.) 'Poor' and 'need' have nothing to do with bready-food like bagels and are considered 'unnecessary' by the interviewer. \n4.) 'Sleepy' and 'Plain' only reinforce 'homeless' further.\n5.) Thus the best answer of these 5 choices would be 'Homeless', as it gives the interviewee the opportunity to show off their general knowledge in the field of social behavior. \nSo the final answer must be \"E1: homeless\"\n\nInput: She saw her husband go from a simple life to a complex life.  She saw the money she'd spent. She never thought it all upfront.  She never knew how it would end or where it was headed. She just did what? Choices: A: thought B: dreamed C: guessed D: believed E: felt\nOutput: 1) In order to find the correct answer to this question, it is necessary to first establish what is meant by 'complex life'.\n2) 'Complex life' is defined as a life that is characterized by challenges, difficult circumstances, and unpredictability.  \n3) The question is asking about the effects that the person's life-change, (moving from simple to complex) had on the husband's wife. \n4) The statement 'She saw her husband go from simple to comlex life' implies there were some challenges and difficult circumstances that followed. Thus we can eliminate 'Plain' and 'Thought'. \n5) The husband's wife states that she does not know how her husband's life will end or where it is headed. This suggests a level of uncertainty. Hence options B and E are removed from the list. \n6) The phrase 'Complex life' also refers to 'unpredictability'. Thus, her husband's wife is not expecting how things will turn out. \n7) Thus, the term 'Believed' is unsuitable.\n8) To summarise; the best answer is D) 'She", "answer": "C: plain"}
{"text": "1: the question is asking for the possible outcome of poor work\n2:the sentence suggests that we are asking about the boss\n3: the options may not be very relevant, but they certainly do not reflect any type of outcome.\n4: it must be C: criticism since it is an outcome and best describes the job.\nSo the final outcome is C: criticism", "answer": "C: criticism"}
{"text": "1: First we can discard A: being annoyed, as the question asks what the  answerer should say and being annoyed means annoyed at something. We do not know that the answerer was actually irritated at the children.\n2. The statement \"Bob and Boris were  standing in a queue...\" tells us that the answerer was probably just irritated at that moment and the children's attitude did not  bother him to a big extent. \n3. \"They were standing in for what?\" suggests that the answerer should use a word for the situation which is similar to being annoyed and they are likely to use what describes their attitude as far as their situation is concerned.\n4. \"The line was fast, but...\" means \"The line was moving fast\". If the line is fast, they will most likely not be at the last place.\n5. Children in front of the adults are annoying by reason of fact that they are disturbing the atmosphere of their position.\n6. So the answer must be E: \"out of order\" - it is the word which best describes the condition of the queue.\nSo the final answers is E: out of order.\n\nInput: She found a job that was similar to her old job. She had what experience.  Choices: A: experience in the same field B: experience in the same place C: experience in same environment D: experience in a familiar environment E: Experience in same job\nOutput: 1) We start by discarding B: \"experience in the same place\", as the question asks about what the answerer has, and \"experience in same place\" does not answer that - It is about a location, the answerer could have experience in that location and not be where he usually works.\n2) \"She found a job that was \"similar\" to her old one\" means that she will have some experience that the new job is \"similar\".\n3) This means that the answerer is likely to experience the same thing again and again, therefore she will have some experience related to the process.\n4) Therefore, the correct answer must be D: experience in a similar (as opposed to the same) process( or environment or job or location)\nSo the answer is D: experiencing in a similar process.\n\nInput: The teacher wanted to punish her for her slackness. She wanted", "answer": "B: being annoyed"}
{"text": "1.\"The child pounded his mit in excitement while enjoying...\"\n2. The sentence indicates that the child is enjoying a game and excited about attending the baseball stadium for the first time.\n3. From the options given, we can cross out any that do not belong to the world of sports.\n4. The answer must be either \"A: football stadium\" or \"B: laboratory\" as these are the only options in this set of responses which could be relevant to the baseball game.\n5. In order to determine which option is indeed the one mentioned, we can eliminate the incorrect ones.\n6. \"D: pharmacy\" is not related to sports in any way. It is an erroneous choice.\n7. \"E: soccer game\" could be a term used to refer to football in general, but this is only implication- it doesn't prove 'a soccer game' refers to specifically 'a football game'.\n8. As a result we can conclude that \"A\" is the only possible answer: \"A: football stadion\".\n9. Hence, the final answer is 'A: football stadium'\n\n#### #Instruction:Answer the following question.\n\nInput:`John's unrelenting efforts to perfect his craft bore fruit when he was awarded the top honor in that field.`\n\nOutput: A) This sentence could be understood to convey that:\n\n1.

{"text": "1: The question is asking which word can be used in place of \"room\" to indicate an entire building that has many rooms.\n2: Options A, C, and E are incorrect as they are for smaller areas.\n3: It cannot be option B as \"spoiled child\" suggests the location is likely to be a nursery school, but a nursery school is a small location.\n4: It's possible the location refers to a retirement home from a larger building, as such a place could have many rooms, which renders \"nursery school\" incorrect.\n5: Therefore, of the remaining two, it's clear that \"preschool\" is the most suitable option, as \"massive\" denotes too many items, and likely too many people, but a single preschool could still be massive in size.\nSo the final word that should go in place of \"room,\" is \"preschool.\"\n\nInput: The bicycle thief is still on the run after all these years and his case is still cold.  The police need to keep following their what? Choices: A: lead B: clues C: plan D: path E: strategy\nOutput: 1- It is important to pay attention to how many years ago the crime occurred because there may be a misconception about its relevance now.\n2- A cold case needs a warm lead to solve which means that \"the police need to keep following a lead.\"  A cold case cannot be solved with a cold, dormant lead.  A cold case requires a working lead.\n3- From the given words, we can see that \"lead\" is the wrong word here.  \"Lead\" refers to a type of bicycle while \"clue\" refers to information which may help find a bicycle thief.  Neither \"clue\" nor \"plan\" is the correct word here.\n4- The question describes the case as cold so option D does not fit here.\n5- Option E describes a long-term strategy to solve the case which goes against the question which asks us to follow the lead and it would be unwise to do so if the strategy was following that lead.\nThus, we have to conclude that the police need to keep following the \"strategy\" and not the \"plan,\" which makes \"strategy\" the correct answer.\nSo", "answer": "A: big house"}

The parents said that their children should learn team skills, which suggests that the children would already be acquainted to basic skills.\n3. Throw things and play games are skills a child might learn at this age, but playing chess implies that they are more developed skills suitable for the kids who were already familiar with the games of the younger age bracket.\n4. Playing chess would be the only one of the options, along with playing ball, that indicates that the kids would likely be playing against each other in the future.\n5.

The only synonyms for notoriety are notableness and celebrity.\n6: \"Religion\" cannot be eliminated or it is the goal of telling many about new organization\n7: \"Religion\". The correct answer has to be \"Learn about\".\n\nInput: Why didn't she have to pay for the flowers delivered to her? Choices:  None\nOutput: 1)She is a close relative of the flower shop owner 2)None\n7: The correct answer is None. If you were to go around town and visit with everybody in the town that includes a relative, you need a lot of petrol to do that. In most instances, such as ours, if my petrol is given by a relative, I may owe a smaller amount of petrol to that relative. But, since we have two ways of doing it, I must eliminate \"she is a close relative of flower shop owner\" since it is irrelevant.\n\nInput: She had no choice but to put up with his abusive behavior because she was what? Choices: A: scared B: poor C: in love D: unable to afford divorce E: stupid F: in a hurry\nOutput: 1 and 2: When looking at the sentences, you find that the correct answer could be either \"she was in love\" or \"she couldn't afford divorce\". But the questions ask, \" She had no choice but..\" so this tells us that the only choice that would have been available for her is either \"love\" or \"couldn't afford divorce\" since divorce is often an unfortunate but expensive process.\n4: \"She was poor\" is not the correct answer", "answer": "B: learn about"}
{"text": "1) The question is asking whether one gets hungry, laughs, is injured or has fun when playing too aggressively.\n2) Option A: get hungry: Playing too aggressively has no known side effect of making us hungry.\n3) Option B: laughter: Having a good laugh from being goofy and silly is not a bad thing.\n4) Option C: injury: It does not make sense in playing too aggressively to have an injury.\n5) Option D: having fun: Option D: having fun makes sense when playing sports.\n6) This leaves Option E: feeling happy: This means when one plays too aggressive it will make one happy.\nSo the final Answer is A: E.\n\nInput: The student has made good use of her creativity and is going to write a novel based what? Choices: A: historical novel B: science fiction C: romance novel D: autobiography E: romantic adventure novel\nOutput: 1: The question tells it the student made good use of her \"creativity\" and that's why she is going to write a Novel.\n2: We can eliminate answers as we are sure that she is writing a novel of which we know that they are : Historical Novel, Science Fiction, Romance Novel and Autobiography.\n3: The answer is \"D: Romantic Adventure Novel\".\nSo the final answer D: Romantic Adventure\n\nInput:The main ingredients in apple juice are water and fruit sugars plus what?

There is no word, which has the same meaning as \"A person with brown Skin\", which could fit in the question \"with whom\".\n7. \"A person with the SKin\" may be someone else with the same skin color\" of \"A person with the same skin\". With whom the person share the same skin. This answer makes no sense either.\n8. \"Another person may also be \"Person with brown Skin of person\".\" \"A person with the person's SKin\" means the other person's skin.

Therefore, \"Person with Person\" is not relevant for the definition of \"A person with brown Sken\".\n11. \"The same brown skin\" or \"the same person\" can still share the skin.\n12. There is no coherent word for \"Person with the same skin\" that may substitute for the phrase \"A person with brown skins.\"\n13.

{"text": "1) The question asks us to deduce the right term to describe someone who is awake.\n2. By process of elimination, we have to choose an answer outlying from all of the other answer options.\n3. We have excluded the answer option \"A: Alert\" as the question specifies that the answer is describing someone who is awake, not necessarily fully alert.\n4. We have excluded \"D: Open eyes\" as this could also be said of someone who is asleep, not awake.\n5. Similarly, we rejected \"C: Drink coffee\" as this could also simply mean being awake because one has had morning coffee. \n6. The remaining two options here are \"B: Asleep\".\n7. And the answer \"E: Conscious\" is the best alternative as it is the opposite of \"asleep\" - and is a more straightforward description of what is expected by a person who is awake. \nSo the final answer in this question is E: conscious.\n\nInput: To get a good night's rest, you should go to bed before this? Choices: A: 12:00 AM B: 12:10 AM C: 12:20 AM D: midnight E: 11:59 PM\nOutput: 1: The question asks us when to go to bed in order to guarantee a good night's sleep.\n2: We can eliminate the options that are not valid times to go to bed in these circumstances.\n3: \"E: 11;59PM\" is an invalid option, as midnight is the true 12:01AM, not 11:58PM.\n4: \"C:12:20AM\" is too early for this question, because it would not leave much time before midnight to sleep.\n5: \"C: 12:5PM\" is also invalid as it refers to daylight hours and is unlikely to be suitable for these circumstances.\n6: The remaining two answer options are \"B: 12: 10PM\" and \"D: Midnight\", which is the opposite of \"E: 1;59PM\".\n7: Therefore, the answer D\"Midnight\" is the most accurate.", "answer": "E: conscious"}
{"text": "1.\"Compete with each other\" is the closest phrase to the concept of races, so it is an accurate answer to the question.\n2. The question states \"what do humans do\", so there is no need to restrict the answer to specific races or humans. \n3. Option A: \"lay eggs\", although humans may make a habit of such, is not in the context of a race. \n4. Option B: \"eat fruit\", is the opposite of what humans do when in a \"race\". \n5. Option C: \"wrestle\", could be considered as a metaphor, but even then it would have to be specified to a particular race like a foot race.\n6. Option D: \"draw pictures\" seems more appropriate for a children's race than for human adults. \n7. Option E: \"draw pictures\" is a bit vague as to what humans do in a race.\n8.

The manager of the establishment is looking after the guests of the hotel.  She is a what?  Choices:  A. Tall  B. Very friendly  C. Shy  D. Strict E. Very pretty\nOutput: 1.) A Small hotel would appear to only contain up to two people staying there. We can infer that this would be the number of guests.\n\t2.) The manager of the establishment would be there to look after the guests of the said hotel. As a manager, one of her primary roles is to \"look after\" her employees in the same way that other managers \"look after\" the assets.\n\t3.) The manager is looking after the guests. A shy person is not likely to feel able to look after guests in a small hotel.\n\t4.) If the manager is strict, it would be expected of them to ensure that the hotel runs in a safe and secure manner for the guests to be able to trust their experience at the hotel.\n\t5.) A very pretty person may make guests feel comfortable, but this is not necessarily their role as manager.\n\t6.) The manager is looking out for the welfare of the guests.

{"text": "The correct answer is:  1. The question is asking about the effects or consequences of playing games. \n2. Since one cannot win or be entertained without playing, it implies one must be playing to gain those benefits.\n3. Similarly, happiness cannot be gained without entertaining oneself, so it also requires playing. \n4. Likewise, winning and relaxation both fall into the category of entertainment, which cannot happen until playing first takes place.\n5. Therefore, to gain happiness, winning, or relaxation one must be playing games.\n6. Therefore the final answer is correct as 'Playing games' is what happens to people when they play games.\nSo the final correct answer is A: playing games", "answer": "C: happiness"}

Choices: A: to ignore it completely B: to hide it C: to overcome their fears D: to run away E: to laugh at their fears\nOutput: 1:\"There is a certain logic to the way people react to fear\" states that there is consistency in their actions.\n2. \"They tend to ______________\" as a follow-up statement, it tells us that people are consistent in their actions.\n3. People do not tend to ignore, hide, or run away from fear. People tend to hide their fears and face their fears. People also tend to ignore this kind of logic, but that's not specified in the prompt.\n4. People do not tend not to laugh at fears, but one must be cautious about jumping to conclusions, especially when given limited information, and so option E is not valid.\n5. As shown in option D: \"tend to run away\", there can be more than one option, but an answer cannot include three or more options simultaneously, the prompt specifically mentions \"to run away\", and ignoring or hiding are alternatives to running away, the options cannot be included together as they are mutually exclusive and exhaustive.\n6. So the valid answer must be B: to hide.\nSo the final Option is B: to hide", "answer": "B: melting"}

However, it is a location as well as a descriptive term for a spout as an option.\n\nSo the final answer must be E: fountain because fountain is a location that is suitable for a spout. \n   \nInput: The doctor asked the patient a series of questions before prescribing any type of treatment.  He explained that this ensured the correct course of treatment. What process is the doctor trying to improve? Choices:  T: Rigorous testing B: Precise diagnose C: Accurate medical procedure D: Flawless execution. E: Correct identification\nOutput: 1) The words \"to improve\" provide context for the purpose of the questions the doctor is asking.\n2) We assume the doctor is providing the correct treatment, and is not prescribing the wrong treatment.\n3) The questions the doctor asks must ensure that the course taken by the treatment is correct and correctness can be defined as \"Flawless execution\".\n4) \"Flawless execution\" can be defined as the correct procedure being performed according to a prescribed protocol without deviation.\n5) It is necessary to have flawless execution in order to have a correct course of treatment.

Choices: A: shadows B: smoke C: fog D: ice E: water vapor\nOutput: 1.: The question is asking about the clouds and our options state their probable identity, but can also be used in other contexts.\n2. A: \"Shadows\" is used to refer darkness, while \"smoke\" can mean several things, but mainly to refer to a darker color.\n3. \"fog\", \"ice\", and \"water vapor\" are all literal translations or descriptions of the cloud, not referring to what they represent.\n4, \"Fog\" is commonly used in the sense of \"cloudy atmosphere due to water vapor\" and \"ice\" refers to translucent water crystals appearing at extremely low temperatures, so it's unlikely that \"clouds\" would be used to represent either, as they would be more specific references.\n5. \"water vapor\" does not fit the question, as clouds are not water vapor, they are solid particles that hold droplets of water.\nSo, the answer is either B: smoke or C: fog.", "answer": "C: party"}

The options provided help determine this, through eliminating some as being not possible and focusing on the possible choices.\"\n3. The options which relate to people are \"A, B, and C\"\n4. Options \"D\" and \"E\" relate to animals/food\n5. Option \"D\" refers to a specific animal, and does not refer to a person (it is a dog)\n6. Option \"E\" is also referring to a specific animal (it is a hen)\n7. So \"D and E\" are eliminated\n8. Now we need to compare A, B, and C, and narrow the options down through elimination of choices that do not match the clues.\n9. \"If one sees a foxx and is standing in a costal gulf state...\", \"is standing\" = past, and \"saw\" = present, so we need to eliminate any reference to the present tense.\n10. \"and is standing and witnessing a Fox\" contains two conjunctions : \"and\", which means that the options for A, B, and D can be eliminated, as they all start with the letter D.\n11. \"B\" = Be, \"C\" = See, so we eliminate A, B, and \"D\" (which includes any options with \"D\" at the start of the words). Thus we are left with \"C:\" (See)\n12. The next sentence reads \" where is this person?\", so we can eliminate any options associated with \"seeing\", leaving \"B\" and \"C\".\nFrom this we can infer that \"Coastal, Gulf State\" = gulf coast states.\nSo the final state that is covered is the Louisiana Purchase/Louisiana/Gulf States. \nSo the final answer must be \"Louisiana\"\nSo the final answer = \"Louisiana\"\n\n```\n$ java Instruction\nYou are given a set of instructions and some options from which to choose.

This rule is stated by the sentence, \"James would get up in the mornings and then put them in...\"\n3.

The remaining options of \"wakefulness\", \"rest\" and \"in motion\" don't make sense here and don't relate to what James did with the ball.\n5. As \"in motion\" doesn't correlate to the question, we are left with the options \"in motion\", \"inactive\" (rest), and \"active\" (bouncing).\n6. We don't need to consider \"resthold\" as James couldn't sleep until the balls became less active - they were all asleep before, hence, James had to be active at night to make them bounce.\n7. Therefore the answer is \"in motion\", as the sentence states James did \"put them in motion\" (again) in the morning.\nSo the final answers are: in motion; in motion", "answer": "B: in motion"}

She asked her dog for an advice on 'losing a bet'.  A loss of a bet would be contrary to the dog's mental ability, but this would not be due to its own incapacity but due to the circumstances which had occurred.\n3. The question statement seems to be focusing on the dog's mental status rather than capacity or intelligence, so the option \"losing\" seems more relevant.\n4. The options \"law school\", \"medicine\", \"playing for U.S. Olympic team\" or \"being a celebrity\" are too high a bar to set, considering that the dog has no prior experience in these fields, nor does it have the qualification to enter.\n5.

A saucepan used for a dish is kept where one puts a pan but for a saucepan only used for a marinara dish, it doesn't make sense to put it in the kitchen cupboard or the boil eggs so we should cross out choice D.\n5. However, marinara is an Italian dish, so there will always be an Italian restaurant where we can put it, so we can cross out choice A.

The sentence says what feeling should we have about someone who does not care about us.\n 2. The options are:\n i) \"unfeeling\" cannot be correct because \"unfeeling\" means emotionless and apathetic, both traits that would not cause someone to wish a person to fail\n ii) \"negligence\" means carelessness, this could be because they don't consider your safety or welfare, but not because they don't care about you.\n iii) \"antipathy\" refers to dislike of a person which is unsuited to what we are looking for (as mentioned above)\n iv) \"indifferent\" means uncaring but is also appropriate because it refers to a lack of interest in what a person says or does (which is correct)\n v) \"rapport\" seems like it would be an appropriate answer for the meaning of the sentence, but it actually refers to a relationship between people in a social setting where there is mutual friendship, trust and sympathy (i.e. it's used to mean \"friendliness\") which isn't what we are meant to find. \nHence, as the phrase \"and wished them unsuccessful\" seems almost redundant \nwe know that it is the lack of care for someone that creates unsuccessfulness.  \nSo this means that the answer must be \"D:indifferent\". \nSo the final answer must be 2.

{"text": "1.\"Entertainment\" means fun or amusement whereas \"Entertainment\" means shows. The sentence tells us what kind of entertainment the speaker is referring to, as she describes her and her children doing at the weekends. \n2. Thus, to identify what kind of entertainment she enjoyed on these occasions we must find out which of the options given represents a form of entertainment.\n3. There are only two options that are forms of entertainment, \"Fairground\" and \"Casino\".\n4. We assume that \"friend's house\" is not a form of entertainment because the word 'house' does not appear in the question and cannot be determined to represent an entertainment.\n5. \"Show\" implies a performance, like theatre.\n6. So \"fairgrounds\" and \"casino\" must be more likely to be the correct answers because it is a form of entertainment, and neither mention a theatre performance.\n\n7. So, the final answer is \"C: Fairgrounds\" and \"D: Casino\".\n\nInput: My dog and cats are no trouble at all, I don't need to give them extra food because they eat a lot.

The main options include : A) \"They must eat a lot\" B) \"They must eat more food\" C) \"They must eat healthy food\" D) \"They must eat human food\" E) \"They must eat whatever I give them\"\n3. It is easy to understand that options B and D are incorrect,  as animals will naturally consume enough food to maintain their bodies, as it is not a choice that they do or do not consume a sufficient amount of food,  and option E is a direct refusal of the question and not answering it.\n4. C is an option that does not offer a clear indication which food these animals can eat and therefore fails to answer the question. \n5. It is left to options A and C.\n6. \"A: They must eat a lot\" is more", "answer": "B: fairgrounds"}
{"text": "1.'Someone watching a person who is player guitar' is describing a scenario of a guitar player entertaining an audience.\n2.Analyzing the question and options, we can deduce certain things not to be possible, based on the scenario.\n3. \"Auditioning\" is likely irrelevant to this question, as it typically involves singers/actors going through the motions with a goal of performance.\n4. \"Listening to music\" can be interpreted as the goal of the guitar player, but this is not required of the one observing them.\n5. This leaves us with \"aritritis of the neck\", which is unlikely to be a reason for watching a musician perform.\n6. Hence, the answer must be \"D: making music\", as this would be the ultimate goal of the guitar player.\nSo the final Answer is D, Making music\n\nInput: What is a cough, cold, or fever in the fall?  Choices:  A Fever B Head Cold C Chest cold D Sore throat E Sinus infection\nOutput: 1: the question 'What is a cough, Cold or fever in the Fall?', is intended to test a persons ability to categorize illnesses based on season and time of year.\n2 The key to this question is that the correct answer must be an illness which could be contracted in summer or fall.\n3. Looking at the question and considering the options we can eliminate certain illnesses, based on the season.\n4. A Fever can only be contracted in winter, and a cough or sore throat could be equally contracted in any season.\n5. A Chest cold, and Sinus infection are both more likely to be contracted in the winter than summer, and would thus be eliminated.\n6. So only Head cold and B are appropriate illnesses for summer, and fall respectively.\n7. However, to be most inclusive of the possible illnesses we could get in these seasons, Head Cold must be the answer.\nSo the final Answr is HEAD COLD", "answer": "C: listening to music"}

These options refer to the AI potentially being raised in a faith-based environment, or in an indeterminate (unpredictable) upbringing respectively.\n4) However, 'Too something' suggests that this'something' was previously put aside and now should be considered.\n5) So, from this phrase, the question is asking which could be 'too something' if the secular upbring is selected over the religious one, and can be best answered by considering E: monastic.\n6) The upbring of an AI can be described as monastic, if raised without an element of worldly thinking or religion in its development.\n7) So, the meaning of the question is, 'would giving the AI a monastic upbring have results that were too...'\n8) Consequently, the possible outcomes after giving the AI a'monastic' upbring, can be labeled as'monastic'.\n9) So the answer, when combined, must be E: monastic, as this fits the definition of the phrase given and the reasoning of the question.\nSo the final answers must be E: monaistic\n\nInput:If you see the words 'a' 'the' 'of' 'it' and so on, they almost certainly refer to what?

Given the previous assumptions, the options that are irrelevant to listen to music are options A.B and D.\n4. The question indicates that the questioner is concerned with how to listen to music, not the medium through which to listen to music. \n5. Hence, Option E: have fun is not the correct answer, as enjoying music is not a method to achieve listening to music.\n6. Out of the relevant options, option A: skate refers to skating to a tune played. Option C: fiddle refers to fiddling on the violin to a tune played, option B: play piano refers to playing a tune on the piano. Hence, the correct option is option B: play piano.\nSo the final conclusion will be A: play piano\n\nInput:Which sentence is false? Choices: 1. I want to be what she is. 2. He said, \"Please let us in.\" 3. We can't afford it. 4. She can be relied upon. 5. Would you mind doing it in a week? 6. Which sentence is false?\nOutput:1. We can see from the sentence, that the speaker is looking to become \"what she is\". \n2. The 2nd sentence states that \"He said, \"Please let use in. We can clearly see from this that the person is seeking to avoid being excluded.\n3. The 3rd sentence states that \"We can't afford it\", We can clearly see that this sentence is a statement of inability to do a particular thing, and is incompatible with the speaker's desire to become \"what she/he is\".\n4. Sentence 4 is another which states \"She can be relied upon\". Obviously the speaker states with this that she can be relied upon to do something. Thus, this sentence cannot be false if the rest of the sentences are true.\n5. Sentence 5 is the question \"Would you mind doing it in the week?\".

Option E: make bread is ruled out because the question states that we live near the sea, presumably living in a coastal area.\n4. By process of elimination, we can come to the conclusion that the answer must be D: eat hamburgers.\n5.  Hamburger is a simple recipe, involving only a few ingredients. Moreover, it has good taste and can be easily prepared. Also, the question states that we have the supplies (the main ingredient is fish).\n6.

{"text": "The shelf is made of several parts, such as \"roof\", \"corner\", \"school building\", \"wall\" and \"cupboard\". By asking questions that involve identifying the \"what\" we must eliminate options that do not correspond to shelf.\n\n1.The sentence states that \"the shelf was showing signs that instability\". This implies that any instability must be caused by structural components of the shelf.\n2. The question asks in relation to the walls/walls but in this context an individual wall would not make up a shelf.\n3. \"Cabinet\" may correspond to a shelf, but \"cabinet\" is not shown to be making the shelf unstable, so we can eliminate this option.\n4. \"Corner\" would not explain instability due to lacking strength or ability to sustain its weight. The shelf can't be hinged at the corner, and even if the whole corner was hinged, the weight would likely cause it to collapse anyway.\n5. Therefore, there would be two options left, and \"school building\" would not make sense due to its context. The wall and cupboard would make a similar shape to the shelf but would not explain 'instability', due to its context, so option B must be correct.\nSo the final Answer is B: CUPBOARD\n\nInput: I was trying to focus on the task at hand, so I ignored the interruption and turned what?

This means I was in an active working state, so the only option that could interrupt this process is a \"voice\" since no other stimuli directly affect active working process of an individual.\n2) Interruption could have been caused by some physical or visual signal, such as \"shouting\", \"light flash\" etc. but only \"voice\" can interrupt a task actively engaged.\n3) The interruption must have been caused by something that prevents working process of an individual as he/she ignored it.\n4) In terms of the interruption, the meaning is that the interruption consisted of a \"voice\".", "answer": "D: wall"}

They don't seem to realize that serving is actually an easy job. \nOutput: 1) This is a short story written by Stephen King & deals with a couple stuck in a hotel isolated in the mountainous region, so the \"hotel staff\" could represent any number of staff members associated/ employed by the hotel. \n2) With that in mind, let's consider each option. \n3) -III & VI are clearly unsuitable because Stephen King isn't writing the story about the hotel staff. \n4) -V could be a negative opinion of the staff, but why would that be the only one, it doesn't make any sense.\n5) -IV is the best answer we can come up with because it expresses a negative opinion of the people working at the hotel, which suits the context of the story.\n6) - I. is the single option that makes no sense.

The options remaining would be A: department store, which might not make sense since the gift would not need to be placed under it, then again the gift may be an outdoor gift and might be left under the tree in the yard.\n5.

Choices (incorrect):  A: dishes B: bedding C: food D: toy E: chair\nOutput: This is a tricky question, but with further analysis, we may be able to find the right answer.\n1. After thoroughly analyzing the question, it gives the impression that the options provided in the question are directly relevant to the question.\n2. \"A: dishes\" and \"B: bedding\" don't seem appropriate since when a dog messes on itself, it makes it on it's bedding or the floor.\n3. Thus, \"he gave the dog food and water\" - we are able to eliminate options A and B.\n4. The remaining options D and E cannot be eliminated since when a dog mess, it can make a mess on any type of surface.\n5.

{"text": "1. The question is essentially asking about what physiological result was caused. The wrestling could simply refer to a fun and playful time, but the use of the phrase 'he was enamored of' refers to a deep affection or love for his female counterpart, which is not necessarily physical. \n2. This suggests a potential romantic relationship between the protagonists, so analysing the other options is necessary.\n3. First, we can eliminate the non-physical options, 'competition' and 'wins'.\n4. We can also eliminate'medals'.  Only the 'errections' option remains.\n5. The term 'erections' is most commonly used to mean erect posture, and the sentence suggests physical contact, therefore it is possible that the erection here could involve physical affection, such as an erect penis as a result of sexual tension. \n6. So, the answer might be D : erection, but it is not necessarily so.\n7. In order to narrow it down, the fact that the wrestling was 'playful' requires a literal interpretation, so it is likely not that a physical erection was experienced at this time.\n8. This suggests that the answer could be A: erection.\n9. The answer here is that the 'physiological results' refers to the 'blood'. As blood was drawn between them as they were physically wrestling, it is reasonable to assume that this is the answer given. Therefore, the answer is \"B: Blood\"\nSo the final answer of \"Blood\" is correct.\n\nInput: He lost patience with his employees who only worked 4 hours a day and went home.

E: Careless\nOutput: 1) According to this story, someone can play dumb to get an answer wrong, but then not be guilty of the attitude they played.\n2) The only way to play dumb and get an answer wrong is to be careless.\n3) This means that the first person cannot be self-satisfied at getting an answer wrong.\n4) They would only be self-satisfyed, if they played smart and got an answer right.\n5) So, by process of, elimination, the correct choice is C: Deceit, or being deceitful: being or appearing to be dishonest or disingenuous.\nSo the final choice is C: Deception\n\nInput:In some cases, your family or friends might seem too involved, especially when they try to meddle in what part of your life they have no authority to interfere with.\nWhat part of the sentence should be deleted to convey the intended idea that your family should not come to you for advice when you don't know if they should?

{"text": "1.'At a state fair judgiing pigs requires careful judging' means to determine the ranking of pigs.\n2. It can be seen from here that the judges must be careful while ranking the pigs.\n3. 'At a state fair judgining pigs requires careful responsibility' is not suitable answer because it refers to judging pigs responsibly.\n4. 'At a state far judging pigs requires carefully evaluating' is not appropriate answer either because it refers to evaluating pigs efficiently (carefully) and not 'carefully ranking'.\n5. From this, we know that only three options are left. 'At a state fare judging pigs requires care full judging' is not suitable answer either because here 'carefull judging' means to rank the pigs carefully and it refers to judging and not judging pigs efficiently (careful).\n6. 'At a state faire judsing pigs requires carefully evaluation' is also not correct answer because it refers to the method of ranking pigs.\n7. Hence, the correct answer will be 'At a state fair iudging pigs requires diligent rankin'.\nSo the final answer will be A: diligent ranking\n\nInput: I was expecting something much worse, what a letup, what a what? Choices:1: what a letdown2: what a come down3: what a come down4: what a relief5: what a letdown\nOutput:1.It tells us that what was expected was worse.\n2.What is referred to 'a what' which describes the opposite of what was expected.\n3. The two options mentioned above can be ruled out, but the other three options are incorrect. Option 3: What a 'come down' is not the word wanted here.\n4. Option 4: 'what a relief' can be excluded from the answer because it represents the opposite of what is expected.\n5. What is needed here would be 'what a letdown', which means to be disappointed by an underwhelming result.\nSo the final anser is a: what a letdown", "answer": "D: evaluating"}
{"text": "1) \"The lady was doing a...of\" states that there was more to follow, to identify the phrase that fits into this structure.\n2. We can eliminate \"Take center stage\" as it is not an action that someone does as part of a show, but as it is given as a choice to eliminate it, it can still be relevant to other options.\n3. \"Persuade\" is not an appropriate description, as it would require the lady to convince the audience in some way.\n4. \"Challenge\" is not an accurate choice either, as a challenge is an argument, not a starting show.\n5. \"Sleep\" is not appropriate either as it is an action involving rest.\n6. So the remaining two options must be \"Speak Clearly\", and \"Begin Show\".\n7. We can confirm this by checking for a sentence structure: \"She (speak clearly)-ed, and (begin show)-ed\"\n8. Option A/B does not fit into this structure, therefore, it is not an accurate choice, as A/B are not appropriate descriptions of what \"The lady was doing\" in the phrase.\n9. So, the final answer must be \"E\", \"Speak Clearly\".\nSo the final answeris E: Speak Clearly\n\nInput: When the fire alarm rang, the students ran off yelling and what? Choices: A: complaining B: asking why C: praising D: singing E: all options\nOutput: 1)\"When the fire alarm rang\" starts with a sentence that states what happens first.\n2.The sentence then states that the remaining actions followed.\n3. \"Yelling\" doesn't seem like a reasonable phrase to follow the previous action, unless the reason for yelling was being frightened from the alarm, which then follows with the \"Running Off\", as a solution to the fright.\n4. \"Singing\" isn't likely following the previous actions due to the implied nature that, due to the panic, the students would have no chance to even think about \"singing\".\n5. \"Complaining\" is also unlikely.\n6. \"Praising\" is not likely.\n7. So the remaining options must be \"Asking why\" and \"D: Running off\".\n8. \"Asking why\", although it could be something relevant, does not fit", "answer": "C: take center stage"}

This statement states that all the seats are occupied so one cannot possibly put the shopping bag there.\n7- So, the answer must be E: home.

D: pain is irrelevant because the question asks what one would feel after yelling, but not the actual cause of pain;\n6.

I can eliminate the options: A: mistakes for this reason- even if we take advantage of the mistakes we make in this year to move forward, the year itself will not be entirely positive;\n7. B is irrelevant because the question doesn't ask about the mistakes we make at all and opportunities seems to be relevant here because we can move ahead with them;\n8. C: successes is irrelevant because taking advantage of success could mean that your year was bad and then taking advantage of whatever advantage it may bring;\n9.

Therefore, we can eliminate this option, \"Make music\".\n5) Option \"Build houses\" requires construction skills that is not the responsibility of speech therapists to undertake.\n6) Hence, the answer must be \"D: Complete sentences\". \n7) Because a speech therapist helps his or her patients to overcome impairment to vocal fluency, they therefore help to complete sentences, not build houses! \n\nInput: What do lawyers look for in the law library?

While option B: \"learn\" seems more relevant to what the business ask, this is not indicated and not necessarily a requirement.\n5. Option C: \"hope for peace\" doesn't specify what customers are supposed to do, rather it expresses an unrelated emotion.\n6.

From the text we could assume that the person speaking isn't familiar with the environment in which college kids live, in turn implying that he/she is disgusted with it.\n3) There is a clear contrast between the lifestyle of college kids and the places for living, the latter being more practical. \"The church\" wouldn't suggest this, and the person described in the text is disgusted with the concept of college kids living in a church. In the same way, \"the school\", \"the closet\", \"the room\" would imply an insufficient place to live, instead suggesting that they use those places to store things, as well as providing the necessary functionality for living.\n4) Hence, our guess is that college kids use it as a \"bathroom\" - as per the text, \"they weren't known [to the speaker] for [their] apartment decor choices\".\nSo the final answer would be B: bathroom. \n\nInput: What inappropriate place could you use if you were a bit nervous?

We are asked to choose from various options, but the question is not only to choose what the table could be in, but also where it could be in.\n3. Analysing the options we can exclude several as they do not allow the table to be in the house.\n4. \"A: Library\": this would be a place for books. This can not include a table because books do not share the same dimensions or size as a table. Hence, this option is eliminated from possible destinations for the table.\n5. \"B: A demonstration\": this implies an outdoor public event rather than a private event. There is no table indicated therefore this option is excluded.\n6. \"D: Football Ground\": a table can not fit in a football stadium, and as such eliminated from possible options.\n7. \"E: Rug\" does not have a specific size or shape, and we can not be certain of a table's height or width, so it is unlikely that such a rug fits under a table. Hence, it is excluded.\n8. \"C: Corner\": The statement: \"to be in your house\" implies that it is important to put the table in the main area of the house, and if it happened to be in a corner then it may cause obstruction to the main spaces.\n9. Therefore, option \"C: Corner\" is excluded.\n10. By process of elimination the final option must be \"D: Football Grounds\" since it provides space for a table.

But these holiday is the celebration of things already happened. This may look confusing to you for the following reasons:\n1. Thanksgiving is not harvesting.\n2. Thanksgiving does not celebrate being thankful.\n3. Thanksgiving does celebrate the things already happened in past years.\n4. So, Thanksgiving is NOT the celebration of things that already happened or the celebration of being thankful or the harvesting, but it celebrates that already happened, this is known as \"A: Harvest.\"", "answer": "E: show appreciation"}
{"text": "1.\"Some might say that if want to do something that result in changing society you need to start from who\", suggests that the word \"you\" refers to more than one individual and is not a standalone act.\n2.

This provides us with the clue to work towards a specific goal, which can be achieved by taking one step at a time.\n4. Taking one step at a time, the question tells us more specifically that the goal is to do something that results from changing society.\n5. Thus, looking at the options, we can eliminate the ones that do not directly have a connection with 'you' ('you need to vote' or 'riot').\n6. The remaining options, however, cannot be interpreted to mean a specific goal ('change clothes' because \"some might say\" and 'riots', which is not a single action).\n7.

Option B and C: although these terms accurately describe the effects of jogging, \"heart attacks\" and \"exhaustion\" are both generalizations, which does not address feet.\n5. Option D: \"shortness of breath\" is a reasonable consequence of exertion, but again, this would not specifically describe feet, and although a \"blister\" could be caused by jogging, it's not necessarily related to \"jogging\" in a literal sense.\n6.

So options D: plantation and E: Poor Countries are the choices remaining.\n4. It is not stated whether or not a plantation in itself can be considered an \"Institution\"; however, a \"Poor Country\" is not what we're looking for because an institution requires more than an area or country to function.\n5. Another option that is not stated but also must be excluded is option B: \"Ancient Rome\" as Rome cannot be considered a Southern institution.\n6.

The options left are \"Cupboard\" and \"Shed\" which both relate to the hiding place of spiders.  If you own a cupboard or shed, you are exposed to the danger of encountering a spider.\n5.

So the question is to identify what stand as the role of a'speak man'.\n2. Now we can eliminate option A by seeing that \"You could think of a speakman as a team leader\" is not suitable for the question asked.\n3.'You could think of a speaker as someone in front of the television' is incorrect to stand in front of the television as it is talking or performing.\n4.'You could think of someone as leader of a person'.\n5.'You could think of them as a company leader'.\n6.'You could think of him/her as a company's leader'.\n7.Hence the final answer must be option D.\nSo the final ans is D: for you\n\nInput: The difference between manliness and bravery is that...

{"text": "1: The question is essentially asking us to identify what is a parent's primary duty. \n2. This question is asking \"what is parent's primary duty,\" so the question does not request us to \"choose which duty is primary\".\n3. Parents have many duties, and there are multiple duties that are important for a parent to prioritize, e.g. school time, sports time, sleep time, family dinner time etc.\n4. However, the question does not refer to an example, and it is not specified. As such, we can not provide many multiple examples to support our answer.\n5. The only thing we can deduce from the question is that the question is not referring to an entire list of duties, as even if it was, none of the duties the question implies is specifically the primary duty.\n6. In addition, the sentence is ambiguous, which refers to both the \"primary\" nature of the duty and the use of the word \"parents\". For example, in \"the happiness of a child is primary for a parent\" implies that the duty of a child is to make a parent happy, whereas the word primary in \"parent's primary duty is to care for their children\" is used in the way that a primary responsibility is the one which is most important.\n7. Furthermore, the use of \"D: control children\" is incorrect. A parent's primary duty should be care for children or happiness.\n8. The meaning of 'control children' is too vague. This option is too vague to give a definite answer.\n9. As such, we need to identify how to make a parent happy in order to answer the question.\n10. In conclusion, the best answer is the primary duty for a parent should be to make the child happy; this seems to be consistent with the word \"happiness\" and the word \"primary\" in the question.\nSo the final answers are:  A. speech freely - No\n\n\tB. happiness of a child - Yes", "answer": "C: care for children"}
{"text": "1) It says that 'children' are confused, implying that when they get confused they might lose concentration on what they are doing and focus on something else.\n2) The options that do not require any kind of distraction or focus are 'play chess','sun themselves' and 'gettable'. These options do not seem suited for a scenario where the children are confused and focus may be lost.\n3) So the other options that require some kind of attention and focus or activity are 'wrong house' and'set table'.\n4) Of the options, 'wrong house' seems more likely than'set table' however, in this context, 'wrong house', as the answer suggests, might make them late (home late), however, 'wrong house might make them confused too.\n5) So the options that seem better suited for children to go to are 'wrong house', in case children will get confused too with a new confusing scenario and'set table', but if by'set table', the question means they were on their way to set the table for dinner(this seems unlikely, but not too far-fetched), the question and its answer could mean 'lost home' and 'lost table' respectively.\n6) So the options that most closely match the given information are 'wrong house'. And 'lost home'.\n7) so the answer is 'wrong house'. But it also makes sense to have an answer that is contradictory to one of the options, in case 'home late' is confusing the reader.\n\nHere's my answer:\nIf children get confused walking Home, where may they go?\n\nThe question implies that when children get confused on their way home, they may deviate from their path and get lost, as a result, they may end up in a wrong house. \n\n\"Children get confused walking home\" clearly indicates that they deviate from their original path.\n\nOf the given options, options, \"play chess\" indicates that they play a game or entertain themselves, i.e. the children have to stay focused on the activity.\nOption \"sun themselves\" indicates the children are taking a break and have a free time to spend. It makes no sense for them to \"sun themselves\" at the wrong house.\n\nOptions \"wrong house\" and \"set table\" are the best options that fit the given scenario, as \"wrong house\"", "answer": "C: wrong house"}
{"text": "1- The first sentence states that the graveyard \"is important to build.\" which indicates that the question asks us to decide where the graveyard should be built.\n2.

A: arlington- land near major business locations/near Arlington National Cemetery and the Pentagon\n6. B: out back- backyards or farmland\n7. C: church property- the lawn of a church, typically associated with burial plots\n8. D: cemetery- the burial plot itself, associated with churches/ graveyards\n9.

The question indicates that there is a certain activity involved and we must identify the opposite opposite of this activity to answer the question.\n2. The choice \"few people\" is the opposite of the word \"crowd\", which involves many people. Therefore it makes sense as an answer, as there are a few of them.\n3. The next few options are: \"b: Pay debts\"; \"C- Individual\"; \"E- Small group\" \n4. Therefore these are definitely not the opposites of the word \"crown\" which involves a lot of people. \n5.

{"text": "1) It is a misconception that deflation is associated with economic crisis, and the answer must choose something that leads to instability from fighting inflation, which deflation does not entail.\n2) \"Depression\" or \"noticeable\" may be the answer in some scenarios, but not in this one since problems and economic instability are not caused by inflation, and the purpose of the question asks for the opposite choice to be chosen, which is deflation.\n3) Eat cake would be a suitable answer for a completely different question because it gives one the sense of overindulgence, but not deflation.\n4) Hence, the answer must be \"D: economic instability\", as deflation is the opposite effect of inflation. \nSo the final answer to the question \u201cWhat may fighting inflation cause if not successful?\u201d is D: economic instability\n\nInput: A man has lost one of the keys to his house, he needs someone else to open the door and he will give him two hundred dollars. The man offers a deal of what price of his house to his neighbor? Choices:  a: one hundred dollars b: five hundred dollars c: ten thousand dollars d: twenty thousand dollars e: fifty thousand dollars\nOutput: 1.) The answer is clearly not \"a: one hundred dollars\", since fifty dollars would actually be more valuable (as it would be the difference between two hundred dollars and a hundred dollars).\n2.) \"b: five hundred dollars\" would be the logical assumption, but is not given because the neighbor cannot gain access to the keys without the man's consent, and the man's house is worth more than five hundred dollars, so it cannot be.\n3.) \"d: twenty thousand dollars\" seems unlikely, considering the fact that the man would get more money if he offered a price halfway between two hundred and five hundred as opposed to ten thousand dollars.\n4.) \"b: FIVE HUNDREDS DOLLARS\" is the only one not explicitly contradicted by the answer options, since the house is worth more than the offered amount.\n5.) The man does not lose the key to his house by accident. 500 dollars would be the minimum he would have to pay for the key, and even that is not given.\n6.) So the answer is clearly \"e: fifty thousand dollars\"\nSo the final answer here is E: Fif", "answer": "D: economic instability"}

The remaining choices may be related to this conversation, but are not a direct cause.\n3. \"The answer\" would imply that the purpose of this activity is to reach an overall conclusion. But friendships are simply between people, not about reaching any conclusions.  So this is an incorrect choice.\n4. \"Love\" is an emotion typically involved in friendships, but love is not the sole cause of these friendships.\n5. Likewise \"Fun\" is also irrelevant as this activity is not an activity in its own right but a way of behaving.\n6. The remaining option is \"Inspiration\", indicating that the goal is inspiration.\n7. Though the activity may lead to this result, the purpose of the activity is not this.

If we take out the fact, the question will be : A 100- year- old man who also painted an image. Choices:  Mana  Eve  Hera  Juno  Athena  \n2. \"an image of what he thought woman\" indicates that it is a woman in his image and imagination, but not of his model.\n3. And we are asked to identify the title of the image, hence it can't be man who painted the image it can only be his image. We can exclude Athena from this list because she was the symbol of wisdom and we think man wouldn't name the woman Athena if he was not wise.\n4.

E: church is the most popular location for a community based theatre in a religious building, such as a Catholic parish that has a musical or dance group.\n6.

However, the deaf will not be able to enjoy doing the things because they can't hear the music/performance, so they would not enjoy \"smiling\" while doing the things mentioned above.\n4. Therefore, the answer is \"A: smile\", because it states that the people cannot hear the music so they cannot \"enjoy smiling\" while performing. \n5.

{"text": "1: \"His day at the computer was nearing an end\" indicates that the sentence describes a desktop computer rather than a laptop or tablet, as the start menu would only exist on a computer.\n2. It also indicates that the day of work was nearly over as one would only be able to close down the computer when their day was complete.\n3. Therefore, an \"end\" day refers to a day of work. The start menu refers to a button on the taskbar at the bottom of the screen, which is used to launch programs.\n4. \"He went to the start button\" indicates that the start button was clicked, in order to access the start menu.\n5. It says nothing about the intention of the user, so the statement that they did something with the start menu can only be assumed.\n6. Therefore the options are: \"B: play games\" and \"D: power down\".\n7. Playing a game would be reasonably a waste of time if the user was at work unless they were on a break, in which case it wouldn't be relevant to say \"nearly an end to the day\" if playing games. The question states that it was \"an end-day\", so this would disqualify all other options.\n8. Power down could be an option.

{"text": "1.) The question can be answered by asking ourselves what could be described as 'obtuse'.\n2.) To achieve this, it is useful to look for examples of 'obtuse'. Objection is described as \"having or showing a lack of clear perception or understanding\".\n3.) This describes'something' that is vague and undefined, in other words, \"something confusing\". In turn,'something' could not be bright, pointed, correct, or acute angled. 'Something' would not be considered to have 'clear perception or understanding'.\n4.) 'Something' would need to be described as 'undefined', thus, it would not be described as 'acute-angled' as it is described as 'bright' or 'pointed'. 'Something' would not have 'clear perception and understanding' as it is described by'something confusing'.\n5.) 'Something' would not 'be correct', although, it could 'be confused'.\n6.) If'something' were clearly defined,'something' would not then be 'confusing', meaning'something' would not be 'confusing'.\n7.) Therefore, since'something' could not have 'clear percpetion or understanding''something' could not 'be bright, pointed, correct or acute-angled'.\n8.) Hence, the answer could be described as \"E: Could not be clear\".\nSo the final answer can be E: Could not be clear\n\nInput: Which of the following makes no sense at all? Choices:  a.

{"text": "1: The question is asking us to identify what the children exclaimed to each other after seeing superman fly overhead.\n2. We can begin by eliminating words that are not in the child's vocabulary. Words like \"Skip\", \"Enjoyed\", and \"Awesome\" aren't likely to be in a child's vocab or context.\n3. \"Ouch\" is also not the correct answer, as it's more likely they exclaimed excitement after seeing superman fly over them.\n4. The word \"watch tv\" is a vague answer, as it isn't clear what that even means.\n5. Thus, the answer is \"D: Awesome\" as it's clear that the children were very excited when they saw superman fly overhead. We can verify this by looking at the phrase \"they exclaim\" and the following context, which is clear.\nSo the final is answer is D: AWESOME\n\nInput: All the fish were out of the water due to the rain.

{"text": "1 The question is not specifically describing a particular excavation or type of excavation, just an excavation in general.\n2. There are two main things that can cause an excavation to not be permitted: 3. If the excavation is taking place at a construction site (A) then, it would be unacceptable as the site would need a certificate of approval or authorisation prior to commencement of any excavation from the responsible authorities.\n6. If the excavating is taking place at a cemetary then, it would not be permitted as a cemetary is a memorial space dedicated to honour the people who are buried, and any disturbances to their graves would not be in their memory interest.\n7. A building is not considered an ideal location for an excavation.\n8. Lastly, a city is not an ideal location as it has very strict rules in place regarding the safety of its people and any excavation could disturb structures like pipes and sewage systems.\n9. These four reasons make the place where an excavation should never take place an archeological site.\nSo the final choice is E: archeological sites\nThe question is whether a particular type of personality or temperament is associated with a particular disease?

{"text": "1.) The question is asking what kind of place is likely to have many statues, and the options given provide plausible answers.\n2.) Theatre, church, statue, lake, and park are all words that suggest a place that has many statues. However, of the given possibilities, 'large city' doesn't necessarily need statues since it's a broad phrase that can include other objects or features rather than specifically statues.\n3.) A church could certainly have thousands of statues, the statue of Christ is one such example. Similarly, a theatre could have many statues if they are used to decorate the stage or its walls.\n4.) A water fountain is likewise a place that can have many statues, especially if it is designed to feature sculptures, as is the case in Fountains Abbey where there are a series of statues representing Biblical scenes.\n5.) Central Park could have many statues, but that would depend on the kind of statues that were intended for the park, for it to be considered a specific example. A park is such a vast space that it could contain any type of statue without restriction.\n6.) Therefore, the answer based on the information provided would be 'C. - theatre' as this would accommodate all of the other possibilities and more.\nSo the final and only correct answer is C: theatre\n \nInput: What kind of tree should go on the front lawn?

Spruce, Pine, Fir, and Aspen would be ideal for a front lawn as they are hardy and easy to grow. All of these trees have needles unless the Aspen, which is unique in only having leaves, and so can be discounted.\n3. A Cedar would not be an ideal choice for a lawn as the tree does not thrive in dry soils and would need to be watered frequently.\n4. The key to selecting the right tree is to consider its maintenance requirements as well as it's potential overgrowth.\n5. 'Maintenance' is a general term that covers plant care and 'overgrowth'", "answer": "C: large city"}
{"text": "1)\"The human looked down longing\", is telling us that the human is feeling homesick, which is a feeling of sadness or missing of the life or lifestyles that an individual is used to and lives. \n2. \"what did he miss?\" Is asking us to identify what he misses.\n3. \"The human looked down longly\" has misspelt the actual word but the actual answer is not longingly but longingly, so we will correct this mistake by adding two N.\n4. So the options could be A: nearest house B; workplace C; the surface of earth D office block E; his feet\n5. The correct answer will be \"A: nearest house\" because we are sure about it.\n6. Nearest house is closest relative.\n7. \"The human looked longingly downwards\" means  the human has a homesick.\n8. \"He missed the nearest house\" means \"the human does not miss his nearest house\".\n9. \"The human misses the nearest house\" means that \"the human misses the planet that is nearest to him\".\n10. \"He misses his nearest house\" means that the human misses his life he used to.\n11. \"He misses the lives he used to\" means that the human is missing his old lifestyles.\n12. It is sure for us that he misses his home and he is feeling sad about that.\n13.

{"text": "1.\"Sam\" here does not refer to a person, but \"a child\".  This would immediately eliminate \"school\", since children do not attend school in the US.\n2. This question is best answered with the use of anagram/wordplay, so that the remaining answer choices are a true anagram of each other.\n3. The answer can be found in the entryway, where \"Sam\" (a child) would not naturally be unless going somewhere for something, therefore, we can eliminate A & B.\n4. It therefore seems most likely that \"Sam\" should be in the office building since offices buildings usually contain an area which would correspond to a \"garden\" i.e. the roof.\n5. In the remaining answer choices, school is still eliminated, leaving four that could all be true answers to the puzzle. \n6. However, this leaves us only having four words to work with, and can be narrowed down further by recognizing that \"Department store\" is an inaccurate answer because they would not be muddy on arrival, eliminating that answer.\n7. So \"Department store -> Office Building\" can be eliminated.  School -> House\" also does not work because there usually isn't a \"house\" in a school. \nOffice Building -> Garden\" also doesn't work, as the \"Garden\" would still need to actually be a child's garden, and not someone's office, or roof garden- which it would not be.\nThere are no other possibilities with 4 answers left to choose from; either house or garden are a possible answer, as they both contain the word \"Sam\", the anagrammed term. Hence, the answer to the original question is D: \"Office Building -> Garden\".\nSo the final answer for D: Office Building <- Garden\n\nInput: This is why when a woman who is married, who is pregnant, and who is a mother becomes involved in a car accident, there will often result in what?

Choice E: own house seems an inappropriate explanation as the question does not specify who will travel.\n4) Thus, we can eliminate those options, leaving only Choice A: relaxation and C: admiration.\n5) But the question \"might take a vacation\" implies that they might not take a vacation. Also, Choice A: relaxing is a reason why someone might take a vacation so is no longer an option.\n6) Therefore, C: admiration is the correct answer as the person might take a vacation for their admiration, admiration could be for different things like nature or even admiration for someone.\nSo the final choice is C: admiration", "answer": "A: relaxation"}
{"text": "1) From the question, we can infer that the clothing costing a lot of money, is referred to as an expensive item.\n2) We know that it is located in a place where it's sold, and so if we look at the remaining options, they should be places where something is sold. \n3) From those options, we look for a place that's used for buying clothes or other items. \n4) Since the person did not purchase at home, it is therefore clear that the person purchased at other places.\n5) It can be inferred that the person must have purchased the expensive item from a store or mall. \n6) Thus, the correct answer would be \"C: Department store\" which would be the correct answer, given the information provided.\nSo the final is C: Department store\n\nInput: He was forced to endure the boring lecture, but at least everyone would have the notes for later reference.

{"text": "1,2. The word 'disability' is used in the sentence, so we should note that the answer does not need to be a mental disability in order to cause the person in question to be always talked to as a child.\n3. It is used as an excuse for not being taken seriously and for children being more sympathetic than adults.\n4. Also, the sentence implies that this man is aware of his disability, and that people do this due to his disability.\n5. The terms 'brain','strength', 'competence' and 'qualification' all don't refer to 'physical' disabilities, so they can't be the correct answer.  \n6. The word 'potential', although commonly used to refer to a person's qualities, can be used in the sense that he is still young, so can't represent the correct answer either.\n7. So, by process, the only correct answer is 'C: physical'.\n\nSo the final answer must be C: physical\n\nInput: Some of you who know him will likely say that he's a what?

It is impossible to say that the man is a friend who is disgusted in the context of the question\n2. 'Jerk' in no way represents the terms given.\n3-5) Similarly, 'Boss', 'Snob' and 'Wannabe' refer to people who are in authority and cannot refer to a man who is embarrassed by his friends. \n6) Hence, the man is likely to be regarded as either a'snob' or a 'wannabe', so the correct answer is 'E: wannabe'.\n\nSo the answer A: snob is incorrect.\n\nInput: For a few days they lived as best they could, but they started to argue over what?

It is unclear whether the phrase implies to literally cross an intersection, or figuratively describe moving from one side to the another.\n8.) \"Feel happy\" and \"Shout at\" are good options because they are common actions to do. 'Shout at' has a sense of excitement and high-spirits, so is a possible outcome.\n9.)

The question is asking us about the internet's accuracy and completeness to depict the history of the ancient Mayan tribes accurately.2. A thorough analysis of the given choices gives the following conclusions:a) The choices under the heading \"Extensive\" include Detailed, Depth, and Comprehensive which mean having a broad and thorough scope. Hence, this is not related with the question.b) None of the other choices provide sufficient details about this question.3. The answer must be either Accurate or Complete because the question asks to what extent does the Internet represent and explanation of the history accurately.4. Although Complete is a specific term, it can mean either something that is \"all round or thorough\" (Cambridge dictionary) or that something is \"finished and finished well\" (Collins dictionary).c) The words Accurate and Complete can be used interchangeably as their meaning is the same (Oxford dictionary).5.

Since the choices are related, the options that do not make sense should be eliminated from the list.\n6. Option B: \"swipe bodies\" is quite a strange choice because it is not related to understanding, and does not suggest anything positive.\n7.

If I could have done what, I would have done?

Also in the second part 'homework' is used as the subject and so 'you' can use present participle rather than infinitive. Hence the options b and c are wrong.\n5: Option a has a wrong verb tense and the question starts with 'If I could have done it', hence option d is correct.\nSo the final option is D: done the assignment\n\nInput:I need to find a way to make money at this job.

We see through the language in the choices that they are the choices for the forgivng act not the recipient.\n3. \"Great relief\" and \"Feel better\" indicate a direct physical or emotional response.\n4. Option \"A: Redemption\" suggests to be forgivness as a whole, but it does not necessarily mean a physical or emotional response only that it does not refer to the one doing the forgivness.\n5. \"B: isolation\" and \"C: Absolution\", suggest to be an emotional response or a response that removes one from a state.\n6.

Hence, the answer must be \"D: great relief\", \"E: feel better\", or  an option that conforms to the one of the these two.\nSo the final answers are D: great relief; E: feel better; or an option that conforms 2 D & E : great relief or feel better\n\nInput:He had been trying to save for years with little results and eventually gave up, thinking that he would never be able to save any money, but he what?

{"text": "1 The question is asking us where John is now staying and what he could be staying in, based on the options offered.\n2. We can make some general observations on the options available, to eliminate others.\n\nInput:The doctor told the patient that the treatment might not make him feel better right away, but it would help him what? Choices: A: get a refund B: see the doctor sooner C: feel better D: sleep longer E: learn to accept it \nOutput: 1:The word 'told' is used in the question. This indicates that the doctor already knew or at least felt certain that the treatment was not likely to make the patient feel better immediately. \n2. This implies that the patient wasn't already feeling well, otherwise, he wouldn't have had to be treated.\n3. Therefore, the doctor telling the patient may imply a pessimistic view, since the doctor wouldn't want the patient to have unrealistically high hopes for the treatment.\n4. Based on the sentence structure, we can assume that the doctor gave this message to the patient at some point before they received the treatment. Since 'the treatment might not make him (patient) feel better right away', this information must have been conveyed before giving the treatment.\n5. 'Right away' cannot be understood in terms of a short time frame, because the treatment may take a considerable amount of time to take effect.\n6. This is because 'right away' as used here, refers to a 'decisive manner', or at least without much delay.\n\nInput:Some people are just as comfortable giving out as they are taking advice.

Choices: A: chocolates B: snake C: pussy D: monkey E: wolf\nOutput: \n1. The question mentions that 'the children were fascinated'.\n2. Fascinated means that they were extremely interested in something.\n3. \"Chocolates\", is irrelevant in this context, chocolates are not an extremely interested thing.\n4. Similarly to chocolates, \"Snake\" is irrelevant to the question. \n5. Similarly to chocolate, \"Pussy\" is irrelevant to the context. \n6. Similarly to snake, \"Monkey\" is irrelevant to the scenario.\n7. We can say that \"Monkey\", \"Pussy\", and \"Snake\" all refer to inappropriate things to mention while taking a test. \n8.\"Wolf\" is a correct answer as it is a commonly used term with kids.\n\nSo the final answer must be E: wolf\n\nInput:We have to stop and ask yourself before you do any of those things.

If I was \"satisfied\" with it, why would I need to dispose it?\n3. Option B: unnecessary, meaning \"not needed or wanted; having no function, purpose, or value.\" seems more suitable because of the emphasis on what would be if we DONT need it.\n4. Option C: luxury, meaning \"something that is not necessary but gives pleasure. or\" something that is expensive,\" could be interpreted as the opposite of \"not needed,\" but this is not the case.\n5. Option D: sufficient has a similar meaning to option C, and could be interpreted as the same. \n6.Option E: extra, meaning \"more than necessary or usual.\" seems to describe something that is not necessary, which contradicts the question.\n7.This concludes that the correct answer must be Option B.\nSo the final answe is B: unnecessary\n\nInput:The boss of the company made the decision.

So we must eliminate option C as if employees are so busy they will not have time to work on the logo and option D as it does not say anything about who will make the decision.\n4: The sentence doesn't say the employees are too busy to make the decision.

Choices: A: swimming B: diving C: swimming up D: diving down E: underwater\nOutput: 1: If we are describing flying birds, then this question is referring to Flying. If we are describing diving birds, this question is referring to the diving motion of birds.\n2. We can eliminate choices C: swimming up and D: diving down. We can use the word'sinking' instead of diving down since it doesn't reflect the motion of flying.\n3. We can eliminate choice B: diving since it doesn't describe the motion of flying which is indicated in the question.\n4. We can also eliminate choices A: Swimming since it is different from the question's description.\n5. Therefore, the answer is choice E: Underwater because it describes the motion of diving birds, as it describes the motion of flying birds.\n6. However, since the question states 'If you look at birds on wings you may imagine that they are (underwater)', then the question is assuming the bird is flying, not diving.

By eliminating the irrelevant options \"A: message\" and \"C: text\", we can understand that the message was a \"letter\" and it was \"his last opportunity to meet\" \n3. It was not a simple \"message\" to communicate his last chance. \"Businessman wrote a letter\" refers to the importance he attributed to the task, and this means that there was plenty of time for a lengthy letter, unlike for a text or sign.\n4. \"Lifetime\" is being used to describe a long duration, not just a period of several years, as in \"1,000-year mortgage.\"\n5. \"Last chance for 20 years\" is not true since he could speak with her another time in 20 years, so it's definitely not the last chance for 200 years.\n6. \"Life time to meet \" does not directly affect the chance to meet.  \nTherefore, \" He was too busy to meet her, so he sent a letter \" is reasonable answer to this question.\nSo", "answer": "D: growth"}

Choices: B: give her some tea C: keep her company D: put another blanket on her E: put a coat on her\nOutput: 1) The question is asking what happened next in the middle of this situation. \n2) We can eliminate choices A and C as they aren't relevant here.\n3) Choice D can't be the correct answer as putting another blanket on a person won't keep them warm.\n4) While option E sounds correct; it doesn't directly follow from the actions of the characters, and the whole point of asking the question is to make up one's own scenario. \n5) So the answer that we can use is choice B: \"keep her company\".\nAnswers: Choice: A: 1 B: 3 C: 3 D: 1 E: 2 F: 3  G: 3 H: 3 I: 2 J: 4 K: 2 L: 2 M: 2 N:3 O:4 P: 1 Q: 2 R: 3 S: 1 T: 3 U: 2 V: 1 W:1 X: 1 Y: 1 Z: 1", "answer": "D: learn to read"}

So, they were under the age of 19.\n2 The second sentence implies the that they weren't in their late 30s, as they were before their 19\n3 So, by process of deduction the they would therefore be in their early 20s (between the ages of 18-20).\n4 The sentence states that they were 'in high school'. So, they likely were not from the UK, UK high schools are not common outside the UK and Ireland.\n5 Therefore, this can be excluded as an option.\n6 The sentence goes on to state that they spent the summer (June-Aug) before their 19 birthdays.\n7 So, they cannot be older than 18, as they would not be able to see the Northern Lights.\n8 The question ends with the statement that they would likely see the northern lights in their country.\n9 Therefore, it is likely that the country is one of the others states listed in the question.\n10 Hence, the obvious answer is United Kingdom, although the US and Canadian options could be valid, depending on location.\n\tSo the final answer to be \"UK\"\n\nInput: You should take your dog for a walk, at what time of day?

{"text": "1 \"What is a way for people to meet each other?\" asks about the activities people do to interact, that is, to come together.\n2. We can distinguish the options that refer to gatherings or groupings or meetings, from those that refer to ways to get together.\n3. \"To believe in God\" is a personal faith or religious perspective, it does not facilitate any kind of human relationship, so we can eliminate it. \n4. Similarly, to pay bills can represent sharing a common purpose or goal, but doesn't mean that two people can communicate with each other face to face, and it doesn't describe \"meeting with each other\" directly, so it is eliminated.\n5. \"Enjoying themselves\" can only refer to hobbies, interests, and so on, but not specifically to people \"meeting with each[other]\"\n6. \"Grouping Together\" refers to people coming together at an event, gathering, or party, but it does not directly \"meet with each other\".\n7. This leaves us with the options : \"face each other\" and \"Enjoy themselves\" only, as they are the only ones which can mean \"people coming together and then meeting with each other\".\n8. So the options \"face each other\"/\"Enjoy themselves\" must be combined as \"face each other while enjoying themselves\" or something to that effect, for \"people meeting with each other\", since those three options are mutually exclusive.\n9.

After exercising, one does not automatically relax.\n5. Additionally, the question explicitly states \"use energy.\"\n6. The term used in the question is \"immediately\", so option D: become stronger is also excluded.\n7. Option E: use energy is more appropriate as this term is used to mean \"to perform some activity that requires or uses energy\", a general description of what exercising is.\n8.

The sentence says 'it was obvious' that his friends did not like him, indicating that his friends reacted negatively to information about him.\n2) 'It is obvious' indicates that the information was common knowledge, leading to options B and C.\n3) The sentence says, 'It was obvious' the friends reacted negatively; the opposite, that his friends reacted positively, is not correct information.\n4) So, the opposite of 'obvious' is 'not obvious'.\n5) Option D is similar to 'obvious', it is also 'not obvious' that he is not a tough guy because his friends reacted negately.\n6) Only option E has 'obvious' and the inverse is 'not obvious'.

Verb: \"disposed\" that further clarifies 'disposing' as a process.\n5. Adverb: \"of\" that indicates the location 'a broken icebox' is to be disposed in.\n6. Adverb: \"Where would\" describes the location in which one wants to 'dispose of' a broken icebox.\n7. Adverb: \"you\" that describes the object of disposal, \"You\" meaning a particular icebox that has broken.\n8. Adverb: \"disposed\" indicates that a broken icebox has been disposed of, not the specific time of when.\n9. It is logical to understand that the question relates to one person or object i.e. one 'You'.\n10. As the question gives the option C where one can dispose an antique.\nThus, if one is disposing of a broken antique, they may dispose it in a Antiques store.\nHowever, \"Antique\" is not a singular Noun as it denotes objects as well as a period of time, thus, cannot be the correct answer to the question.\n\n11. If one is disposing of an icebox, it is logical to place it \"In the kitchen\" where one can dispose of a normal kitchen appliance.\n12.

Do you mean she did it thoroughly as a result of her being careful, conscientious, and precise, or that she went above-and-beyond the minimum acceptable amount of work.

It could apply to many types of wood.\n5.) Similarly, \"composted\" and \"warp\" aren't very well defined either. \"Warp\" could indicate that the wood wasn't fossilized, but rather formed an irregular piece while in the process of fossilization.\n6.) However, \"hardened\" is very similar in many ways to \"composted\", so this option could also be suitable. \n7.) The 3rd option, \"Petrified\" appears to most clearly fit with the requirements, since fossilization results in the hardening process.\n8.) \"Petrified\" also indicates a very obvious outcome which is generally distinctive from the others.

Analyzing the list of options, we can exclude the ones that don't relate the start of every night. \"Clap\" refers to performing at the start of every night, and \"Reproduce\" implies the start of the music performance. So, this option doesn't indicate the start. Clap and Reproduce could however be done at a more than one point in the performance, so these aren't relevant here.\n3. \"Celebrate\" could mean the start of the performance, but this seems more to involve getting onto the stage than anything else.\n4. That leaves us with: \"Work hard\", \"Hear crowd go mad\", and \"Crown go mad\".\n5.

Then the man was seen running away, which he likely did because he was \"frightened by a man with an earing\", as the question explains.\n3. We know that the man with the earring could be frightening because a man with a large, visible earring \"is often the boss.\"\n4. In a workplace situation, if a supervisor has a visible earring, it signals that they are in charge - hence being frightening or alarming to see a male employee dressed as a woman, 5. and the man with the earing frightened him.\n6. The man who he had previously engaged may run away with \"\u2026nothing special.\"\n7. As the description does not suggest that he car", "answer": "B: tomb"}

Looking at the choices we eliminate the ones that don't make sense in the given scenario.\n3. \"Music shop\" refers to a retailer, not a musical instrument.\n4. \"Music store\" cannot be the answer to this because the question is specific to the Banjo, not Music in general.\n5. \"jug band\" suggests group settings where a Jug Band is played as a musical instrument, therefore it cannot be the answer to the question. \n6. \"The United States\" doesn't provide enough context, and is too general a setting to be the answer.\n7. Finally, \"Among Nice People\" is likely to be the intended response. Though if this is the case it should be \"Among Nice People Who Play The Banjo\" as this is explicitly the purpose of the question.\nSo the final answer must be C:Jug Band", "answer": "D: united states"}

Choices:  C: diagnostic testing B: investigation A: examination D: analysis E: appraisal F: survey\nOutput: 1:\"When the doctor did not give me a diagnosis\" indicates that the doctor could have given one but didn't, leaving us with a blank in the narrative. Option E - \"appraisal\" doesn't make sense because the narrator is surprised by a specific action (no diagnosis) and appraisal isn't a negative or positive response.\n2. Option F is \"survey\" which is also referring to a specific term, but in this case it is to the medical practitioners that were surveyed, the \"doctor and his patients\". \n3. With this, we can eliminate options A, B and D. \n4.

Poor judgment- the brand names were wrong, so the brand names were misleading.\n2.) Marketing gimmick- this can represent the sales pitch offered by advertising, which can cause the brand names to be wrong.\n3.) Carelessness- this can represent the workers, as they failed to notice the brand names were wrong.\n4.)

One is able to learn, and that is what?\n2.) The word 'is' (in the second half) indicates that the question is asking about the thing which learning is necessary for.\n3.)

{"text": "1.\"Where is he?\" is the question that can be inferred from the wording.\n2. Johnny's location can be inferred from his hobby and the sentences describing his actions after work. His hobby is 'a lot of work', which would not typically be done unless it is important or close to one's heart. His following actions are 'Johnny sat on a chair and relaxed', suggesting that his hobby is of paramount importance to him.\n3. This context implies that Johnny has taken time out from work to focus on his hobby, and has relaxed after completing it.\n4. Option 'A: state park' cannot be eliminated as Johnny is now relaxing, implying that he has spent the day 'working on his hobby', which could have been spent in a park; but again, park could be interpreted as 'a place where you park your car' and not specifically where you relax after completing a hobby.\n5. Option 'B: bus depot' is unlikely to be the correct option as Johnny sat on a bench, meaning that the place he had been using had seats for the public.\n6. Option 'C: garden' can be eliminated as Johnny completed his work on his hobble (not gardened) and relaxed. Moreover, working in a garden doesn't usually equate with'relaxing' later at the location.\n7. 'D: gym' is unlikely to be appropriate as Johnny's relaxation involves sitting on a bench and not exercising/ working out rigorously in any location.\n8. This leads us to the final answer being 'E: rest area', as after 'working on a hobby', the option of relaxing in a place where the public can come to sit or lie down sounds reasonable.\nSo the final option is: E: rest area\n\nInput: The two friends arrived early at their destination in order to get a good seat, but the show was already sold out.

Options A: backyard B restaurant, C: crockpot and D: barbeque doesn't relate to \"slow cooking\" which is \"suffering an injury or pain gradually, over a long period of time\" - which in turn is related to \"cooking slowly.\n4. Hence, our focus now shifts to Option E: barbeque.\n5. This term can be used to refer to different cooking methods, but the best fit is \"slow cooking\" since it is used to refer to \"cooked food prepared by cooking over a grill\" and \"what is done cooking by cooking something slowly.\"\n6. Thus, after removing the irrelevant options, we can arrive at the answer as E: barbeque and the final answer to be E: barbeque", "answer": "E: barbeque"}
{"text": "1.\"What does playing soccer lead to, in general,\" is the main focus of the question. But, the question is about soccer players in particular, not a general answer.\n2. Therefore, in order to find an answer, we need to focus on each possible result for a player.\n3. For each option, we can eliminate the ones that do not generally occur for soccer players.\n4. \"Excitement\" and \"Fatigue\" are too broad to be applicable to a soccer player.\n5. \"Anger\" and \"Hurting\" could be caused by certain incidents, but not by playing soccer alone.\n6. \"getting tired\" is a possible result, but this may not relate to what playing soccer 'leads to'.\n7. So the only possible answer is \"D: hurting\", as this is the most direct indication of a negative outcome, following the playing of soccer for a long period of time.\nSo the final  answer is D: hurting.\n\nInput: What do these sentences have in common? \"That guy was drunk.\" \"That guy was a fool.\" \"That guy is a fool.\" Choices:  A B C E D F H J H J B F J D J C J F J H J J F L H F J B B F J F J F J J\nOutput: 1\"What is the main link?\" means to identify what all these sentences have in common.  It's not about the differences in their meanings, rather, what they all have in common.\n2. So, the first step is to ignore what they are trying to convey and focus on identifying possible similarities. An obvious similarity is that they are all about certain people.\n3. To further narrow each sentence to only indicate one kind of person, we can eliminate \"guy\" which is unnecessary for the remainder of the question.\n4. So, \"That guy\" is repeated because it describes someone. (A,B,D can be eliminated)\n5. \"is a fool\" contains the word \"fool\" which sounds similar to \"fool\" in other sentences. But, the question specifically asks us to find a commonality in these sentences: they are not interested in identifying things that sound similar.\n6. \"That guy was...\" and \"That guy is...\" are", "answer": "E: getting tired"}
{"text": "1 The question refers to a person who is lying about a body, but is very scared of being found out.\n2. This suggests that the scenario involves somebody who is not used to lying and this can be excluded.\n3. \"The reward money\" suggests that money is the motive for telling the lie and lying to collect it, which is not the case.\n4. The phrase \"problems with being found out\" could suggest that money isn't the motive, but rather the person in lying is afraid to be discovered for lying.\n5. The person in the scenario is lying about the body, as specified in the question, and the option \"being found out\" isn't specific as it encompasses any number of reasons, it therefore cannot be the motive.\n6. By process of elimination the answer must be \"The person is afraid of being caught\" as they are afraid of being in trouble and this is the only option specifically mentioned in the sentence that is not ruled out.\nSo the final  answer is E: afraid of being caught.\n\nInput: What should you call a man who talks a lot about work, but never does any? Choices: 1. A: a fool 2. B: a hobbyist 3. C: a slacker 4. D: a snoot 5. E: a gumball machine\nOutput: 1 1. We rule out the options \"C\" (slacker) and \"E\" (gumball machine), as the man in question is only ever talking about work. \n2. \"A\" (fool) would be an apt characterization for him, had his actions been more similar to his talk.\n3. \"D\" (snoot) suggests a man who is self-important, but this is not a characteristic of the man in this scenario.\n4. \"B\" (a hobbyist) is not suitable for this man in the scenario either.\n5. So, from the above analyses, the likely answer is \"A: fool\" as it is the only option which most closely matches the actions of the man in this case.\nSo the final ansers is A: fool", "answer": "C: being found out"}

We know there were more consequences, because the question asks what they did.\n4: When we eliminate options A and C, we find that bleeding and buying a gun are the only options we have left that apply here.\n5: This leaves us with only D as the correct answer.

From this, \"Amsterdam\" is the only option that mentions canals, but this lies in Northern Europe.\n6. So we can conclude that Amsterdam is not where one finds many canals, therefore the answer is \"D: Venice\"\nSo the final answer must be D: Venice\n\nInput: The 1800s was when some of our most famous paintings were created.

We can see that, for example, there are no paintings from '1900 to '1910, as they would not feature from the 1800's in which this question is asking.\n4. Similarly, the dates '1950 to '1960' are too far removed from the 1850's range. There is no paintings in an era that didn't feature during the 18040's.\n5. 'Before 180' is incorrect, as the question asked us to look for paintings which were created from the 1830's onwards to the present.\n6. For option \"D\" we can determine from the context of the question, and the paintings mentioned within, that the years '1900-2010' would not contain any of the paintings mentioned from the 1780's onwards, and so this is invalid.\nThe reason it would be 'from the 18320'", "answer": "D: venice"}
{"text": "1.\"Great\" refers to the feeling of enjoying oneself and being satisfied.\n2. It is more likely that the reader would use the beach in its figurative senses as the basis for the question- 'the beach' as metaphor for 'the place to which the question refers'.\n3. Similarly, 'in the basement' and 'beans' are incongruous with the question, as they lack pleasant or positive connotations,'solar system' is unlikely as the question states only 'lay in the sun', and 'west' would probably be used to describe geographic features more than anything else.\n4. Hence, of the options, only 'beach' is likely to refer to a pleasant place in its figurative sense.\n5. The question posed seems to be trying to elicit or generate a word which will appear in a simile or metaphor, and this word is likely to have pleasant implications, hence 'beach' would be the correct answer to this question.\nSo the final word is E: beach\n\n\nInput: They had some old family papers, and if she could decipher them, she be able to what? Choices A: make a new family B: find out something new C: make new words D: make new history E: find out what happened\nOutput: 1: The question asks us to give the outcome of being able to decipher the family papers, if she could do so. \n2. By using the word make, in the options, it implies that the deciphering of old family papers would lead to a construction of something new. \n3. Only option D: make new history is not likely to occur as it appears in its literal sense, and thus is likely irrelevant in relation to the question. \n4. Option A: make a new \"family\" seems similar to option D: make new \"history\" and is therefore also likely irrelevant.  \n5.

So we need to look at the remaining options, which are \"feel relaxed\", \"kill boredom\" and \"social bonding\".\n4. Feel relaxed would fit but this would not be a likely scenario for a person chatting with his/her friends.\n5. \"Kill boredom\" is in a similar vein to the phrase \"kill time\". However, we need to be specific as to whether the objective is to kill the boredom, or whether it's killing the entire thing of \"friendship\".\n6.

{"text": "1) The question asks for the name of the type of sensor used in a security alarm, based on an explanation from an installation expert. 'this' is simply a word used to indicate direction, and can mean many things, therefore disregarding 'this' option.\n2) To determine which option is correct, we must first ascertain what it is that this sensor monitors. According to our sentence, the sensor measures 'just the distance,' indicating that 'the distance' is the thing being measured and, therefore, 'this' must therefore be referring to 'distances'.\n3) This narrows down our available options. Since the only distance that is measured is 'the distance', and our only options are C or D, D is our final answer, as 'proximity' means 'how close to', which, in our case, 'this' represents 'the distance'.\nSo the final answer for this question is C: proximity\n\nInput: A good way to check out the place is to ask to the locals what things are best to do as a traveler there, and what you should avoid or you will lose money. Choices:  Avoid B: Lose C: See D: Miss E: Take\nOutput: 1: The question is essentially asking about what to do, and what not to do, as a way to avoid costly mistakes and potential scams.\n2: The options excluded from consideration are 'avoid' and'miss' as these do not have anything to do with 'travel' or 'locals', thus are not relevant to the text.\n3: 'See' is an action verb and relates to what to see (ie. the sights). The word 'take' here is ambiguous as it may refer to something we can take with us (as in a 'ticket'), or as something we are doing at the time (as in a'selfie'). So, 'take' is disregarded. 'lose' seems to be most relevant here as it refers to money not being made or spent.\n4: 'Lose' is then the correct option, as 'lose' here specifically refers to'money' - as opposed to other terms like 'loose' that are also acceptable but in a different context.\nSo the final answers to this question are: 'Lose'.", "answer": "D: proximity"}

To answer this question we should use the wording as a guide to what is being asked and to identify what we are looking for - 'You go to the movies... unless it's an ____'\n2.) By process of elimination \"A: an animated film\" is incorrect because this is a choice of what genre the movie is, where as the question focuses on going to the movies.\n3.) \"B: a comedy\" may seem to have some relevance, but it is important to look at the question for clarification - The question refers to cinema or movies; comedy has no place at a cinema.\n4.) \"C: an offbeat\"  film, is irrelevant here because 'it's an offbeat film' has no correlation with what we are looking for, 'You go to the cinema...'\n5.) \"A horror film\" is also clearly a non-option as this type of film does not relate to cinema and would actually have the opposite effect to this question  - 'You go to cinema... unless it's a horror film' would not be correct.\n6.)

The name \"Mark Twain\" is a pen name that was chosen long after the person in question has died.\n4. The name \"Samuel Beckett\" is probably not familiar to the intended readers: people living a century later who were born over a century after the man in question's death.\n5.

{"text": "1.\"Where would you see people playing with a ball in uniform?\", which could be referring to a sporting event, where athletes in one team wear the same uniform, or a place where many people play a ball, such as in a public park or street.\n2. Therefore, the answer must be \"C: sporting goods store\", one place that would be likely to have many people playing with a ball.\n3. If the question is referring to the sporting event or the street scenario, it would still be'sporting goods store'. One person or group of people playing may still be referred to as'many people'.\n4. This is because, \"many\" is an adjective and could be used to amplify the idea of a lot of, or even hundreds or thousands of people.\n5. Moreover, it might be referring to a particular place like the store, rather than the event or street.\n6. Hence, the correct option should be \"C: sport store\", where you can see many people playing with a large ball.\nSo the final sentence is C: sporting goods Store", "answer": "E: sporting event"}

He should have done at the end is given as the question, indicating that it was his only option in that position.\n3. 'change his mind' appears to be a good answer, but the question does not specify that it is actually an opinion held by the teacher.\n4. Therefore, the most suitable answer is 'changed his mind', as it is in the opinion of the teacher that it was a very bad grade.\n5. The other choices 'explained in how the grade was', 'lower it up', 'raise it up', or 'lowered the grade' do not seem as suitable answers, as according to the question these choices appear to be made by the teacher with no explanation to the student.\n6.'Lower the grade' should have been written as 'lowered the grade', but this is irrelevant for the question.\n7.

The child and the father both died from poisoning, but they didn't die from the same poison.\n3. Since only poison A, B, and D poison people, the father must have died from a different type of poison to his son.\n4. This means that the father could not have died from alcohol poisoning like his son. Poison A causes respiratory muscle collapse, and would therefore not kill a child.\n5. Since the boy had died from alcohol poison they cannot have died from the same poison. That means that poison D or poison C could kill a child because they cause cardiopulmonary arrest.\n6.

{"text": "1) The question as it stands is asking us to identify what species is likely to have a caring heart, based on the information provided. In our answer we have to state the 'all-mammals' option. \n2) Mammals are a specific species, just like chickens are a species, dogs are a species, elephants are a species. No one mammal or no one of these animals is a mammal. The same is true of all animals in general. An answer of \"all animals\" would be incorrect.\n3) The all option has a 'definite' meaning, but some nouns are also always singular. For example, an animal has a personality/person. Therefore the answer must be referring to either all animals/species or all mammals/animals.\n4) The choice between the two can be made through eliminating the two incorrect options in order to reach what seems to be more sensible answer.\n5) The choice of \"Artichoke\" is incorrect as it is neither a species nor an animal.\n6) The choice of \"Live animal\" is incorrect, because this is an animal which is currently alive, but this option is stating \"all\" animals or species that have never died.\n7) Mammals (species) have been shown to have more complex emotional brain activities than non-mammals. This demonstrates that at least mammals are likely candidates to have caring hearts. So by inference the final answer is, \"The 'all' can be a type of mammal\".\nSo the final answer must be \"The 'all' could be a type of mamal\".\n\nInput: They decided to take their bicycles, their friends and relatives, and drive to the park.

Therefore, \"drive\" or \"to\" could be the correct answer.\n5: Options F- T are", "answer": "A: person"}
{"text": "1: The question is asking what will happen to skin which is pinched (squeezed between 2 things). 2: The options offered can answer the question differently for examples: \n3. 'Cold' is relevant if skin is pinched in freezing temperature and this means the skin on the pinched part is going to feel cold.\n4. 'Pressure' will cause pain, as pressure is applied on skin.\n5. 'Bumpy' may also cause pain.\n6. 'Itches' are symptoms of irritation while 'clammy' refers to feeling of dampness on the skin.\n7. Above all what will happen to skin is that it should feel painful because pinched skin has a high chance to tear or get damaged. \n8. All these options can lead to pain, except 'clammy' and since pinching may cause pain, 'clammy' is not the valid answer.\n9. From the remaining options, 'clammy' and 'pain' can't be the direct relation and hence 'clammy' is also eliminated and the answer stands at 'pain'.\nSo the final answer should be: 'pain' \n\nInput: One of the signs of a high fever is an overly high body temperature: Choices:  A : hot B : chilled C : frozen D : shivering E : sweaty\nOutput: 1) The question implies one of the signs (amongst others) of having high fever is high body temperature and 2) The options provided are- 'hot','chilled','frozen'&'shivering'.\n3. 'hot' is not one of the signs and can't be the selected one.\n4. 'chilled' is also the same.\n5. 'frozen' will be irrelevant as high body temperature is due to high fever.\n6. Thus, we can eliminate 'frozen' as an answer.\n7.'shivering' & 'chilled' are one of the signs of high fever, therefore'shivering' is chosen to be the answer.\nSo the final question should be: \"shivering\"", "answer": "B: feel pressure"}
{"text": "1 The question is asking where a cat would find the most joy.\n2. Options A, C & D are all places where a cat would find enjoyment, but only option E: \"barn\" is a place specifically where a cat would be happy, as a barn is a place for cats to live comfortably, and possibly take a nap (see example below)\n3. A cat's home may be a place where a cat would be content, but the question is asking which place a cat would be happiest in, and that place would be the barn. \n4. Hence, the answer must be E: barn.\nSo the final answers are D: Barn\n\nInput: A bull market is a situation when the value of a country\u2019s currency against what? Choices: A: local currency B: foreign currencies C: other currencies D: international currency E: one currency\nOutput: 1: The sentence is asking which type of currency the country's currency is rising relative to, such that a rise in value of this type of currency could be considered a bull market.\n2. We can rule out option A: local currency because this wouldn't cause a bull market. \n3. Similarly, option B: foreign currencies cannot be used because there is no need to rise to the same level, as the same amount of foreign currency could be used to buy the same amount of goods. \n4. Option D is close, but option E is the only choice that makes sense. International currency doesn't make sense as this refers to another country's currency. \n5. There is a need to rise relative to foreign currency, so the question is asking which foreign currency. \n6. Hence, the answer has to be E: international currency (see example below) and the final answer is E.\nSo the final words are D: international currency\n\nInput: After several days of rain, one man\u2019s barn was still full and the other dry.

B: satisfied, but wanting to finish the project, they would not want to leave it, so they would stay late, and do their work to make sure they did it well. C: they would take the same jobs the next day, the people always take the same job, and nothing changes, all they think about, it's doing their job, with satisfaction, but with more determination to do it well. D: that day would never end, once a job is done, they would leave it, then go home and it's done, and so you don't think about it much. E: doing that same job again, they wouldn't know anything, and you also won't, but they're happy and ready to leave it.\nOutput: 1) The sentence expressing the feeling of finishing the work and being satisfied then left with nothing to do. \n2) There is more than one reason, but the key point to understanding the answer is the use of the word 'feet up' (this suggests they are laying about and with no job to do).  This is followed by the 'wanting to finish project' part.\n3) As no other option provides a reason as to why they wouldnt stay late to complete a job for the day, the answer must be A: with nothing to due, having their feet up and wanting to finish the job.\nSo the final statement is A: With nothing to did, there feet up and we're satisfied with this.", "answer": "B: applaud"}

Choices: A: the piano B: the organ C: the violin D: the flute E: the piano forte.\nOutput: 1.) The question indicates that the assistant's unlikable character is demonstrated through her choice of musical instrument.\n2.) The phrase \"absolute horror\" indicates that she played the violin to the utmost abhorrent manner, unlike the other pianos, organs, flutes, or pianos fortas.\n3.) The violin has many variations and the question specifically states that the assistant plays one of these variations \"to the utmost,\" which indicates that the instrument of choice is the violin.\n4.)

{"text": "1) The question states \"Where do kids find Fish in their backyard?\" which implies that backyards are a primary location that kids can find fish in. 2) By process of elimination, the statement \"Ocean is where fish is found near us (either where we live) but is far from in our backyards.\" is not relevant here. 3) Similarly, the statement \"Boat\" is irrelevant because \"boat\" is the means by which we get to our chosen destination, it describes the means but not the destination itself. 4) The statement \"Pond\" on the other hand, is a primary location where fish are found in. It is suitable for all the options except for \"end of line\", which is used to mean the end of a particular task or job is reached. The statement \"Pond/where kids find fish\" is used to show the main topic of the question. It would be inappropriate if any other option was chosen, as it will defeat the purpose of the statement. 5) The statement \"End of line\" may be suitable, if the question had the word \"ocean\" in any one of the answers. 6) This statement is the only suitable option as the phrase \"end of the line\" is a common use for someone who has exhausted all of the possibilities, or reached a point where it's over. 7) Kids do not get fish from any other location except from the \"pond\". 8) Kids must find fish at the end. 9) Kids don't have to cross the ocean. 10) Kids must find the fish in their backyard. 11) Kids can only find fish in the pond. 12) It seems unlikely that kids find fish in an ocean at some far away place. It's much more feasible to find fish in a pond. 13) If kids do not find fish in their backyard, it means that they have not found it anywhere. 14) Since the other options are inappropriate, it follows that the answer is only \"Pond\". So the final answer is Pond", "answer": "C: pond"}
{"text": "1 - The question is asking what we are hoping to achieve when we speak with someone.\n2 - All the options presented involve speaking with someone. It can be seen that each option has a different context of significance, not necessarily just with one other person.\n3 - It is clear that option A: Communicating with Others can be both an act of socializing, and an act between persons, but it does not have to be the latter.\n4 - Option B: Hurting feelings could be seen as a more hurtful, personalized act - but still does not have to be just a relationship.\n5 - Option C: Dry Mouth is likely unrelated to communicating at all, and can also be seen as non-verbal communication.\n6 - Option E: Changing behavior is a type of communication that involves change for another person in some way.\nSo now the options remaining are B: hurt feelings and E: changing behavior. Option B: hurt feelings only refers to talking when speaking may cause conflict. Option E: changing behaviours has no connection to relationships, which does not fit the context of the question.\nTherefore, the correct answer is E: changing behavior because it involves communicating with someone and changing their behavior and doesn\u2019t cause any harm in context to the question.\nSo the finals answer is E: change behaviour.\n\nInput: What's the largest kind of bird that you've ever seen? Choices: 1. A: Raven 2. B: Eagle 3. C: Raccoon 4. D: Turkey 5. E: Ostrich\nOutput: 1- The question asks for the \"largest\" type of bird. Birds have a wide range of sizes, therefore many types have the potential to be bigger than other types.\n2- There are many bird types larger than ravens, and all of the smaller birds can be found in nature on earth. So it is impossible for this to the most large kind of bird, because of the restriction in context to nature on earth.\n3- Raccoons are mammals, not birds, therefore it will not be the largest kind of bird.\n4- Turkeys are land-based birds. Like raccoons, they are mammals and will not be the biggest bird.\n5- The ostrich is the only bird type in the options that can be found in Australia,", "answer": "A: communicating with others"}
{"text": "Firstly, the question asks us to state what it means to accomplish nothing while watching television. Seconds, there is a grammatical error in option A which should read \"get/ing/gets fat\".\n7. So there are some options that are incorrect, and should be eliminated. \n8. The choice that is incorrect is 'get' in option A. \n9. The term \"fat\" is usually an adjective referring to a substance or adverb describing \"slowly gaining weight/ becoming fat\", used in the context of option A, and it seems it does not fit in.\n10. Option B makes the most sense grammatically, \"if x happens, then y\". \n11. Further, option B makes better sense compared to the others because it describes the outcome of a singular action.  All other options describe multi-faceted outcomes. \n12. Option B describes what happens to the body if the singular action \"watching television\" occurs. \n\n13. Thus, option B is correct as the body \"gives/gets/gets fat\" if only the singular action of \"watching television\" is taken. \n\nSo the final answer will be: \"B: get fat\"\n\nInput: When we go to the mall we can usually buy anything and everything, even new cars.

This leaves two options, \"have lunch\" or \"cook dinner\".\n5. We can eliminate \"have lunch\" because if you are hungry you would eat when you are at home. \n\nBecause of all this, \"cook dinner\" fits best with the scenario described and thus, \"cook dinner\" becomes the answer.\n\nInput: Who is this man speaking to us?

The second sentence gives further detail about the first speaker: \"Who is this man speaking to?\".\n3.\"A little fat man with a white beard was speaking to them\".\n\nIt is clear from the dialogue that the first speaker is the one who has a white beard.\nTherefore, \"A stout man wearing\" is the answer.\n\nNote:\nIn this part, there are some \"A stout man who is wearing\" in the same position as \"Who is this man wearing\"?

Option C: pencil cases- the scenario does not mention any school, and the question does not mention using pencil boxes in a classroom. One may even use a pencil box to store other things.\n4. Option E: the office depot- a pencil is used in school, but not necessarily only in schools. One can use it for note-taking, reading, drawing, and even in a daily routine at home.\n5.

When I turned 29, I knew that I really wanted to become a mom but didn\u2019t know how it would ever be possible.  How could I possibly ever have children when I\u2019m a woman?  Answer: 1. The first sentence describes that the speaker is a woman who knows that she wants children but it is uncertain that it would ever be possible for her to have children at such a late stage.\n2. The speaker is questioning that she is unable to conceive, as the word \"mom\" refers to one who looks after a child.\n3. This implies that if the speaker could \"have children\" and become a \"mom\" then she would be able to have control over a child's well-being, this would provide joy and fulfillment to her life.\n4. However, it indicates the importance of being a parent based on the usage of the word \"never\", which does not permit the possibility of the speaker considering parenthood.\n5. Yet, the second sentence suggests that the speaker now wants to become a parent but could not bring herself to do so as she is unsure how this is going to happen. 1. The only thing necessary to become a mother is to conceive.\n2. So the solution is to \"look forward to becoming pregnant\"\nSo the final answer statement is A. Looking forward to becoming pregnate.\nSo the final Answer is A: Looking forward to becoming preganant\n\nInput: If your family does not care about your goals in life, what do you look for in a partner, if anything? Choices:  A. Their looks B. Their financial status C. Their level of education D. Their hobbies and interests E. Whether they love you\nOutput: 1) A.) Their looks\n2) To begin with, we exclude \"B. Their financial status\" because people's financial statuses do not dictate their personal tastes and preferences.\n3) \"C. Their level of education\" is also ruled out because people's educational backgrounds do not dictate their family values, so a person's relationship with one's partner should be based on more than education.\n4) \"D", "answer": "B: piggy bank"}
{"text": "1: where children can play a game is a different place from where they do so.\n2: The children's playroom is where they play the game.\n3. So, the sentence states that children play toy store games in children's playroom.\n4: This is the only option where the sentence fits the meaning. Children can't play toy store games anywhere else but only in children's playrooms, like \"B\".\n5. Therefore, the correct answer is \"E: children's playroom\", as that is where they play toy store games.\nSo the final answers is E: children's play room\n\nInput: what do you need to be a lawyer? Choices:  law degree B: patience C: intelligence D: good memory E: leadership\nOutput: 1) We look to this sentence as we need to answer the question asked and see what is necessary to become a lawyer. \n2. To be a lawyer, you need education.  There are two types of education: university or college education (law degree), or training (apprenticeship).\n3. Also, you will need good communication skills and patience to be a lawyer because you will have to do a lot of negotiation.\n4. You need to have a strong sense of judgment to protect other people from getting cheated on.\n5. You need to be honest because lawyers cannot make lies in court. \n6. You will need some intelligence to be a lawyer, but you don't need a genius mind to be one.  The most significant advantage for becoming a lawyer is knowledge, not intelligence.\n7. A person needs to be logical to become a lawyer.\n8. According to this article, \"intelligence is defined in the first place by one's ability to communicate, remember, and understand language well.\"  According to the second article, \"Communication skills will be essential no matter what role you end up having.\" \n9. We need memory to solve difficult tasks but lawyers never need a sharp memory as they can always refer to books or documents. \n10. This sentence also doesn't specify the type of leadership.\n11. Therefore, the correct answers are \"A: law degree\" and \"C: patience.\"\n\nSo the final answers are A: law degree and C: patience\n\nInput:why did", "answer": "E: family room"}
{"text": "1.' Usually' implies that exceptions exist.\n2. In the absence of hands we can exclude sports like soccer. So, the game that doesn't allow for the use of hands must involve the use of other body parts that would still bleed, unless the question refers to blood other than human blood.\n3. It's logical to assume that the use of capillaries doesn't result in blood being spilled, because capillaries are used in the circulatory system. As blood normally ends up spilling somewhere when a human capillary breaks, this choice is unlikely to be the correct one.\n4. Ball also is also ruled out, as blood could be spilt directly from hands, not necessarily from capillaries (see previous paragraphs), and ball is not known for blood being spilt as a result of using it.\n5. The usage of the word \"animal\" leaves the options 'person' the most likely one. The reason being, that when one person fights with another person, their hands rarely come into contact, blood being spilt usually from cuts and bites, etc. This means, in the common English lexicons definition, blood is spilt in person versus human situations rather than animal scenarios. \n6. From the above mentioned options 'animal' and 'person' are the only options that involve the use of hands and the word \"not\" which eliminates the option that does allow the use of hands (soccer). \n7. Hence, by logical elimination, the correct option would be 'C: ball' being the most likely candidate, and the other ones are not viable.\nSo the final answers is C: ball\n\nInput: \"Few people are able to achieve the goal of what?\" Choices:  A. Living long and wealthy life B. Living life to fullest C. Living life simply D. Living life modestly E. Living life happily\nOutput: 1.\"Few people are able\" to do something does not suggest that it is the norm. Thus we can rule out \"living long and wealthy life\". We can also rule out \"living life to the fullest\" because it is not necessarily living life to the fullest that is difficult. People often live to the fullest but aren't able to achieve the goal.\n2.\"C. Living life simply\" suggests that people can achieve the goal by living life", "answer": "A: soccer game"}
{"text": "1:The sentence suggests that John recently took up the position of first violin.\n2 He then holds a job playing first violin. \n3 He is a member of a symphony orchestra.\n4 His position in that orchestra is to be first violin.\n5 He is employed full-time as a professional violinist.\n\n6 A: violin case would have to refer to the type of case/box used to carry/store the violin. This does not sound appropriate since there is no mention of cases or bags in the sentence.\n\n7 B: the symphony orchestra is the place or venue that he performs in his job. So, this seems to be what is referred to in the sentence.\n8 C: to be first violin sounds right. it is a position/job title which may not refer to the place of violin playing. This is why I have included the options Class and Learning to play Violin as options too as they sound like they refer to the process of learning to play Violin.\n\n9 D: to be employed in a full-time way as a professional violinists seems to be what is meant in the sentence. This suggests that John will be at first violin, at the orchestra, until he retires and/or is promoted\n\nFinally, the answer will be B - symphony orchestra, since this is the place in which he plays in first violin, where his violin is placed, and his job.\n\nSo the final answer will be B: symphony oratorio\n\nInput: One of the things that the United States military has a good deal of in abundance is what? Choices: A: land area B: water area C: air space D: population\nOutput:1:The question asks about the things in abundance with the United States military:\n\n2:The options I have been eliminated:\n\n3:There is none\n\n4:The thing the US military has a lot of in abundance is air space, as the airspace under US control is divided in four regions called air divisions. This airspace is 25% of the total, according to the US Census Bureau. There is a very high concentration of military aircraft than other private or commercial aircrafts.\nSo the final option is A: air space\n\n\nInput: When the 53 percent of the vote was the", "answer": "B: symphony orchestra"}
{"text": "1: The question wants to know which one of the options corresponds to an attache case. \n2: We can find further clues in the sentence. It refers to an attache case as'small'; it also implies not all the locations have attache cases, and the correct option will correspond to those that do.\n3: Options 'D: in your shirt' and 'E: business meeting' don't really refer to the small and portable nature that an attache case can have. \n4: Other options seem slightly more appropriate, but can still be eliminated. 'B: chair' refers to an attache carrying a bag, not a small and portable attache case.  'A: overhead compartment' is again referring to a bag, not an attache case, and 'C: hospital' does not require a portable version, it is already portable. \n5: Option 'A: B: chair/D: business meeting' is the remaining suitable options.  However, both 'B: chair' and 'D: business meeting' are a bit vague and unclear, leaving it difficult to decide the right one.\n6: That means the answer should be 'A: overhead compartmanet', as it refers to an attache bringing an 'attache case' into an 'overhead compartment', which makes logical sense.\nSo the final word is A: overhead compartment\n\nInput: He may be a bit of a tyrant, but with him in control, things run smoothly. Choices:  A tyrant B peaceful C pleasant D rough E quiet\nOutput: 1 The options we can eliminate are 'A: tyrant' (we are not told what kind of 'Tyrant' or any qualities of the tyrant are mentioned) and 'E: quiet', as we are told about the tyrant's qualities, and nothing is said about the way things run.\n\n2. So, the three options that can be excluded are 'A: taint', 'C: pleasant' (we are told about the taint of the tyrant, so pleasant and taint are contradictory terms), and 'E: quiet'.\n\n3. We are left with 'D: rough', as this does not require much elaboration from the reader to understand what it means.\n\n4. 'D: rough' refers", "answer": "E: business meeting"}

{"text": "1.\"What does Diving off a cliff do to a cartoon character?\" The question's answer is provided: Comedic.\n2. \"Do we know what is meant by 'comedic' here?\" The options will allow us to determine this. \n3. Comedic is an adjective that denotes things that are funny. However, the only option describing a bad result is C: Spinal Injuries.\n4. As such, we can cross off the options describing a bad result (spinal injuries and dismemberment).\n5. \"Getting wet and getting splats\" have nothing to do with humour, they just describe the nature of the situation.\n6. \"Exhilaration\" is a sensation, a feeling of excitement and happiness. It is not an action. \n7. The remaining possibility is to go with option B: dismemberment, because Dismemberment is also something that is humorous.\n8. We conclude this option is most likely as it is the only humorous choice available. \n9. Therefore, the final answer is B: dismemberment.\nSo the final solution is B: dismemberement.\n\nInput: The citation he gave was incorrect in its wording, but he corrected the what? Choices: A: facts wrong B: sentence wrong C: meaning of words D: spelling  E: sentence structure\nOutput: The wording of a citation is one of the main components.

This means the citations should accurately state the source from which the quote was taken.\n3. The options in this case describe errors in each of the following: The facts of the citation, the wording, the sentence structure, the meaning of the words, and the spelling.\n4. Since the citations contain the source of a quote and are given to people to judge the accuracy, then we know the sentence is wrong if it has any error in it, hence we can exclude the options stating anything about words or sentence.\n5. \"Meaning of the words\" is a subjective opinion, since meaning is not objective, then it can be considered as a subjective option.\n6. So as the options related to subjective views are eliminated, and leaving only the options that", "answer": "E: splats"}
{"text": "1.\"James is applying for a job that he wants\" The sentence uses the context of James being successful to define the situation where the job is a \"good fit\" and James is more likely to have the experience to suit the job better.\n2. James has applied for the job and he is waiting for their response. Hence, the question asked us to identify the qualification that he does not meet.\n3. James wants the job more so he has more hope than others if qualified, but hope is not a reason why he may worry.\n4. James is not sure if he will or will not be successful in attaining the job and if he may or may not do the job properly.\n5. Hope is generally about believing in something and that it will come true, but the sentence is asking how James is worried.\n6. The sentence tells us James is worried about not \"receiving\" the job, which means that James may have less sleep because he is worried about the job. Sleeping deprivation may cause anxiety and worry.\n7. Sleeping depravation due to anxiety and worry could explain why James is worried about receiving the job.\n8. Hence, the answer must be \"B:\"rejection\".\nSo the final answer Is B: rejection\n\nInput:The man at the shop selling those old-fashioned phones was what?

{"text": "1.The question asks us to identify a particular use or form of payment which is the focus of the sentence.\n2. This payment is in common use among many people in need of a particular service.\n3. The five options given represent different forms of payment, but each have other specific uses. \n4. \"Mailing\" or \"demand satisfaction\" are not exclusive to paying at the counter.\n5. \"Counter\" payments may also extend to the payment of money for services.\n6. \"Demands satisfaction\" also implies a personal relationship between the merchant and the customer.\n7. \"Demands\" can be interpreted differently, some individuals may not have this type of relationship - so it does not necessarily represent all forms. \n8. For all these reasons, it's clear that the answer to the question must be \"D: Paying at the merchant's place\".\nSo the final answer for this question is D: Paying at the counter \n\nInput:Too much information can be as harmful as not enough information in relation to what? Choices A: decision making B: learning C: thinking D: understanding E: teaching F: knowledge\nOutput: 1: The problem statement states that 'Too much information' can be as harmful 'as not enough information'.\n2. This suggests, according to the context, that 'not enough information' is somehow unhelpful.\n3. Eliminating the options 'd' 'e' 'a' and 'f' as these do not necessarily relate to the question.\n4. The options 'learning' and 'knowledge' mean different things and do not accurately describe the information presented in the statement, but 'decision making' and 'thinking' do.\n5. The question is asking for information relating to 'Thinking' and not 'Learning', as it doesn't make sense that too much learning would be harmful to thinking. We can then rule out 'c' and 'd' as the correct answer options.\n6. Finally, we can conclude that the answer is 'B: Learning' as learning would be more closely related to 'thinking' than 'decision making'.", "answer": "A: mail orders"}

However, \"stretch\" is a suitable way to express one's self, as stretching one muscle to relax another.\n5, option D: stretch doesn't suggest a healthy way of dealing with additions, as stretching one's muscle doesn't necessarily aid in dealing with addictions, unless one is using exercise to deal with one'a addiction.\n6, option E: weigh can be a helpful solution in that it aids \"overeat\", however, it does not provide a solution to a particular addiction, as overeating is often done to cover up one's true feelings\n7.

Choices:  A : For half a mile B: Four miles C: Eight miles D: Twenty miles E: Forty miles\nOutput: 1\".Walk to school... uphill both ways\" sounds familiar as it has been used in many TV programs, such as the popular \"Leave it to Beaver\" TV show that had many such sitcom-like situations. However, this quote does not provide a basis for a correct answer, especially since it does not mention distance which is the key point in this question.\n2. \"He walks to school... uphil both ways\" does not include any detail on how far he walks; therefore, the question does not ask about a location such as a school.\n3. \"I have to walk to school... uphall both ways,\" which does use the correct phrase but still doesn't specify distance. Walking distance does not necessarily mean uphi, either.\n4. \"He walks from California to Oregon... uphill both", "answer": "A: botanic garden"}
{"text": "1: The answer to this question should be the name of the state you are standing in, in relation to these geographical coordinates.\n2: \"If one sees a foxes\" could refer to \"if one person sees\" or \"if a plural of number of people see\"\n3: \"and is standing\" could mean there are multiple people\n4: \"standing in a landlocked,southern state\" refers to a person that is standing in the state and not just any position within the state.\n5: By analysing these conditions, we can identify if their is just one person (\"one sees\") and the state is landlocked and in the souther states (\"southern state\").\n6: So, by process of deduction,the answer is \"Louisiana\", as the state is landlocked, south, and louisiana is one of the southern states.\nSo the final is Louisiana\n\nInput: John is a famous writer ____ he has a short story and a novel that has been translated into dozens of languages. Choices:  A; for B: in C; on D; from\nOutput: 1; The question is asking us what connects John a famous writer to two of his works.\n2: As there are only two options, the first is unlikely and not relevant to the sentence.\n3: The word 'from' is correct for the other option. This is because each sentence ends with a prepositional phrase \"that has been translated into\"; so you need to start from here and work backwards.\n4: The first is John, is the subject of the sentence but from can not apply as John is the writer of the two works and is not the subject in question and is not involved in the translation.\n5: The second prepositional phrase is \"that has been translated\". The thing that has been translated is not John but his works.\n6: Now the question is, what goes between John and translated.\n7: The only thing could be the \"from\", that is the object of the preposition as in the example \"Sam went to school from Monday to Friday.\"\n8: John as the writer and his works being translated, must be on the noun following \"from\".\n9: As 'on' is not correct, the word 'for' must be correct for the second option A; for.\n10: By process of deduction, the", "answer": "E: arkansas"}

C: An emergency room would not provide contraceptives 4. D: A drawer can provide contraceptives  5. E: A medicine cabinet can provide contraceptives. \nWe see that these options are essentially synonymous. They all have the same meaning: a container that holds an object. Since the question specifies where one would get one, they are the same.\nSo the final option is E: medicine cabinet\n\nInput: To whom are the lines addressed in the following passage? Choices:  I, a father  II, the boy  III, the mother  IV, the friend Choices: A: I I and II A: II I and III B: IV II and III C: I II and IV D: I III and IV E: IV III and II F: None Correct Answer: I II and IV\nOutput: I. This question requires us to determine to whom three lines in the passage are addressed: the first, the second, and the third. Let us examine each of these lines in turn.\n2. The second line begins with the words \"'Twas on that day\" thus suggesting that it is the mother who is speaking. It then refers to her son as \"my little angel of God\". This line is then repeated by the speaker in the same manner after their friend has told them that \"the boy was not at home\".\n\n3. The third line continues with the words \"You see I was wrong\", which are followed by the phrase \"it was my boy that had broken the bell\" This suggests that the speaker is the boy's mother, not the father.\nWe can therefore conclude that in all probability, it is the mother to whom these lines are addressed.\nSo the final Option is: I, II and IV", "answer": "A: health center"}

A Hill cannot be described as a giant hole or as a plain.\n5.\"B: Gorge\" is also out of context here.\n6.\"C: Sandplain\" is not a type of plain either.\n7.\"D: Cliff\" can be described as a giant ledge.\n8.\"E: Mountain\" is the only choice that is both descriptive of the situation and related to the question itself. It makes sense that a \"mountain\" could be called a \"hole\" and a \"plain\" could also be called \"mountain\".\nSo the final answer would be E: Mountain\n\nInput: Everyone knows I've been working hard lately so as a result I must be what? Choices: A: exhausted B: energized C: sleepy D: energetic E: tired\nOutput: 1.) Everyone knows I'm working hard lately (indicating that the result is \"I'm working hard lategy\")\n2.)  As a result I must be (meaning the option must follow on from the previous)\n3.) must be exhausted (indicated by the fact that exhausted is an adverb meaning the verb worked hard lately occurred in the past)\n4.) tired (indicated by past tense of exhausted being in past tense rather than the present tense of working)\n5.) energized (indicated by verb in the future tense being exhausted rather than working, which occurred in the past) \n6.) Exhausted = exhausted\n7.)

{"text": "Based on the context, \"go for run\" suggests that the sentence is referring to the physical result of a run, as opposed to the sensation or feelings associated with it.\n1. As \"sense of flight\" often refers to being airborne as a result of a \"run,\" we can eliminate Option A: \"satisfaction.\"\n2. \"trip\" is also excluded as it connotes an unexpected or unexpected fall, rather than the physical effects of running.\n3. The feeling of sweat or \"heat\" would likely not be associated with a physical effect of a run but instead a result of an unpleasant condition.\n4. Therefore, \"sweat\" and \"the result of a run\" can therefore be eliminated from the options.\n5. The option that best describes the after effects of a run is \"falling down\" as this refers specifically to the physical effects caused when running.\n6. Therefore Option D: \"tripping down\" and Option E: \"falling\" are both options are correct, as these indicate negative after effects of running.\nSo the final answers are D: falling and/or E: falling\n\nInput:The new school building in the village is a nice and big structure, built to what? Choices A: accommodate the village B: attract the students C: attract the locals D: attract new pupils E: satisfy the teachers\nOutput: 1: The sentence structure in this question provides the clues to the wording, \"The new school building in a village is a nice and BIG structure, built TO WHAT?\"\n2: The sentence structure provides clear indications of the wording. The sentence consists of three clauses; the one which directly precedes the first three options, and a parenthetical clause.\n3. The parenthetical clause describes the school building as \"a nice and big structure.\"\n4. This provides an example of the wording, \"built TO WHAT?\".\n5. Additionally, Option A: \"Accommodate the village\" could imply that the building was constructed with the size limitations of the village in mind.\n6. This is not necessarily true for a new school building, as its aim is not to accommodate the villagers but instead, the students in the village who have outgrown their previous building.\n7. Hence, options A and B: \"Accommodating the village", "answer": "A: satisfaction"}

{"text": "1.\"A lonely man committed a suicide\" means that a lonely man kill himself.\n2. If a lonely man feels happy, why would he commit suicide? The answer must be one of the following: he did not want more suffering, avoid problems or unhappiness, or end the pain.\n3. If he wants to end pain, unhappiness, and problems, the possible answers that meet these criteria include A:suffering B: he was unhappy C: avoid problems D:\"he was happy\", and E:end pain. \n4. So we have to eliminate A and B, which are irrelevant because they do not represent the man's state. \n5. D is an inappropriate answer as it suggests that a happy guy will kill himself by choice.\n6. In conclusion, the only valid options remaining are A and C, which can both be eliminated because in the context of the entire question, \"was happy\" and \"avoid problems\" do not have the same meaning since avoiding problems sounds like it would make a guy less happy.\n7. So the answer must be C: Avoid problems because this makes the most sense for the sentence.\nSo the final answers is C: Avoid problems\n\nInput: A new restaurant has opened in town offering home made meals, all kinds of vegetables, and what? Choices: A: pizza B: pasta C: sandwiches D: soup E: bread\nOutput: Answer: Option B: pasta\n1. This question is asking what the restaurant is offering.\n2. We can eliminate C: sandwiches and E: bread.\n3. A: pizza and D: soup do not make sense since the restaurant is not offering pizza or soup in the list. Option A: pizza B:\"pasta\" C:\"sandwiches\", and D: soup do make sense.\n4. Option C: sandwiches is a valid choice, but it does not fit the given context. The restaurant only offers home-made meals, as well as vegetables and either a sandwich or pasta.\n5. The question does not mention any veggies, so the answer must be A:pasta, since the other two options are wrong, since it only offers to vegetables, not all kinds of vegetables.\n6. So the final answers is B:", "answer": "D: unhappy"}

We can eliminate any options that aren't tasks that you could use a dictionary with.\n4. Option A: 'Do crossword puzzle' may be a task involving a dictionary, but this doesn't help deal with boredom.\n5. Option B: 'See art' may help you with creativity, but you don't want to solve boredom, just help you in general.\n6. Option C: 'Give up' cannot be a task with a dictionary, either you use the dictionary, or you quit trying.\n7. Option D: 'Grocery shop' does not have to be done as a group activity, so cannot help with boredom. \n8. Option E: 'Play chess' may be a task with a chess dictionary, but it still requires you to interact with another person to fulfill successfully, so cannot help with solitary boredom.\n9. However, the only option left is 'Play chess', which may involve your friends or colleagues, so it's not entirely relevant.

No other option has a relation with the main idea.\n7. It can be seen that 2 out of the 3 options can be eliminated.\n8. \"Not from the federal reserve\" refers to a note not from a government agency, so \"D: Not from the government\" must be the answer.\n9. \"Not from the Government\" means that a note is unissued by the government.\nSo the final decision is D: Not from the government\n\n# Input: What's something you", "answer": "C: blacksmith's shop"}
{"text": "1..The question is asking what students are trying to do, not why, so it is reasonable to exclude \"become adult\", and \"further education\" as we seek a term which focuses on what students \"are doing\".\n2. This leaves the remaining options of A, B, C and D.\n3. The answer of \"A: study philosophy\" can be disqualified as it doesn't refer to \"why they are trying to do something\".\n4. The answer of \"B: become adult\" can be eliminated as it doesn't mean \"trying to do\" but instead describes the desired outcome of the students' activities.\n5. A possible reason for eliminating the answer of \"C: ask questions\" is that it suggests that students are \"doing\", a general term that could refer to other activities that they are involved with.\n6.

A necklace should never be screwed, it is delicate.\n4. A wall outlet fixture is a specific attachment which also wouldn't be screwed onto something else.\n5. A tool box can contain both screws and other objects, so it is not an accurate description of what is being screwed onto something.\n6. In relation to this, a computer is also inaccurate as it is unlikely to have a chain ring attached to it.\n7.

Choices:  A, B, C D E\nOutput: 1: It's better to tell someone what you do want, rather than what you don't.\n2 The question refers to the sentence \"It's best to tell\", thus it is imperative rather than indicative.\n3 It doesn't matter whether they hear what you want or not because they can just get it wrong either way. All that matters is that you are clear in what you want.\n4 B,C,D are inappropriate: In \"B: Telling someone what you want\" you don't tell them what you don't like. But the opposite is correct in the real world.\n5 In \"C: Get it wrong anyway\" it's not really telling, because you \"GET\" what they give, and this differs from receiving. It isn't telling at all. It's receiving.\n6 In \"D: You're clear\" they are no longer clear about what he wants them to bring.\n7 The correct answer must be \"A: Exactly\". This is an indicative sentence and it is essential to tell exactly what you want.\nSo the final and correct answer is A: Exactly\n\nInput: Which of the following was the only American woman to win the World Figure Skating Championships?

{"text": "1.\"Where would you find some'swords' in your house?\" The question is asking where one would locate swords in their home, not whether they own swords.\n2. Options A and B may be relevant, as a sword and a scabbard are essentially the same thing, however, in common parlance, they are separate items, and scabbards being a thing in which to store blades are rarely referred too as such. The term'sheath' refers to a place, such as a scabbard, rather than the article which it stores.\n3. Options C and D are incorrect, as no one would collect swords at home, and the container called 'Scabbard' doesn't contain them.\n4. Option E is incorrect, as it is not in people's homes.\n5.

{"text": "1.\" The question states that the garage had light sensing and automatic doors, which is a feature commonly found in modern houses, and that it was not a townhouse or a neighbor's house (as these have no garages).\n2. Therefore, the only potential matches are a modern house or a downtown house.\n3. The question does not specifically say which type of house was being referred to as it could be either type without contradicting the information given.\n4. It is not explicitly stated that downtown houses do not have garages, which the question implies. However, downtown houses are likely to have multiple vehicles parked outside in a small space, leading the reader to assume they do not have garages; so they would instead have to choose \"modern house\" as their answer.\n5. If the question stated that the garage and automatic doors referred to a single building of an unknown type, then there would be no choice unless there was some way to determine what type of building it was, and this is not possible as the reader does not know the house in question. \n6. Thus, the choices available would be \"modern house\" and \"garage\".\n7. In this case, the question could be interpreted as \"What type of house had light sensing and auto doors in the garage?\"\n8. Hence, the answer for this is A: modern house\n9.

If \"came back\", \"at home\", and \"home team\" were the result of \"Billy's parents were fighting\", this would mean Billy wasn't in these places, which contradicts the question's information: Billy was at home.\n5. The options that could reasonably be the answer are \"present\" and \"charming\". 6. \"Home\", \"home team\", \"at home\", \"came back\", and \"charming\" are irrelevant to Billy's actions in relation to the question's previous statements.\n7. Option \"present\" is the correct answer because, while present may have been the place from which Billy's parents were fighting, it did not result in Billy's action of \"going away.\"\n8. Option \"charming\" is not the correct choice. Charming could not be a reason to go away without having the intention to return.\nSo the final correct answer is Present.", "answer": "C: at home"}
{"text": "1.. The question states where most people keep their magazines, so it is asking us to choose which out of the 5 choices is most likely to contain magazines\n2. We can eliminate choices A,B and C, as the question specifies 'where they keep magazines', so places which don't typically contain them, such as Bokstore,library and doctor, are not a likely choice.\n3. Now looking at choices D: home and E: table- there is a conflict in the question, with choice E: table stating that magazines 'keep on a table' and choice D: home stating the opposite- 'keep at home' \n4. However, the answer can be based on personal preference (keeping at home) and we should also make a note that the question is not looking for a literal answer, but most likely answer.\n5. If there are any other choices that conflict like this, ignore the question, and simply select the choice that you believe to be most likely. (ie. in this case E: Table).\n6. After eliminating E: table, what you should note, is the 2 remaining choices- D and E. Since the two choices conflict, it becomes impossible to make a final decision as to which of the two is more likely.\n7. What you should do in this case, is to select the one choice that you believe is most likely to be closest to being correct. (ie. in our example choice E: Table would have been a slightly incorrect answer. However, you can select E: home instead since E: Table is not an option.\n8. This rule applies when two choices conflict. What you can do is select which one has the highest probability of being correct, since you cant conclusively rule it out with certainty. (ie. if you believe the person who keeps their newspapers on a table also keeps their magazines on a table, you may choose that as the answer instead of the conflicting one).\n9. This method of thinking works when eliminating multiple conflicting choices. If you can't choose the one that would most likely be correct, you may select the one you think is the closest to being correct, and you can apply that reasoning to almost all question types after this.\n10. To conclude, the answer to that specific question is 'E: Home', however the thinking rules you have just learned from analyzing those choices", "answer": "E: table"}

Option \"C\": \"High\" may seem like a suitable choice, but this is referring to the height of the building, as its name suggests.\n5. Option \"D\": \"Huge\" may also seem suitable but this too is describing the sheer size of the building's physical dimensions.\n6.

{"text": "1.\"Prostitute\" is a word that conjures up mental imagery of someone making a living as a prostitute but it's not likely for a person doing this to take up a career.\n2. Thus, the best answer fits the image of someone doing this \"work\", as a profession or a source of income, as in the options B, C, D are not likely choices for a \"professional prostitute\".\n3. Option A \"New York\" is an incorrect choice as it doesn't represent the likely place or time of a \"professional\" prostitute.\n4. Finally, the chosen answer is \"whorehouse\" as someone who wishes to offer services and make a source of income from this, is likely to do it at a whorehouse.", "answer": "B: whorehouse"}
{"text": "1.'Why would you not want' means why wouldn't one want to work with wood?\n2.The question is not why there are issues one might have working with wood, or how hard it is to work with wood, but the reason why one wouldn't want to work with wood.\n3. The other suggestions are not accurate for describing wooden working. There is no frustration in working with this material, so eliminating frustration.\n4. There is no issue about how someone gets paid for working with it, so eliminating being paid.\n5. People typically want to make money or at least earn what they get paid, so eliminating wanting to make money.\n6. Money has to do with the value of an object not with wood itself. So money is not a reason to not want to work with wood and can be eliminated from the list.\n7. You would not want to use wood at work because of the blisters it might give you.\n8. So the answer is 'e'.\nSo the final answer would be E: blisters \n\nInput: \"If I were you, I would pay this bill immediately.\" He said to her. Choices: A: right B: ok C: very good D: good E: wrong\nOutput: 1.\"If I were you\" Means \"If you were me\". So the narrator doesn't mind paying the bill. He didn't say it to himself, he's referring to someone else. \n2. Because this isn't a sentence for choosing opinion from someone else it makes sense for a choice to be \"Good\". All other choices are opinions of the narrator.\nSo the final choice would be B: Ok \n\nInput: We need to change schools tomorrow to a new building where no one has ever been killed. Choices: A.  To B. Of C. The D. In E. With F. Out \nOutput: 1 We are the pronoun \"we\" that needs to change schools. All the other options are not us.\n2\"Need\" in \"need to change\" implies that the change would be necessary and something that can't be done without. All choices seem to be optional choices, except maybe the one where \"Need\" is not used. \n3. The options that use \"To\" are not required, only the final choice", "answer": "A: blisters"}
{"text": "1: By using \"a lot\" in this sentence. the question is suggesting a high quantity.\n2. The following statements about the two choices that don't mean \"a lot\". \n3.  \"Ignoring\" refers to someone consciously avoiding someone or something and not including them in their plans.\n4. She didn't intend to ignore him, but she certainly did. \n5. \"Being rude\" refers to acting in a deliberately discourteous manner, not in a way that could be interpreted as an effort to hurt someone's feelings.\n6. \"Being ruthlessly blunt and truthful\" (BBC)\n7.  \"The use of the phrase 'frank contempt' also indicates that the term 'contempt' is meant as a compliment,\" (Merriam Webster) \n8. Therefore, both \"A: Ignoring\" and \"B: Being rude\" should be removed.\n9.  \"Disparagement\" means belittling someone or something, often in a public way.\n10. \"C: Disparagement\" is the correct option.\n11. By the same token, the phrase \"disparaging remarks\" should be interpreted as being positive and thus \"D: Contumely\" should also be discarded.\n12. Thus, \"Between 'C disparagement' and 'D contumely,' the latter is more useful in this context. It suggests the hostility and intensity that \"contumely\" includes implies that many were not as positive about her as John was.\" (Grammar Girl).\n13. So the option to select is \"C: Disparagemet\"\n14. \"Contumely is a formal term that connotes a very high level of offence and offensive intent.\"( Collins)\n15. Hence, \"contumely\" means extreme disrespect.\n16. So the final answer is C: Disparagement", "answer": "C: disparagement"}
{"text": "1 and 2. The question presents a narrative scenario and is asking for the next action that the gambler carries out.\n3 and 4. As the question is stating that the gambler previously has been winning, this indicates that they are not going to quit.\n5. Given this, the most logical action is to carry on playing, and this is further reinforced by the option C: compete.\nSo the final action is C: compete. \n\n### Instruction:Answer the multiple choice questions.\n\nInput: I'm just going to hang out at the bookstore and see what the mood is like, so I'm going there how? Choices:  the most the latest one can decide A: all the time B: as many as C: whenever D: not at least E: at any times\nOutput: 1-2. The statement suggests that he is not sure yet which bookstore is the best one to go to so he wants to check both in order to know.\n3. The choice D: not at least is invalid because you cannot assume that the best bookstore is not at least great.\n4. Therefore, the choices which describe a way of viewpoint are the ones of importance so they are: A: all the time, B: as many as, C: whenever, and D: at any times all describing a way of viewpoint and all can be ruled out.\n5. So the question is referring to two bookstores, so you have to decide on the choice that works with the word \"both\" which is one of the two other words with a different meaning.\n6. \"Both\" describes two things whereas \"All\", \"As many as\", \"Whenever\", and \"At any times\" describe a number of things.\n7. So we have to choose the remaining two choices.\n8. The most logical one to pick is the choice \"all the time\" as he is trying to decide which bookstore is the better one to go to, not the better store of all.\nSo the final word is A: all the time.\n\nInput: If a new friend offers to share her umbrella when it's raining, she'll make sure that which of the following?

{"text": "1.\"What treatment might an old-time doctor have tried to accomplish\". The question is posing the idea that there is a historical connotation to the practice of using leeches, indicating that leeches were once a widely accepted and popular treatment, as the first portion of the sentence suggests.\n2. The idea here is not to speculate on an old-time doctor's motivations for using leeches, but to determine what they were actually trying to accomplish.\n3. The options do not directly reflect their motivations, they only represent aspects of the practice itself such as performing surgery, studying medicine, and letting blood.\n4. In contrast, \"letting blood\" is a more literal representation of what an old-time doctor may have been trying to accomplish, as it refers to the medical treatment that leeches were used for.\n5. Therefore, the answer is E. \n6. Moreover, the remaining options may be considered as reasonable motives which old-time doctors may have had, but they do not represent the main intention behind the use of leeches, as is implied in the question.\nSo the final answers are the options let blood.", "answer": "E: let blood"}

Other objectives might include \"having fun\", \"racing\", \"claiming the prize\", etc., but their primary aim is to \"score points\" as per the current context.\n\n1. For this, answer D must be eliminated as it is the aim to \"score points\" and isn't directly related to their objective.\n2. Similarly, answer E is also not feasible as it does not directly relate to the game in progress.\n3. Answer A \"bounce the ball\" is also incorrect as it isn't an objective of the game, rather is a component of a larger set of \"rules\" of the game where \"baskets\" are scored.\n4. Answers C and B can be eliminated as well as they are not a part of the current game being played.\n5. Thus, the answer must be \"B: compete\", which is the overall objective of a game in general where both sides aim to win.\nSo the final correct answer is B: compete", "answer": "E: score points"}

She never achieved what? Choices: A: her self esteem B: satisfaction C: ambition D: goals E: security\nOutput: 1:  The question states that she never married and was what everyone else wanted, but was never who she wanted to be. It is asking for choice B, Satisfaction, to explain why she never achieved it. \n2:  Based on the context, it is understood that \"she\" is a girl or woman, so the options that exclude her are:  A: Her Self Esteem, B: Satisfaction, C: Ambition, and D: Goals.\n3:  Option E: Security is not the reason why one cannot achieve satisfaction.  Satisfaction can be achieved despite not being what one wants to do. \n4:  The option remaining was A: Her Self Este.  This is the most likely option to mean self-satisfaction and the reason may be lack thereof for never achieving their desired end result.\n5:  This choice fits with what is being asked. \n6:  Therefore the answer is A: Her Self Este\n\nInput: She put down her purse and was relieved of the tension between what?

Not only are clouds visiable, they are visible more from higher points\n4) Although a medieval castle has a tall tower, the question states that James looked out the window, so he would be able to see clouds from the highest part of his tower\n5) In conclusion, James could only reside in a tower or in a city, this is the only logical option.

'Cash Register' is not where clerk places checks, neither is 'Throw away' as money must be exchanged between the person writing the check and the clerk. 'Desk Drawer' is the only option remaining which is not an unsuitable term for this question. 3: From the question, we can assume that the 'pay envelope' is of a different color than what is used by the clerk to keep the check in the 'desk drawer'. The pay envelope is to be used by the clerk for making change for the person who has written the check, implying that the pay envelope is not of personal use to the clerk like a check will be for the clerk himself. 4: Hence, it must be 'Desk Drawer'. 5: This is to establish that one has not made a mistake. A 'Throw away' is not always 'incorrect'; there are some things that are truly 'waste of money'; it must be checked whether the clerk is throwing away the check after receiving it. 6: In short, a check will be kept in the 'desk draw' by the clerk for providing change to the person. 7: 'Box' in this case, is not appropriate for storing any documents; it is more related to holding things together like boxes in a store hold items together. 8: Therefore 'Box' must be excluded and 'Desk Drawer', the remaining one will be the correct answer.\nSo the final answers is D: desk drawer\n\n\nInput: An electrician is shocked when he works near what?

That leaves us with \"Wrong\" and \"Everyone, but not feeling it\"\n6. After some thinking, there's always been something else that made me feel like i didn't belong, that everyone thought that love was wrong (or that they're wrong for it).\n7. So the correct answer is D : love is painfull and feels wrong and that there's also another reason why people feel it, but it seems everyone is right in trying it\nSo the final answer \nis D : Love is painfull and feels  Wrong, and there's also another \nreason why people feel it,  but it seems everyone is  right in trying it\n\nInput:  The two most important days in your life are: _______ and _______ \nChoices:  A: When you're born, When you discover the value of \nB: When you find out what you want, When you find out what is \nC: When you fall in love, When you discover the meaning of \nD: When you become a parent, When you go to heaven \nE: When you die\nOutput: 1 The most important days in someone's life is \"When you're born\". \"When you fall in love\" is more important for a romantic relationship that is why the question refers to someone.

You do not exactly have to go to the party.\n3. In fact, by now we can eliminate the option B as 'you do not call the 911 before you go to the party, because then you might go to the party'. 4. We can also eliminate the option C because 'you do not get drunk before you go to the the party, because there is a certain amount of time required between both these actions. 5. Now it is obvious that you do not do E before, so we should eliminate the option E as well.\n6.

{"text": "The question is requesting a response from a cat, that sounds normal, rather than being one-sided.\n1. \"See King\" is unlikely as it is in reference to a specific king and not a reference to any king in general.\n2. Also, this is very specific because the response comes from a cat, who normally \"meow\", \"drink water\" and \"live many years\".\n3. Hence, A can be rejected.\n4. Similarly, B can be recalled as it is not a general response.\n5. \"Hello\" is the opposite as this sounds one-sided and not a general response; the answer could either be \"hello\" or \u201cmeow\u2019.\n6. Hence, B and C can also be rejected.\n7. On the other hand, D is the choice which is most likely to be expected as it is a general response that is most commonly expected from a cat; it is not one-sided. \n8.

The difference between settling something and settling everything is that the former does not involve everything ending because a compromise is reached.\n5. When settling everything, everything ends by settling the relationship and it is not guaranteed for everything ending if they settle. Hence, the choices are \"settle everything\" and \"kill bill\".\n6: If Johnny chooses to have a relationship with someone, they cannot kill that person. Choices cannot be A: control people and kill bill, so the answer is B: settle everything.\nSo the final choice is C: settle everything\n\nInput: The doctor decided to put in a pacemaker before putting a bandage on the gash on the neck.

The question is asking for the name of a European country which is famous for its potatoes.\n4. It's important that both the country and the industry be specified in order to produce a correct answer.\n5. No other country is listed with 'European' so that eliminates a, b, and c.\n6. 'Ireland' is not a country but a region, therefore it does not answer the question.\n7. Therefore it's likely that B: cassero is the correct answer.\n8.

{"text": "1, The question asks what typically happens to a drunk's speech after they become intoxicated, and eliminating some of the options.\n2. The sentence can be read as having a negative tone, in which case \"Regret\" or \"Talk Nonsense\" could be suitable.\n3. It can also be read as having a positive tone, in which case, \"automobile accidents\" would be a fitting choice.\n4. It can even be read as neutral, in which case, none of these four options can adequately account for any changes in a drunk's behaviour.\n5. It is therefore most logical to select \"D: talking nonsense\", as this is the only option with a generally negative undertone; \"Driving\" is obviously an action, and \"Accidents\" is ambiguous.\n6. \"Intelligent\" is often associated with positive qualities, but as the drunk does not remain \"intelligent\" whilst drunk, it would not be an appropriate answer.\n7. \"Regret\" would work as an answer but may lead to ambiguity as to what the person may \"regret\" whilst drunk.\n8. Similarly, \"accidents\" would work as an example but may be ambiguous when deciding if it is or isn't due to their intoxication.\n9. Hence, D is the correct answer.\nSo the final choice is D: talking nonsensically\n\nInput:The person who has the most amount of knowledge about Shakespeare is often considered to the man who.

The choice of the answer 'there' in the sentence shows that it is a singular noun 'a', not a non singular noun 'A'.\n3. As 'a' denotes a single location and 'A' plural nouns. This shows that choice E is the correct noun to answer the question.\n4. E: A waterfall: As the question is \"where\", the noun required is a singular noun and since there are no other noun which contains both singular and plural forms of noun as the other choices. we know that choice E is the best answer.\n5.

It shouldn't be \"D: make mistakes\" as humans don't make mistakes to reproduce. Humans make mistakes in other ways.\n6. \"Hear sounds\" doesn't make much sense as humans hear some sounds and don't hear some sounds and it is definitely not reproduction to hear sounds.\n7. So for correct answer, humans make mistakes and reproduce and eat ice cream when they want to reproduce is not a good answer because humans also eat ice cream when do not want to reproduce.\n8.

The options 'A: apologize' and 'D: Ignore him' do not fit into the context of the question.\n3. The question says you had to 'have' so there is no option 'C: ignored him'.\n4.

The phrasing of \"who lives close to you\" in the question further emphasizes the need to be closer to your friend than your workplace.\n3. As a result, we can eliminate options of \"B: bus station\" and \"D: neighbor's house\".\n4. The phrasing of the question further leads us to eliminate the option of \"A: workplace\" too.\n5. We can conclude that the only viable choice must be \"E: At school\".\nSo the final answer must be E: at school\n\nInput:When some time ago in London at a party, I met a person who lives in the South of France  Choices:  A.: The man you met lives in the south Choices:  A. The man you met lives  in the South  B. In The South  C. You met  the man who lives in the South  D. You met the man who lives in The South Choices:  E. In which I met The Man who lived in The South \nOutput:The question contains multiple instances of the word 'you', 'person', 'the man' and'met'. This shows that the question is regarding an experience of the person who is describing it, and can be categorized as a first-person narrative.\n2. Secondly, the question states that 'you met' someone at a party in London. This suggests that the narrative is taking place in London and refers to a past event.\n3. Therefore, the final answer is that the man who is being referred to 'lived' in the south of France, and the option is 'D: The man you met lives In The South'.\nSo the final answer to be selected is D: The man you met lived in The South\n\nInput: The old man came into the restaurant and asked for the check.

{"text": "1. The question asks for the place where one stores dishes.\n2. The options 'apartment' and 'pantry' are not logical answers to this question.  Apartments are self-contained homes, whereas pantries are storage or cupboards and are generally placed in kitchens.  In this sense, these options should be rejected. \n3. 'Bookshelves' generally refer to where one stores their books.\n4. This indicates that the answer for this question should not be a bookshelf. \n5. Hence,'shelf' can be said to be the answer given.\nSo the final answwr is C: couch\n\nInput: What is the name of the city in which the world's tallest building is located? Choices: 1. A: Dubai 2. B: New York\nOutput:1.  The question asks for the name of city in which the world\u2019s tallest building is/are located.\n2. The word \u2018which\u2019 denotes plural form \u2018which means there are more than one tallest building.The question asked about not the tallest building, but tallest building \u2018S\u2019.This means only one tallest building is asked. i.e. only answer will be single tallest building, not the tallest buildings(plural form).\nSo the final answww is a:Dubai\n\nInput: Which would not be a possible answer to the question, \"Where do you usually store dishes?\" Choices: A. living room B. kitchen C. table D. pantry E. shelf F. apartment\nOutput:1. To answer the question correctly and complete the puzzle, you must remove the option which would be a possible answer to \"Where do you usually **store** dishes?\"\n2. \"Living room\" refers to a room used to entertain guests, and is therefore not a likely location for storing dishware.\n3. \"Kitchen\" refers to a room where food is prepared, but it is also the room where dishes are placed, so this would NOT be a possible answer to where dishes are stored.\n4. \"Table\" could be a possible answer, but remember that in the question asked this was already eliminated as a possible answer (see Step 1).\n5. \"Pantry\" means \"room for food\" and is also", "answer": "B: pantry"}
{"text": "1)\"Yell\" suggests a form of communication. We know this, but we haven't yet decided whether it's the children, the parents or both who are being yelled at.\n2. This narrows our answer choices to options A-D.\n3. Amongst these, options B-D specifically describe methods of communication between a parent and a child.\n4. So, if we were to pick a more broad answer, that doesn\u2019t exclude other communication methods, it would have to be option A.\n5. We\u2019ve excluded options C and D for two reasons.\n6. One, we know that parents yell at chaos, not their children.\n7. Two, options C and D describe communication with a parent, not from a parent. Yelling doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a parent is communicating their thoughts to the child (as yelling can also be a way of expressing anger). \n8. So, as we don\u2019t know their intentions for the yelling, we haven\u2019t eliminated option A.\n9. The question then asks us what these parents are trying to do by yelling.\n10. So, option A: guide children fits best (as it is a form of instruction), which is also a method of communication.\nSo the finalanswer is A : Guide children", "answer": "C: control children"}
{"text": "1.\"What could there be in..\" refers to the nature and extent of options, rather than a specific object.\n2. 'City' and \"Strip mall\" are locations rather than items, and are thus excluded.\n3. 'Clerk' is a person, not a place or object.\n4. 'Neighborhood' is a location as well, and is excluded.\n5. 'rooster' is an animal, and is also excluded.\n6. Hence, the correct answer is \"E: rooster\", as this represents a physical object.\nSo the final result is E: rooster\n\nInput: A number of individuals at the dinner were involved in what? Choices: A: politics B: sports C: drama D: music E: science\nOutput: 1.'Involved' refers to an action which implies 'involved, involved with, having to do with.' This precludes the other options which are merely nouns and refer to an 'involved' person.\n2. None of these options are 'involved in' politics, sports, drama, music or science.\n3. 'Politics' is a noun and is excluded. 'Sports' is a noun.\n4. 'Drama' is a noun, and is excluded as well.\n5. 'Music' is a noun as well.\n6. Hence the correct answer must be'sciences', as it's the only one of the five options, which is used in the active voice. Hence the final answer is E\"sciences\"\n\nInput: The woman was very happy when she returned to what? Choices A: the store B: the hotel C: her parents  D: her boyfriend E: her room\nOutput:1.The term 'The woman was very happy when..' represents a 'cause and effect' pattern, describing how/why the woman was feeling happy.\n2.There is no option which clearly links the woman's happiness to the cause, rather than to the result.\n3.The options 'The Store', 'The hotel' and 'Her parents' only mention her happiness as an effect, and not as a cause.\n4.'Her boyfriend' is the only remaining option.\n5.Thus, the final answer is D.\nSo final result is D", "answer": "C: clerk"}
{"text": "1. The question asks, \"what feeling might propel [one] to instituting civil [action],\" indicating that the answer is a feeling, rather than an action.\n2. The options do not provide much clarity, as multiple possibilities could apply.\n3. Eliminating \"companies\" and \"trial\" from the options, we can then focus more on the feelings of the party.\n4. \"Compuclations\" is a possibility, as this would indicate a possible cause for civil action.\n5. Eliminating \"anger\" and \"court case\" we are left with \"Tiredness\", due to its implications of being unable to perform tasks correctly, which could lead to civil action.\n6. Hence, \"Anger\" is best avoided, and its unlikely that civil action would occur due to \"complications\". So, the answer must be \"D: tiredness\" as the question asks for the feeling/motivation that drives the party to action- not its specific outcome.\nSo the final answers is D: Tiredness\n\nInput: Why do I love New York? Choices: 1.A: The way it always looks better no matter how bad it gets. 2.B: The subway. It\u2019s always there even if you need it at a terrible hour on a terrible day. 3.C: The way you walk the same street day after day with the feeling it will never be the same. 4.D: The gothic subway stations. 5.E: People watching. You get to eavesdrop on stories so much better than the books.\nOutput:1.The question suggests that there may be several reasons for loving New York, and the answer here is to do with appreciating the qualities of the city, rather than anything specific about it.\n2. \"The Subway. It's always there even if it needs it at a terrible hour.\" is an example of enjoying something in general, rather than specifically about the city.\n3. \"The way you walk the same streets day after day with the same feeling it will never change\" is also an example of appreciating the city. This could be said of anywhere- not necessarily New York\n4. Similarly, \"The Gothic subway stations\" is an example of the beauty for the sake of beauty, and not a specific part of New York, so the", "answer": "C: anger"}
{"text": "1.\"Where can you buy a...\" is a yes/no question, and the options are where you buy things, so any answer besides a store would be incorrect.\n2. Answers B and E are out because there are no fishing camps that are likely to sell fishing rods, unless it is in addition to other camping equipment.\n3. Answers D and A are also out because these are stores which sell other things such as tools, cooking equipment, etc.\n4. This leaves us with answers C and F. Since this question is referring to where to buy a fishing rod, neither C nor F provides an answer that fits the situation. Therefore the correct answer must be answer C, which is Hardware Store.\n\nInput:How do we know how many stars the Great Nebula in Orion has? Choices: 1. By counting the stars. 2. By seeing the shapes. 3. By the stars' brightness. 4. By the distance from the earth. 5. The brightness and sizes of individual stars. Output:\n1. This is wrong, since we know that stars are innumerable. Therefore they cannot be counted unless an upper bound is also provided.\n2. We can conclude that this is also incorrect through elimination as well. All the other options are related to viewing the stars, whereas option 2 states directly that we can see the shapes of the stars.\n3. Brightness is measured by some instrument (light years, etc.) whereas the question asks about the number of visible stars.\n4. As it takes an enormous amount of time and effort to even get a rough estimate of the distance from earth to Andromeda galaxy, which is visible 150 light years away, how would one hope to calculate the distance to the nearest star? Therefore this option should also be discarded.\n5. This is the only option which contains both the distance from earth and the brightness or sizes of individual stars. Option 5 must be correct.\n\nInput:He bought the best kind of tomatoes, but they had what? Choices: A. Bad taste B. Green C. Large D. Small E.

{"text": "1&2. The options can be analysed as follows; \n3. A: This option doesn't make sense at face value as cards are not an activity intended to be amused by. This option is a literal answer that cannot support an implied meaning.\n\"3. C: Charmed? How could playing cards be a charmed action? It's not amusical in the sense that playing cards do something other than being played.\n4. B: This is a confusing option as it's literally an explanation of why the family is playing cards, not the reason.\n5. D: This option states an intended goal, but does not necessarily explain why they are doing it, but it is related. The answer cannot be that the family is having fun, the main idea of the scenario is focused around the outcome of winning money.\n6. E: The main idea of the question is: what reason is there for the family to be playing cards? So option E: \"win money\" is the most logical and simplest option, which could be easily omitted if it were not an answer.\nSo the final answers are D: having fun OR E: win money\n\nInput: The students were excited because they will have the opportunity to present in front of the class. What does \"present\" mean? Choices:  a: explain b: read c: argue d: show something e: do something fun\nOutput: 1,2,7,&8. The sentence can be restructured to state: \"The students were excited because they know that they will have the opportunity ___.\"\n2. Present, as used, indicates that the students are participating in an activity.\n3. Reading indicates they are listening to something.\n4. Arguing indicates that they are debating with another person.\n5. Show something indicates that they are demonstrating an item.\n6. Do something fun indicates that they are playing a game.\n7. Do something fun indicates a different meaning to the sentence as it relates to a class being fun and entertaining to attend.\n8. So the answer seems to relate directly to an activity: _ _ Present. The options don't suggest a single word option that directly answers the question, as \"be\" would not work, the action could only happen in the future.\nSo the only option to answer the question is A: \"explain\".\nSo", "answer": "D: having fun"}
{"text": "1.\"The woman experienced great joy\" means that she was happy or pleased at some event or thing. In the sentence, it's referring to the birth of her son.\n2. \"....and despite that\" signifies that despite this joy, the next word will be opposite, or opposite meaning, as there is an inversion.\n3. The following word that contradicts this feeling is \"This was a sadness. This means that her state of mind was sad, that she was unhappy.\n4. \"Despite that\" and \"was\" indicates the use of a linking verb, specifically \"the simple present tense of 'be'.\n5. This is supported by the words \"Despite...\" and \"that...was\" being together, with no other words in between.\n6. Hence option C is the appropriate answer for this question.\nSo the final answers is C: A sad time\n\nInput: I'm taking a train to New York. After checking what, I will have to wait a while for my train's departure. I wish I never had to take what! Choices:  A. a bus B. an auto C. a plane D. a taxi E. a cab\nOutput: 1: I'm taking... to New York. I wish I never took a... to New York means that the person in question was at the station to get a train to New York, and instead has decided to travel by a different method as they don't like travelling by train.\n2: We can start by eliminated the four options which contain \"taking\". i.e Bus, Auto, Plane, and Taxi.\n3: The sentence mentions that the subject is checking in advance of the train's departure, meaning the time before the train leaves. Hence we need to understand when this time is, the \"check in time\"\n4: A check in time is usually in the morning, but this may vary depending on the train or specific company\n5: We understand now that the check in time is in the morning, so we can eliminate the options which can't check in during this time.\n6: This leaves us with Bus, Plane, and Cab meaning the subject is not happy with having to check in early in the morning.\n7: We understand the subject wishes that they never had to check in early, so the options which don't mention the subject", "answer": "C: bad time"}
{"text": "1:  The question asks where a department store \"might\" be located.\n2: \"It's located in the Northwest of the USA \" so the store must be located near a \"big city\"\n3: \"idaho\" is a state, and although there probably are some citys in idaho, it doesn't mention it. So no, the answer must not be \"idaho\".\n4: \"Shopping mall\" and \"big city\" are options, meaning the answer must be either a \"Shopping Mall\" or a \"big city\", since they can both not be true simultaneously\n5: \"big city\" is a more general concept than \"shopping mall\", so the answer must be a \"big city\" or a \"Shopping Mall\", but since the options are given in order, the answer is a \"Shopping mALL\".\nSo final answer is a: Shopping mall\n\nInput:  The answer to this question isn\u2019t very profound or even deep.

{"text": "1.\"John is studying animals\". This sentence refers to John as a scientist, who is studying animals as part of his job. \n2. \"What is one of the many\", indicates that there are more than one things to watch them do in order to study them.\n3.\"Copulate\", does not directly apply here.\n4.\"Die of cancer\", also falls outside the scope of the question.\n5.\"Obese\", is relevant to animals but is not a part of their natural behavior.\n6.\"Bathe\" cannot be correct either since bats are a species of mammals or \"bathe\" would also apply to any animal which has fur or hair.\n7.

I was too stupid \nto listen. ... Advice B. Sughgestions \nD. warnings E \ncomplaints, in this case. The speaker makes a negative tone about the things he has said. \n\n3: Since the answer has to be a correct and positive phrase of the 'things you have said' \"Advice\" comes closest to it.\n4: Suggestions does not have a single definition and it may be related to suggestion as stated in the example, but this is also the case with warnings.\n5. 'It's too late. .. I was too stupid to list'n', does not have a single meaning and it is better associated with advice.\n6. Therefore it is the closest option to the question.\nSo, the final answer is: Advice\n\nInput: John is studying animals.   He's interested in biology and what?

{"text": "1.\"What only some types of police\" is asking this question: \"Are there any specific types of police that do everything?\"\n2. The first rule of elimination is to rule out those choices that are already answered in the sentence.\n3. So A, which answers the question \u201cDo all police do these tasks?\u201d is eliminated.\n4. Similarly, C and D, which answer the question \u201cAre all police these things?\u201d are also eliminated. \n5. The answer we want can now be chosen from the remaining choices.\n6. To answer this question, we need to focus on the word \u201conly\u201d. It is used to indicate that something is the sole thing that \u201cdoes these things\u201d. This must then be the answer.\n7. Thus, the answer must be \"B: Board Vessels\", as this is the only choice available (to do this type of police work). \nSo the final answer B: board vessels.\n\nInput: She didn't even know which one of them was supposed to do what, but she made it clear that they each could take care of only one what? Choices: A: child B: meal C: errand D: job E: assignment\nOutput: 1.\u201dShe didn't even know\u201d indicates that she did not know anything about the things she didn\u2019t know about.\n2. \u201cWhich one of them was supposed\u201d means she was asking them which one of them was assigned to do whatever they were supposed to do.\n3. \u201cBut she made it clear\u201d means that despite not knowing, she made it clear she wasn\u2019t happy with their indecision.\n4. \"That they each could take care\" must refer to \u201cthe thing that\u201d she knows they must take care of. So \u201ccare\u201d is the right choice.\n5. \"Of one what\" is the word after the choice, which is missing. The word refers to the thing that \u201cthey each could take care of,\u201d which we have just decided is \u2018care\u2019.\n6. This is clearly referring to a job- 'care' is the only choice that is not a noun.\n7. \u201cBut they clearly\u201d must refer to the whole sentence, as it refers back to the previous sentence\u2019s \u2018could take care\u2019.\n8. \"Care\u201d clearly is the answer- the question is simply \u201cWhat\u201d.\nSo the final answer to this question", "answer": "A: direct traffic"}
{"text": "1.\"Spray\" here means an outpouring of water but also a discharge of a liquid which has been stored in a container.\n2. This gives us the clue of a spray (as a liquid discharge) over someone's body, and the sentence says that if she'd rather do that than to use a perfume she must not like using the latter.\n3. She's doing a what-if scenario of being able to spray a bottle of perfume over herself at the fountain or something else, but she'd rather do it herself with the water from the fountain, which indicates she actually has a repugnant dislike for the smell of perfume.\n4. Perfume is a liquid, and fountains and springs are associated with fresh water. Hence, the term 'water' appears more often as a noun in the sentence than any other term, and this is the indicator we need to identify her main concern.\n5. The terms 'perfume' and 'air' are out of consideration here because the sentence is very clear in saying that she doesn't like the smells of both. The term 'air' is out of consideration because the sentence is also very clear in saying that the fountain water is better than the perfume she'd previously used, implying that she is unfamiliar with the air that she breathes and the fountain water. The term 'fountain' does not have specific characteristics to it.\n6. The terms 'puddle' and'swamp' do not satisfy the given requirements as they would imply 'unpleasant smell'. The term'swamp', in particular, is out of consideration, as it is similar to puddle in meaning, also because they would cause unpleasantness in her if applied to her, implying that she doesn't want perfume on her body either. This is not satisfied by'she'd prefer spraying herself than using a bottle of perfumes', as she is not saying she dislikes perfume application, but perfume as a smell in general.\n7. Since we eliminate all terms that do not fit in the above criteria, the question becomes about whether water would smell bad and be more unpleasant than perfume. The sentence says that water is preferable; it is more pleasant than using perf", "answer": "A: perfume"}

Hence, the answer must be 'D: texas.'.\nSo the final answer must be D: texas\n\nInput: Why do you always have to take such a strong stand on this, Marge? Choices: 1. A: Because it's right thing to do\n2. B: Because it's morally right\n3. C: Because it's important\n4. D: Because it's what I believe\n5. E: Because it's fair\nOutput: 1- The sentence tells us \"why you always have to take...\" so it can't be A(take a strong stand), B(that's morally right), C(that's important), D(that's what I believe)\n2- Marge is the one taking a strong stand so the statement must be addressed to Marge.\n3- It is the strongest one of the options: 3. To convince Marge that there shouldn't be a strong stand on her opinion.\nSo the sentence would be \"To convince Marge that it shouldn't be the wrong thing to take a strong stand on her own opinion \"\nSo the final answer will be: E: fair\n\nInput: I never knew people ate those disgusting bunnies and cute little hamsters.

The sentence tells us \"I never knew people ate...\" and \"But I'm still a... \", which means the boy in question is a good person.", "answer": "A: new hampshire"}
{"text": "1: The question is asking for an ingredient of a specific sugary, soft drink type, that contains water.\n2. The options exclude the beverage itself, so no \"A: mountain dew\" or \"D: whirlpool bath\".\n3. The remaining options include a cup \"C: soft drink\" but do not directly describe the ingredient, they reference it indirectly, \"A glass\" and \"A: coffee cup\" but don't describe the ingredient.\n4. The answer must be \"E\" because \"A coffee cup\" implies a container, and water is the ingredient, not the container.\n5. Therefore, the only option that does not describe a container is 'coca cola'.\nSo the final answer has to be E: coffee", "answer": "C: soft drink"}
{"text": "1: The question identifies a \"What divider\" which indicates that one needs to decide on the correct option that describes this divider.\n2: By the given scenario, \"street\" is excluded as being a wrong option.\n3: This eliminates \"Living room\" being the right option.\n4: The question has stated that the \"work or school\" requirement means that option E: office suite is also an option as a divider.\n5: Hence, we are left with options B: binder, C: obesity, and D: living room.\n6: \"obesity\" does not define a divider, hence it can be eliminated as a correct option.\n7: As it is an option, \"B: binder\" cannot be correct, as it is already defined as a divider. So, D: living room is the only correct option left.\n8: Living room is defined as a divider in its own capacity. So, it is also an incorrect option.\n9: As only the remaining option (D: living room) can be an option for the correct answer, the answer is D.\nSo the final ans is D: Living Room", "answer": "B: binder"}
{"text": "1.\"Captive\" means confined, restrained, or held in custody or bondage.\n2. \"Monkey\" is a type of primate mammal which belongs to genus callitrichus.\n3. We can exclude the first three options as they do not contain the word'monkey', or are not a suitable habitat for a monkey.\n4. Therefore, the answer could only be the last option here: \"D: Zoological Gardens\", the only place in which captive monkeys are found.\nSo the final solution is D: Zoological Gardens", "answer": "D: zoological gardens"}
{"text": "1.) The question is essentially asking, \"If someone is outgoing, what are they generally likely to do?\" So, we begin by identifying who is 'outgoing'.\n2.) So, we can eliminate the options that aren't necessary for a person to be outgoing.\n3.) This leaves us with:  \"A: new experiences\", \"B: playfulness\", \"D: good looking\".\n4.) Although outgoing people could be looking to new experiences and/or be playful, the correct answer is 'looking to something beautiful'.\n5.) This is because someone who is outgoing will tend to seek attention of peers and will look for ways to garner that attention, with good looks being a good asset in this regard.\n6.) So, the answer is \"E: beautiful\", as this is the only choice that suits the context of what is being suggested.\nSo the final answers are C: own house, E: beautiful and A: new experiences, D: good looking\n\nInput: We decided to go out for lunch at our local diner. It looked as though everyone in the place knew each other.  There are a few things that I think were what? Choices: A: clear distinctions B: clear signals C: clear answers D: clear indications E: clear answers\nOutput: 1) The question is essentially asking that while we were out for lunch at the diner, something stood out.\n2) The only clear indication of a family group was a man with what, who seemed clearly unhappy with his situation. He has a clear relationship with his wife, she appears to be caring for him.\n3) So the answer, which is an indication of the man's unhappy situation, can only be \"D: the man's clear unhappiness\".\n4) We can rule out the woman, as she is clearly nursing, but we don't know if she is the man's wife, and she is clearly not the only other person at the diner.\n5) It is also unlikely that the man has clear signals of relationship with any other individual. The family group is clear, so the only clear indication can be the man's unhappiness, indicated by the fact that he is clearly unhappy.\n6) We are told: \"There are a few things that indicate...\" and the only relevant one is", "answer": "A: new experiences"}
{"text": "1 The question is to identify which sport is the noisiest one compared to the others.\n2. The word'sport' indicates that the answer's reference would be a particular type of sport. To eliminate an option, the other one must describe the most extreme opposite.\n3. Option A:'show' suggests that its a theatre and not a sport, as well, the verb'show' is used to express a show, not a sport.\n4. Option B: 'theatre' is also used to define a theatre and not a specific type of sport or game, which is what the answer is.\n5. Option C: hockey game is used for the hockey sport, so not suitable as the answer to this question.\n6. So answer options should be either'movies' or 'event', which describes the same game, just one could take place in the day, and the other one, at night. \n7. Thus, considering this, the answer should be 'C: hockey game', as this game is the loudest.\nSo the final and correct answer is C: hockey game", "answer": "C: hockey game"}
{"text": "1.\"A government seeks what...? \" refers to a government of a nation-state over its people, and not over a group of people living in a country.\n2. As it is a government, the question refers to governmental governance which can be in various forms like monarchy or democracy.\n3. The options \"B: trouble\" and \"C: city \" aren't mentioned in the context.\n4. Option \"D: sun\" is a figurative expression for the brightness of a sun in the sky, which doesn't fit well in the context.\n5. \"E: control\" is the correct answer as control is what the nation state is trying to impose on its people.\nSo the final answers are E: control\n\nInput: He is as unscrupulous as anyone you've ever met. Choices:  A. as corrupted B. as kind C. as intelligent D. as sincere E. as trustworthy\nOutput: 1: The sentence states that \"He is as unscrupular as anyone you've.....\" which means that he is not the type to cut corners.\n2: The sentences in the question all refer to a persons attributes which are \"corrupted, kind, intelligent, sincere, trustworthy\" which cannot be used in comparison. Also, \"as\" is used here to compare him with someone as yet not mentioned in the sentence.\n3: Comparison is also done by the phrase \"is as____\"\n4: Since the first sentence says he is unscrupular, it would mean he is not corrupted, so \"D. as sincere\" is wrong.\n5: \"C. as intelligent\" is wrong since it implies that he is highly intelligent and it can also mean that he is as intelligent as anyone else.\n6: \"A. as corrupted\" is wrong because he cannot be termed corrupt since the sentence clearly mentions that he is unscrupual.\n7: \"B. as kind\" is wrong since the sentence does not imply that others are of poor or low quality.\n8: Option \"E. as trustworthy\" is correct as it's the short one.\nSo the final ans is E: as trustworthy", "answer": "E: control"}
{"text": "1.\u201dThe people wanted to take a scenic route\u201d suggests a preference for a slower route than they could take by road, which is likely to have been the most direct and fastest option.\n2.\u201cThey chose the highway that cuts through\u201d indicates no preference for scenery, but could also be referring to the country, in terms of land.\n3.\u201cthe countryside\u201d is an option but it seems more likely that the people would have wanted to see the countryside than cut through it, due to the connotation of the word \u201ccut\u201d in the phrase \u201ccut through the\u201d.\n4.The same reasoning can be applied to \u201cthe united states\u201d.\n5.\u201cthe beach\u201d excluds seashore land entirely, which seems unlikely, although this may depend on the context.\n6.\u201cthe atlas\u201d means a book, which is too abstract to make sense of the context.\n7.The only option left is \u201cthe developed land\u201d, as the others are unsuitable.\nSo the final choice is A: countrysnide\n\n\nInput: His favorite kind of foods are simple as are what? Choices: food B: dishes C: meals D: drinks E: recipes\nOutput: 1: His favorite kind of is food, referring to the nurturing foods such as meat and vegetables, which are simple in nature and not fancy or complex in recipe.\n2. \"As simple\" indicates what he likes because it's similar to the simplicity of his favorite food, so he must like simple things, such as \"food\" or \"dishes\" as the choices.\n3. Dishes refers to the meal, which may be complex or simple, so it's not appropriate to the noun phrase.\n4. Meals is the same idea as dishes, and excludes complex nourishment like \"food\" as the answer, so its removed.  \n\n5: Recipes includes the word \"recipe\", which is too specific to this personality's likes: foods or dishes.\n6. \"Simple\" doesn't exclude drinks, so it must be \"food\" \n\nSo the final choice must be food\n\n\nInput: A new company will provide a new service that will be what?

{"text": "1 The question asks \"You are seeking to provide to yourself what when you've applied for a job,\" 2. The word 'provide to myself' signifies that one of the options applies to the question of what 'a job' is seeking to provide itself. 3. Therefore,  the word 'Your' refers to the same person seeking, and the word 'applied for a job' refers to a possible candidate applying for the job.\n4. The question continues with 'what'. Therefore, the answer refers to what a job provides itself, but the word doesn't explicitly indicate it is of money.\n 5. \"Income\" refers to a sum of money. 6. So if we examine the 4 options that could provide money in this context, we find that the only related one is 'Income', since options 'Work', 'Employment' and 'Hope' are unlikely to provide money. 7. Hence, the option that provides money is 'Income', and the answer is 'Income'.\n\nInput: Her friend will what? Choices: A: help B: guide C: hinder D: support E: discourage\nOutput: 1: The question is \"Which of the following is the most appropriate verb to complete the sentence below?\" 2. It then asks us to indicate whether the options 'help', 'guide', 'hinder','support' or 'discourage' are true, if the person refers to the sentence beforehand.\n3. Therefore, the most appropriate use of those options, is to complete the sentence: \"I will ___ to her friend as she gets ready for her party.\" 4. The question now asks us to identify the option that is the most true.\n5. \"Help\" denotes assisting someone in completing an activity.\n6. \"Discourage\" means to inspire fear or apprehension; to try to discourage is to make someone reluctant to do something; to encourage is to try to make someone do something. \n7. So \"discourage\" is most correct option, since it completes the sentence while other options cannot even be used in the context.\n8. So the answer is \"What (an answer) discourages\" is the option \"discourage.\"\nSo the final answer to this question is discourage\n\nInput: The bride and", "answer": "C: income"}
{"text": "1: The key portion of the sentence to identify the missing concept is as follows, \" While eating hamburger... talking about...how they were going to..\"\n2. With an understanding of the question, the most fitting answer choice would be \"E: food poisoning\", as the use of the word \"they\" indicates that more than one person was involved. With only one person and one ride, the answers of \"heartburn\", \"enjoy\", \"gas\" and \"have fun\" do not apply.\n3. This statement indicates the cause of the break from rides, and \"Food poisoning\" would not be a reason why. Hence eliminating option \"Food poisoning\", we shall move on to answer choice (E).\n4. Option A: \"Heartburn\" and B: \"Gas\" are both possible side effects for eating hamburgers, although the question states clearly that it was \"taking a break from all the RIDES\", not the food eaten.\n5. Option C: \"To Enjoy\" is not the correct answer. The wording indicates they were talking about the next ride, with the action \"enjoy\". \"Have fun\" is a possible answer as it is part of the sentence, but the question states they talked, not used or said the action.\n6. Option D: \"Food poisoning\": This is incorrect as it indicates food poisoning, not gas. Additionally, the sentence does not state this had occurred.\n7. Thus, option E: \"Food poison\" is the most likely answer.\nSo the final answers is E: food poisoning", "answer": "B: have fun"}
{"text": "1 The question asks where food can be purchased and/or eaten, thus, by using the first word of each sentence and eliminating anything outside this scope- 'house', 'fast food restaurant', and 'conference' cannot be the answer.\n2. Therefore the correct answer is 'D: Library', and the reason should be obvious due to the word choice in the question.\n3. The question suggests that food can be purchased and eaten at tables, i.e. at a place where food is readily available.\n4. The only place mentioned to provide such a service would be the library. A 'house' or 'conference' would not necessarily include the necessary tables.\nSo the final answers is D: Library\n\nInput: Do you often travel to Europe? Choices:  Yes: A No: B C Never: D E Someone else: F Output: 1. The statement: 'Do you often travel to Europe?' indicates that the subject of the sentence travels, or had previously travelled, to Europe and that this information is not known, or is at least uncertain.\n2. This therefore means that it is possible that the subject travels to Europe on occasion and therefore option 'A' could be correct.\n3. However, that it is not known if the subject travels to the continent would normally disqualify travel to Europe as more than one or two specific occasions.\n4. Option 'B' could be correct, meaning that the subject travels only occasionally to Europe.\n5. Similarly, option 'C' could be correct, implying that the subject does not travel to Europe at all, thus is unlikely to have previously travelled there.\n6. Option 'D' may be correct, providing a correct answer, especially if the subject travels as part of a long term assignment or for a reason other than tourism.\n7. Option 'E' could provide a false statement, as someone else could travel to Europe, not the subject, giving a misleading response.\n8. Finally, to provide the correct answer to the question we must answer whether option 'F', 'Someone else' is correct, in which case we are provided with the correct answer.\nThis therefore means that option 'D' could be correct, to provide a general answer.\nOption 'F' could be correct, as a specific response to the question.\n9. Therefore the correct answer to the given question would be", "answer": "B: fast food restaurant"}
{"text": "1.)The question is essentially asking about what Sarah thought she found in the cabinet.\n2.) By eliminating the \"irrelevant answers\" we can be left with \"junk food,\" \"antidote,\" \"nutrient,\" or \"medicine.\"\n3.) \"Nutrient\" can not be the correct answer because the question states that Sarah took poison--not something nutritious.\n4.) The answer \"antidote\" can not be the answer because we know that Sarah did not know the poison she took before she consumed it.\n5.) Similarly the answer \"junk food\" can not be the right answer either because Sarah took poison (because she was poisoned) and junk food is not poison.\n6.) Therefore, the answer must be medicine because \"Sarah took poison,\" which could only be true if she thought she had found medicine in a cabinet which was poison to her.\nSo the final word should be medicine\n\nInput: A good manager uses good people and keeps them happy.

{"text": "1.\"Where would there be a connecting...\" is the phrase used.\n2. This sentence suggests that the answer is \"A: Wires\", \n3. because in order to connect to a place it's necessary to have a connection or wire to go there.\n4. Therefore, we can eliminate all the wrongful answers. \n5.\\ There would be no need to connect via electrical circuit, computer network or even via a wall because the answer doesn't say that they would need to connect via any of those methods.\n6. Moreover, a freeway would not be connected via electricity or via a computer network so this means that option D: freeway is incorrect.\n7. Therefore the remaining candidate is A: Wires and C: computer network.\n8. Wires could be either analog or digital, but it's more probable that the answer would be digital. \nSo, the correct answer is C: Computer network\nSo the final answer to this question is C: Computer network", "answer": "E: freeway"}

So we are left with option E: pantry as the possible answer.\nSo the final option is E: pantry\n\nInput: When the weather is hot, what should you eat? Choices:  E: cold or frozen A: hot B: sandwich C: casserole D: snack E: salad F: soup\nOutput: 1) A sentence in english often indicates the meaning of other words without needing to explicitly state it. Here, the question states, 'when the weather is hot' and then lists a variety of food items that could potentially be eaten.\n\n2.) When phrases are written in different languages such as 'when the weather is' hot in this case, there might be a variety of literal and figurative meanings attached. The literal meaning of 'hot' in this example doesn't need to explicitly refer to 'hot foods' or 'hot weather' as the question has already done this. Therefore, it is acceptable to understand 'when the weather is HOT, what should you eat' as the literal meaning being, 'hot foods' such as casserole or 'hot weather'.\n\n3.) All other choices do not satisfy the requirements for being eaten when the weather is hot. 'Snack, Sandwich and Salad' are eaten at different times and 'Cold or Frozen- E' is simply not acceptable.\n\n4.) So the answer should be D: Soup because Soup is most likely to be eaten when the weather in high.\nSo the final is Soup\n\nInput:What do you call a girl that likes to jump?

We can consider various locations of manufacturing operations as a group of the answer choices.\n3. The location given in the answer choices as \"A: factory\", isn't a specific place that humans are likely to find manufacturing operations, more specifically, as its location is industrial, it is not something you would be likely to find at home or even at a school.\n4. The other answer choices - \"B: school\", \"C: grocery store\", \"D: band\" and \"E: aircraft\" - are all places within the human environment, as defined in the question, but none of these have manufacturing operations as their main activity.\n5. The location given in \"B: school\" may contain a manufacturing operation as a supporting activity, but not the main activity as its definition.\n6. The location given in answer choice \"C: grocero store\" is likely to contain manufacturing activities as a support, but still not the main activity as it is not the defining purpose of the business.\n7. Answer Choice \"D: band\" could also be a potential manufacturing location within the human environment, but it would not be a main activity.\n8. The main activity of a band (or an orchestra for that matter) is performing music which would not be considered as the core manufacturing purpose of a group.\n9. Finally, \"E: aircraft\" requires quite a different environment to be found and is more likely to be a separate and specific case that will be dealt with differently, as opposed to other environments and human manufacturing operations.\n10. Therefore, we can eliminate these answers - \"B: school,\" \"C: grocetoire store,\" \"D: band\" & \"E: aircraft\" and we can conclude that a human environment which manufacturing operations should be found in, must be answer choice \"A: factory\".\nSo the final answer must be A: factory\n\n### Instruction:Answer the 4 following multiple choice questions.\n\nInput: The man felt a great surge of confidence and was ready to take any risk.

Choices: A: hand B: arm C: leg D: arm rest E: foot\nOutput: 1) In this sentence we can understand the context of the previous phrase, \"I had already used my hand\".\n2) The sentence that follows, \"to push this cart\" implies that someone else was pushing the cart before I did.\n3) Given this, we can say that it must be \"A: hand\" because it is \"what I had already used\".\n4) The other options \"B: arm\", and \"C: leg\" are both limbs as well and are more likely to be used in the first place by another person.\n5) \"D: arm rest\", is a piece of furniture.\n6) \"E: foot\" is unlikely since it is more likely to be used first.\nSo, the answer must be \"A:hand\u201d\n\nInput:What is my home country?

{"text": "1) The question states that people park their shopping bags in the parking lot.\n2) From the sentence, we can infer that the parking lot must be a public area.\n3) We can eliminate the park option (A), as it is not a public area.\n4) Next, we eliminate the airport (B) option, assuming that the parking lot is not an amusement park.\n5) We can also exclude the malls (D), as parking lots are typically areas that people drive to and park their automobiles in to access a store. \n6) The last remaining option (E) would be a train station, therefore the correct answer is (E): train station.\nSo the final Answer is E: train station\n\nInput: A good detective is able to get his suspects to talk because he makes them what? Choices: A: nervous B: calm C: angry D: scared E: uncomfortable\nOutput: 1.'A good detective is able'to 'Get his suspects to talk'is the statement given to us which leads us to determine what word is best for this circumstance. \n2.The first word'make them' is 'what'word that's used to describe a good detecting ability that make them'to get a confession from them.\n3. 'Calm' means the state of being calm and/or not agitated; tranquil. It can not be used as the word is used to represent the opposite of agitation.\n4. 'Talk'which is very similar to 'nervous'means feeling of fear or unease. It doesn't help our guess that the answer will be something which will be associated with fear.\n5. 'Nervous'means excited, showing signs of stress. Again we can find it similar to previous suggestion and it is not appropriate for the context.\n6. 'Happy with them'does not quite connect with what the statement of the question are telling us.

However, in this sentence, 'ungulate' could refer to a large animal, but not in the sense that it is one that could be killed by bullets.\n4: The term 'bomber' refers to a large flying aircraft with bombs and missiles. However, the question does not state 'bomber' and 'lunch' in a direct relation, and therefore the answer cannot be related to bombs, as the question mentions 'kill people' and not 'bombs'.\n5: 'Body armor' is a piece of protective clothing, although it could be the'something' he shot at, it is unlikely that 'body armour' appears in the sentence to refer to it.\n6: James' choice to use the cannon is in direct relation to 'lunch', as James used the cannon to'seek lunch' - 'killing people' is not connected to this scenario in any way, and is, therefore, irrelevant.\n7: 'kill people' refers to James looking for animals and killing them, not targeting people and killing them: this is the main purpose James had for using the cannon, to find the lunch he was looking for.\n8: 'Animal' is referring to the animal 'lunch' or animals James was hunting. While James used the cannon, he was seeking animals and animal-related things: these are 'animals' and not 'people'.\nTherefore, the answer that best'suits' the context is E: animal.\nSo the final answers is E: animal", "answer": "B: ungulate"}

Choices A: call the boss B: call someone else C: give orders D: give good tips E: give advice\nOutput: 1: the sentence says \"the man with the plan is called by what? so the man is called the boss. 2: the second sentence also confirms the boss. 3: the third sentence is asking if he would show the same level of respect if he were called by what he is called now? 4: they would be the same. 5: the next sentence says the boss should treat everyone the same.\nSo the final choice is A, and the answer is that \"he should show the same level of...\"\n\nInput: The boy thought it was better to play some video games.

Thus, we can assume that the glass was on the inside of the car.  The broken pieces would not have come from the front, as the engine is usually on the front, so the only other possibility would be the rear window.\n6. Hence, \"E: Street\" must be the correct answer, as the street would be where most of the broken glass would be found.\nSo the final answers are E: Street\n\nInput:The door had been left unlocked after being left open earlier in the day was how the robbers gained entrance into the bar.

In the list of options, we can eliminate the choices that refer to the 'actions' of humans or machines or 'happiness' as the creatures that are performing pollination.\n4.

We know from the text that they are playing with their cell phone & watching tv, so it would follow that they are not learning, rather wasting time. The choice wouldn't make sense here as they are not doing as asked of them, and their actions aren't allowing them to achieve what was asked of them.\n8) Finally, choosing \"E: falling asleep\" makes the most sense, as this choice fits with the scenario most - the person is taking up these actions because they would like to make their studying easier, & so taking up sleeping is the best choice to ease studying.\nSo the final choice is E:falling asleep\n\nInput: In the past, most things were made out of wood, but today things are made out of what?

II. Keep your voice down is incorrect because poker has to be played with a lot of talking\n\n3. III. Play softly is incorrect because you're going to be saying \"hi\" \"hello\" \"how are\" and \"good bye\" in a poker game, it's a very loud and raunchy game that should not be played softly\n\n4.

{"text": "1.\"If I wanted to store Dirt in my home\" - here, we are asked \"Where can I put it?\" meaning, what is an ideal place to store Dirt? So, to work out which option is correct, we first have to decide what Dirt is.\n2. One must first determine what the noun Dirt refers to. When we say \"It's raining dirt!\" we mean gravel or small, solid particles of soil, infiltration that are airborne or that settle by gravity. Here, we can assume the word \"dirt\" refers to small, solid particles of dirt that we can place in our home.\n3. So, to decide which option, 1 of the 5 given options, \"is correct\", we must define what \"putting dirt\" (in this case being \"the act of storing/placing soil particles in your home\") actually is.\n4. A closer look suggests that options A: fingernail and E: closet are not relevant, as they do not store dirt per se, but are used to collect the dirt, i.e. the soil particles from your body/ your home is the closet.\n5. Options B: garden, & D: computer are not suitable either, as they do not give an answer to \"Where can I put dirt?\" but rather, they state the thing, which the dirt has to be, on which it is stored. B: Garden, meaning that the dirt has to have some other meaning other than \"dirt\" which \"is stored\", and D: computer, which states that the dirt has no other \"meaning\" other than being \"dirt\", which \"is stored\". And also, both B: garden & D: computer have nothing to do with the \"storeroom\", which the question is specifically referring to, or even the \"home\", meaning this option is also not correct due to the fact that it has nothing to do with the question itself.\n6. The final option C: corner, seems to work well as it states that the \"dirt\" has to be stored in a corner, as opposed to, the gardens of B: and the computers of D:.\n7. \"I wanted to store dirt\" is a common phrase, and this option, C: corner is a common place to store dirt. Hence, the answer", "answer": "E: closet"}
{"text": "1.) This question is asking us to select, among the given options, which word best completes the phrase \u201ca person to\u201d. \n2.) According to Cambridge dictionary, \u201ca person to\u201d means one required. We should, therefore, select the option that most clearly expresses the meaning of necessity.\n3.) The first four options are redundant and fail to clarify the need for a person in relation to the cow\u2019s milk. \u201cTo milk a cow\u201d is clear enough in meaning, without the added necessity that \u201ca person\u201d must do it.\n4.) The next option \u201close weight\u201d is grammatically incorrect. \u201cNeed\u201d is followed by an Object and a Degree to form a complex form of the verb \u201cto need\u201d as \u201cI need a person to\u2026\u201d. The next option, however, is \u201cLose Weight\u201d. If someone needed to lose weight, the verb would be \u201cto lose weight\u201d, but the Degree should follow \u201close weight\u201d.\n5.) \u201cStep Forward\u201d is the next option, which is also incorrect. The phrase \u201cto step\u2026\u201d is a complex form of the simple verb \u201cto step\u201d, used when someone \u201cstep forward\u201d has an Object after \u201cstep\u201d, forming a complex form. The next option, though, is \u201cStep Forward\u201d. Thus, it is incorrect and does not reflect the meaning of the actual sentence.\n6.) \u201cCross Street\u201d has grammatically the same fault. \u201cCross\u2026\u201d is a complex verb with two parts, the first part is the Root, and the second part is the Object. In the sentence, though, the word is only \u201ccross\u201d without any Object, thereby making it the wrong word.\n7.) \u201cNeed Food\u201d is the remaining option that is grammatically correct and fits the actual sentence. It is a complex form of \u201cto need\u201d with the object \u201ca person to\u201d. The word \u201cNeed Food\u201d should, therefore, be the correct word for the sentence.\nSo final answer is E:need food\n\nInput:How long should you wear your coat in this weather?

So the answer must be C: two different ages\n4: Although this option talks about an age difference between them, there can be many different ways to make these two different ages combined together.\n5: This is the correct combination for the worst answer, the combination of Two very different personalities will clash together and one of them is very different to the other, even a little bit of difference can have a big effect on what they will feel, and how they would express it.\n6: Based on the answers above combined with the sentence: there is no other answer than E: Two very different personality\nSo the final answer must be E: Two very different Personalities\n\nInput: Why are the men on TV wearing suits so much more expensive than the men in real life?

So that's not the right answer.\n4: The terms'sweating' and'movement' don't match the idiom. Also, the term'movement' is used twice to confuse the phrasing, but in neither case does it refer to the act of actually getting your foot wet by walking into a puddle..\n5: 'Lying in' could be referring to the act of laying in a bed or couch within a puddle, but it would probably be more common to just ask a question along the lines of 'laying, are you lying in a puddles?'\n6: The term 'laying in' doesn't really work in context with the term 'walking into' the puddles. To walk into means you just barely touched, or stepped into the puddle. So this answer isn't correct, but we can eliminate it because it doesn't make sense either way you try to form it.\n7: \"Walking out of\" is incorrect because there isn't such a specific phrase \"walking out of\" the puddle\" used normally.

From the context of the question, \"open eyes\" probably means to look around, which is not an activity.

The option C - 'newspaper' is a common mis-spelling of 'newspaper' when asked to fill-in-the blank.\n4. Therefore, the answer will be 'fountain pen', since that is what is filled with 'ink'.\nSo the final answer will be F: fountain pen\n\nInput: He's a very serious person but he can't take this thing seriously. Choices:  A. He is too serious B. He's not serious C. It is difficult for him D. He's not funny E. He looks funny\nOutput: 1) We can exclude the \"Because He's Not Serious\" option in the context that \"He's very serious\"\n2) In this context, \"D. He's not Funny.\" also not feasible as it describes \"He's not Serious\"\n3) \"Can't Take This Thing seriously\" option excludes option \"c. He's Not Funny\" because if he can take this (any) \"thing\" seriously (the context doesn't mean \"He's Not Fun\" but \"He Can't Take This Thirning Seriously\")\n4) Now we need to focus back to the original sentence from which we started - \"He's A Very Serious Person\". The context of the question is that he can't take something seriously even if he's very serious.\n5) So we can eliminate option \"a. He's Too Serious\" which means \"The seriousness of \"Some Thing\" is overwhelming\"\n6) So we can use the remaining answers and the context again to solve \"He's A Serious Person\"\n7) So the Answer is 'E. He appears funny when dealing with something'.\nso the final answer will be \"E. He appears funnier when dealing with something\"", "answer": "E: printer"}
{"text": "1: We can eliminate options B: wilderness and C:fly, since a marmoset is a small animal. These words are suggestive of wide open spaces which a marmoset would not necessarily prefer.\n2. We can eliminate option E: colorado, since Colorado is located in the Rocky Mountains in the western U.S. \n3. Option A: dictionary suggests the opposite of our answer, in addition, it does not mean \"go to\". This means that a marmoset is unlikely to go to a dictionary.\n4. Option B: wilderness also does not fit. It is unlikely that a marmoset would want to choose to live among wide open spaces, as they are usually found in trees and jungles.\n5. Finally, option D:underground is also a possibility, but it may be easier to consider a different response. We could also change this to under. We can see that underground is not an option since we know our animal is above the ground.\n6. Therefore our answer must be the only remaining one(E:COLORADO), since it implies going outside their typical habitat, which in this case, would be the underground.(Since they live in trees)\nSo the final answer for this question is E:colorado\n\nInput: You can get an idea of what a person is like from their eyes, but what kind of evidence suggests that from? Choices: 1:  A: their gestures and body movements 2:  B: their accent 3:  C: their writing 4:  D: their speech 5:  E: None of these\nOutput:1. So we rule out option 1. as their eyes are no way related to gestures or movements.\n2. Eliminates options 2&3, as accents are primarily voice related, and writing is primarily a hand-based form of communication.\n3. Eliminates Option 4. as speech primarily refers to the words themselves, rather than eye contact. \n4. So, by process elimination, the only possible remaining option is E: \"None of these\"- there is literally no other choice that fits in such a question, in terms of the options provided.\nSo the final final answer for this question would be, E:None of these", "answer": "D: underground"}
{"text": "1.. The information in the context suggests that we are searching for some furniture.\n2. The question has 3 parts and asks us to choose where it should be put based on an order. \n3. To solve this efficiently, we make note of the following. Part A: side chair, part B: people, the context implies that a side chair will be sitting place for people.  Part C: for people to visit me, we see that the side chair will be put in such a place that it will allow people to visit me and  part D: office, we see that the context is a working place and this working place might be where there will be a side chair  Part E: table, we see that the answer choice is not in line with the context and is out of the options. Therefore the side chair must be placed in the library or office environment with the people coming to visit me who will be seated comfortably on the side chair.\n4. The answer will be only be the options A,B,C or D. The side chair is for the people to visit the desk area in the office or library.\n5. The answer is not A C or D, but the answer is D : Office.\nSo the final Answer is D:Office.\n\nInput: This room was used for many things, including prayer meetings, which started on Wednesday nights.  After supper we prayed for what? Choices: A: our friends B: each other C: our troubles D: our government E: our health\nOutput: 1.... Prayer meetings are done at mid week every Wednesday after supper, this part tells us to choose a option that can be applied to the prayer meeting as well.\n2. The word \"we\" is also important as it confirms to us that the prayer meeting has only the writer who can pray for others.\n3. The given text is not very descriptive of the prayer meeting and the context is not clearly indicating the prayers to be made for the specific things which could allow us to make a choice easily.\n4. After looking through the 5 options we see that none of them is likely to be the answer since they cannot be used in the prayer meeting without any changes at all. ( A : Our friends : not possible, we only pray for each other not our friends B: Each other : not possible, only pray for others C", "answer": "B: office"}
{"text": "1,\"What is the biggest speech ever given in the capital?\", question is being asked concerning an address which has taken place. \n2. \"Each state\" is the smallest speech made in the capital, so it is not possible for it to be the biggest, therefore we can rule it out.\n3. \"Gettysburg address\" is made up of two words as opposed to \"speech\", it is an address that is made, but isn't made in the capital. 4. \"State of Union address\" is a form of speech, but takes place every two years due to being made by the President of the United States. Since we are told that this speech in question is the largest, and being given often, this is not possible for our speech to be \"The state of union address\", so we can also eliminate this as an option. \n5. Being made every year since the signing of the constitution in 1789, this speech has been given more times, thus allowing it to be the longest speech in the capital. \n6. As such, our last option is \"The European Union\" which is an area of the capital which consists of all European countries. Hence, making this speech the largest speech given in the capital. Therefore, the correct answer is \"E: Europe\"\nSo the final answer must be A: Europe\n\nInput: What do you do at every meal? Choices: 1. A: Eat 2. B: Snack 3. c. Exercise 4. D: Walk 5.

{"text": "1The question is asking for the likely emotional state of a person who was abandoned by everyone after they stopped being married to someone else. Options A: grief and B: solo are irrelevant for this question and can be eliminated. \n2. Option C: isolation is possible but it's also possible that the person in this scenario will not be bothered by anyone because they're choosing to be that way after being abandoned. \n3. To get at the heart of this question, we need to focus on the aftermath of being abandoned and how it may be likely to make the person feel.\n4. \"Pleasure\" and \"Happiness\" are not the most likely responses. This is because \"pleasure\" implies a level of joy or satisfaction that we'd expect to be experienced by the person, even after being abandoned by everyone. \"Happiness\" denotes a content or satisfied state of being, which might not be expected to be experienced after being abandoned by everyone because of the severity of the social rejection involved. \n5. In summary, the likely emotional state is \"what is a person likely to fell when they are abandoned by everybody after they stop being married?\".\n6. Therefore, the answer is \"D: Isolation\", which is the least likely response amongst all possible responses.\nSo the final question is E: Isolation.\n\nInput: \n\"His friends were jealous because they didn't understand how he was so well known.

{"text": "1: The question asks us to determine the term used for describing her skill of keeping guests entertained.\n2: We know that both \"Fun\" and \"Entertaining\" refer to parties and other events with a specific purpose. They are not synonymous, as the question makes no mention of fun.\n3: \"Talent\" is only used occasionally for referring to ability in performing entertaining activities, however it is vague. More importantly, the question says \"he she had a what?\", and we know that \"she\" refers to her instead of her male friend.\n4: \"Learn about\" does not match the context. We can further distinguish that \"Intelligence\" is not \"what\", since it must be used to define her knack for entertaining rather than the actual subject of entertainment itself (i.e. the question is about what she has a knack for).\n5: Therefore, the answer must be \"A: Fun\", as \"have a knack for\" and \"have fun\" are similar in context.\nSo the final answeer is A: fun", "answer": "B: talent"}
{"text": "The question is asking where Dave put his beer in the house.\n2. The options are irrelevant to Dave's case.\n3. The fact that they are in opposite time and place does not change the meaning of the text. \"Beer\" is in plural form here, the phrase \"his beer\" refers to a singular object.\n4. A soccer game is irrelevant because Dave is drinking beer in his home.\n5. Options A: refrigerate and B: closet are irrelevant.  The text says \"it would be off the floor\".  If it is at the refrigerator or the closet, it will not fall over. It cannot be option B because it does take up space on the floor either.  It must be between option C: can and option D: shelf.\n6. Option C refers to something that is taken with you, this is not suitable to the situation.\n7. Option D refers to a cupboard. The text says \"where he could get to it\". A cupboard is suitable, but he would not necessarily put it up on a cupboard, it's more likely to be placed in the corner or near a seating area.\n8. Option E refers to a location on the football field.  This is therefore irrelevant to Dave's situation.\nSo the final Answer is D: shelf\n\nInput: We had a terrible fight because we could no longer agree on what the best way for us was.  How did this happen? Choices:  (1) We fought for too long (2) You didn't listen (3) My idea was wrong  (4) You were selfish (5) We were tired\nOutput: 1) This must be one of the reasons the fight continued- the fight is no longer about who is right, but has become personal. Therefore it would not be one of the reasons for the fight. The options do not have this meaning.\n2) This cannot be the reason for the fight because the fight has broken down and does not involve listening.\n3) This is too vague.\n4) This cannot be the answer because it cannot be the main or core cause of the fight. It cannot be the answer.\n5) This option is incorrect because they are not tired.\nso the final answer is 1: we fought for too long", "answer": "D: shelf"}

Hiragana(Katakana) and romanization are two different approaches for the way Japanese is written. Hiragana(Katanana) is a collection of Japanese letters which are used with kanji and are used in place of kanji especially for pronunciation. Romanization in contrast, is a way of writing characters in the Latin alphabet. Although there's quite a significant overlap in which Japanese writing uses Hiragana(Kanji) and Romaji, there are many exceptions and there's also plenty of confusion especially because Hiragana(kanji) and Romaj were developed fairly independently. Therefore, Hiragana(Kanteji) and romaj(i) are two distinct ways to write Japanese.\n2.)

However, as the object contains health, it does not apply so it can only be excluded.\n5- As the sentence does not speak that Zebra is for sale, option A: Zoo is out the question.\n6- Zebra is a type of animal so D: Desk is also excluded as D: desk is a place to work with an item. Zebra is an animal that can be found outside the desk.\n7- Opera also refers to one kind of animal, the type that is a singer and not a real animal. So option E: Opera is also out of question.\n8- Only option 'C: Hospital' can be the choice because Hospital is an 'establishment that provides diagnosis, medical care, treatment, and hospitality to people who need medical attention'.

To be ignorant\", the best choices suited to the scenario.\nSo the final answers are A. Not exist and B. To be ignorant\n\nInput: The young boy is very smart. He knows everything about computers - except for what? Choices: - A: the Internet B: hardware & software C: RAM D: the internet service E: PCs\nOutput: 1: It is clear from the question that all answers relate to computers in some way.\n2: Option D is only one type of Internet service, so that has been eliminated.\n3: Options A and B can both be described as \"knowing everythign about computers\", so they have been eliminated. \n4: Option C refers to hardware and software, which is a piece of \"everything\" about computers. Option E refers to \"PCs\" and is another piece of \"everything about computers\"; so these have been eliminated too.\n5. Option C seems to describe RAM as some sort of service, which does not make sense, so that has been discounted as well.\n6: The remaining options are then \"D\" and \"E\", leaving us with the answer D - Internet Service.\nSo the final choice is D: Internet Service", "answer": "C: ignorance"}

{"text": "1.\"Where does someone not happy with their car?\" The question asks us to determine where a person unhappy with their car may take it.\n2. As the question states where a person unhappy about their car would go, it is clear that it is their reaction to a situation.\n3. Therefore, we can eliminate all the other answers.\n4. A: \"down the river\" does not describe what a person unhappy with the car would do.\n5. B: \"the city\" would be where a person who was generally unhappy with their car would drive to.\n6. C: \"a repair shop\" would be where a car that didn't work correctly would go.\n7. D: \"the neighborhood\" would be where a neighbor with a spare car would welcome the other person to use.\n8. Above all, E: \"the neighbors\u2019 house\" would describe where a person would go who was happy to take a loan from their neighbor with a working car.\n9. As the answer does not fully include the concept of the question, the answer must include all the remaining parts.\n10. \"E: the neighbors house\" includes all the other answers. Therefore, the answer is \"E: the neighbours house\".\nSo the final answer to this question is E: the nearest neighbours house\n\nInput: I wish that I was taller, but I'm afraid that my mother would be disappointed if I wasn't.  She wants me to be the best at what? Choices: A: anything B: everything C: nothing D: something E: something different\nOutput: 1: \"I wish that I was tall, but I'm scared that if I grew, my mother would disappoint me. She wants me to be good at what?\"\nThe statement is in the past tense, meaning that they are afraid that she would be disappointed if they were to grow tall.\n2: Tall has been chosen over something different as the person is saying that she doesn't want to become someone else other than she already is, because her mother wants her to be the best at something.\n3: \"The Best\" must have been chosen over everything, because it is the only option that does not indicate that she may have to overcome something to get there, as everything has many different options.\n4: It was the obvious option with no other reasons, that", "answer": "C: repair shop"}

It doesn't say she was selling the client a product, in fact the agent could have been selling any property that the client wanted.  Also, the client didn't mention any objection or distrust.\n2nd Reading:  If we look at the words \"delightful\" and \"arounf\", they do make the text less likely to have been written by a salesman.\n\n3rd Reading: We should ignore \"all around\", as it is not clearly used as a modifying word. This leaves us with charming, deceive, or exaggerate.\nWe can eliminate charming because no one would describe a salesperson as charming, even if he/she is trying to be.\nWe can eliminate deceive because in modern societies people won't trust a salesperson if they are lying.\nExaggerating in sales is not recommended because clients see it as desperate behavior from sales staff.\nSo only exaggerate is left and we can see that one should not exaggerate if they are trying to gain clients trust.\n\nAnswer is D: incompetent.\n\nInput: She may know the truth, but she won't speak up, as she's scared of what? Choices: A: getting hurt B: hurting others' feelings C: hurting her own feelings D: hurting herself E: hurting others\nOutput: 1)The context of the paragraph tells us that the person she's talking about is being unjustly blamed for something.\n2)This means that she's in a situation where she will be hurt if she \"speaks up\".\n3)The sentence immediately after that, \"She may know the truth,...\" and \"as she's scared...\" tell us that she not only wants to speak up, but also may know the truth.\n4)As she's scared, it's likely that she's afraid of what would happen to her if she spoke up.\n5)So this leaves us with the choices that \"hurt others' feelings\"(A) and \"hurt herself\"(E).\n6)It says that she's scared and that she \"wants to speak up\".

Choices:  A. Drama B. Fairy tales C. History D. Mystery novels E. Nursery rhyme \nOutput: \n\n1. The question asks which type of text a student would need to read to study abridged/condensed versions of. \n2. \"Drama\" refers to fictionalized storytelling in stage plays, but not to actual events. \n3. \"Fairy tales\" refer to fictional stories with mystical elements. \n4. \"History\" contains facts, not fiction. \n5. \"Mystery novels\" do not contain condensed/abridged facts like other types of literature.\n6. Hence, the answer choice \"Nursery rhyme\" is used to tell simple, short stories/poems.  Nursery rhyme texts would contain condensed and abridged elements to their stories.", "answer": "E: laundry room"}
{"text": "1: The question asks about how to \"fix\" the issue of dryness in the air in one's house.\n2. The question states that there is \"little water in the air.\"\n3. We can eliminate option C \"surface of earth\" because water cannot be found \"surface of earth.\"\n4. We can also eliminate option D because the question states clearly that no other solution than A \"humidifier\" fits the criteria. It is the only solution that addresses air itself instead of a \"surface of earth\", and it does this effectively by adding liquid to the air.\n5. Option A, we can eliminate because it would not add liquid itself to the air. Instead, it would just keep evaporating the liquid from a container in order to cool off a house.\n6. Therefore option B, an ice cube would have to be used to add liquid to the air itself. This is not a useful solution for the same reason that a \"surface of the earth\" would not.\n7. Therefore Option E \"burn it to the ground\" doesn't resolve the issue and thus should not be selected as the correct answer.\n8.

'frustration' could be associated with feeling rejected or disillusioned upon applying for jobs that she felt she would be qualified for.\n3. 'working hard' refers to putting effort into studying and applying but not necessarily for a specific or targeted purpose.\n4.'stress' is also a common term associated with hard work, however in this context it doesn't make sense for the statement 'I knew I was qualified so what did I feel?'\n5. 'employment' also refers to working, but it would seem odd that the answer would be employment since that was the specific outcome she was after. \n6. 'love' would suggest that she had been applying for a position that involved caring for others, such as a nursing position, as opposed to one that was specific to her skills and experience.\n7.

{"text": "1.\"The wind tore off...\" This phrase indicates that the wind was moving at a fast speed, tearing off the shingles.\n2. To determine the type of wind, the question provides an additional description of what the wind did.\n3. Options A, B, D, and E each describe a specific action of an object which could have been moved or displaced by wind.\n4. However, the description of the shingles being torn off indicates that the wind would need to be fast and have force behind it, likely in the form of a gust.\n5. The question provides no specifics, so no options can be definitively excluded.\n6. \"Change direction\" indicates that the wind switched to a different direction, but does not indicate how fast, or forcefully, it did this.\n7. Similarly, \"Spreading\" and \"Wave wheat\" each describe an effect of wind, but don't directly address the force of the wind to cause this effect. \"Dry hair\" implies that the wind moved the subject, but not necessarily with force.\n8. Only one option could potentially describe a fast and forceful action of gusty wind. Option C, \"Blowing hard\", is a good fit and the preferred option.\nSo the final answers are 1: Dry hair, 2: Spreading, 3: Blowing Hard, 4: Crumpy, 5: Crumby, 6: Wave Wheat\n\nInput: It can make the difference between getting a good job and a bad one, how?

A celebration might be a success when procreation is successful but no celebration occurs when it is unsuccessful.\n3) Likewise, we can rule out option D. Reproduction does not necessarily indicate success, as unsuccessful reproduction still results in reproductive success.\n4) Therefore, options B, C, and E are available candidates for success.\n5) Option B, having a party, is unlikely to be a success as it is unnecessary to celebrate procreation as it cannot be considered a major event.\n6) Option C, hearing the crowd go mad, is also unlikely to be the result of procreation as it is dependent on noise rather than outcome.\n7) Thus, the final answer remains option E, reproduce.\nSo the final sentence is E: reproduce\n\n## 4.

Only II C. Only III D. Only IV\nOutput: 1.) The question asks us to select the answer that is not a true statement.\n2.) Option IV is both the simplest and the best answer to the question- it is obvious that opportunity is not distributed equally, so not a true statement. \n3.) Option I is the second best answer in terms of plausibility, but it would still follow that opportunity is not equally distributed without strong desire.\n4.) Option II suggests that strong desire is not a prerequisite for success, even though opportunities are not equally distributed.\n5.) Option III follows that individuals with a particular background are more likely to be successful, which may be argued that success is not determined by opportunity alone. \n6.) Hence, we can conclude that option IV represents the only answer not to be a statement of fact.\nSo the final statement is Option IV :Only the fourth is not a true statement\n\nInput:B: What", "answer": "E: reproduce"}
{"text": "1.\"'Where is one likely to buy listening vinyl?'is essentially a rhetorical question for the listener as the phrase \"one likely to buy\" suggests that some may not buy this type of vinyl.\n2. In this context we interpret the question to be asking where most people are likely to buy listening vinil.\n3. The options that must be excluded first are \"a: safeway\" and \"b: record albums / album store\" as these would not be an appropriate shop.\n4. Next we can eliminate \"c: record store\" due to the use of the phrase \"likely to buy\" which suggests that a \"store\" where these are sold would be an optimal destination for listening vinyl.\n5. \"d: car\" can be eliminated for similar reasons, but even if this were a vehicle in some way this would not convey the desired use of the phrase \"one likely... to buy\".\n6. \"E-wallpaper\" may seem unconnected to buying records, but listening vinyl would be suitable for a wallpapr in the right circumstance, like a house or bar. \n7. As for each of these reasons, we can conclude the answer is most likely \"d: car\" as we must select the option that can be considered most likely to be purchased in a car.\nSo the final answe is D: car \n\nInput: Many a times there's more to it than we think it might be.

The connotation of the phrase \"take on\" implies that \"the school system\" is a greater or more powerful body than John and his small group of people.\n3. The usage of the term \"small group\" does not imply that John and his group are part of the \"power of the people's voting rights\".\n4. Option D can be eliminated as \"army\" refers to a particular entity, while the question seeks to identify a term for \"power\" more generally.\n5.

Therefore option E: read a book\nSo the final answer E: read book\n\nInput: A well thought out schedule will have what? Choices: A: room for flexibilty B: space for leisure time C: 15 minutes a day to spare D: at least 38 hours a week\nOutput: 1: \"A well thought out schedule will\" state that to build a good schedule we must consider what to include.\n2. \"Leisure time\" refers to the time we spend enjoying ourselves.\n3. 'Room for flexibility', '27 hours', 'flexible' and '38 hours a week' aren't relevant words according to the context and would suggest an unrealistic work schedule.\n4. Option E: Read a book\nSo the answer is A: Have space for flexibility\n\nInput: There is still time left to do work, don\u2019t feel pressured! What are you what? Choices: doing B: running C: waiting D: stressing E: worrying\nOutput: If the person is doing something urgent then its not the correct time, either way its the incorrect time.\n\"Time that I feel pressured\" could suggest the correct time.\nA time is a period of time during which an action, process, or sequence of events takes place and we need not think about the exact amount of time till we feel the need to relax.\n\"Feel stress\", \"Feel pressured\", \"Feel like giving up\".\n\"Feel like giving up\" suggests that we don't", "answer": "E: read book"}

The same applies to the hotels and hotel, as they also are separate buildings, not connected to an office building reception.\n5, Therefore, reception must be in a hall, which is on the first floor or ground level of the office building.

A point in the center of the nose. D. An imaginary line connecting the eyes. E. An irregular line of wrinkles around the mouth. \n\nOutput: 1: According to the explanation, a metopic ridges is a longitudinal ridge, as in an imaginary line crossing over two eyes of the corpse.\n2, Therefore, the options can be removed if they are only descriptions of the nose, or one's center forehead creases.\n3. The remaining options are still descriptions of the forehead creases, not of the ridge.\n4. Hence, the answer may be neither choice B nor choice E.\n5. The last remaining choice which is an explanation- choice D, is correct as it contains the specific descriptive word, \"imaginary\" in reference to the longitudinal ridge.\n6. In summary, the answer is D: A point in the center connecting the eyes, as a metopic rider is a longitudinal line joining the eyes.\nSo the final answers are D: A point in center connecting the eyes.", "answer": "E: office building"}

It is not implausible that someone might like Mary simply because she is honest, or fun, or worthy- but 'Choice' is specifically about her honesty, fun, or worthiness.\n7) Therefore, the answer must be 'Choice'. Mary was liked because she was honest, fun, worthy, and choice. So the final answer is E' Choice\n\nInput: The teacher gave out extra credit points to a group of students who had all done what? Choices: A: extra credit points' work B: all extra credit points' work C: extra credit points' assignments D: assignments for all extra credit points E: assignments for extra credit points\nOutput: 1.) The sentence reads, \"[the teacher] gave out extra credit points,\" so the students have already completed some activity, and we can rule out options A and C.\n2.) Option E implies that the students were given the extra points for the assignments as well as the other activity. The students didn't choose to do the points, so this doesn't work.\n3.) D is incorrect because it only refers to assignments, not extra credit points' work.\n4.) Options B and E do cover all extra credit points' assignemsnts; however, we cannot be sure if the question would accept this.\n5.)

{"text": "1: From the scenario it is known that the competition is to drop an object, this suggests that the answer is from the options \"hold onto\", because this is the only option that could potentially fit. \n2: The scenario has also been described as extremely difficult.  Therefore, the answer would only be from one of the options that are not particularly descriptive of the action taking place.\n3: The options of \"pick up\" and \"lifting\" require different actions to actually happen, they would never be used in a game where you have to drop the object because you would then have to do something else to either pick up or lift up the object.\n4: There are two options that are somewhat descriptive of what is happening in the scenario: \"hold onto\" and \"hold still\".\n5: Though, \"lifting\" can be implied to have the same effect as \"holding onto\", it also describes a different action taking place.

{"text": "1.'What is a convenient place' - the question requests for the answer to a place that is convenient.\n2. \"For a bus station\" - to ensure that all considerations to do with bus stations are noted, which narrows down the answer to a choice that mentions 'a bus station'.\n3. 'Convenient place' - in order to ensure we do not choose a place such as the school or city centre, which would be too close to the bus station, the term 'convenient' should be used in combination with 'a place'. This means 'a place' for the bus station, not just a place in general.\n4. The answer choices must all include a location that is convenient for a bus station.\n5. 'Maps' is an option that may serve a purpose in finding the bus station, but not if we needed to reach the bus station itself. It is not considered convenient, but rather a tool to help locate it.\n6. 'City centre' is not a convenient place, as the area would probably be congested in a city, which does not allow the bus station to be located nearby without difficulty. In this case location is not convenient, but rather the city in general is convenient to visit.\n7. 'School', as opposed to 'a school', which may sound similar in meaning, should not be considered, as a bus station does not have a school near by- which the question does not include.\n8. Therefore option D: 'City Centre' should be eliminated.\n9. Option 'A: Maps' does not directly describe the location either. It may describe the location's surroundings but maps aren't generally seen as 'a convenient place'.\n10. So by process of elimination only E: School remains. If this were a location for the bus station, the question would state: \"There's a bus station near a school\". Since the option states \"there's a ____ for ___ near a school\"- this only leaves the possibility that it's a destination not of an object/location, hence option E is the final answer.\nSo the finals answer is E: School\n\nInput: The last day of class went by quickly thanks to your friend.

{"text": "1) The question asks regarding a hypothetical scenario where someone is leaving their office and does not require his account book anymore.\n2) There are 5 options ranging from 'A: kept at accountant' to 'E: Keeper tamp'.\n3) A) can be eliminated since it would mean he is leaving the book with someone else.\n4) B) purse is a common household item that people use to store various objects.\n5) C) desk drawer can be eliminated since the option suggests the account book will not be kept in their house.\n6) D) bank can be eliminated since this implies the person is storing the account book at a bank.\n7) The option E) keeper tamp is a reference to 'Keeper' as in 'Keeper tamp'. This can be ruled out is because it has nothing to do with putting an account book anywhere, it is simply an inapplicable reference, which we already know.\n8) Hence the question essentially asks where the account book can be put/ stored and the answer would be D) at the office because only the office has the capacity to store a book.\nSo the final choice is D: at the office\n\nInput: A good way to make a long-term habit stick is  to ____ a hard time. Choices:  A to make it easy B to keep trying C to make it a part of life D to build a sense of urgency E to make it unconscionable\nOutput: The sentence refers to a good way to make a good habit stick, so we can rule out \"To make it easy\" and \"to make it a part of\". The next option left is to make it a \"hard time\", which means: 1. To struggle or fight against. Example- She had a hard time getting accepted into the university because of her financial situation. 2. Not pleasant or enjoyable to experience. Example: I had a hard time trying to concentrate on my schoolwork with so much going on in my personal life. 3. To present difficulties to someone. Example: They had a hard time trying not to argue. So, it's clear from these meanings that \"hard time\" can mean something that is difficult, unpleasant.\nThe second part of the question is to find a sentence that best completes it. That sentence would be \"keep", "answer": "C: desk drawer"}
{"text": "1.\"A teddy bear is a soft toy bear.\" 2. A teddy bear is something that someone would buy in the place stated in question which is a \"Toy Store\". 3.\"A bear is like an animal that has fur.\"So,toy bear will have fur and it is a toy because it is not a real bear.\nSo the final question is that 1. Teddy bears are soft animals. 2. A teddies goes to toy store,thus teddies do not go to home.\n\nInput:If it is not what I want, I'll return it to the shelf. Choices:  A. toy store B. bed C. shelf D. closet E. home\nOutput:1.If i buy something from the the shelf i will definitely go to the shelf to return it. 2.There is no \"bed\", \"toy store\",\"closet\" etc. 3.The \"home\" is where someone go to sleep.\nSo the final answe is to the Shelf. because,the most logical place, to put back the thing.\n\nInput:You shouldn't worry about what is in your head unless it's on your what?

The question states is about a desk, a place to put things.\n3. We should exclude options A, B, and D, since they are not about a place that would put things.\n4. \"Worry\" means to be distressed at anxiety and stress; \"head\" means a person's thoughts and the mind; \"put to\" means to use to purpose.\n5. Thus, the sentence implies that you have to put your thoughts somewhere useful, since they are useless.\n6. We do not know what's in the person's head, so it must be the desk. If one can't put things on the table, why would you be worried about what's in your mind?\nSo the answer is Desk.\n\nInput: It goes on in the head and it doesn't stop until", "answer": "E: toy store"}

Choices: A: frames B: decorations C: condition D: subject E: value\nOutput: 1: The question is rhetorical asking what one needs other than paintings to make an object valuable.\n2.The sentence suggests that the objects in a painting are valuable to begin with. Only then, if such objects are not to be found in the pictures, would the picture's worth be reduced.\n3.Therefore, the given phrase \"the paintings' what?\" refers to other objects that render a picture valuable, except for paintings.\n4.None of the options provided can be excluded at this stage, except frames because they do not refer to \"the paintings'.\"\n5.\"Condition,\" \"Subject,\" and \"Value\" all refer to objects of a painting, except \"condition,\" which has a non-pictorial meaning. In this case and on a basic level, a painting's condition is defined as the overall and visual state of the artifact.\nFor an untrained eye, a painting's subject is a visible and comprehensible picture on the surface of a canvas.\nValue, in this context, is the relative importance of something. \n6.Thus, the options \"Condition,\" \"Subject,\" \"Value\" are not suitable for this context.\n7.Since \"Condition\" is not a synonym of \"the picture's,\" it is excluded.\n8.Similarly, \"Subject\" has a distinct meaning unrelated to any picture.\n9.Therefore, the remaining option \"Value\" is invalid.\n10.In the end, the given phrase refers to objects other than \"the painting's\" to make it valuable. \n11.The", "answer": "C: bound"}
{"text": "1.\"During the brainstreaming session\", the word'session' refers to a meeting or gathering.\n2.The question's context is to indicate that multiple people were talking to each other, so this indicates that multiple people exchanged information in some way.\n3. \"Obtaining Information\" is also correct as some information might be received through the process, however there is a strong indication that the session was multi-person and thus also involves'sharing' and 'conversation'.\n4.

That person is said to be paralyzed. Choices: A: muscle tense B: muscle stiff C: muscle tight D: rigid E: stiff\nOutput: 1: \"When a person is in an exceptionally relaxed state\", the word \"exceptional\" indicates that the relaxation/stiffness occurs as an exception, and not regularly.\n2. \"Rigid\" and \"Tight\" refer more to how things are, where as \"stiff\" refers to a state of being.\n3. \"Stiff\" is a synonym for rigid, however \"rigid\" is also more indicative of the fact that a stiffened condition is unlikely to happen/be natural.\n4. \"Rigid\", \"Extremely\", \"Exceptionally\" and \"Muscle\" all relate closely to each other.\n5. The word \"Paralysis\" is usually associated with a state of weakness and inability to move.\n6. If a person is in this state, then obviously it indicates a state of muscle \"TENSE-NESS\", as it takes an extreme amount of effort and muscle movement to do the least of things that should otherwise be easy and natural.\n7.

This indicates that the print was too small to read comfortably with the naked eye, suggesting that the text was deliberately kept to a small font without any extras like a text box as it would have been in this case, causing difficulty for the reader.\n2. \"He began to suffer eye strain\" suggests that he began to experience stress or tension to the muscles around the eyes after a period of excessive straining trying to read the print.\n3. \"happiness\", \"sight\", \"insight\", and \"understanding\" are irrelevant here. 'Understanding' is too vague to be the answer, 'happiness' may indicate that he was happy about the purchase, but this doesn't make sense in this scenario; he would have to understand to realise the benefit of it.\n4. That leaves'strain' and 'thought' - both could be possible outcomes of reading something with extremely small font for extended periods, although'strain' has connotations of physical tension, the sentence also hints at a mental aspect to this.\n5. \"E: Thought\" is the more specific fit, both connotations seem to apply.\nSo the final answers is \"E: Thought\".\n\nInput: I felt depressed for no reason at all, until I realised I had no hobbies to keep my mind occupied and when I started a new hobby my depression went what?

The tone conveys a sense of intimacy that implies a smaller, more restricted space.\n4: D is incorrect because it implies a non-hotel venue, which contradicts the question\u2019s request for a reception at a large hotel. \n5: Loosening restrictions to any large hotel is an incorrect answer choice because the correct one is A.

Similarly, \"learn from each other\" does not involve anything related to traveling on liquidos.\n6. Therefore option D: traveling on liquid is more suitable than other options.\n7. Therefore it is reasonable to assume that we should choose \"D: traveling on liquid\", since people perform various activities when traveling on liquids, and we can not narrow down which one of them is the \"right\" one.\nSo the final correct answer is D: Sailing on liquids\n\nInput: The people of the island were more interested in one activity than another.  The men talked about what? Choices: A. cooking B. gardening C. fishing D. eating  E. doing laundry\nOutput: 1) The question suggests that we must find out what activity all of the mentioned options except one talk about.\n2) 'Activity' has been used in the question to indicate two activities - 'cooking' and 'gardening', both of which people engage in. \n3) 'Fishing' also involves participation in an activity, though the answer should be 'what the men talk about' and not 'what people generally do'.\n4) 'Eating' is not a singular activity and can not be applied in this context.\n5) 'doing laundry' is a singular activity of its own, which cannot be applied here.\n6) In this scenario, the only activity suitable to the prompt is fishing, but 'doing laundy' might be more appropriate to the context mentioned in Option E.\n7) The reason why this option is inappropriate is because although the women were more interested in it than any other activity, in context, it is only 'an activity' that they were interested in and the question still asks us to identify one singular activity.\n\nSo the final correct sentence was E: gardening", "answer": "A: sail boats"}

It is a noun, not a verb. \n3.\"What\", in this context, refers to the person's experience.\n4.\"Was happening to him\" refers to his bodily state. As the awakening process requires both consciousness and awareness, it is more logical to deduce that the awake state relates to the previous choice.\n5.\"Physiologically\" refers to a biological state rather than a mental or emotional one. It can be inferred that \"what was happening to him\" when he awoke refers directly to his bodily state, as opposed to his consciousness or awareness. \n6.The final word in the sentence is \"Bill\" which is capitalized. Capitalization can identify either specific instances of nouns, or a generic instance of a noun, as in \"Bill\" representing persons, and \"Bills\" representing money. In this sentence \"Bill\" must refer to a person.\n7.The other possible meaning refers to a medical record or diagnosis of a Bill or other person, but in this context the question is more likely about the personal experience of the individual which is capitalized. \n8.As the previous answer is deemed to be correct, we can then eliminate other options that are not related to the question \"Was awakening what was happening to Bill\", including:\n\"Tiredness\" \u2013 This does not relate to a person waking per say.

This leaves us with the choices of \"Bite\", \"Feel pain\" and \"Die\"\n4. Biting animals is clearly not touching, so the answer must be one of the remaining two choices.\n5. The only way to touch something is if it is live, thus we can exclude die as the obvious answer here.\n6. Feel pain is a clear reaction in animals when they are touched and is in line with the original intent behind the question.\n7. Thus, the answer will be \"Feel pain\" as this will be the only correct answer. Feel pain is the only way something could be in touch with wild animals.\nSo the final answers are F:Feel pain\n\nInput: The man was going to be late for class, but stopped when he saw a what?  Choices:    A: dead person B: school C: student D: teacher E: police officer\nOutput: 1:  \"He was going to be late\" means that he had intended being late and had a set intention to reach the location.\n2. The term \"He was going to\" implies that he decided to continue by himself, after stopping in front of the dead person.\n3. Eliminating the options that are irrelevant to this scenario, one can now move on to find the answer to \"He was going to, but stopped when he\", which clearly means he stopped. This would require one to consider what specifically stopped him, and from this we can eliminate the irrelevant ones.\n4. The choices of \"A: Dead person B: School\" refer to different instances where stopping takes place, while the choices of \"C: Student D: Teacher\" refer to \"being late for class\", which we already know is not what he intended. This means that the scenario refers only to the dead person.\n5. This leaves one option, \"E: police officer\" which refers to a \"stop\".\n6. \"Having stopped in between two locations\" clearly refers to moving forward or backward after stopping as indicated by the movement of the verb. In this case the location referred to by the sentence is \"class", "answer": "C: bite"}
{"text": "1.\"Human in a large nort eastern city\" could be the context that the sentence gives us.\n2. \"Where can you see animals?\" is the central question in this question.\n3. We understand that we are in a \"large nort eastern city,\" so this rules out options c and d, which are not in \"nort eastern city.\"\n4. Since we are talking about \"large nort eastern cities\" and the question relates to \"animals\", animals in cities would be zoo animals, or \"zoo\" would be where we would see \"animals\", so excluding option A.\n5. We also know that we are talking about humans, and if we are talking about humans then \"sky\" or a \"workplace\" wouldn't be the best choices, but \"New York City\" still fits and is not completely out of context, so if we cannot guess anything, we could choose option E. \n6. Thus, we can eliminate options B, C, and D.\n7. Therefore \"The best answer, which fits the sentence, is 'zoo'\"\nSo the final answer should be Zoo \n\nInput: I am a man, I have a woman by my side. I have a great, great relationship with them. The man's what? Choices: A: wife B: girlfriend C: mom D: father E: sister\nOutput: \"I am a man, I am a woman by my side, I have a great, very happy relationship with them\" the answer can be either option c or d, a man has many relations with women, he could also be married to her, they could a couple\n\nOption a can be excluded as a woman cannot be referred to as wife and option b can be excluded as he is describing his relationship and a woman cannot be referred as girlfriend as they are clearly married, both options a and b can be excluded so,\nthe answer is either c or d\n\nOption C can be exluded as man can not simply say I am a mother in the beginning of the sentence and in the end of the sentence, it is a complete different meaning\n\nOption D can be exludr as the relationship is a good one and a sister can never be termed as a husband's sister,\nthe correct answer is option E: man\u2019s father", "answer": "A: zoo"}
{"text": "1) The question states that John prefers glass and wishes to be somewhere else, rather than what?\n2) All options but one describe a place, so choice A, cupboard is disregarded because it is a place.\n3) Because the question does not simply ask \"where\" but \"where does he want to be?\" we can eliminate choices B & C which refer more to a place.\n4) Options D & E are unsuitable as both are negative rather than positives.\n5) The most obvious choice here is D: own home, as the best place for John was at home.\n\nSo the  final answer is D: own home \n\nInput:He had a strange idea to be successful: he wanted to be famous and also wanted to have what? Choices: A: money B: a house C: an exciting life D: a family E: admiration\nOutput: 1: The question states that John had a strange idea to what?\n2: All options are options for success, so we disregard ones that are not such, especially any that may be unattainable to everyone. For example, option E: admiration is not something we can achieve.\n3: Options A & B are for money and a house, which are not unreasonable for John to want, however option A does not include an aspect of success, rather being wealthy.\n4: Option C: an exciting live has a similar ambiguity to option B: a house and doesn't have an aspect of success. Option C, is for John to live an exciting live, which is something that we could conclude John wanted in general, however doesn't relate to success.\n5: Option D: a family is not necessarily something that we can acquire. We cannot guarantee with certainty that John has managed to have a family but it would be quite a strange idea not to try to have a family, as it is the basic foundation for human beings. It also could be a positive aspect of success.\n6: So the answer is most likely D: a family as it's a more reasonable and attainable option.\nSo the final answers is D: a family\n\nInput:She needed help getting her new job.

{"text": "1.The question asks where a glass of wine can be purchased, implying that the user knows where wines are normally purchased.\n2. The options include \"A: art show, B: A: bar, C: A: church, D: A: basement and E: A: basement.\n3. The last 3 options (A: bar, D: church and E: basement) are all clearly false, because in each of these cases the user would not purchase a glass of wine as they require a bottle or more.\n4. This is evidenced by the phrase \"A glass\", which implies that no more than 1 glass of wine would be purchased.\n5. By eliminating the above 3 options, and leaving just 2, the user needs to decide based on the remaining options, as \"A: Basement\" and \"B: Basement\" are both options for where to buy a glass of wine.\n6. Option \"A: basement\" would seem a logical solution to the question, because that is where wines are stored.\n7. However, it's evident from context that the user has chosen this location incorrectly, and \"B: basement\" is correct.\n8. This would mean that the user purchases wine from a bar or from a church.\n9. \"B: Basement\", therefore, is the answer to the question.\nSo the final ans is B: Basement\n\nInput:The government needs to do something about the homeless problem and is considering rent control and how that impacts the supply of housing. Do you think that would solve that problem or make it worse or have no impact at all? Choices:  Increase Impact Reduce Impact None Worse Better Equal\nOutput:1. The topic of the question is \"rent control\"; the issue being addressed by the government through this policy.\n2. Option \"A: increase\" refers to policies that increase the rate of rent controlled housing production, which is considered inadequate by the government, and option \"D: no impact\" can be eliminated as the government cannot have no impact on the issue.The options that follow this exclusionary pairing are \"B: worse\", \"C: no impact\", and \"E: better\".\n3. If rent control increased production, then clearly the government has lessened the effects of homelessness, and the option \"", "answer": "C: bar"}
{"text": "1.\"Sammy wanted to go where the people were. Where might he go?\" the questions asks us to identify where Sammy will go, to experience people around him.\n2. This can be inferred from the use of the phrase \"go to where the people are\" which shows he will go to a populated area.\n3. Thus, the best answer would be option C as \"Sammy wanted to go... to experience people around him\".\n4. A race track would also be suitable for experiencing people but the key to the correct answer is the fact that \"he will to where the people are\". \"going to a race track doesn't seem to be the best answer\" said a test taker.\n5. The test taker's reason to eliminate \"race track\" and \"apartment\" as answers were that, \"he will go \"to where the people are\" and people stay in apartments\".\n6. \"The desert would be a very bad place for a person to go to experience people around him, he would most likely get hurt\", test-takers said.\n7. Thus, \"a roadblock\" is a much more probable answer than \"the desert\" as, \"roadblocks are usually formed when a person will experience people. Moreover, test takers argued, \"there would be few people in the desert\".\n8. The last answer choice is \"Apartment,\" but it is possible an unintentional pun was made here, as \"the people\" could be interpreted as referring to tenants living in an apartment complex. This would make \"apartment,\" in this context, a more literal answer choice than the others. Since this answer choice does not follow logically from the passage, it is eliminated.\n9. So the final answer is D \"Apartment\"\n\nInput:I wish I had a tiger to ride on. I wish I were a tiger. I wish I could what?

{"text": "1) The question asks where a business restaurant is likely to be located. A restaurant that primarily caters to business customers is a business restaurant here.\n2) The options listed do not all describe where a business restaurant would be located. We can eliminate all options that do not describe a business restaurant as possible locations.\n3) Examples to eliminate all options except for A, B and D: (i) A 'town' is not considered to be a business sector, and it may or may not have business restaurants. (ii)  A'mall' is not commonly associated with business restaurants. (iii) A restaurant 'at' a hotel may simply be a restaurant located inside a hotel. It is in the hotel, but may be meant for any customers, including business clients.  (iv)  A 'business sector' is a location with businesses working in the same field.\n4)  The options that can be eliminated now are (iii) A: town - option (iv) D: business sector, and (v) E: yellow pages. Option E: yellow pages may contain phone numbers for  business restaurants. But it is unlikely that the restaurant would be located there.\n5) Therefore, the options that remain are (i) A: town, (ii) B: at a hotel, and (iii) D: a business sector. Option D: A business sector is the most probable location for a business restaurant. We know that these are all reasonable locations, so option (ii): A business sector is a more specific location, and the likely choice.\nSo the final choice is D: business sector\n\n\nInput: The two boys came from what?

{"text": "1.\"2 too quickly\" in the preamble refers to heat and is telling the listener that the man is expiring. James was too hot and must cool down.\n2. As a result we can eliminate D and E, as they do neither prevent his imminent death, nor cause him to continue experiencing heat stroke. \n3. \"2\" should also be considered a preamble, as the speaker had already clarified the situation in the phrase beforehand. In the next sentence, the listener is given the information of how he is dying.\n4. \"Relaxation\" refers to a psychological condition, and \"Calm down\" refers to a figurative phrase rather than a physical state that can be attributed to physical conditions involving heat.\n5. As such, B and C are likely the only viable options, as they can both apply to the heat stroke situation presented to us in the question. However, since it is not stated that \"James was a doctor\", it is feasible that his demise could be brought on by some psychosomatic ailment.\n6. This leads us to conclude C is the correct answer- \"James' cooling off was expanding, causing him to lose too much heat.\" Expansions can cause contractions, therefore if James's cooling off is expanding, then he must be losing heat.\n7. The other option B is also not suitable because \"cooling off quickly\" is not the cause of James' imminent death, but a solution, the cause of his death is the opposite.\nSo the final is choice is answer is C: Expansion, and the answer is E: Calm down\n\nInput:  The sun is rising, but it will soon be hidden, the moon is waxing.

{"text": "1\"Typically\", the word used in the question, means what is customary or usual.\n2. Therefore the answer cannot be \"A: hospital\", \"B:head\", \"D:Elderly person\" or \"E: doctor's office\" because these are not unusual or customary for contracting illness.\n3. \"Sick person\" is the only thing that can be categorised as \"usual\" for contracting illness, so we will select this as our answer.\nSo the final answewr is A:sick person\n\nInput: If one goes to the dentist, he/she will go through all the procedures required of him/her.  He/she cannot skip them unless he/she is what? Choices: A: dying B: afraid C: ill D: nervous E: sick\nOutput: 1: The dentist is what?  He/She can't skip their required dentist routine, unless they are: a) dying b) afraid C) ill D) nervous E) sick\n2. Therefore, one could say the answer to the question is \"ill\" or perhaps \"sick\", because one may not go to the dentist unless they are ill or sick.\n3. However, we do not know what illness the dentist is suffering, is it a minor cold or flu or could it be a serious illness that causes death?\n4. It is also possible the person is not sick with an illness, but is afraid of suffering a disease or procedure, or is dying because of their age thus, there are many possibilities.\n5. There have been too many possibilities that can lead us away from a straight forward answer, but upon careful consideration we do know that all the other options will be present, if one dies due to their illness, they will have been afraid, nervous, and sick leading up to their death.\n6.

{"text": "1.\"Which entrance would you choose?\" the question asks us to consider choosing one of the entrances based on a criteria to avoid using the back entrance.\n2. To solve this question correctly, we begin with the obvious choices 'Side' and 'Main' to eliminate, as the back entrance is not one of the listed entrances, and therefore would not be one we would choose.\n3. Options 'Anterior' and 'Current' can be eliminated by understanding that the question states 'you do not want to use..' which does not include either of these answers.\n4. So we only have the remaining four options.\n5. As we know, Entrance E is the back entrance, choice (E) is not what we need to avoid.\n6. With the remaining answers, (A) and (B) - The side entrance and the main entrance, we can understand that as the question describes it, neither can be considered ideal entrances, otherwise they would be specified in the list of choices, (Side) (Main). Therefore choice (A) and (C).\n7. Choice (A), \"side entrance\", does not meet the criteria of not considering the back entrance (as the back entrance is the side entrance), and the choice (C), \"anterior\", does not meet the requirements based on 'you do not want..', nor does it have any other criteria to support its use in this context.\n8. Thus, choosing choice between (A) and (D) \"current entrance\" is not the ideal answer, but is the option that best meets the requirement of the question.\nSo the final answers are D: current entrance.\n\nInput: At his core, he was a person who values his what?

The answer can be inferred using his actions and noting the values he possessed.\n3. In this case, we can infer that money is his core; for the following reasons: His career revolves around his company's wealth, he is working towards increasing the companies profit exponentially, through his innovations which are monetary gain-oriented to his business.", "answer": "B: main"}
{"text": "1.\"the drug kingpin told his men to run errands\" is the sentence which makes us understand what the kingpin meant by what he said.\n\n2. The Kingpin's 'errand' could include going everywhere to distribute money to drug dealers.\n3. However, the question's answer choice, 'to run errands' doesn't literally mean to take money.\n4. Instead, 'to take money' seems to be a better choice, as this phrase implies taking from every dealer to give to the kingpin.\n5. This also makes more sense from a contextual point of view, as the kingpin could be collecting money for a variety of reasons, including bribing the police, for paying drug dealers, and so on.\n6. Therefore the answer must be to 'take money', as this accurately reflects the specific purpose of these errands.\nSo the final answers are A: park B:make time C: receive instructions D,E: to run errands \nHence, it is C: receive instructions\n\nInput:They asked him many times why he didn't want kids, but he didn't give a straight answer.

For example, it doesn't make sense to require the camper to cook breakfast before cooking food, as it would be unintentional. Similarly, asking a camper to light a fire makes no sense before cooking food.\n4) It isn't always necessary for a camper to pack or bag the camp before cooking food, the camper may prepare the necessary ingredients and then use a microwave.\n5) The only option related to cooking is option (3)- pack or bag.

{"text": "1 There are two correct options, \"A\" and \"E\", as they are both on the East Coast of North America.\n2. Out of the other three incorrect options, \"B\" is the most likely to be incorrect, as it is inland.\n3. We can further eliminate \"C\" as it makes no mention of seafood and \"D\" as the North American coast has many beach towns.\n4. Thus the answer can be confidently narrowed down to either \"A: maine\" or \"E: ocean\".\n5. Maine, being inland, likely wouldn't have a seafood menu. The question specifically asks \"A seafood restaurant\", implying that it could be on the coast.\n6. So \"E: ocean\" must be the answer, as it is on the coast but also includes a menu of seafood.\nSo the final answers is E: Ocean\n\nInput: One of the challenges facing the new manager is to create a strong staff of what? Choices: managers supervisors leaders executives\nOutput: 1 The question is asking us to identify the correct term which describes the role the manager is responsible for when creating a strong staff.\n2. We must first eliminate \"Executives\", because they are not managers, supervisors or leaders.\n3. \"Leaders\" means to walk ahead, but these aren't people who are leading- they are people who work with the manager and need to be managed themselves, so it may not be the most appropriate option.\n4. \"Managers\" are likely to be people who work for the manager, not directly under them.\n5. \"Supervisors\" are people in charge of a group of workers- this is likely closest to the role the manager will have to have, because they will require supervision and guidance, so it may not always be necessary to make them managers.\n6. The remaining option is \"leaders\", which are people who others look up to and follow.\n7. So \"managers\" is the correct choice, as many of the people will have to be managed by others under them, and thus will be leaders.\nSo the final outcome is A: managers\n\nInput: They don't want you to know that an ordinary person can do what?

{"text": "1 The question asks, What is the only way to recover from exhaustion...(1) So the only way to recover is to (2) from exhaustion.. So (1) and (2) must be the same things.  It is only by careful examination of the context that we determine that 1 and 2 are not different things at all. It is clear (1) is synonymous with (2), so we cannot eliminate (c), (d) or (e) as possibilities. \n2. It is only with the remaining options that we can reasonably answer the question - we can eliminate options B and D because neither provide an answer to the question. If it were possible to meditate yourself out of exhaustion or recover by just getting more rest, then none of the other options would be asked. The first thing you do after getting very very tired is sleep to recover, and then when you wake up, you are no longer exhausted and so do not meditate to recover. (2) is an alternative to (1). They must therefore be different things. \n3. Option B, stays in bed.. does not provide an answer to the what is the way to recover from exhaustions question. \n4. Option D, run out of steam gives some indication of the process of recovery, but still does not answer how you can recover. In fact the only indication you know what you need to recover to when you run out of steam.\n5. Option C, have rest is synonymous with rest. Therefore it is by definition the same thing as having rest.\n6. Option E, go to sleep is clearly an inadequate answer to the problem, and so we exclude it.\n7. The only viable options that can give us what is the only way to to recover from exhaustion are A meditate and E go to sleep. \n8. (a) does not give what is the way to recovery. There is not reason why one needs to meditate as a recovery from exhaustion, as it can be done at any time. The same applies to E. A recovery can be done without needing to meditate or go to sleep.\n9. So, A meditate and E sleep are the only viable answers remaining.

Option C: Violin case also contains the phrase \"South of\" and \"North of\", so is a possibility but we need a state.\n5.

{"text": "1.\"She continued to do what?\", this suggests that the process of trying to reduce her waist-size continuously failed.\n2. The word'miserably' strongly suggests the word 'fail' here.\n3. We can rule out all the remaining options, simply by applying logical reasoning.\n4. 'Gaining weight' is not the opposite of reduced; 'Increase the size' is not the opposite to reduce to make smaller.\n5. 'The process' is too ambiguous and can be interpreted in various forms, it does however, link to the term'she continued to do', which means that it can be connected to one of the previous options.\n6. She can only continuously fail to reduce her waist if she still does what she did initially, but this would violate the definition of failure, which is 'to fail in achieving an aim or purpose'. So, option A must be ruled out.\n7. 'Augment' and 'Dispare' are both out of place as well. Dispare, according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary refers to diminishing, so she would not have failed to reduce, but instead she would have failed to increase. As for 'Augment', it refers to the increase of something, so again she would still not have failed as her waist was never increased- she simply failed in doing so.\n8. Option C, 'Make larger' is possibly the most suitable option, but it is out of place if one is 'trying to reduce' something. Therefore, if she would have failed to'make larger', which again relates to increasing something, it must be that she tried to increase something but failed, i.e. she failed to decrease and increase something.\n9. To clarify further: Jamie's initial attempt at reducing her waist can be referred to as 'trying to make smaller/decrease' and the final attempt as 'trying to increase/make larger'. Therefor it is possible that Jamie failed to decrease something (which is different than making it smaller).\n10. We can also refer to this definition of augment and dispare in the definition of'reduce'; to reduce is to reduce to a lesser state than before, and so by definition Jamie failed to reduce her waist, which can be explained by saying 'She failed to decrease her waist size, and failed to increase", "answer": "A: gain weight"}

D: credit is a possible answer, but it does not define her impractical purchases in the same way.\n5.

We don't want a \"pleasant surprise\" or a \"reward\" because those are both good things. 2) We can also eliminate \"justice\" because justice has many forms, and we're only looking for what \"life\" gives us. 3) \"What we want\" is also not included because the sentence only says that we \"get\" what we deserve, it says nothing about what we want.\n4) And we're left with the answers \"C: a reward\" and \"E: good\".\n5) But here is where the sentence gives us our deciding clue: \"many people\" get what they deserve, but it isn's necessarily \"good\".\n6) So, the correct answer must be \"C: a reward\", because people may get \"rewards\" that are \"not necessarily good things\".\nSo the final answer must be C: A reward\n\nInput: He thought of his grandfather's death as what and was a good time?

We must now consider the context of the sentence when analyzing option D.(\u2018Missing out\u2019) It refers to the event.\n8.) This doesn't mean that she wasn't attending, but rather that she was missing out on something. \n9.) It\u2019s not easy to know what she missed, as it would be difficult to determine whether or not she was sick all the time, because there\u2019s no more information given to decide this, But it\u2019s possible that she was too sick to attend the event.\n10.) So, by process of deduction, the answer is E( \u2018Comfort\u2019) because comfort can mean peace, quiet and relaxation. And in this context, she might be feeling down about missing a particular day of the event.\n11.) And while it could be the case that she was ill or bedridden all the time, this could still be the right answer, as comfort relates to relaxation, which means this can refer to her entire life.\n12.) Hence, the answer is comfort\n\nInput: His wife hated to cook for herself since she liked to have the food cooked perfectly and didn't have the patience to what? Choices A: cook herself B: learn how to read C: learn how to cook D: read E: pay a cook\nOutput: 1) The phrase \"have the food cooked perfectly\" clearly shows that the wife wanted to avoid making mistakes while cooking.\n2)", "answer": "D: missing out"}
{"text": "1. The answer clearly needs to begin with the words \"I'm looking for\" in order to state one's purpose in looking for a place where alcohol and fried  foods can be found.\n2. The sentence following this indicates the existence of choices A to E, all of which can be interpreted as places where alcohol and fries could be found.\n3. However, the key term in this sentence for locating what we are looking for is \"Any suggestions\", indicating that the individual seeking the answer hasn't found the type of place they were looking for.\n4. Option A: pub, despite being a place serving alcohol and fried chicken, is not the correct answer. \n5. It does not provide suggestions of any kind to the querant in their search.\n6. Options B: plane and C: beer are incompatible with the initial wording, for their connection with alcohol alone is not \"suggested\".\n7. Option D: store can also be rejected on the same basis, as it does not provide the individual with any kind of suggestion.\n8. \"fraternity house\" is excluded as the querant specifies they are not looking to drink alcohol and are not concerned about its availability.\n9. Finally, Option E: Fraternity House has suggestions, but as there were no other suggestions provided, this is not relevant in solving the question.\n10. The only option available is Option B: plane.\nSo the final answers is B: plane\n\nInput:Which fruit has the most calories - apples or oranges? Choices: 1. A: Oranges, 2. B: Apples, 3. C: Tomatoes, 4. D: Grapes, 5. E: Bananas\nOutput:1. There are a number of terms that can be defined as \"calorie\", and we have to be certain that the intended calorie count relates to the total amount of both.\n2. The correct sequence would be BDC to identify which fruit has the most calorie count.\n3. 1 and 2 are eliminated as they both indicate the correct answer is either 'Apples' or 'Oranges'.\n4. C, 'Tomatoes', do not have the right number of calories and D 'Grapes', do not have the same calorie count as App", "answer": "A: pub"}

String is the most likely and essential component to a kite, and if Sally ran out of string, she would not be able to use her kite- so the answer must be E: end of line.\nSo the final answers are E: end of line\n\nInput:A bird that cannot fly is called a ________?Choices:  A: lame B: flightless C: caged D: wounded E: tamed\nOutput: 1) The question asks for a word that best describes a bird which cannot fly.\n2) The main choices all focus on different aspects of the bird.\n3) Option A: \"lame\" is more likely an insult directed at a disabled person, so, it is not applicable here.\n4) Option B: \"flightless\" suggests that a bird cannot fly, but it does not indicate why.\n5) The term \"caged\" describes any bird which is enclosed, but it doesn't provide information on if the bird is flying or not.\n6) The term \"wounded\" means to harm something, which may happen in captivity, but it doesn' t show if a bird cannot fly because of this.\n7) \"Tamed\" suggests the bird is controllable, which may result from a lack of flight capacity.\n8) So, the only valid answer is option D: \"wounded\".\nSo the final answer are E: wounded", "answer": "D: end of line"}
{"text": "1st step: The question is asking about an object that we need to locate.\n2nd step: Let's identify what the question is requesting for. Is it asking about geographical location? No, because if it were that, the answer would be florida or california. The question is asking about a general location, not a specific or precise location within the United States.\n3rd step: Let's use some words to eliminate options. For example, the object cannot be in a small area like denmark and california (large area) is not possible either, so both are out. The object must be somewhere where lots of people reside in the area (hence large area), the area being relatively east.\n4th step: The answer should be an adjective like, coastal, east, southern, northeast etc., the question indicates east coast so an answer needs to be somewhere on the east.\n5th step: East coast area or areas or regions or such similar terms can only apply to the whole east coast of the US since there are many east coast areas across the US and are not as similar as coast or shore, in which case we can eliminate them.\n6th step: So, the answer must be the word United states.\n7th step: Let's start with the commonest of the options- the answer must be a phrase, hence the last word cannot be plural.\n8th step: The options are: United states- United states- so the plural option, denmark cannot be the answer. Since the options are: E- A, denmark cannot be an option.\n9th step: The options we have are A- E- so we eliminate the option B since the answer can only be a single word without a plural form. From the remaining options, \"C\" cannot be the answer because it is clearly unfit- no single word, no other information, no option of what can be the answer. It can be a question. So the answer must be \"A: florida\".\nSo the final answer must be A: florida\n\nInput: The most interesting thing about a book is the person who writes it. Choices:  A. An interesting writer B.

Therefore, option D must be this solution, as the given statement is in the form of a mathematical problem.\nSo the final question is D: Math Problem\n\nInput: In the 1970s, the city of Los Angeles was trying to attract families to move in, so how did they do it? Choices: 1. They built a lot more jobs 2. They cut taxes 3. They offered free daycare 4. They built a lot of playgrounds E: All of the above\nOutput: 1: The question asks \"How did they do it?\", suggesting that the answer can be in terms of the actions that they took.\n2: The answer must involve actions that the city took in a collective way.\n3: The answer is unlikely to be an action such as \"cut taxes.\"\n4: The answer must only provide 1 action, although \"they built\" can be seen to involve multiple actions.\n5: All of the above cannot be correct - if all four of the statements were simultaneously true of the city of Los Angeles, their actions cannot have combined to attract families.\n6:  Thus, after eliminating the less suitable options, we can conclude that the answer to the question will most likely involve an action such as \"they built playgrounds.\"\nSo the final answer will be E: They built playgrounds\n\nInput: A survey about what people watch on their phone during commercial breaks found that 18% watch what.

{"text": "1.This question is asking where Ben was after the accident.\n2. The question tells us that Ben made a mistake. This could be related to driving under the influence and it could be a significant factor since he was put in prison for 8 years.\n3. Prison sentences are normally 1-2 years long, but in this rare case he spent more than 8 years in prison so we can exclude Option A: prison\n4. Bridge sentences in prison are not common. The time served for bridge sentences can vary from just a few months to several years. Based on this information, we concluded that Ben was not given a \"bridge sentence\"\n5. We can eliminate options B & C.\n6. In the United States of America, there is a trend that people who are homeless prefer to stay at a homeless shelter rather than at someone's house. The question asks about Ben's address for 8 years.  We can infer that he would not have stayed at an unknown address which means option E is not the right answer.\n7. We concluded that his sentence was longer than a bridge sentence so it must be for 8 years. Based on this conclusion his sentence probably started while he was in prison. If he was in prison he would have no choice other than to stay at a neighbour's house since they can't be homeless since they are too old to be homeless.\n8. Option B is the likely answer because there is an overview of the US prison system.\n9. Ben is an alcoholic and has an accident.  Option B is the most suitable based on the description.\n\nInput:The two-year contract with his employer was only the beginning.  The next six years of his life were filled with the greatest joy.

Given the context of the question, options A, B, and E should be eliminated. One would not want insect repellent as a result of jogging, and heart attacks and shin splints are not positive.\n4.

Choices: A: risk taking B: investment C: financial stability D: spending power E: banking sector\nOutput: 1.) The question asks for us to find the right word to complete the statement: \"They encouraged this...\".\n2.) We can eliminate options that may suggest they encouraged risk taking or investment. We can also choose the option that most accurately describes \"this\", i.e. financial stability, spending power or banking sector.\n3.) As \"the mess that led to... \" is the cause of the crash, we should look for an option that describes the cause of this mess (a negative action) and rule out the other options. \n4.) Options \"A, D\" suggest the cause was risk taking and spending power but this seems implausible given what happened afterwards as described in the question.\n5.) Option \"C\" correctly suggests the cause was failure to avoid financial instability, but \"failure to avoid\" suggests an inaction and so this would be an incorrect way to describe this cause.\n6.) The only option remaining is E which correctly suggests a negative action and describes the \"this\" that needs a corrective, i.e. banking reforms. \nSo the final answer must be E: Banking Sector.", "answer": "B: not noticeable"}

We can eliminate the options that are not features of glass: \"Break easily, Bend, Hold water\"\n3. The phrase \"thin glass\" is ambiguous, we can't be sure if the thinnest possible glass, or if there are a variety of thicknesses included.\n4. The phrase \"shattering\" could refer to the glass itself, or what happens when it is shattered, when broken into smaller pieces. For the question to be answered, it must strictly refer to the glass itself.\n5. There are some other options that can be removed from consideration as the features that the question is looking for. \"melt\" is not a feature at all; \"Melt glass\" is not the way that glass is made, as glass \"made\" is \"glass\". \"dissolve/be liquefied\" are not features but more processes related to what happens to the glass after it has been made.\n6. Now, all that is left is two options: \"Shattering\" and \"break easily\".\n7. This would mean both that:\n\n1) if the glass is very thick and heavy, it will not easily break.\n2) if it is very thin and light, it will easily break.\n8. Thus, we can conclude that Thin glass \"breaks easily\" and thus is a characteristic of thin material.\n9. Hence, the correct answer is B: \"Shattering\".\nSo the final answer A: \"Shattering \"\n\nInput: What is a major problem in the environment? Choices: 1. Air pollution 2. Dirty water 3.

Clearly, such a circumstance implies competition and rivalry.\n4) Thus, John is motivated to compete and therefore is likely to categorize people into winners and losers.\n5) So, out of all the options provided, only option B: \"perform better\" is the correct answer.\nSo the final sentence is: John liked being able to divide people into winners and losses. It makes perfect sense that he's a competitive person, and it's not hard to see why.\n\nInput:John knew exactly where his money should have been going.  Though he was very busy, it still bothered him that he had no one else doing what? Choices:1  A: cook his meals B: clean his house C: mow his lawn 2  D: give him a massage E: entertain him\nOutput: 1 John knows exactly where his money should be going, clearly indicating that he is a very organized and organized person.\n2. The question asks us what made him worry even though he had no one to take care of the needs John had left over.\n3. It clearly indicates that John left a lot of work to do for himself and that this bothers him because it wastes time.\n4. Therefore, John misses the help of others to help him take care of everything.\n5. So, out of all of the options provided, we can say with certainty that it is option E: \"entertain him\"\n6. The question then asks us a second question, this time asking us to determine which option is the best option to put down as the answer.\n7. We can eliminate options 1 - 5, since none of these would improve John\u2019s ability to focus and get more work done.\n8. This implies that the correct answer would be either B, C or D.\n9.

{"text": "1: The main idea of the question is to identify an external factor that could prevent someone from buyeing chistmas presents.\n2,3. No need to eliminate anything as all options are relevant to the question.\n4. The option \"Happiness\" is irrelevant as it is not a monetary term. The word \"Happiness\" refers to personal feelings.\n5. The option \"Lack of money\" is irrelevant as the question simply asks about how to buy things even though it is related to the money. We should look for a word that means not being able to buy.\n6. Options \"Stress\" and \"Exhilaration\" could both occur before or after the process of purchasing chistmas presents. \"Relief\" is not an action word which is expected.\n7. \"Relief\" also refers to a sense of relief, something one may feel after purchasing chistmas present but it doesn't refer to something that could prevent someone from purchase chistmas presents. \n8.

{"text": "1.\"Joe bought a ficsus\" this is an adjective as it modifies 'Joe', the noun, so the term should be \"Joe's ficus\"\n2. To make sense of the question, we look for context.\n3. In the context of 'gardening' and 'flora', the terms 'forest' and 'flower' refer to places where we grow plants. In short, they are nouns that do not fit the requirements to replace the term 'home'.\n4. The term 'theater' can be either a pronoun or a noun, but it isn't suitable as'movie theater' could be referring to multiple locations.\n5. So we can eliminate A: family room, B: tropical forest, C: flower garden, and D: movie theater.\n6. The term 'hair salon' is relevant here because it is a type of store where you sell things related to hair- styling tools and products. It could also be a place that sells those very items; to people who are buying them for a living, in a commercial environment.\n7. So after making reasonable deductions, the answer is \"E: hair salon\", referring to the area where we sell things related to hair.\nSo the final Answer is E: hair salon", "answer": "A: family room"}

The options we have been given are not completely suited to the scenario described and we need to eliminate those that do not make sense.\n3. Options A and B are irrelevant - they either state that someone will never guess or they are a mystery, and they don't suggest different ways the man's hat is on.\n4. Similarly options D and E do not make logical sense, the statement \"but you'll never guess\" doesn't suggest that it had been upside down or back to front - it suggests that it had been on sideways.\n5. Hence the answer which would make logical sense is option C - \"He twisted it\".

We should start by discounting all the options which don't directly allow the person to move from one place to another.\n3. \"Car\" is the only option that might fit, however it doesn' 'enable' the person to get from one place to another as much as it 'allows' it to take place.\n4. The use of the word 'helicopter' instead of 'plane/airplane' suggests that one is not limited to using a car when moving between places since it could be transporting in another, possible faster, way.\n5. \"Speak words\" is an odd suggestion, as people can often speak words in their cars, which are not actually transportation.\n6. The other option \"believe in GOD\" suggests that we would need to be transporting to a destination within a church, wherein we are then 'believing in GOD' together.\n7. 'Dance together' might be appropriate as a way to transport yourself with another person, but this is not necessarily common practice.\n8. However 'believe in GOD' is not an uncommon phrase.\n9.

{"text": "1) We can discard choices A and B because if either of those options were the right answer, the question wouldn't have asked for \"more time\".\n2) Choices C and D don't really capture the spirit of the question either. Choice C - \"Back pain\" is related to studies and learning, but there could have been other, non-academic factors for John's visit which could be causing him pain. Choice D - \"Being bored\" isn't really an indication of spending more time and exploring exhibits.\n3) Choice E - \"pondering\" is the right answer. John wanted to spend more time at the museum, he wanted to explore and study the exhibits. The question also states \"John was an academic person and loved doing,\" this means that he loved studying, gaining knowledge, and pondering.

{"text": "1: In the previous two sample questions, an explanation was provided for the options, which helped clarify their connection to the subject. \n2. However, this question lacks such clarification, making it seemingly impossible to identify the answer without additional information. \n3. Therefore, in the absence of any such explanation, we can only consider each option in turn and rule them out for their various absurdities. \n4. \"Burned\" is the most easily dismissed option- it would destroy the piece of wood and thus is incapable of producing any reflection at all.\n5. \"Polished\"- the wood would still be present in a polished state but would lack the element of reflection.\n6. Similarly, \"Carved\" has a similar issue as the wood would be'manually' reduced to a flat surface and would no longer reflect the light because of that.\n7. \"Composted\" is a similarly absurd option that would decompose the wood, thus defeating its purpose. \n8. \"Nails\" may not be as absurd as the aforementioned options, however we can see that it is easily and completely dismissed by the simple logic of \"How do nails produce a reflection?\"\n9. This brings us to the final option, which turns out to be \"C: Carved\", because cutting wood out of the shape of your head can create a reflective surface, making the answer \"C: Carved\".\nSo the final answer  is C: carved\n\nInput:The doctor told the patient to drink lots of tea, since that what?

Choices:  a. careless B. dishonest C. smart D. thorough E. innovative F. generous\nOutput: 1 The Question states that the president will attack companies who pay too little in taxes, which implies that companies who pay too little are in trouble. The options are all things or people that can cause people to be in trouble, except for a and b. However, the sentence uses the word \u201cwere\u201d rather than \u201care\u201d, which means that the president\u2019s decision is in the past, so the companies in question have already been in trouble. 2. This implies that the president would have more success if she was more thorough. The question seems to be asking for a more appropriate word choice but actually expects an answer of \u201cforesight\u201d or \u201cproactive\u201d or \u201ccaution\u201d but not \u201cforesight\u201d is mentioned in the sentence and not in any of the options. 3.

Similarly, we cannot eliminate C: relax because doing a crossword every day may itself be simple but it is not pleasurable. \n5. Therefore, the answer must be \"A: you're boring\", because the crossword puzzle is simple but not pleasurable- and this is an example of what we would consider \"boring.\" \nTherefore, the choice is A: you're Bored.\nSo the final answers are A: you're what?

As there is only one kind of man in the scenario, it is irrelevant to eliminate certain options.\n3. By definition, an \"intellectual challenge\" is \"something that requires a lot of mental energy or effort.\" which is different from boredom. \n4.

C: eye strain is unlikely in this context, as nothing suggests that the driver is on the phone or is distracted whilst driving.\n6. D: getting tired does not automatically involve pain. Pain can come as part of the tiredness, but there are other ways to experience this state.\n7. E: a car crash could cause physical pain, but this is only when it already involves crashing. What is required in this context is a consequence to driving, but without a crash.\n8. Thus, the answer must be \"D: Getting Tired\".\nSo the final answer does not involve pain.", "answer": "D: getting tired"}
{"text": "1.\"The dog ran to the window\", refers to the dog's location rather than the location of the window.\n2.\"...and barked\", suggests that the dog made a noise, \"at the friend's house\" implies the location of barking, not the location of the dog.\n3.\"...The dog ran to the back door\", explains that the dog's location was a door rather than a window.\n4.\"...He sniffed around the yard\" would be suitable if the sentence was referring to the location of the dog, or the yard the dog was in.\n5.\"...The dog ran around the building\", implies the location of the dog is part of the building, not the location of a window.\n6. The remaining answer, \"the window\", is consistent with the context and could easily be inferred. Therefore, the correct answer is \"E: front window.\"\nSo the final answer would be E: front window\n\nInput:I've eaten a salad from one of what? Choices: A: The Happy Garden B: Pete's Place C: Gourmet Express D: Healthy House E: Food Store\nOutput: 1:\"The Happy Garden\" is a place that \"sells a variety of fresh, local vegetables and greens\", not salad specifically.\n2.\"Pete's Place\" could be anywhere to purchase food.\n3.\"Gourmet Express\" is a chain establishment rather than a place.\n4.\"Healthy House\" doesn't sell food but rents space for growing herbs.\n5. \"Food Store\" sells produce such as \"tomatoes, lettuce, or cucumbers\".\n6. By elimination, the answer must be \"B: Pete's place\".\nSo the final answer will be B: Pete'\n\nInput: It's very difficult to figure out where your best friend from childhood has gone to what?

{"text": "1.\"Can\" would imply that there are multiple ways that someone can keep a file.\n2. The question states where someone can \"KEEP\" the file, which suggests that the list of choices does not include the location of where the file is created.\n3. So, we can rule out \"suitcase\" and \"filing cabinet\" as those are how the file would be stored, not where.\n4. This takes us to the remaining three choices.\n5. \"Desktop\" refers to a computer screen which should be ruled out, as the question is about the location of storing the file, not its place on the computer.\n6. Same is the case with \"cloud\" as the question is not about where the file can be located on the cloud, but where it can be stored offline.\n7. So, \"Computer\" is the only choice that fits the question.\n8. So, the answer would be 'Computer'\n\nInput:  Which animal are you most likely to see in the woods? Choices:  a. A fox b. A deer c. A hawk d. A mouse  e. None of these animals live in the woods\nOutput: 1- Analyzing the question, we can eliminate the options which do not represent any animal: 'a: fox', 'c: hawk', and 'e: none of these animals live in woods'.\n2- This leaves us with the following options: 'b: deer' and 'd: mouse'\n3- Both the options are animals likely to be seen in the woods. 'b: deer': It could be argued that deer do not live in the woods, but rather on grassy fields or high trees. However, 'b: deer', as used here means deers living in woods and not in fields or high trees.\n\n4- This leaves us with 'd: mouse', which answers the question.\n\nSo the final answer, which should be deer", "answer": "C: computer"}
{"text": "1,The sentence implies examining and identifying differences within the categories of various objects.\n2. There are different kinds of categories; those given are books, chapters, on and examining different things.\n3. From the list, \"see a particular program\" does not directly relate to examining.\n4. \"See\" is a synonym for \"look at\".\n5. \"Go somewhere\" does not match with \"exploring a variety of things\" rather than examining one thing in detail.\n6. \"B: go somewhere\" does not match up with any of the topics (books, chapters, back).  \"Go somewhere\" does imply that the author's intention was to go out; however, the author made no mention of this intention, and it is difficult to determine how going somewhere relates to any objects.\n7. Therefore \"B: go somewhere\", is ruled out.\n8. \"Explore, look at, explore, different types of\", \"see or read a particular program\", these phrases are connected to chapters, books and on the back. We can conclude that option \"A: examine different things\" is most apt here.\nSo the final answers are: B:go somewhere & A:examine different things", "answer": "D: read book"}
{"text": "1.\"What building has a ot many glue bottles?\" could be an easy error in English spelling, but, the question is what building has a lot of glue bottles, so the error should be corrected to \"What building has a lot of GLUE bottles?\"\n2. To answer the question, the glue bottles obviously have to be somewhere.\n3. If they are in an office or a classroom etc, then they wouldn't be in 'a lot'.\n4. It follows that 'the building' must have the glue bottles.\n5. This, along with the building's characteristics (art room, police station, classroom, desk drawer etc), can eliminate each of the other alternatives.\n6. By process of elimination, the building must be 'the school'\nSo the final answer must be the School\n\nInput: It is good to take a break from what? Choices  A: school B: drinking C: studying D: reading E: homework\nOutput: 1:\"It is good to take a BREAK from school\".\n2. We can eliminate the first'school' as being in the sentence because the question is asking about school related activities.\n3. It also does not suit the meaning of 'take a break from....' because one is not 'taking' a 'break from' school.\n4. 'break' in the sentence is being used to mean pause, stop or withdraw from something, not school.\n5. 'From' a drink, for example, could possibly mean to stop drinking for a while.\n6. Similarly 'from' homework is possible.\n7. This allows 'C' and 'D' to remain as the other options, though the 'to' in'studying' is odd (it could be grammatically correct, but the word 'from' in the sentence would be better).\n8. From these two alternatives,'studying' fits the correct meaning best for the sentence, i.e. 'to stop studying'.\n9. So the answer would be 'C: studying'.\n\n\nInput: The store's stock was what? Choices 1. A: small B: thin C: full D: low E: empty\nOutput: 1.'A: small' does not suit the sentence; it implies a store that has small stock - not the opposite.", "answer": "E: school"}
{"text": "1 Jim didn't like the party because it seemed like the guys there only did what?\n\n2. Based on the sentence, we know that Jimmy didn't like going for the party.\n3. So, it's not that he disliked dancing, getting drunk, meeting new people, and having fun.\n4. From the given option, he has indicated that he did not like fun, which is the opposite of what he disliked at the party.\n5. So the choice option would be E: He didn't like fun.\n6.

Hence we can exclude B: heart attacks as, in the context of the question, this is neither great nor specific.\n4) This leaves C: relaxation and A: good health as the only options that could potentially be considered as benefits of exercise.\n5) But we can see that C: relaxation does not refer to general health. It refers to relaxation of a specific part of the body, which is not necessarily the same for everyone.\n6) So, the logical conclusion would be that A: good health refers to the benefits of exercise that are the most specific - general, over-arching health.\nSo the final answers is A: good health.\n\ninput:I would like to learn Japanese, but it's difficult to what?

Options 3 and 4 are synonyms for learn, but also for speak so are eliminated. \n3. Option, 5, is the main clause in this question. \n4.

{"text": "1. Question states where a bullet projectile would be found during a war, and requests the specific location.\n2. Analyzing the choices available, the word \"battlefield\" has military connotations, and would be a suitable place where a bullet could be found, but the question states that a war is in reference specifically to armed conflict, and not any other type of warfare\n3. As stated earlier, choice \"battlefield\" may be an appropriate \"war\" location, but in its most general sense, a \"battle\" refers to any conflict/confrontation, as with a family, so the word choice \"battlefield should be eliminated because of this\n4. \"Museum\" may be a suitable location, but in terms of context, this would be a suitable location to find a bullet projectile, once the war had ended, or between war-periods to commemorate the time of war\n5. Choice \"Weapon\" is too general to be appropriate for this question. It could apply to any weapon used in a war, regardless of if it's a bullet, or any other weapon used.\n6. \"Canon\", as a musical reference, does not seem to be an appropriate term, and choice \"Tornado\" would have no relevance in the context of war, as it would be in a different scenario (unless a war is fought over which is more powerful, tornado, or cannon)\n7. So, the answer choice is \"D: canon\", due to the fact that a canon is a piece of equipment that is often referred to as a gun or a cannon, which is used as weapon in a war- specifically during war.

You don't want to start listing out options as it would appear to be a mistake in your question!\n1. As shown below, since the number of options are 7 there must be some time limit in the given options.\n2. \"Less than 5 minutes\". 5 minutes appears twice in both the 5 minutes section and the greater than 5 minutes section. \"Greater than an hour\" too shows 1 hour.\n3. This means that no bike rental is rentable for less than 5 minutes. So, you can immediately exclude \" Less than an hour\".\n4. Also, since it's not given which type of bike we're riding, there's possibility its a cruiser bike...or perhaps, a bmx bike...or maybe even, a mountain bike.\n5. Since there is no information available, you cannot discard any time limit.\n6. Now, lets consider \"Greater than 5 minutes\". If the limitation is greater than 5 minutes, there are 4 time periods.

This question asks what might occur in terms of stress, tension and winning/losing. However, arguments and debates are not associated with winning/ losing or being tense. Thus, options A: stress B: winning/losing and C: tension should be eliminated.\n\n3. Similarly, arguments in competition are not necessarily based on winning or losing, and thus argument is eliminated.\n\n4. Similarly, debate is excluded, since they usually focuses on logical reasoning or discussions rather than emotion.\n\n5. The remaining options are argument, debate and stress, which can be narrowed down to two arguments: A) argument and B) stress.\n\n6. Arguments are a form of discussion, and stress is something which can occur during such discussion. Thus option A can be eliminated from the pool of possible answers.\n\n7.

This because excessive hand washing could cause irritation. Although this is an outcome, it is not the direct outcome of obsessive hand washing.\n3. \"Use of soap\" may be caused by \"excessive hand washing\" but it may not the best answer suited to our question as, although it will be caused by washing hands, it isn't the main concern of our story.\n4. \"Cleanliness\" means that somebody washes their hands to attain cleanliness. We can argue that excessive hand washing will attain cleanliness, but the question doesn't ask for the cause of someone becoming clean, which is achieved with cleaning, the action in itself.\n5. \"Thinking\" as a cause of excessive hand washings is not suitable as the word \"thinking\" suggests the outcome of washing.\n6. \"Wet Towel\" is not suitable as the main cause of washing hands. This is because the intention with washing hands is to rid them of dirt, so the resulting outcome (hands washed clean) is caused by \"excess hand washing,\" as this is our requirement.\n7. Hence, the question must be answered by \"E: wet towel\" because, if we were to conclude that the main cause of excessive hand-washing is the wet towel, we can say \"the wet towel made the man obsessive\" since his hand-washing behaviour is based on the wet towel on his hands.\nSo the final one is E: wet towel", "answer": "B: irritation"}

Heretical seems to more commonly refer used to describe views that contradict traditional religious beliefs, so these two choices are mutually exclusive.\nSo the final answers must be D: conservadox and E: heretical", "answer": "B: heretical"}

This is also not an appropriate answer for two reasons- firstly, our fiddling wouldn\u2019t necessarily be due to dexterity but rather from ignorance.\n6) More importantly, we are given the scenario of playing without knowledge of music and \u201cdexterity\u201d cannot explain why we are doing so.\n7) Conclusion: The final answer is \u201cC- idle time\u201d as this is an explanation of why we are fiddling. \nSo the final answer must be C: idle time\n\nInput: He was a kind and generous person who enjoyed being what? Choices: A: appreciated B: useful C: liked D: praised E: thankful\nOutput: 1.) The question is asking us what adjectives best describe the person.\n2.) The word \"kind\" comes first, followed by \"generous\".\n3.) The question tells us that the person is \"kind and generous\", which makes it inaccurate to say \"They enjoyed being generous\" or \"They enjoyed being kind\".\n4.) To be kind is to be gentle or compassionate, whereas to be generous is to give, and is often done with compassion.\n5.) To be generous is to be willing to share, not necessarily to be the source of the kindness shown.\n6.) From this, we can eliminate the choice of \"B- useful\" as being helpful is not necessarily a form of kindness, although it could be a by-product of generosity.\n7.) We then have the remaining possibilities of \"A- appreciated\", \"D- praised\", and \"E- thankful\".\n8.) Of these, \"A- appreciated\" and \"D- pra", "answer": "D: knowledge of music"}

{"text": "1-2. The question asks what someone would want to be if they were thick.\n3-4. From the given options, we can exclude \u2018Sparse\u2019 since it implies the person does not have much weight and \u2018Thin\u2019 because it actually means the opposite of thick.\n5-6. Thus, we narrow down the options to \u2018Slender\u2019, \u2018Free Flowing\u2019 and \u2018Diets\u2019.\n7. 7. However, the options mentioned thus far relate to the person himself whereas the question asks about a person that is thick.\n8. Also, \u2018Thick\u2019 in English refers to the opposite of slender.\n9. Thus, the answer has to be either \u2018FreeFlowing\u2019 or \u2018Diets\u2019, referring to the person that is thick\u2019s possible choice of food.\n10. 10. Out of these, only \u2018Free Flowing\u2019 means the person who is thick is wanting to be free flowing which in common English refers to being slender because it is often used to explain someone who doesn\u2019t get diabetes.\nSo the final answers is Free Flowing\n\nInput: The young girl was very beautiful and she appeared calm, but I could tell she was nervous.

{"text": "1.\"Jigsaw puzzles are made out of many pieces,\" it is not one piece.\n2. A \"chess game\" is two pieces being played against each other.\n3. Similar to chess, \"puzzle boxes\" or \"puzzles\" require a container to store away pieces in.\n4. Although the answer is given as \"A piece,\" This answer has already been used and is rejected.\n5. \"A piece\" by definition, is an individual part that is not the whole. This again would not match the requirement of the question in which it is asked of an item that is made out of only 1 piece.\n6. Therefore the answer can be narrowed down to C: \"Plex,\" although this matches the grammatical requirements of the question, it is rejected as the answer since plex refers specifically, to a certain type of puzzle, and the question did not mention any such requirements.\n7. The only other possible option that meets these stated criteria is E: \"puxxle,\" which is defined as a particular puzzle, so the answer must be rejected by exclusion.\nSo the final option is B: \"Chess game\"", "answer": "C: puzzle box"}

A scary person is almost never happy, so this is the wrong option.\n4) Option \"C: Dangerous\" might be a possibility but this is just describing scary people's nature i.e. \"dangerous\". It doesn't specify how people actually perceive them, so this is incorrect.\n5)Option \"E: Weird\" would mean strange, peculiar, unnatural, or illogical. This is an interesting answer, but it is implying that people perceive scary people in the literal sense i.e. not really weird or unusual.

Choices: A: give you time off B: tell you to take vacation C: give you pay increase D: pay you extra E: leave you alone\nOutput:\n1. The context of the sentence states \"this was my first job\". Thus it is quite clear that, in this scenario, the role \"they\" is playing is that of the employer.\n2. Question asks 'they what?', suggesting some sort of response to taking days off for vacation.\n3. The other options are irrelevant to the question in this context.\n4. It is reasonable to suggest that the employer would give the employee \"pay increase\" as the employer is paying them a salary.\n5. Likewise, the term 'give you pay increase' contradicts the previous options. As they are irrelevant to the question as a whole.\n\n6. Therefore 'D: pay you extra' must be the correct answer as its unlikely that in such a scenario the employer will want to do anything else other than 'give you pay', as this is the most obvious thing to do to someone who wants to be away from work.\n7. It is also interesting to note that the employees expectations here are unreasonably high. An employer does not usually give an employee 'Extra Pay' solely for taking a vacation.\n\nSo thefinal answer is D: pay you extra\n\nInput: They're going for their first date, and he thinks maybe they shouldn't do what?

All of the remaining choices (except for \"engage\") are plausible possibilities under different circumstances, however, in the scenario outlined by the sentence (a fight between two people, \"to the enemy\" mentioned in the question), the only answer that is correct is \"D: Smile\" because \"Smile\" is a term that describes the way one feels or appears when confronted with a problem.\n5. It is the only option that implies that the person is neither angry nor furious.\n6. The other choice implies that the person engaged, retained, or was arrogant.\n7.

We can eliminate choices \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", and \"E\" because they are irrelevant in the question.\n4. \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\" are specific types of landscape with no special characteristics mentioned about its foxes.\n5. Foxes do not need a forest to survive well but they do need a lot of space to hunt and so it would be best to assume that the foxes hunting would take place in \"C\" because it is the \"great outdoors\" and it gives them the maximum space to hunt.\n6.

This includes not affording a maid to assist with household chores. Thus, this isn\u2019t a problem of the child\u2019s mother. Neither is \u201cToo busy\u201d to be a problem. Ruling that out leaves us with the option of \u201cToo tired.\u201d  However, this can either be physically or mentally\n3. Excluding physically tired, there is still the matter of mentally tired, or depressed. We can reject this as a potential answer, due to the nature of the question. The mother needs to address this properly. She should not allow the child to grow up with no one to help him/her through this difficult period. Thus is not an appropriate answer.\n4. \u201cToo rude\u201d is also a good candidate and is rejected when we see that the", "answer": "E: procrastination"}
{"text": "1) The question asks \"What is a lover's likely outcome from making love?\" \n2) Considering the following factors:\n3) A) Making love would likely result in falling in love, therefore it is a likely outcome.\n4) B) Liking the person, rather than loving them, is a motive behind making love. Making love is one of several outcomes that could result from this. Therefore it is an irrelevant option.\n5) C) Making love would NOT result in building a family together. Therefore it is incorrect.\n6) D) Making love is NOT an outcome of making love. Therefore it doesn't fit right and it is incorrect.\n7) E) Distancing yourself when you make love. Distancing after making love, however, is most likely to happen because people's desires change and they develop feelings. People may also distancing themselves the whole time. But it isn't the most common or the most likely outcome. Therefore it is an incorrect option.\n8) Therefore, as the most common result from lovemaking is to fall in love, it is the correct answer to the question.\nSo the final choice is A: build family together as an option.\n\n### Input:What was it that caused the crash landing of the passenger plane in the Himalayas? Choices: 1. A: fog 2. B: hailstone 3. C: high-speed wind 4. D: ice 5. E: light snow Answer Output: 1. The sentence says that the crash was in the Himalayan mountains, which means it was a high-altitude crash. \n2. Fog and hailstones would cause no damage because they are not solid, frozen substances.\n3. High-speed wind is an unlikely possibility.\n4. Ice is one of the most likely possibilities. The pilot's experience will inform his decision to land in this condition.\n5. Light snow is not sufficient to cause a significant problem like this, but it is not impossible.\n6. Thus, light snow is likely to be the cause.\nSo the final answers is D: light snow\n### Input:The woman's family will help her cope with her feelings of grief and what? Choices: B. loss C. joy D. frustration E. sorrow\nOutput:", "answer": "C: make love"}
{"text": "1.\"A person looking for new things\" refers to someone who is seeking opportunities for growth or new experiences.\n2. The question asks what the individual would do after finding these new things.\n3. Of the choices given, only two options, \"become depressed\" and \"thank god\", are irrelevant to the question.\n4. Option \"D\", experiences, also does not fit the scenario as it does not specifically describe an action.\n5. Option B, \"welcome change\", seems the most appropriate- as it implies receiving something else or an alternative version, and it is the only option that can be directly linked to a person.\n6. So the answer must be \"B - welcome change\"\nSo the final answeris B:  welcome change\n\nInput: It's hard to understand that most important things in life are simple. Choices:  A\" easy to use B: simple C: difficult D: advanced E: complex\nOutput: 1:The sentence, \"It's hard to understand...\" indicates a difficulty in recognizing or acknowledging the importance of simple things in life.\n2. The sentence further claims that these things are often overlooked in favor of more advanced or complicated matters.\n3. This suggests that the complex things in life are often viewed as more important than the simple ones.\n4. Hence, the options \"advanced\" and \"complex\" should be chosen, as these choices signify the complicated things in life, which are often held in higher regard.\n5.\"it's hard to understand\" also suggests some level of confusion, so the words, \"difficult,\" \"advanced\" and most likely, \"complex,\" are more appropriate.\n6. \"hard to understand means that things are \"tricky\", \"complex\" is even worse. However, \"Easy to use\" is not the correct answer for this prompt as this has to do with simplicity, not difficulty.\n7. Therefore the answer must be \"ADVANCED\" and \"COMPLEX\"\nSo the final conclusion is C: advanced D: complex\n\nInput: In the past, it was acceptable to assume women would take a less prominent role in the society.

{"text": "1 The question states that \"A long day of traveling\" has an important phrase attached, 'after a day of...'.\n2. Answers A and D are ruled out since \"sickness\" and \"jet lag\" don't pertain to \"a day of...\" but two days.\n3. Answers C and E are also ruled out since \"motion sickness\" and \"relocation\" doesn't pertain to a day, but motion sickness and relocation is a result of traveling the next day.\n4. Remaining answers B and D suggest motion sickness, which is a short-term effect that occurs quickly after travel.\n5. This leaves B and D as the only answers.\n6. The word \"after\" directly precedes \"traveling \", making B, motion sickness, and D, jet lag, as the correct answers.\nSo the final answers is A: Motion Sickness and D: Jet Lag\n\nInput: What should you do if you have a lot to get done and not much time? Choices:  What should you do if A: B: C: D: E: 1. take a day off 2. write out a checklist 3. take deep breaths 4. use your willpower 5. use your phone or computer 6. stay positive\nOutput: 1 One should take a day off even if they still have a lot to get do because work burnout is common, it happens as soon as the body realizes that there isn't enough time to accomplish every task.\n2. Write out a checklist to stay on task even if you have a lot of work to do and have less time.\n3. take deep breathes to let go of the pressure of all the things you need to get done.\n4. Use your willpower to get everything done, even if there isn\u2019t a lot of time.\n5. Use your phone or computer for your work even if you have to cut out on some of your favorite activities to do a lot of things.\n6. Stay positive to motivate yourself and to get inspired to finish off all the tasks at hand.\nSo the final list is A: Take A day off B: Write A Checklist C: Use your Willpower D: Use a Phone or Computers E: Stay Positive\n\nInput: If you are working on A", "answer": "E: fatigue"}
{"text": "1: The question, asks for the likely place to view an 'old copy machine. As the question mentions 'view', it is asking about finding, rather than acquiring.\n2. The sentence gives us clues to help determine the possible locations: \"Old\" - the machine may be vintage or antique, \"Copy machine\" - the location must be related to the type of machine.\n3. \"school\" and \"museum\" exclude themselves as they are unlikely to have an antique copy machine.\n4. \"Barn\" is also unlikely as it's hard to assume they would have an antique device, even an office would probably not have an early copy machine.\n5. \"Industrial area\" could be relevant as it may refer to a scrap yard.\n6. Finally the question states that the place chosen must be 'likely' - so our possible answer can not be anywhere other than 'Industrial Area'.\nSo the final answer the answer is: C: industrial area.\n\nInput:In the end, she was happy with the way it all turned out and I what? Choices: A: thanked B: blamed C: congratulated D: credited E: reprimanded\nOutput: 1)The question poses the dilemma of what verb the speaker will use to describe the resolution of the situation. \n2)She is blaming her boss for something that was not his fault, so in order to describe the situation, she cannot use \"thanked\", \"blamed\" or \"reprimanded\".\n3)However, she did not \"congratulate\" him, as this was not the situation she was unhappy with (regarding her promotion).\n4)The verb in the question is \"credit\", so she must have \"credited\" her boss. \nSo the final answer: C: credit.\n\nInput:He took my advice as I said what? Choices:A: nothing B: something C: everything D: nothing E: everything\nOutput: 1.)The question asks about what the speaker may have said to his friend. \n2.)The speaker's friend has already taken the speaker's advice, this has made the speaker upset at his friend, thus he is unlikely to have said \"nothing\"(as this does not upset him).\n3.)He is", "answer": "B: museum"}
{"text": "1.'What would you put furnitures on top of', refers to a common task of placing furniture in a room.\n2. Furniture and items that we use to furnish a room are placed on the floor and the roof is typically considered unnecessary and is usually covered with a ceiling to keep water out.\n3. Furniture is also rarely placed on the roof, which would cause it damage in a rainstorm, making it impossible to put furniture on the roof.\n4. Therefore, options A and C are unnecessary.\n5. Option D: An apartment is an apartment, so it doesn't refer to 'the room' the furniture is put in.\n6. Option E represents a specific item that can be used to hold furniture that we may place in a room. The key here is that we may put the furniture somewhere inside our homes.\n7. There are no exceptions to this. So the answer is:  E: Neighbor's House\nSo the final answer  is E: next door\n\nInput: It's a bad idea to think you're good enough to play on the team, since all it takes to make  the team is to what? Choices A: try hard B: play hard C: practice hard D: train often E: practice frequently F: work out consistently\nOutput: 1.The question is asking which words are used in the same phrases as 'all it takes to make the team '\n2. 'to try hard' is mentioned twice, 'to play hard' and 'to practice hard' are mentioned once each, and 'working out consistently' is mentioned twice.\n3. Therefore, none of the other words mentioned in any of the sentences that could replace all it takes to make the teams are true, since the sentences do not mean 'all it takes'.\n4. This eliminates options A, B, C, D and F, since they all refer to 'trying hard'.\n5. The answer now being 'B: Play hard', 'Practice hard' and 'Work out frequently'\nDo not mean 'working hard'\n6. So the overall, final answer is B: play hard\n\nInput: She is very fond of her children, but she never makes a fuss over them, always keeping the what?

{"text": "1.) The question refers to \"waiting for your transportation on (train) rails to arrive\", but doesn't specify which word to exclude. From this, it is clear that option B has been intentionally left out. It is a common phrase to say \"waiting for (something) on rails to arrive\", but it is not common to include the words \"bookstore\", therefore A and C are out as their optionals are not words to leave out. D is likewise out, as optionals are not words, and it is more likely the answer will be a singular word.\n2.) The remaining options all include transport. From the usage of the phrase \"transportation on rails to arrive\" it is reasonable to include transportation and by inference exclude transport. Additionally, \"You can read a magazine\", implies that reading is an option, and it is not an option to read a magazine at a bookstore, unless perhaps \"at\" is being used in the same way as optionals, which this question seems to rule out. Therefore B and D are out.\n3.) Left are \"newsstand\" and \"waiting room\" (A and E).\n4.) Newsstand is a singular word and by inference cannot be the answer.\n5.) The remaining option E (waiting room) is an odd choice of answer. It wouldn't be so unlikely to be reading a magazine in the waiting room (unless, again, this means it is not an option at the newsstand).\n6.) As E has excluded too many of the words used, the only logically suitable answer is A, which stands to be the correct answer\nSo the final answer has to be A: train station\n\nInput: The number of words which can be formed in English from the letters of the word \"bicycle\" is what? Choices: -1 A: five B: nine C: three thousand D: four E: infinite\nOutput: 1) The question asks us to \"identify the number of words which can [be] formed in English from the characters of the word `bicycle.'\" As stated, the question is asking how many words are there.\n2) The answer must be four: Bi (bicycle); cy (cycle); cil (clever); cle (clear).\n3) The exclusionary approach would mean removing the optionals (C: three thousand and E: infinite) from consideration. This leaves", "answer": "A: train station"}
{"text": "1.\"the police wanted to help traffic, after some accident, which caused a jam.\"\n2. \"Hurrying\" or \"Directing\" is not likely to cause a traffic jam.\n3. \"helping\" may make it better.\n4. \"Forcing open a door\" to cause a traffic jam is absurd and would not be done by police.\n5. \"Cornering\" a thief will not cause a traffic jam. What may cause a traffic jam is \"cornering\" a thieves car in a traffic jam when the police try to get control of the traffic. \n6. Also, a thief would not be stopped by police in traffic. \n7. So that means that the answer to the question must be \"C: help\".", "answer": "A: hurry along"}
{"text": "1: The question asks where to find performers on a particular platform in public places.\n2. The options available are: Arena. Building. dock, Concert hall, and Museum.\n3. Arena: a public venue, especially one with a covered seating area and a stage, for public recreation, entertainment, or exhibitions.\n4. Building: a permanent or stationary work/structure that remains in one spot after it has been constructed.\n5. Dock: a natural or manmade strip of land projecting into water where ships and vessels can tie up.\n6. Concert hall: a large hall or auditorium used for orchestral or choral concerts.\n7. Museum: a place of deposit/accumulation for curiosities and objects of interest or artistic, historical, or scientific value.\n8. The answer must be 'Building' since performers do not appear on stage nor exhibits in a museum nor can they operate to or from water on a dock.\n9. Moreover, arena suggests that the performers take to the staged-like area, while the building suggests that the performers appear inside the structure.\n10. The building is the correct choice since it's a permanent or stationary structure from which performers can appear.\nSo the final answers is B: Building\n\nInput:Which of these is often used to start or end conversations at social gatherings? Choices: 1. Hi-how are you? 2. Hello- how are you? 3. Hi-hello- how are you?\nOutput: 1,2, and 3 are grammatically incorrect in terms of the usage of 'how'. It should read 'How' with no comma/semicolon.\nSo the final word is Hi-hello- how.\n\nInput:What\u2019s the only way to get to know everyone and find your people? (1. Get to know people. 2.

The correct version is B: kentucky, kentucky derby refers to a race (e.g. B: a horse race) which contains B: kentucky as one of it's constituent parts.\n5.

Its not possible to describe or be associated with an abstract word.\n8. All of the above explanations have one fundamental problem. They all try to define \"Courage\" as a characteristic.\n9. The word \"Characteristic\" is the key clue. The sentence implies that \"Courage\" is a characteristic.\n10. If that is the case, then we need to go by the definition.\n11. The definition of a characteristic is:\n\"A quality peculiar to an individual; something that is peculiar to, or distinctive of, an individual; a quality, trait, quality, or characteristic\"\n12.

The judge has spoken, the evens was solid and the accused was found not guilty. This means the accused did not commit the murder he was accused of.\n2.) \"Knew he did this murder\", the question has stated that the accused did not commit this murder.  This makes the above sentence incorrect as it is the accused who has spoken not the judge.\n3.) \" Be acquitted\" the accused is acquitted and \"not found guilty\" this states two different aspects here. One is acquitted and other is found not guilty. \n4.) \"Knew he didn't do it\" means that the accused knew he would not be convicted of murder so he did not commit the murder. \n5.) \"Go to the police\" or \"being acquitted\" would not make a sense as he would not be found not guilty.\n6.)

{"text": "1) The question asks how a man spending 3 hours on his grooming in the mornings might affect his job.\n2) The choices represent reasons for his taking 3 hours every morning, for example: - Tardiness would be a detriment to his job, meaning if he was consistently late.\n- Looking Good would benefit his appearance and could improve his career in some circumstances.\n-Injury could be caused by his spending so much time on his appearance.\n-Neatness is an unlikely answer as although he may wish to be clean, this would not significantly benefit his job. \n5) As a result of these options and the scenario described, - D: Vacation stands out as a likely possibility, as the question asks specifically about changes at his job and time that he must spend on himself every morning. \n6) \"Take 3 hours every morning\" - as a rule, people will not use this amount of time grooming over the course of a week if they aren't paid off (given to them as leave).  This is most likely to be a regular occurrence, meaning vacation would be likely to be the result.\n\nSo the final answer should be:  D: Vacation\n\nInput:If he gave the woman a ticket home, I know what she'd have done: she would have been on where next.

The choices represent likely routes of transportation in most situations.\n3.) However, the last two options are unlikely in this scenario, as there are no boats or bikes present. 4.) We can eliminate these two choices from the getgo.\n5.) We can then disregard D: bike, and E: car, as it's unlikely that, in her current condition, she'd go anywhere but to her home when travelling.\n6.) \"Train\" can also be eliminated. It doesn't sound likely that the man would give her this form of transportation from someone she barely knows.\n7.) \"Bus\" is the best option for someone to choose who is giving someone a free ticket home. There is no reference to the cost.", "answer": "A: tardiness"}

We also can eliminate D: become tired as the same reasoning applies, as this is not a cause rather it is a result.\n4.

The police should not have been so lucky  D. they found weapons in the apartment  E. the police arrested him instantly\nOutput: 1..After reading the first part of the sentence, we can understand that the sentence indicates that the police found all kinds of weapon in the apartment of one gunman including guns and sword. These are different types of weapons.\n2. The question is asking us to pick an option from A to E which shows that we could answer according to the last part of the sentence. Since the gunman is not armed, it is very unlikely that he would keep all these weapons in the apartment.\n3. We know that the only possible reason why the gunman would keep all these weapons would be because that is the person who does those kind of things.\n4. If someone keeps an army in his apartment, then how could they be able to pass the police in the first place?\n5. Therefore, the apartment cannot be empty for somebody who keeps the army of weapons, so he has to be armed and since he is armed, his apartment cannot be empty.

Why would he keep all", "answer": "E: evil"}
{"text": "The question asks us to locate the structure that was constructed by the donation of a large sum of money.\n1.

'The bank' does not seem to fit as it is not a physical building structure.\n3. 'The big town' and 'the Big City' are not the correct answers as the use of the terms 'Big' appears to refer to the size of the town and not the size of its structure.\n4. 'The building' seems to be a more likely answer, as it fits both in terms of being a physical structure and the use of the word 'big'. Moreover, the options are not mutually exclusive as both 'The Big Town' and 'The Big City' could have 'the building' be a part of the town or city infrastructure.\n5. So, the answer must be 'the Building'.\nSo the final answer for this question is C: Building\n\nInput:The company was formed in 1870 and it's been run by his father, but how do they continue that?

But a big ship can unload its cargo in any port.\n4. A cargo ship could be a shipping container. But then refrigerated containers have a different role. Lorry is also a suitable answer.\n5.

Because of this, we must look for a word that is useful for more than just sounding fancy.\n2) The word \"D\" would be considered \"useful\" in that it is \"Connected with other foreign languages\". The word that the sentence is asking us about, however, is \"useful\", which refers to the ability to accomplish a specific purpose.\n3) Although a lot of the examples in this question are Latin words or based off of these terms, they still work for specific purposes (such as \"E\", \"formal\"), which means that they are useful.\n4) The correct answer is \"D\" because something can be useful without being Latin or easily understood.\n5) The question asks you to identify the meaning of the adjective: useful.\n\n## 2-17\n\nInput: This is because it makes the house uncomfortable for what?

Choices: A: overthinking B: tension C: stress D: exhaustion E: dehydration\nOutput: 1)\"If one has a headache,\" refers to the fact that all people experience headaches, it is not referring to a specific person.\n2\"It is caused by what?\" suggests the main reason for the headache, i.e. what makes them suffer from a headache. \n3. The options provided are:\n3.2)tension\n3.3)stress\n3.4)exhaustion\n3.5)dehydration\n4. Firstly, \"tension\" is not a cause of a headache. It is more similar to a personality traits of a person, which may cause a headache, but not the main cause.\n5. Next, \"stress\" is not a single cause either. It is the result of a chain of causes, so can not fit the question either.\n6. We can similarly eliminate \"exhaustion\" from the options because it also requires a chain of causes which results in the person being exhausted, so it too does not meet the criteria.\n7. Therefore the answer must have something to do with causes leading up to a headache, which requires that the person \"has a headache\".\n8. This leaves us with the option of \"dehydration\", or lack of water. Dehydration is the cause of a headache because it impedes the normal flow of blood and oxygen and results in the person experiencing a headache. Therefore, dehydration can be the reason for a headache. 65656", "answer": "C: need food"}

Choices: A: late and often B: early and unexpected C: sudden and not expected D: too late and rarely caught E: sudden and expected\nOutput: 12. To understand this we need to pay attention to the use of the term \"surprise\" in the question. It suggests that we focus on whether the disease appears to take someone unawares, rather than the point of time when it appears.\n2.Cancer doesn't take people by surprise by itself- there is some sort of reason it takes most people by surprise.\n3. Therefore, any answer which states that cancer is caught too late could be correct.\n\n4.If we look at the remaining choices closely, it gives us the impression that cancers which are expected are more likely to happen.\n5.This is due to the description of a cancer as common or \"rare\". \n6.So we could conclude that choice A: \"late and not unexpected\" would describe a common or \"rare\" cancer.\n\n7.Choices B,D and E describe unexpected cancers which often seem to take people by surprise, but there is no guarantee of this.\n8.The only other possible possibility which could describe a commonly occurring cancer is choice C: \"sudden and expected\"- as this would describe the oncoming of common or rare cancers.\n\n9.So, the most precise answer must be C: \"Sudden and expected\" as all other possibilities seem unlikely.\n\nSo the answer is C:", "answer": "B: movies"}

He borrowed money with no intention of returning it. 2) The vow refers to a formal voluntary agreement as in a pledge. \"Broke a Vow\" implies that the man did break a pledge and returned, which can't be the answer because it suggests that he has broken a promise. 3) He stolen money, which can't answer because there is something else besides taking money and returning it, which is the answer to the question.\n4) He broke a pledge, which doesn't answer question. 5) Broke a vow, which doesn't answear the question because it is a statement of returning the money.\n6) Didn' be taken a pledge, which is the answar to the question because it only says it.\n 7) No promises, which does not answer question because it is a negation for taking a pledge.\nSo the correct answer is \"D. Returned\" because he had returned the money, rather than stolen it.\n\n## Part II: Multiple Questions\n\nInput: Aunt Jody was in", "answer": "E: mexico"}

Answer choices are not given as part of the question, we need to infer them from the information expressed in the paragraph.\n3. In the given paragraph, the author explicitly indicates that the consequence of taking a shower after going on a run is \"leg cramps\", as this consequence is related to the specific activity of going on a run (exertion).\n4. This implies that the other choices, D, E, F are incorrect, and that the correct answer is \"B: becoming tired\".\nSo the final answer will be B: Becoming tired\n\nInput: Why does a bicycle need to be pushed uphill? Why does a rocket to fly to the top?

{"text": "1. The question is essentially asking about equal opportunity for all potential candidates when applying for a job.\n2. The term 'background' refers to factors that are not related the job, such as: previous work experience, university degree, personality traits, etc.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude a candidate's background should not be a factor in the hiring decision for their application.\n4. The options that exclude this choice are \"critical thinking\" and \" equal opportunity\", as both involve intellectual reasoning or discerning factors about the candidate.\n5. Likewise, excluding the choice of 'compliments', as they refer to appreciation or praise rather than intellect or skills.\n6. Similarly, the option of 'raffle tickets' cannot be the answer because while they involve giving out lots of gifts, they are not relevant criteria for hiring for a job.\n7. As the question asked us which factor does not influence the hiring decision, we can deduce that the remaining options should be eliminated.\n8. Therefore, the answer is D: \"equal opportunity\" because it refers to fair treatment of candidates based on their skills and abilities, rather than any factors that are unrelated to the applicant's skills such as their previous work experience or university degree.\nSo the final  answer is D: equal opportunity\n\nInput: She was not a complete failure in the class; she actually managed to do well in what two subjects?

Therefore, she must be able to do well in something. 3. Reading and English are both literate subjects, but she needs to be able to do well to get a decent mark. 4. The answer can't be physics or engineering as these are not considered literate. 5. In conclusion, the answer must be D: Writing.\nSo the answer is D: Writing", "answer": "C: equal opportunity"}
{"text": "1.\"What happens after something happens\" means \"What happens after a grooming takes longer\"\n2. There are several steps to a grooming. It must start and end, and then you need a \"next appointment\". There must be a waiting area or room, so no injury. Same for beauty, except perhaps after a wound is healed. Late happens during an appointment, so it's not needed here. This leaves mistakes and annoyed.\n3. Mistakes can be before an injury because the injury would be prevented, but it would also include an injury. Beauty would be after an injury to heal, but it wouldn't have an injury. Late would be during the grooming appointment, so it'd be an error while grooming, not an injury. \n4. Annoyed after the grooming would mean the client got annoyed afterwards, which wouldn't be a mistake, but a complaint about it or the service; this wouldn't have happened to the next appointment.\n5. That leaves Mistakes are the answer.\nSo the Final answer is D: Mistakes\n\nInput: It is clear that having no power will result in what? Choices: A: no loss of authority or position B: no control over others C: more humility D: greater freedom\nOutput: 1.\u201cPower\u201d here is to be interpreted as having control over an individual or group. The other choices are all relevant when applied to \u201cpower\u201d in it\u2019s original sense: \u201cauthority\u201d, \u201cposition\u201d, or \u201ccontrolling others\u201d.\n2. We can eliminate options that are incompatible with the main interpretation here. \n3. \u2018Humility\u2019 requires a loss of power. \u2018Freedom\u2019 requires a power-free state.\n4. So A: No loss of authority or position or C: greater freedom are the only remaining relevant options.\n5. However, both of these options could mean having a power-free state, which means greater freedom - a fact that option C is not intended to cover.\n6. Therefore it must be A: no loss of power.\nSo the final Answer is A: no loss of Power", "answer": "C: late"}
{"text": "1) the question is asking where one would need a coat to be warm if the weather is cold.\n2) the following choices are eliminated; a bank(noon) is a location where there is no outside temperature, a coat is not required to be worn in it; a good book is not a place where a temperature can be measured, so a coat is not required for it to keep one warm; a bus stop is not a place where you may keep warm as it isn't meant to be an area to sit still; a post office wouldn't need a coat to be kept warm due to the temperature control being regulated to a certain comfortable level, so this isn't a relevant choice; a graph is for displaying data, which isn't related with one's temperature, so it is also eliminated.\n3) Therefore, the choice D: Bus Stop is the best fit as it is a place where a temperature is directly measured or can be controlled to a certain level, so if the weather is cold a coat is required.\nSo the final choice is answer is D: Bus Stop.\n\nInput: What is a small town if you have lived in Atlanta?

{"text": "1.\"where do you typically find...\" suggests an open question, requesting information about a location where the trash can is usually kept.\n2. The options given are places where a trash can might be found, e.g. in areas such as parks or motels.\n3. However, the main location for finding a trash can in a city would be streetsides, where one is most likely to find a motel or park, therefore eliminating A: park and B: motel.\n4. This leaves us with C: corner, which is the location of a trash can on the corner of a street, and D: bus stop.\n5. While there are some bus stops with trash cans close by, it is not likely that these particular trash cans are at the location where people typically throw away their trash.\n6. Furthermore, bus stops are usually not permanent structures like trash cans are, and are easily moved.\n7. Thus we can eliminate D: bus stop and E: store front.\n8. So the final answer is C: corner of every street, as it is where one might typically find a trash bin.\nSo the final answers is C: corner of street\n\nInput:Why did he spend the whole weekend watching films?

Options \"Read\" and \"Fly the Plane\" have no relation with Electronics, so we eliminate these options\n5. Option \"Passenger\" is when people sit next to each other or other seat of the plane, which is not using Electronics, so we need to remove this option\n6. Option \"Land the plane\" has no relation with Electronics and Electronics can be used in planes\n7. \"Buy tickets\" is also eliminated from the question\n8. so option (E) is correct and we need to choose the option (E) as answer.\nSo the final answers will be E: Buy Tickets\n\nInput: One of the basic concepts of modern physics is the what?

{"text": "1.\"Where is a good place?\" This implies \"a good place\" does exist and will have to be found.\n2. \"Symphony\" includes the whole orchestra (band) and is not limited to a single instrument. \"Symphony\" is therefore inappropriate for the question.\n3. Similarly, \"Music room\" can refer to a room of a house which contains musical instruments, which is again broader than what is required.\n4. \"Music store\" can refer to the actual shop which sells musical instruments, which is not what is required, or it can refer to the storage or room which is used for storing musical instruments, but this is unnecessary if the instrument is already purchased.\n5. \"Under bed\" is not specific as to where the instrument is to be placed, and the information provided does not provide a location to be suitable.\n6. Therefore by process of elimination the correct answer is \"C: music room\", as the instrument can be stored in a music store or placed under a bed. If the question asked \"under a bed\" this would be an acceptable answer.\nSo the final reponse is C: music room\n\nInput:What if the only thing that is unique to that species and it's environment and the only thing that changes from environment to environment of that species is the need of what? Choices: A: adaptation B: variation C: evolution D: interference E: reproduction\nOutput: 1: \"What if the only thing...\" indicates we are imagining a situation in which \"the only thing\" has to be identified as a necessary component.\n2. A need would change from environment to environment within the same species. So, we can eliminate the options: \"A: adaptation B: interference D: evolution\", which do not specify any change.\n3. The remaining options: \"C: variation\" and \"E: reproduction\" must thus be considered. \n4. However, as the question also refers to \"the only thing that changes is the need...\" this is also sufficient to eliminate these options, since they do not refer to only \"differences in need\" but can refer to any kind of difference.\n5. So ultimately the answer is \"C: variation\", as this is the only option which could be interpreted as referring to \"the only thing\" which changes as a result of environment.\nSo the final solution is C: variation\n\nInput:", "answer": "C: music room"}

We can eliminate options A and B as 'driving car' and 'road'.\n3.Option C- 'getting tired' is not necessarily applicable to the question, as it is a negative result of a vehicle driving instead of a task that entails driving.\n4. Option E - 'ticket' could be used to describe \"getting in trouble with the police for speeding or driving too slowly\", however this isn't necessarily linked to driving a car. In the context of this question's scenario, it may suggest that it can be added to some other options such as B and A, but it doesn't really express the actual process of moving cars, so it should be excluded.\n5. So the answer must be either B or A, which are both possible options based on the context of what entails moving cars.\nSo the final is B: road, C: getting tired\n\nInput: The teacher said that she should have given the students another example and explained it to them more carefully.

{"text": "1 The first sentence clearly states that \"homework assignments\" will be found in a binder which is in an \"office\"- but the word \"in\" is not defined after \"office supply store\" which suggests that it may refer to a physical location.\n2. The other four options are specific locations where a binder could be found but the \"office supply store\" option allows for a more general location.\n3. The last sentence states that the binder would be located in the office, providing further evidence that the location could vary.\n4. The sentence suggests that the binder would likely always be found with homework assignments which would never be found in a bookcase or a classroom.\n5. Hence it's valid for all the five locations, although \"in classroom\" suggests it should probably be there because it is an instruction from a teacher, the first option \"in the office\" is more likely as it can refer to any location in an office, and is not specified by the question.\n6. Therefore \"in office\" is the correct answer.\nSo the final answers is  A: Binder is in an office.\n\n\nInput: There weren't enough players to field a game, so instead the teams played an what?

{"text": "1) The answer is given in 2 parts. This question requires you to analyze carefully the wording of the sentence and the specific details about the person described.\n2) Question is asking us to identify the blinking lights that 'you are usually looking at'. The details we are given are: 'you see blinking lights..' and the person is male.\n3) The question is asking \"what are you usually looking at?\" indicating that you should determine which occurrence the blinking lights are most frequent with, and which are less frequent.\n4) However, based on this we have to know some more particulars about the situation. 'You are usually looking up' could indicate any variety of situations- an airplane, a music concert, or the night sky.\n5) The given detail is the statement \"you are looking at a male\" which limits the type of scenario to one that a male would be usually looking at.\n6) Thus, 'planes, concerts, etc.' are possible but they are more abstract, whereas the 'night sky' is more detailed. You have to analyze the question as 'blinking lights at night', thus eliminating all the other possibilities. \n7) Hence the answer should be either 'night sky' or 'concert'. The difference between the two lies in whether or not 'turned at night' is a possibility. The details of the question indicates that it is, because 'lights' are blinking 'upwards'. Thus, it can be interpreted as an event where people sit down and look up to 'watch something'. In such a scenario, lights are turned on, but are not blinking or flashing.\n8) Moreover, the 'lights' in this scenario are the ones coming from the source itself. For eg, if someone is sitting under a concert stage that is lit up, it is a distinct possibility that people would be looking at the stage, not at the upwards blinking lights.\n9) 'You are looking at a male' indicates that you are not looking at other aspects of the scene, but the 'blinking lights at your level or higher', so a male could be sitting down in this scenario, looking towards his height or more upwards with the view.\n10) Consequently, 'concert' best answers the question as, in the scenario of a concert, the lights could be blinking upwards towards the concert stage.\nSo the finalanswer is", "answer": "B: plane"}

After this statement, the sentence says \"That meant that the only time she could have left was...\" suggesting that at one time or another, Sarah must have left her house.\n3. This implies, that it is impossible for Sarah to be home the whole time unless she leaves, which she presumably would not do.\n4. Thus the question asks us to identify the only time \"to leave\" could have been, in order to clarify where she eventually went.\n5. \"Daytime\", \"Night\", \"Early morning\", \"Afternoon\" are all incorrect options as they only refer to times, not days of the week. That leaves us with \"Daytime\" as the only true option.\n6. Hence, the answer must be \"D: afternoon\", as that is the only time \"To leave\" could have been.\nSo the final answers is D: afternoon\n\nInput: Mary could not leave for the party until her parents could trust William.  If no one trusted William, then what conclusion could be drawn about Mary's parents? Choices:  their trust cannot be earned A: they still trust him B: they don't trust him C: they would trust him D: they cannot trust him E: nobody trusts him\nOutput: 1: The question states that Mary cannot leave for the party unless someone trusts William. From here, we must identify what happens when no one trusts William.\n2: If no one trusts William, then it follows that Mary's parents will not trust William and that she is now in an indefinite position, unable to leave for the party.\n3: Therefore, the correct options are A and D.\n4: Both options can be eliminated because 'cannot be earned' and 'cannot trust him' are inapt in this scenario.\n5: 'they still trust him' is incorrect because, if no one trusted William they would not have asked Mary to leave even though they might still trust him.\n6: Only 'nobody trust him' is suitable as no one trusts William if no one does trust him.\nSo the final conclusion is D: they cannot trust William.\nSo the", "answer": "A: early morning"}

So, The correct answer should be Option C: intellectual challenge. \nSo the final answer should be C: intellectual challenge\n\nInput: To get somewhere requires a lot of time and energy, but it is also rewarding to find the right answer.  So what do you lose when you fail?\nOutput: 1) What is interesting is that, to a very limited degree, the process also rewards the effort that one puts in.\n2) This is because if someone has dedicated themselves to learning something, they should, at least, feel that the process of learning is its own reward.\n3) As such, if someone is to take the time to get somewhere, they must also expect to feel the satisfaction of finding the answer to the question.\n4) It is only when both are sacrificed that a failure is truly a failure.\n5) Therefore, to fail is not simply to lack the final result, but to lose the process as well.  \nSo the final answer to this multiple choice question is that to fail is not simply a lack of something but also a loss of something.\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question in one or two sentences each and the total score will be your sum score.\n\nInput:A.

{"text": "1: This question is asking what might have to be delayed because there weren't enough seats, so we know that there isn't enough seating for everyone but people are still trying to fit inside.\n2. The sentences don't really tell us what kind of building it is, so we can rule out options A: building, C: meeting and D: office because they are all specific terms that could refer to multiple different things.\n3. We know from the previous sentence that this is a small building, however that isn't included in the answer options and not all of them are small so we need to eliminate'small' as well.\n4. If we look back at the question we'll notice the word \"delay\" is a hint, so we also need to eliminate the answer 'everything'.\n5. So we're down to the options \"bookstore\" and \"coffeehouse\", however they are both incorrect.\n6. The answer must refer to a building with enough seats for everyone, and since there is no place for everyone, all meetings could be delayed.\n7. Since there is not enough seating for the group, we can conclude that there would be enough seating for everyone if there were more seats, so the option \"building is incorrect.\n8. The question doesn't really tell us anything about whether this is a private establishment or a public building so \"bookstore\" and coffeehouse\" are also incorrect.\n9. The option B: bookstore makes even less sense because then it would have to be a public building with seating for everyone and books, which doesn't make any sense since the building isn't large enough to fit everyone plus books in it.\n10. The option E: coffeehouse is not correct because it doesn't make sense for this building to have enough seating for everyone when you can't fit in the building and there isn't enough chairs so all \"meetings could be delayed\" if this was the case.\n11. Option C: meeting makes sense because the question specifies the meeting didn't have to be delayed (we know this from the first sentence) and all meetings could be because it doesn't necessarily specify which meeting being referred to here.\n12. So, finally, the only answer that makes sense is A: buildlings, which will have to be delayed because \"the building had not enough ch", "answer": "C: meeting"}

D: he could not recognize the disease's symptoms. 5. E: His specialty was internal medicine.\nOutput: In the context of this question, option C is correct because although rare diseases do not imply being confused, here the doctor is confused, as the patient has an uncommon disease that he has never come across before and does not know the disease's origin and symptoms. As a result, option C is the correct choice. In summary, the answer is C: because patients who have the disease are rare\n\nInput: What is the meaning of \"these are just some of the consequences of an eating disorder\"?

The phrase 'In a community' appears to indicate the location of a school within a district or town, and therefore the answer is 'B: In a community'.\nSo the final answer must be B: In a community\n\nInput: She spent three years completing 100 hours of what? Choices: A: study B: homework C: coursework D: independent reading E: independent writing\nOutput: 1.) We can rule out all other options as the sentence only asks us to identify the number of 'hours' and not other units of measurement. \n2.) The sentence states that \"...she spent three years completing\" 100 hours, which can be re-written as \"she spent three years completiing x hours\", indicating that \"courses\" or \"work\" is being completed rather than just \"hours\"\n3.) We can further eliminate 'B: Study' because it refers to \"studying\" and does not indicate the amount of time spent studying nor the completion rate achieved during the time spent studying.\n4.) We can eliminate 'C: Coursework' as it is the same as coursework and also does not indicate the completion rate of hours.\n5.) This leaves us to interpret \"D: Independent reading\" as being referring to \"100 hours of Independent reading\"\n6.) We can also eliminate 'D. Independent reading' because we know that a total of \"100hours\" is being completed, as stated in the question, yet the individual 'hours' have been completed over 3 years. \n7.) Finally, 'E: Independent writing' is the only option left and matches the rest of the criteria.\nSo the final ansver must", "answer": "C: every city"}

By analyzing the options, we cannot eliminate certain words that will apply to both the man and woman.\n3. The choices excluded are, \"A: Girl\" because it can apply to both the man or woman.\n4. \"C: Man\" because it can apply only to the man.\n5. \"E: Woman because it can apply to the one of the character.\nSo, the options are A: Girl B: Woman C: Man, D: Girl\n6.

We can thus eliminate 'unconcerned' as an option.\n4. The phrases'stressful' and 'harder' do not imply danger, but rather imply challenges. Therefore, these do not fit the context of the question.\n5. 'Deadly' and 'dangerous' are dangerous as these imply that someone may die.\n6.

However, option \"D: fall apart\" has a tense of \"discard\", which does not suit the overall meaning of the sentence.\n4) The remaining options are A: dissipate, B: flown, C: disintegrate and E: penultimate.\n5) It can be inferred that option \"A: dissipate\" stands for spreading of money as we know that it will be in use by the person who used the last of it for some time.\n6) The choice between option B: flown and C: disintegrate is ambiguous and cannot be made because there is no relation between a person using money and the money flying up ( option B) or flying away (option C) in the person's hand.\n7) \"Penultimate\" is the final option and is a noun to mean the position before the last.

In summary, the answer is B: Downtown, because downtown can refer to many things at once, as \"many different things can be found in downtown\". It is not a very specific place, whereas other places might be more limited in where things are located.\n5. Downtown is described as having things from a wide variety of sources, whereas less specific place descriptions usually mention which things or types of things are likely to be found.\n6.

Answers 'A: pudding', 'B: get news', 'C: strain' and 'E: though' lack logical application to a letter recieved from a friend overseas. 5.

The'mountain' being a metaphor for his ambition/professional endeavor, and not an actual physical mountain.\n2.

Which of the statements best describes the most important point of a learning disability?\n2. Analyzing each statement, only two appear to qualify as the main points for a learning disability - option 1 and 5.\n3. Option 4 talks about someone 'having trouble with mathematics'. This is something entirely separate to having a learning disability, and should be excluded.\n4. Option 3 talks about 'differences between...'. While this differs from option 5 in saying it's 'hard' rather than 'difficult' at the beginning (i.e. 6 versus 5), it is still related to vision and letter recognition, thus would be difficult for someone with a learning disability.\n5. Option 2 describes 'frustration', which would be an accompanying feeling for anyone with a learning disability, but is not the essence of the disorder itself and should be eliminated.\n6. Option 3 describes that being able to'see similar letters' is the important thing, but being able to see'similar letters' is the point of a learning disorder.\n7.

Option \"D: sitting ideal\" is irrelevant, as this does not indicate doing anything for money.\n4. Option \"C:everywhere\" does not indicate anything beneficial that people should do. \n5.

Option \"B: speaking to people\", meaning that the person is speaking with people, is not directly related to doing something for money meaningfully. Option \"E: care for people\" is a good candidate for a godly mission to do, but this does not refer to doing something for money, as it states that doing this is \"for money\", which is in contradiction with the idea to do not being paid.\n7. Also, the question states people generally will be expected to do these things, so we can conclude god is not wanting us to do these things anyway. \n8. Hence, the answer must be either A or E.\n9.

Option A (working in life), although not the best option (since some work not contribute meaning to human life) is still the most relevant choice to the theme of god's expectation of people. \n13.

If asked what one feels at some point during the opera, it would be appropriate.\n5. Thus, \"relaxation\" can be left behind.\n6. Also \"feeling sick\" may seem like an answer you can consider but it does not relate to an opera, so it is not an adequate answer either.\n7. So the answer must be D: The opera, because the opera is a complete experience that includes relaxation, you can be bored by that, and also you can sleep when watching the opera.\nSo the final choice is A: Opera", "answer": "D: relaxation"}
{"text": "1) The sentence is worded to suggest that the desk is located in a space that would usually not be used by young people.\n2. In the given context, it can be inferred that the desk is not often used, meaning that the choice of C is unlikely.\n3. This leaves A \"office building\", B \"schoolroom\", D \"bedroom\" and E \"gym\" as options.\n4. The desk in an office building would likely be used only occasionally by young people and even within a schoolroom or library, the desk is often used by adults.\n5. Therefore the most likely place for such a desk would be within a gym.\n6. Finally, this leads to the conclusion that the answer is \"B: schoolroom\". So the final answer is B: schoolroom\nSo the final answer becomes B: schoolroom\n\nInput: An old saying is that a leopard doesn't change its spots. This suggests that what? Choices: A: you can't teach an old dog new tricks B: the environment and other people affect behavior C: what is learned can be unlearned D: you are as your father was E: humans are genetically pre-determined\nOutput: 1.) The sentence clearly implies that old leopards retain their spots while living in different environments or among different people, suggesting that the spots are likely to be genetically determined.\n2. The other options don't provide this information, as humans aren't leopards (option B), the environment or other people aren't spots (option C), we cannot teach dogs new tricks (option D) or people inherited their nature from their parents (option E).\n3. Thus, the answer must be \"A: you can't change a leopard's spots.\"\nSo the final answer can also be A: you can's change a leopard spots", "answer": "B: schoolroom"}
{"text": "1.) The question basically states that people visit places in celebration. It then goes on to ask about a particular place they might go to celebrate. \n2.) The statements above indicate that people attend carnivals as a way of celebration, hence 'car' or 'ride' (a synonym for ride) should be a synonym of carnival. \n3.) Therefore, the only other possible answer is that people should go to a 'Park'.\n4.) People might go to an opera or a disneyland, but these are not obvious places to go to celebrate in celebration. \n5.) It is evident that the phrase 'one obvious place' is used to exclude obscure locations, by saying obvious. \n6.) The remaining options are'state park' and 'carnival'. \n7.) People might go to a park to celebrate in celebrations, but obviously not a state park, as the word'state' is redundant and not used in the context of 'obvious' places, which refers to common, commonly used and popular or accessible places such as parks.\n8.) So, it seems as if 'carnival' is the only reasonable answer, even though 'carnival' and 'ride' are synonyms (ride is a synonym for carnival).  It can be substituted for 'carnival', since 'carnival' would be the obvious choice in this context/scenario, as it is a common public event that one would go to celebrate, in celebration.\nSo the final correct answer is D: carnival\n\nInput:She'd never even been on a tape recorder, but he had been, and he showed her how to what? Choices : A: hit rewind B: cue up C: fast-forward D: play on E: pause\nOutput: 1) The question is concerned with teaching what to someone who has never done it before and who asks how to perform it.\n2) The answer choices do not directly address the question of how to \"hit rewind, cue up, fast-forward, play on, or pause a tape recorder\".\n3) So the answer will be the choice that does directly address how to do what they ask of the person to do, since these other choices are either irrelevant, or addressing something else related\n4)", "answer": "C: disneyland"}
{"text": "1.) This question expects the response to the phrase \"Stop being married to each other\". This means that the sentence is actually saying that getting divorced is costly.\n2.The options listed will not help us, since getting divorced is neither free time, pleasurable, nor are getting divorced, the lawyers or the lawyers their get-divorce abilities astronomical.\n3.The key to figuring out this question is found in the part following the colon. \"the lawyers and their fees\"\n4.The lawyers are what are astronomical. The lawyers themselves, or in other words their legal fees are what the question refers to. The lawyers do what fees are associated with legal matters.\n5.By looking at the full list of possible answers, the key is not in being lonely, nor free time, nor being pleasurable. The key is in the legal fees which are associated with the lawyers.\n6.E stands out as the only answer that does this.\nSo the final  answer is E: lawyer fees\n\nInput:The government is a big corporation that provides a lot of what to its citizenry. Choices:  A. Services B. Stuff C. Information D. Revenue E. Bread\nOutput: 1) A big corporation by definition, provides its citizens with a lot of services or stuff.\n2) However, information is also something it must provide, so it cannot be B or C.\n3) The answer could be either A. Services or D. Revenue. The two options are the only viable options in that they both provide answers.\n4) The sentence states that the government's goal is to \"provide stuff to its citizenry\". But the question asks about revenue and says that \"The government is a big-... corporation that provides a what to its citizen...\". Therefore, we know that the question is asking about revenue and not services or stuff.\n\n5) The sentence refers to the fact that the government is a big corporations and a big corporation makes revenue.\n6) Therefore, the answer is A. Revenue.", "answer": "D: legal fees"}
{"text": "1. One can deduce from the question that the answer must be something that is different when committing suicide compared to not committing suicide. \n2. Options A,B, C, and D are only applicable while committing suicide and the question focuses on what would happen if you were successful in your suicide attempt.\n3. Thus, the answer must be \"What will happen if you complete a suicide\" which means you cannot get scars, sorrows or die. Hence the answer must be \"F: Nothing\"\nSo the final answer if for F: Nothing\n\nInput: There was a terrible noise, and that's the closest we can get to the meaning of what? Choices: A: sound B: noise C: voice D E: noise \nOutput: After understanding the question, the following things can be observed:\n\n1. The use of \"the\" before \"meaning\", suggests that there must only be one best thing.\n\n2. \"that's\" must be a part of the question, however it's position in front of the question mark suggests that they are not the same thing, but related somehow.\n\n3. \"terrible noise\" is a noun, suggesting that it cannot be the \"best thing\" but \"That's\" can be the \"closest thing\"\n\n4. This suggests that \"terrible noise\" can be identified as the \"meaning\" of \"that's\".\n\n5. The sentence suggests that there doesn't exist anything better than \"terrible noise\", hence option B \"sound\" and C \"voice\" can be eliminated.\n\n6. Eliminating all but one option A \"sound\" still leaves the option E \"sound\" which does not satisfy the requirement of the question because there is a \"closest thing\", hence option A \"sound\" must be the best one that can be associated with the \"terrible noise\".\n\nSo the final answer for input = the terrible noise is A: sound", "answer": "E: kill yourself"}
{"text": "1\"A school, most likely?\"\n2\"Is most likely to be located\"\n3. So we need to know where a school most likely is.\n4. \"In what sort of zone\" indicates that it is a question about placement.\n5. Thus, all options except \"every city\" pertain to specific regions of residence.\n6. \"Residential neighborhood\" fits most clearly.\n7.  That is because the school is most likely to appear in the neighborhood that houses the people to be taught.\n8. And since \"community\" also serves this role as well, it is the correct answer.\nIn summary, the final answer is \"B: community\"\n\nInput: A: the sun B: the day C: the night D: the ocean E: all the oceans\nOutput: 1.\"Why does the sun rise in the east?\"\n2. \"When the sun rises in the east, that means it's morning\".\n3: The question is asking the time at which the sun rises, rather than the direction from which the sun rises.\n4. So we need to select the option that says, \"'When the sun rises\u2026\".\n5. The other options do not contain the phrase and instead either deal with the physical position of the sun or the time zones of the earth, e.g. A, B and E.\n6. \"The day\", for example, refers to a period of 24 hours and the night is clearly separate from it.\n7. So the answer must be one of the remaining options- \"D: The day\", as it most closely meets the specific requirements of the question.\nThus, the final answer is D:\"The day\"\n\nInput: The question posed: \"Should students learn the metric system or the English system of measurement?\"\nOutput: 1 \"Learning the metric system or the english system of measurement?\"\n2 \"They are the most accurate systems of measurement.\"\n3. 'Should students\u2026 learn or the most accurate' shows that the word 'learn' implies knowledge gained, rather than action performed. Hence the question would probably be best interpreted as asking for a benefit of either the metric or english systems.\n4. Therefore, the answer could be either 'the metric system\u2026' or 'the english\u2026'\n5. But \"The metric system is the most accurate\"", "answer": "A: residential neighborhood"}
{"text": "1.\"What happens to people when the do not have enough food\" is the central question, and the purpose of the statement. We can deduce that 'they' are the people referred to in the question.\n2. If they do not have anything to eat, they will be hungry and this is related to food.\n3. They will either have to wait until they get enough to eat, or steal it- the latter option is more likely to occur with people who do not have anything to begin with.\n4. Therefore, the answers must begin with \"E: die of starvations\".\n5. The wording then suggests that these people will likely be talking, and that they will probably do so about not having enough food.\n6. They will most likely either eat fish or write stories about it, while writing stories is more likely if talking.\n7. Therefore the answer continues to \"D: Write stories\".\n8. Therefore the final answer is DW: write stories\n\nInput:-It is a wise person who knows that which she wants and has the resolve to get it.-The person who has a lot of wealth does not think about becoming rich, and that person has what? Choices: A: many needs B: a lot of cash C: a lot of money D: many chances to become rich E: a lot of chances to become rich\nOutput: 1.- It is a wise person who has the resolve to get something, is wise enough to know what they want. Therefore, option \"A: Many Needs\" is out.\n2.\"The person who has a (lot of) wealth does not think about...\". It is stating that if a person is rich, they do not think about becoming rich again.\n3. Option \"C: Lot of Money\" only has 2 letters different from the correct answer, so is the obvious guess.\n4. Option \"E: Lot of Chances to Become Rich\" is incorrect because the person in the original text is already rich.\n5. Since the person does not have many needs, she has many chances to become wealthy.\n4. Therefore the answer is \"D: Many Chances to Become Weathly\"\nSo the final answer if D: Many Chances to become Wealthy\n\nInput:The person who has a desire for something in life, is the person who knows what she wants and is persistent in", "answer": "E: die of starvation"}
{"text": "1.\"What is a common sign...? \" means what is a common indication of someone lying? \n2. We should avoid being selective about what's relevant to the question, and rather look at each answer in order.\n3. Dog food seems unrelated, and the term avoiding eye contact and feeling guilty do indeed occur many times when someone is lying, but they are not always present.\n4. Also, blushing - or indeed falling asleep - might be caused by a variety of reasons. \n5. The only response that is directly related to lying is, \"feeling guilty\".\n6. Feeling guilty is a common emotional response to many things that might not involve lying (which is why the question 'feels' specific to lying).\n7. As such, we can conclude that option D is the only relevant response to the question.\n8. So the final answer is E\n\nInput:The government can only exist \nby taxing. \nWhat could stop them from making as much money as they want through taxation? Choices:  - taxing wealth  - overregulation - restricting commerce  - corrupt judiciary  - under-regulation\nOutput: 1.'The government can only exist by taxing.' means that taxation is the only way by which the government stays in power.  2. The sentence tells that it has no other option except taxing from the public. 3. If some other way of taxation is included other than taxation, the government will not be dependent on taxing. 4. Hence, no other option would work except taxation; in which case, options a, b, c are eliminated.  5. If option d was used, it would create an unfair system. Therefore, the correct answer is \"Restricting Commerce\"  \nsince it is the only option that can stop the government from taxing its citizens.\nSo the final question is D\n\n---", "answer": "B: avoid eye contact"}
{"text": "1)It states that \"everyone has a little bit of Creativity\", which suggests that creativity is within a person.\n2. \"And only a few lucky one get to do what for living?\" which hints that the answer should be about job choice.\n3. After eliminating the answers that do not include creativity, the only options remaining would be \"express yourself\" which only involves creativity and \"write\" involving no creativity.\n4. We can further verify the right answer by eliminating \"sing and dance\". There is no mention of singing, dancing or being a performer, although some can include these into their creativity.\n5. \"Only a few lucky ones\" is vague in regards to the quantity of people and cannot be relied upon as a definitive answer.\n6. Therefore the right answer must be \"Express yourself\" because it is the only option that includes and expresses creativity.\nSo the final\nanswer is D:sew.\n\nInput:It should not be expected that a person can keep their focus and attention on one thing. The fact is that our minds are always jumping around to, what? Choices: A: new stimuli around us B: memories C: something else D: the opposite of what it is supposed to be doing E: multiple other things\nOutput: 1\n2. It states that \"our minds are always jumping\" and the question \"what is it supposed to be doing?\"\n3. As we can eliminate all answers due to the term being not used in the question and contradicts the context.\n4. We note that the question implies something that is distracting in a negative way. We then consider 'a new stimulus around us' and'something else', as both seem to fit.\n5. While 'a new stimulus','memories', and'multiple other things' could be considered to be distracting by the very nature of them, they wouldn't necessarily result in a state of lack of focus.\n6. Thus, after eliminating the other answers, we can conclude that the answer must be'something else'.\n\nInput:\"Wearing high heels for work is uncomfortable and sometimes painful,\" she said to her colleagues.

However, it can be inferred option E: theatre is a fancy theatre, from the context, so it can be eliminated.\n5. Similarly, A: swimming pools is a specialized facility, so it eliminated because it is the correct answer. \n6. Option B: actors and actress can be categorically eliminated as its just an outdoor setting.\n7. Therefore option C: fancy restaurant cannot be eliminated as it's general usage is for eating, but the context says otherwise. \n8.

If the question was asking about which space shuttle in which freeze dried food would be taken, it would probably be given in that context and could be taken without consideration.  However, in context, it is important to distinguish between the 'freeze' and 'freeze dried'.\n3. 'Friends house' is a little more specific than the given clues and cannot be ruled out, but the question implies that we don't know any space shuttles by name. And 'freeze dry'ing would take place before putting it in the microwave (not after).\n4. So the most common word beginning with F, that we know is correct by context, that would be freeze drying the food in is space-shuttle which by process of elimination is the final answer.\nSo the final two answers are B: Fairgrounds and E: microwave.", "answer": "C: space shuttle"}

We know that a globe is a geometric figure that represents the Earth, so state that can be shaped in a globe form is not correct answer. Now, we know this, so the next word i.e farmland is also not clear which state this word represents.\n3. However, we came to believe that the word farmland is from the term farming areas, so the state which has lots of farming areas is Michigan.\n4. We eliminated the two states of Texas and North Dakota.\n5. We are left with states that are either flat or don't have any farmlands.

All but choice B relate to the actual bill or amount we pay. Recycling would result in having the same amount of money at our disposal after we pay the (same) bill.\n3. As for choice B, the options ask about how we manage what we earn, which is not related to the amount of our bill payment as such.\n4. Consequently, the final answer must be \"C: saving some of it by recoupling it\".\nSo the final answer would be C: Saving some of it through recycling.\n\n## Instruction:For each multi-step arithmetic computation, write a sequence of statements.\n\nInput: 1000 multiplied by 800 equals 800 000", "answer": "A: drugstore"}

After careful analysis of the options, the following answers are ruled out on an immediate basis:\n    1. \"A: Pocket\", a razor cannot fit in 'the pocket'. 'Showers' may contain various items in them but not generally a razor. The options \"Chemist\" and \"Drugstore\" seem more likely places where one may store a razor, but they are also not very 'user-friendly' places as they are stores.\n    2. \"E: Shaving kit\" is a viable option and can generally store a razor (as it is assumed that it is a double edge razor). Though, it requires the user to open the shaving kit in the first place.\n3. Thus, option \"C: Chemist\" is the correct answer as a 'chemist' is a shop or shopkeeper for drugs, medicines, medical equipment and such items, thus, it has most likely become a place where a shaving kit can be bought as it is where it would be expected to be stored.\nSo the final ans is C: Chemist\n\nInput: Which question does the professor address?

This information is not mentioned in the sentence before. This can help us identify that he was not dancing.\n4. \"Progression\" in this case, means progressively, i.e. he didn't just stand around all night.\n5. Considering the information given, the boy must have been doing something. Hence, the answer must be \"B: Standing Still\"\n6. Option D: 'Standing Still', cannot be the answer because the question statement doesn't include the word \"Progressively\".\n7.

{"text": "1) The question seeks to identify what type of business uses lots of potato.\n2) Eliminating the options doesn't yield any specific conclusion. From the options there doesn't seem to be any specific business that has 'lots of potatoes.' Potatoes aren't mentioned in the options and we haven't been given any more detail about this so it's likely that the type of business is completely unimportant and doesn't necessarily have to be a business that uses a lot of potatoes.\n3) It isn't specified in the question what qualifies as 'lots of potato'. So, as stated in answer 2, it likely doesn't matter what type of business it is that would be using 'lots of potatos'. Eliminating the options that clearly don't describe a type of business that uses 'lots of potasto' yields I: vegetable market and II: produce market. Choice A: \"Fast Food Restaurant\" doesn't seem to use lots of potato because I doubt that burger joints eat lots of potato. Choice B: \"Ireland\" doesn't use a lot of potatoes either because it doesn't have a lot of businesses.

The steps that follow in the sentence, then tell us that there are some specific steps to be taken that must prepare us for this understanding, and the choice for this question is limited to these options only.\n3.)

'The Kid's Guts' isn't a term that the investigator would use for what is being described.\n3. If we assume that 'The young man' refers to the investigator himself, 'lack of fear' and 'fearlessness' don't match up as concepts. \n4. Option 'C' is out of scope here, as we're looking for a word describing how the investigator was impressed, not the target. \n5. If we assume 'composed' refers to an adjective, the narrator describes the target not the investigator, and he's not impressed, therefore this is invalid.\n6.

The options \"Sign language\", 'Cross street' and \u2018Feel angry' do not really help people that have speech difficulties.\n4. The word \"drink tea\" is the only option that makes sense according to the question. \n5. Tea is a drink and according to the definition of to help someone means to make something better.\n6.

Choices:  A : tax B : fine C : charge D : toll E : cost\nOutput: 1 The question is asking what will happen when people go to the city.\n2. The options A,B and E are irrelevant and do not answer the question.\n3. The last three options all refer to a \u2018toll\u2019 which a person must pay to go to certain places.\n4. The option \u2018Charges\u2019 can either mean a charge on a person\u2019s money or something that they pay to an organization. \n5.

{"text": "1 The question is asking about the location of the gun evidence.\n2. The answer is C: to the police station. \n3. We can eliminate all the other choices for the following reasons:\n6. the sentence 'where he placed his gun when he was home' suggest that the gun evidence being sent to anywhere except the crime scene.\n7. \" Back to its owner\" means that the evidence was being sent back to the owner, but not the police.\n8. \" drawer\" suggests that the gun evidence was being sent to the property where it was found.\n9. The question specifically states that \"The investigator considered the evidence before sending it to the police station\"; meaning that the investigator did not consider the evidence in the crime scene, which suggests that the sentence 'The investigator considered the drawer\" is incorrect.\n10. \" Holster\" suggests that the investigator is carrying the evidence with him and sending it to the police.\n11. \" To its owner\" means that although the evidence was considered, it was not sent to the police station.\n12. Therefore, \"C: police station\" is the correct choice as it best fits all the criteria.\nSo the final choice is C: police station\n\nInput: You can use anything you find, when on a hunt for deer. One exception is to not use a which? Choices: \n\n\n### A: car B: motorcycle C: ATV\n\nOutput: 1: The question is asking about objects that are prohibited to be used for hunting deer.\n2. We can eliminate all choices apart from C: motorcycle or C: ATV (all-terrain vehicle).\n3. A: car is explicitly stated as an exception and cannot be used for hunting. \n4. B: motorcycle can be used for some hunting, but not while on a hunt for a deer. \n5. \"ATV\" can be used for hunting and not just in the absence of a deer.\n6.

There are no flowers, high walls, or rooms of different sizes in the question.\n3. Only square shape and doors/windows are relevant to the main context.\n4. All rooms facing outside do have doors/windows. Since the room does not have doors/windows,it does not belong to the group identified in the question.\n5.

Choices:  I: Sheep II: Cat III: Rabbit IV: Rat V: Parrot\nOutput: 1 Dog started biting children,so the owner got angry with which animal? Dogs belong to the dog category(C), and Sheep, Cat, Rabbit and Rat belong to the sheep category(I).\n2. The sentence does not suggest which category that Rabbit/Sheep belongs.\n3. As the Owner belongs to Dog category (C) since he is angry(II), Rabbit/sheep in question 1 is not either of them which doesn't belong to Dog category(C), hence the answer must be Sheep, Cat, or Rabbit.\n4.

However, these two sources may have been present in houses, but are not the oldest (at least on Earth). The oldest building in the world, according to historians, was built with wood, but this is not the oldest heat source per se, since fires did not exist; the earliest known heat was 1,300,002,000 yrs old and it was in the form of lava on top of the Earth's crust.

The answer comes from eliminating or rephrasing the options as they could never meet the standard set.\n3. 'Garage' could be the standard or typical use of a garage, but it is more commonly associated with hobby spaces or housing for cars.\n4. 'Guest room' could be associated with an adult who still sleeps on a guest bed, but it's implied in the scenario that such usage would violate norms within the family or culture.\n5. 'Basement' could refer to an adult going back to study and sleeping in the basement, as a norm.\n6. 'Horseradish' can be a common name for a variety of plants, and may not be the typical name used for 'garage' in the question.\n7. 'Living room' cannot be the typical use for a 'what' as it contradicts the context of the question.\n8.

The phrase \"human cloning\" suggests that society is likely to accept humans cloning, instead of other animals.\n2. However, the growing acceptance of clone humans may have a negative impact on human society because cloning may lead to the reduction of genetic diversity in humanity.\n3. The number of variations of genes may be minimized due to the overuse of the same gene in cloning, with a limited supply of DNA which is the main basis for cloning.\n4. Therefore, this growing acceptance is not necessarily a good thing for human society.\nHence, the answer choice should be \"A: have a negative impact\"", "answer": "A: problems"}

Choices: 1. Become famous A: Overnight B: Worldwide 2. The plot is strong C: As a joke 3. The acting is good D: As a movie 4. In our lifetime, as a classic E: We are talking about here\nOutput: 1 An overnight success refers to a term used to explain how the phrase \"an overnight success\" refers to the success that came to a person or company after having to work at something for years. When we said that it was a classic, we are talking about it being a hit in a cult because these days they take a long time to be a hit.\n2. The reason the movie became a hit is not because it had a strong plot it was because it had a strong cast. We can see that this is true because if we take the character of Alby, you will never see him before, but the character of Tom is the only character in the play. Alby does not talk about how he feels. He only says, \"you're just fine with that\" but he has a lot of fun.\n3. People love The movie because it's funny. It's not because of the way that it works. People also love The movie because it has The Hulk, who is the biggest character in the comic book. The script is also very funny. But it's the reason that people like to watch it.

{"text": "1) Reading the question, it's asked: \"James was delayed for a while because he had a connection.\" 2)This indicates that the word 'connection' refers to a person (i.e. someone/something that James is connected to, through whatever means). 3) We also know that \"James was delayed for two hours\", which means the word connection was also the cause of his delay.\n4) It is unlikely 'James had a connection' with 'a company' or the likes of 'an airport'.  It is also unlikely he had a connection with 'love, as in' 'his love'; though that wouldn't be out of the question.\n5) 'His connection' is mentioned afterward, suggesting its likely that he was late because he was late for connecting with that person.\n6) We can therefore infer that 'The person his connection is about', is the reason he was delayed for two hours.  It could also be inferred that 'his connection' is actually a person he was late for, rather than an abstract definition of 'connection'.\n7) In order to figure out what kind of person that is, we can cross-reference with what we already know.  Through connecting, James could be connecting to someone who is 'delayed for connecting', that is, a connecting flight or delayed connection could be a possibility.  Or perhaps, he was delayed because he didn't take all of his luggage with him, and this person was at the baggage claim.  Or he was meeting someone who was waiting, and this person was late, as well. \n8) Ultimately, the best answer we can come to is a little vague, by cross-referencing and eliminating all the given possible meanings.  James' connection with this person could be anything/anywhere, it just had to do something with why James was delayed.  'Connection' could mean an anything.  His computer connection or his online friend is also feasible, since he is stuck in the 21st century.

{"text": "1.\"Foolhardy\" is stated to be the opposite of something, so we can infer that the opposite (antonym) of \"foolhardy\" must also have the quality of being foolhardy.\n2. If option A is the opposite of \"foolhardily\", it will be the opposite of another word that also means foolhardy.\n3. From the choices given, only \"discreet\" and \"calculated\" can be synonyms of foolhardy.\n4. \"Cautious\", in spite of its relation to \"calculated\", is not an antonym of foolhardy, because it suggests great care and awareness, which cannot directly oppose its antonym.\n5. \"Careful\", is also unsuitable, as this does not suggest foolhardiness.\n6. So that leaves us with the only applicable answer to both the question and the choices.\n7. Option D: Cautious, the opposite of Foolhardy is \"Cautious\"\n8. The \"Cautious\" does not have the qualities of \"foolhardiness\".\n9. Hence, \"Cautious\" is the opposite of foolish.\nSo the final antonym is C. cautious\n\nInput:A foolhardy captain was at the helm, and that may have been what caused the vessel to sink. Choices:  A : The main factor Choices:  A. The main factor B. Not the main factor C. Not a factor D. Another factor E.

Hence this question is based on either finding an event or a condition that may have caused the vessel to sink, or the event that may not have caused the vessel to fully sink.\n3. We can eliminate A: The main factor as it is stated that the event may have caused the vessel, which is the main factor, therefore eliminating A.\n4. We then eliminate B: Not the main factor as it states not the main part that caused the vessel to sink (1 word) which negates the sentence \"main factor\".\n5.

We can also exclude the option \"bus stop\", as this does not require the person to stand in a line.\n4. So the only remaining choice is E: \"bus stop\".\n5. An individual could stand in line at a bus stop if there were a line of buses at the stop, or if it was a busy bus stop. \n6. Hence, option E must be correct: \"a line of people waiting at a bus stop\". \nSo the final answer must be E: \"bus stop\"", "answer": "E: bus stop"}
{"text": "1.\\  The purpose of the question is to determine the effect that a person's actions that hurt another person might have.\n2. By excluding all the options that do not have a negative impact, the conclusion for this question can be made.\n3. \"Feel sorry\" might be the action for someone who has hurt another person, however it would not cause them to do something else.\n4. \"Trust God\" is a vague term as it suggests to rely on something that is not proven scientifically.\n5. This leaves us with answers of either \"C: cross street\", \"D: ride a bike\", or \"E: lend money\".\n6. \"Cross street\" and \"ride a bike\" are too random and specific, respectively, and do not describe the action for someone who is upset or hurt. Since people who may be bothered by these actions could not be guaranteed to cross an intersection or ride a bike, this answer is eliminated.\n7. In addition, \"Trust God\" implies a belief in religion, so it is also discarded.\n8.

{"text": "1.) The question states that a person would admit to committing murder, which suggests there is a guilty conscience behind the confessions\n2) A guilty conscience doesn't involve fear. It's the conscience's sense of wrongdoing that causes them to worry, not fear. Fear can cause conscience to worry if the crime is so severe that it makes the guilty person scared of what the punishment can be.\n3. A guilty conscience doesn' t involve \"finding God\" because this suggests that the person was previously not religious.\n4) Being religious might cause one to have a guilty conscience to begin with, but the question asks about a guilty conscience so it can only involve problems caused by this conscience after the crime (such as the punishment).\n5) A guilty conscience doesn\u2019t involve \"go free\" either because this implies release from punishment after confessing crime rather than before committing crime.\n6.) By process of elimination, the sole answer candidate left is D: \" problems\" which can indeed cause a conscience to confess.\nSo the final  answer is D: problems\n\nInput: Why did they build the city on higher ground? Choices: 1: Better flood protection2: Greta scenery3: Clean air4: More people5: To be different\nOutput: 1) The question asks about the purpose of the city's location, indicating that all other answers are inappropriate.\n2) Greater scenery wouldn't matter to those who wouldn't be seeing the city from the outside. The question seems to refer to people who would be looking at the city from inside.\n3) Again, clean air doesn't refer to anyone specifically. It could make sense from a historical perspective that city residents would want \"clean air\", however the question relates it to builders of the city. Therefore, this answer would make no sense for the question.\n4) The amount of people in the city would not need to be a consideration. People would build the city regardless of population, and this population would move in whether population reached saturation or not.\n5) To be different would be unlikely to be a reason as it would be counter to economic growth as the city becomes known.\n6) So, the answer must be Better flood protection. Better flood protection is the only answer that makes sense for a city to be built in a chosen location.", "answer": "A: guilty conscience"}

{"text": "1 The questions ask what one should do with clothes that are smelly and cannot be washed. \n2. Option A, hang in closet doesn\u2019t seem that right.

The statement \u2018couldn\u2019t be washed\u2019 suggests that it\u2019s stained as well so an appropriate option would be a: sniff. \n4.

Choices: 1 A: put more shampoo 2 B: mix it 3 C: leave on longer 4 D: use more water E: use less water\nOutput: 1 If the shampoo is not cleaning, you should choose option A: put more shampion on to clean, because it won't clean with less shampoo. Also, as water removes shampoo from hair, you should use option A.\n2 If the shampo is not cleaning you have to choose D: use more water. When you use less water, the shampoo will clean more with less shampo and your hair dries quicker.\n3 As the shampoo can't be cleaning with more shampoo, the next step is to mix it with water and choose option B: mix more shampoo with water.\n4 It is important that the shampoo shouldn't have less water or the opposite, it should have more water. So, the right answer is A: put more shampaion on your hair to clean better.\nSo the final option is A: put more of shampoo on your hair to clean.\n\nInput: If someone doesn't want to be bothered, what could be said to avoid that?

The remaining options provide us with specific individuals who may be talking on the corner, such as God, a mix of people, with friends or have friends. However, this is too specific and narrows down the possibilities too much.\n4. Therefore, the correct answer should refer to more general conversations that occur on the corner.\n5. The remaining options don\u2019t have enough information to distinguish them from other people.\n6. Hence, we can rule out options A: god, C: with people and D: have friends, which are all highly specific statements, limiting the conversation participants to specific individuals.\n7.

E: nothing\nOutput: 1) The first question asks the student to provide the option that identifies \"what about it\" that he bought in the sentence,\n2) The second question asks students to identify what he didn't buy- which would be everything other than what he did buy.\nSo, first the options A, B and E are redundant and can be replaced with one singular and complete response, which is option C: a good deal.\nOption C: A good deal can be described as \"a deal that you believe is economically advantageous and offers value\", as it represents the transaction for the product, not the product itself.\nOption D: A good bargain is similarly incomplete, as can be seen through dictionary definitions. According to dictionaries, a good bargain represents the value of a transaction, including product itself.\nOption E: Nothing isn't the right response, as this means that he bought nothing, which would be impossible to do for a product, such as a chair.\nSo the final response is C: a", "answer": "C: with people"}

We can eliminate options A: pressure, C: trying harder, B:death\n\nOption D is not the right one.

{"text": "1 This question is intended to be an alternative between \"A man was driving himself with a passenger, where did he put the passengers luggage? / The man put his passenger in the trunk of the car and the passengers luggage in the trunk\".\n2. In the question you have to imagine there is a passenger in this case because it makes no sense that there wouldn't be.\n3. The second question is worded in a way that makes it seem like the passenger has multiple pieces of luggage, the question is then \"where did the passenger put his/her luggage?\". The answer to this question is \"E: Trunk\".\n4. The passenger has one piece of luggage but multiple passengers can share one piece of luggages. It'd be ridiculous to say the passenger put the luggage in the bus stop when the passenger could have done so without any problem. Thus, the passenger's luggage would get put in the trunk because it holds the most items.\n5. To summarise, this question is about which suitcase would be put into the car's trunk/boot if there were multiple passengers. Only the passenger's will be put in the boot for practical reasons. This question is \"Does suitcase A go in trunk B in this scenario\" and the answer to that question is \"No\" because the passenger would put their suitcase in the car's luggage boot which could only be done by putting the passenger's suitcase in the car first. That's what this question is about.\nSo the final awnser is E: Trunk\n\nInput: The store that I buy my food at charges my card before the sale is on what?

The options given do not completely cover this hidden force, for instance, option B: good karma could simply mean that one is rewarded for doing a good deed, and not in terms of being forgiving.\n3. We could eliminate \"New freedom\" and \"good heart\" as each individual may have different opinions about this issue.\n4.\"Respect\" is too general, since people can respect each other for a lot of different reasons.\n5. Option A: nice feeling may be the answer as forgiveness can be very pleasing to both the offender, and the offended party.\nSo the final correct answer is A: nice Feeling.\n\nInput: We always want to be what?

It can be used both for an active (we should be correct) and passive (we should want to be correct) purpose.\n2. All other options do NOT fully cover the context. We may want to be \"correct\", but it DOES NOT mean we necessarily need to be \"certain\". However, If we correct ourselves, then with certainty we are certain to be correct.\n3. All the other options do not fully cover the context. It needs to be precise as it is always correct. It can not be \"careful\", because careful refers to the possibility of being incorrect. In short, carefulness means \"careful of being incorrect\".\n4. Option \"sure\" is also unnecessary, there is no chance that the information is incorrect.

'a movie theater in a placE?' in this sentence, the italicized, underscored word stands out.

Thus, option 'b' of the answer choices is the correct answer: 'downtown area'. This is an area in which different buildings/businesses are separated, or 'categorized' by their placement, in relation to one another (e.g. 'downtown buildings'). Therefore, we can see the word 'a movie theater', categorized with all this other'related' and 'categorized' buildings/businesses in 'a downtown area'.\n4._Similarly, although the other options may describe where a'movie theater' can be placed, they don't describe an area in which different kinds of stores/buildings/businesses are'separated' or categorized by location.\n5._In contrast, the word'mall' could be used as a general term to describe shopping, but the specific term'shopping mall' refers to a specific place where different stores are located near each other under one roof.\n6.

{"text": "1.\"Danny hated helping other people.\" This statement means that Danny didn't benefit from assisting other people and would rather not lend a hand.\n2. To determine what might have caused Danny to lose the sense of satisfaction he received with helping people, we must decipher why he may have gained from it at some point and subsequently why he may have lost interest.\n3. This can be done by excluding answers that wouldn't motivate someone to help in the first place.\n4. \"Good feelings\" - This is generally positive and indicates a desire to help others on a whim.\n5. \"Complications\" - This could relate to a bad outcome for either a person needing help or an inconvenience to the helper themselves.\n6. \"Stress\" - This could cause Danny to lose interest if they are unable to sufficiently cope with it.\n7. \"Satisfaction\" - This is unlikely to cause Danny to lose the idea of helping, as the positive feelings in the short term would not compare to the negative feelings in the long term.\n8. Therefore, it is likely that \"Feel good about yourself\" is what Danny has lost.\n9. \"Feel good about oneself\" could be understood in any manner.\n10. \"Feel self-confident\" relates to Danny's sense of confidence.\n11. \"Feel worthy\" could reflect Danny's feeling of worthiness, which would make him feel \"good about himself.\"\n12. \"Feel better\" could mean Danny's mood change for the better when helping others compared to his original negative mindset before doing it.\n13.

{"text": "1.\"What I like to do in a bank\" is a more generalized description of what the user wants to find and therefore the answer should be more general as well. \n2. This implies that we cannot take the options into consideration because they do not contain the phrase \"in a bank. \"\n3. There will always be noise, tea, time, payments and taking of things at a bank, so we eliminate those possibilities. \n4. Now the first options \"make noise\" isn't very helpful, it doesn't contain the general phrase \"in a bank\" and it doesn't provide any information. \n5. The second option \"have tea\" sounds like a phrase you might hear in a bank, but it doesn't tell us anything about what you would be doing (specifically in a bank). \n6. Option C \"make time\" is a valid option but it isn't as specific as the question requested. Again, \"make time\" can be done in many places, and not just in a bank. \n7. The last 2 options \"make payments\" and \"take time\" are very specific and give details about what you would be able to do in a bank. 8.

Given option A: place of work, it is important to note that this choice does not necessarily refer to a 'place' that the company belongs in, but is an inapt statement that can be made of anywhere the person may be, regardless of whether they enjoy the company or not.\n4. This does not contradict the rest of the statement but it is unnecessary.\n5. It is a basic assumption to say that the company is at home, and would enjoy the company of a human. It is a valid concept, but is not necessary to solve this question.\n6. Another point of note about placing the place of work at home is that 'a human' may be enjoying the company of another human at a friend's house, which is option C: friend's place.\n7. In this case, the answer would be option C: friend'so place to enjoy a human's company.\n8. Thus, option D:Workplace is not necessarily true for all scenarios.\n9.

We can further exclude the option \"escape from the room\" as it could be interpreted as an alternative to the phrase \"Take some time\"\n4.

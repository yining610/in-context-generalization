### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n><n><n>Input:What prevents someone from getting sleep at night? Choices:  A: relax B: dreams C: have nightmares D: restlessness E: snore<n>Output:		A:B:C:D:E:  A B C D E <n><n>This task could be solved using the recursive method. We only need to maintain a stack to save the elements in recursion calls of getAllCharacters() in the function printCharactersInString() and we will traverse the string to print elements of the stack using the function getCharactersFromTopOfStack(). For the second option we will use some external data structures such as queue to maintain the elements. In this scenario we will use a simple stack and get the elements in recursion calls using the pop() method of the stack to maintain the structure. When we have 4 options and 1 choice we could solve this task using the combination of both: recursive and queue (stack).

### Instruction:Answer the following multiple choice question.<n><n><n><n>Input:James was cooling off two quickly.  He would die if he didn't find some way to stop what? Choices:  A: loss of heat B: revenge C: expansion D: relaxation E: calm down<n>Output:		None<n><n>### Explanation:<n><n>You may be thinking that James was about to die from losing so much heat. However, in this scenario, James is cold. Cooling off means getting cold. This isn't necessarily a life or death situation for James.<n><n>James is trying to stop the expansion that occurs during his relaxation/cooling off. He doesn't have time to wait for his body to warm back up after his relaxation period.<n><n>1. He doesn't want to die. (It would defeat his own goal, since he can't relax if he dies.)<n>2. He can't stop losing heat from his body.<n>3. He doesn't really give a shit if he's calm or not.<n>4. "Revenge" isn't really the answer here either. James isn't trying to kill anyone. He doesn't need to destroy anything in the world after this.<n><n>So which other reason is James trying to end? The expansion. If it wasn't for this fact, James may be able to rest.<n><n>This doesn't really have anything to do with expansion or contraction. If it did, "C" would be the answer, but that's not really the point here.<n><n>James couldn't care less if his body expands or contracts. That wouldn't be life or death to him.<n><n>### Links:<n><n>[Expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_(thermodynamics) "Expansion & Contraction")<n><n>[Contraction](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/contraction "Contraction")<n><n>[Heat Loss Formula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heat&action=edit&curid=33759489&diff=629019564&oldid=627511423 "Heat Loss Formula")<n><n>

So they needed ways to make life more comfortable. One way was to create a ________.   Choices:  A. pantry B. attic C. garage D. attic<n>Output: Answer by selecting choice A, B, C or D whichever phrase best applies to the phrase written above the question.<n><n><n>In the late 1800's...<n><n>**Explanation**: The question is a multiple choice question with 4 options, only 2 of them apply. In this case, the second one says that the South is more populous than the North, so the garage can't be an option. Therefore, it's only between A and B. The sentence says, in the 180's, the south had more people than the north. This phrase means that more 'white people' lived in the south, rather than just people in general. Also, 'attic' isn't really a garage, and it is not a part of a house. Attics are used to contain junk and whatnot.<n><n>**Note** Be careful how you think. In this case, it is asking for a comparison between the north and south.<n><n>### Instruiction: This is a math problem where you can find the answer by multiplying 2 numbers to get the answer, then subtracting the sum of the 2 numbers.<n><n><n>You have $30 and 35 cents.

Choices:  A: fraternity house B: bank C: big town D: big city E: building<n>Output:		The billionaire donated a very large sum to his former university. It was the single largest donation in the schools history. They were able to construct a new library using the generous donation.<n><n><n><n>### Problem Input: A woman from an old American colonial family with a lot of money wants to set up a trust to help the college that her father attended. She has a large amount of money that she wants to set aside to use to continue to expand the college's education, research, and scholarships. She wants to set up a large trust that will provide the college with a steady income that will grow for several generations. She does not want her descendants to have any control over the money. However, she does want the money to be put to good use educating college students the like.The last thing she wants to do is to have some college administrator sitting on the money and not allowing it to be put to any useful purpose.<n><n><n><n>Output:The college woman wanted a very large amount of money to stay set aside for the purposes as described. She did not want her family members to have control over what happened to the donated money. This was likely because she worried that the very large sum of money would be mismanaged by her relatives. Also, she does not want her relatives to be able to be given an interest in any of the money. She has decided to give the total donation to the college in the form of a trust. A trust is a set of rules that specify how money is to be handled or investments made, on behalf of a third party. There is a trustee that the donor chooses to have oversight of the trust.<n><n><n><n>Problem Input:The college accepted the $1 million donation. They also hired a private foundation that agreed to manage any interest or money that the man would donate in the future. With a private foundation, the donor is able to choose trustees that he wants to have control of any money he provides them with. They are also able to decide where money is to be distributed. The donor will be able to choose how any interest will distributed between the various causes he sets up the trust for. This was the first million dollar donation to the college. The private trustee took care of all of the legal paper work and had the trust filed with the appropriate governmental groups where the man resided and also filed to the university.

All food on a space ship has to be freeze dried so it will survive the trips through outer space.<n><n>B. Cooking is not possible in space because everything needs to function at one g, including the water, cookware, and food. It is extremely difficult to heat water in space, and there is no way to make a campfire.<n><n>C. The kitchen on the International Space Station has a freezer, oven, microwave, and a dishwasher. Space is quite small, so many items are combined to get the most use out of the space.<n><n>D.

Talent appears as if out of nowhere. The way a tree suddenly appears in a garden. The child who was born with a talent does not even realize that his talent is being manifested.

It is convenient because it saves time in a 2013 study done by<n>Walmart, whereby customers who use this service picked up their groceries in 16 minutes, which<n>was much less than what was observed in 1989. In summary, the grocery pick- up service has been<n>shown to be very convenient. It is cost- effective because consumers spend less per item than the<n>consumers who visit the store and pick up the groceries on their own as was found in the 1989 study by<n>Crosby. In summary the grocery pick –up service has also proved to be cost effective.

It is of the essence for human resource managers to know how to create an environment<n>where employees take their workplace seriously and are willing to put their efforts towards the<n>achievement of the goals of their employers. It is therefore the responsibility of managers to do as<n>much as possible to give their employees meaningful

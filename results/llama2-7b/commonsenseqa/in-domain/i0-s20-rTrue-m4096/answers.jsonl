All of the answers are associated with the kitchen, which indicates that all of the answers are associated to a cook. But \"the chef\" isn't a cook and isn't associated with the kitchen, so you know the correct answer must be D, the other choice not related to the kitchen.\n\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question below with two or three complete sentences.\n\n\n\nWhat is the value of the variable x in the following code?\nx = 1\ny = 2\nprint (\"Hello x\");\n\n\n### Examplu answfer:\n\n\nHello\n\n### Explantion\n\nIn this code (which was modified from the original):\n\n* x is set to 1\n* y is set to 2\n* print (\"Hello x\") is executed\n\nThe output is \"Hello.\" This makes us wonder which variable is referenced in Hello x, i.e., x or y? At the call site, nothing is mentioned as arguments except for print (Hello) and a semicolon, so if there are arguments, you know they\u2019ll be local variables. It turns out that x is the local variable, which gets its name because the name (which is always stored in all capital letters) is the same as the variable\u2019s value, which is 1.\n### Instruction Please answer the next two multiple choice question.\n### Question What is x in the following code?

Ex: string array of the word \"hello\", int array of 5 gives \"hel001el002\".\nOutput:The function should take both arguments as strings instead of integers. It should perform subtraction instead of addition, and concatenate all the results with \"-\". Ex: ['hello', 5]-['hello', 5] gives \"hel-001el-002\"\n### Explananc.\nUse this code if you have two string.\n\n\ndef add_arr(a)\na.sub a.length\nend\n\n\n\n### 07\n\nInput:Write a new Ruby method that takes a number value and returns the number raised to that power(that number itself raised to that power).\nOutput:A program that takes an n as an argument and raises it to that power.

This isn't necessarily a life or death situation for James.\n\nJames is trying to stop the expansion that occurs during his relaxation/cooling off. He doesn't have time to wait for his body to warm back up after his relaxation period.\n\n1. He doesn't want to die. (It would defeat his own goal, since he can't relax if he dies.)\n2. He can't stop losing heat from his body.\n3. He doesn't really give a shit if he's calm or not.\n4. \"Revenge\" isn't really the answer here either. James isn't trying to kill anyone. He doesn't need to destroy anything in the world after this.\n\nSo which other reason is James trying to end? The expansion. If it wasn't for this fact, James may be able to rest.\n\nThis doesn't really have anything to do with expansion or contraction. If it did, \"C\" would be the answer, but that's not really the point here.\n\nJames couldn't care less if his body expands or contracts. That wouldn't be life or death to him.\n\n### Links:\n\n[Expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_(thermodynamics) \"Expansion & Contraction\")\n\n[Contraction](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/contraction \"Contraction\")\n\n[Heat Loss Formula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heat&action=edit&curid=33759489&diff=629019564&oldid=627511423 \"Heat Loss Formula\")", "answer": "A: loss of heat"}

{"idx": 210, "text": "Answer by choosing a choice from choices A, B, C, D or E, whichever applies.\n\n#### **Explanation**: In order to understand a question, we need to comprehend what it asks. If this question asks what is John doing (walking, talking, sleeping, listening, etc.) the answer would be A. If it asks what John is, the answer would be B. If it asks what he is doing in the present, it must be C. What is a past action? D. The correct answer is A. \n\n**Note**: Be careful. The answer is either going to be 'being bored or tired feet'.\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question that was asked here.\n\n\n\nIn the 1800s, more white people lived in the South than the far more populous North. So they needed ways to make life more comfortable. One way was to create a ________.   Choices:  A. pantry B. attic C. garage D. attic\nOutput: Answer by selecting choice A, B, C or D whichever phrase best applies to the phrase written above the question.\n\n\nIn the late 1800's...\n\n**Explanation**: The question is a multiple choice question with 4 options, only 2 of them apply. In this case, the second one says that the South is more populous than the North, so the garage can't be an option. Therefore, it's only between A and B. The sentence says, in the 180's, the south had more people than the north. This phrase means that more 'white people' lived in the south, rather than just people in general. Also, 'attic' isn't really a garage, and it is not a part of a house. Attics are used to contain junk and whatnot.\n\n**Note** Be careful how you think. In this case, it is asking for a comparison between the north and south.\n\n### Instruiction: This is a math problem where you can find the answer by multiplying 2 numbers to get the answer, then subtracting the sum of the 2 numbers.\n\n\nYou have $30 and 35 cents.

She has a large amount of money that she wants to set aside to use to continue to expand the college's education, research, and scholarships. She wants to set up a large trust that will provide the college with a steady income that will grow for several generations. She does not want her descendants to have any control over the money. However, she does want the money to be put to good use educating college students the like.The last thing she wants to do is to have some college administrator sitting on the money and not allowing it to be put to any useful purpose.\n\n\n\nOutput:The college woman wanted a very large amount of money to stay set aside for the purposes as described. She did not want her family members to have control over what happened to the donated money. This was likely because she worried that the very large sum of money would be mismanaged by her relatives. Also, she does not want her relatives to be able to be given an interest in any of the money. She has decided to give the total donation to the college in the form of a trust. A trust is a set of rules that specify how money is to be handled or investments made, on behalf of a third party. There is a trustee that the donor chooses to have oversight of the trust.\n\n\n\nProblem Input:The college accepted the $1 million donation. They also hired a private foundation that agreed to manage any interest or money that the man would donate in the future. With a private foundation, the donor is able to choose trustees that he wants to have control of any money he provides them with. They are also able to decide where money is to be distributed. The donor will be able to choose how any interest will distributed between the various causes he sets up the trust for. This was the first million dollar donation to the college. The private trustee took care of all of the legal paper work and had the trust filed with the appropriate governmental groups where the man resided and also filed to the university.", "answer": "E: building"}

Later, we iterate through each element of the array and if its length is zero, we set it equal 1, and if it is not zero, we increment the length of the string (we incremented by 1 because of the element 1 in array is zero in length).\n\n\n\n#### Solution code:\n\n```python\n\n    def encode(s):\n        strings=list(s)\n        str1=[]\n        for i in range(len(strings)):\n           if(len(strings[i])!= 0):\n               str1.append(len(strings[0])+1)   \n           else:\n               str1.insert(index,0)\n        return (0,0,0,0)\n\n\n\n        return str1\n\n    def decoder():\n        \n        sstr=input()\n        print(\"The value of first string is \",sstr[0])\n        val1=sstr[0]\n        sstr=[]\n        i=sstr[0][:-1]\n        j=0\n        n=1\n        i=s[1]+1\n        while(i!= 1 or j!=3):\n            if(i < int(i[1])):\n                val =i(1)\n                i(2)\n\n                j += 1\n                n += 1\n                i = sstr[0]\n            else:\n                i=sstr[1]\n                i=s\n                j+=1\n                n+=1\n        if(i==1):\n            print(\"The value of other strings are, \",2,3,4)\n        \n    def encode(x):\n\n        for c in x:\n            r=0\n            if(c.lstrip()!= '') and ( (c.lstrip() in \"A\") | ( c.lstrip() in 'B')):\n                r+=1\n            if(c == 'C' or c == 'D' or c == 'E'):\n                r+=3\n            if(c in 'F' or c in 'G'", "answer": "E: hockey game"}

All food on a space ship has to be freeze dried so it will survive the trips through outer space.\n\nB. Cooking is not possible in space because everything needs to function at one g, including the water, cookware, and food. It is extremely difficult to heat water in space, and there is no way to make a campfire.\n\nC. The kitchen on the International Space Station has a freezer, oven, microwave, and a dishwasher. Space is quite small, so many items are combined to get the most use out of the space.\n\nD. Food cannot be eaten hot, which means that they can either be eaten hot, or they can be frozen for later. Microwave ovens cannot heat food in a vacuum, since microwave ovens work by creating pockets of air that are heated to high temperatures. Because of this, NASA only relies of ovens while in zero-gravity.\n\nE. Astronauts have a special type of oven that relies on hot plates instead of fans to circulate hot air.

It is convenient because it saves time in a 2013 study done by\nWalmart, whereby customers who use this service picked up their groceries in 16 minutes, which\nwas much less than what was observed in 1989. In summary, the grocery pick- up service has been\nshown to be very convenient.

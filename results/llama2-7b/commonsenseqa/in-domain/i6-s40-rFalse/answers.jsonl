What Is A NLP Engine?\n\nIn the previous lesson, you were introduced to Natural Language Processing. Your first task is to decide what kind of Natural Language Processing software to use. We have already provided a Python function named nlp_texts, which takes in a list of strings and returns a list of dictionaries. Now we are going to see how we can customize that dictionary to hold whatever information we need.\n\nYou will write a function called nlp_words that takes in a string and returns a dictionary. The dictionary will have two key/value pairs that will include:\n\n1) The number of words in the string. \n\n2) The number of unique words in the string (this means the most common word was not counted twice).\n\nYou will see how this looks in the next exercise. But for now, just consider a string such as \u201cThe\u201d as unique. This means that the output should not indicate that there are two words with the same meaning.\n\n### Solution:This project is divided into three class modules, the first module is dictionary, the dictionary take a string as parameter and print a dictionary object.\n\nThe second module is called nlp, the function takes a string, it split the string, return the unique values in the string and the count how many values in the string\n\n1) input:  input1 = \"Hello, how are you?\"; \n                    1. input2 = \"hi\" output: [('hi', 1)]\n\n2) input:  input2 = \"Hi, how are you\"; \n                    2. output: [('how', 1), ('you', 1)]\n3) input:  input3 = \"the cat sat;\"", "answer": "B: wine press"}

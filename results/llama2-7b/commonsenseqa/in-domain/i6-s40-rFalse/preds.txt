It is my belief that the power of people working together and standing up for what is right is great power. There are heroes all around the globe in places we often don't look for them.  To find the goodness,  look around.  To find it, you'll need a good place.  A place where you can see the horizon line.  With a view of nothing and everything.  Here,  you will find no barriers, no boundaries, no limitations, it's a place of love and openness.  The goodness,  is always around.  It can even be found where you least expect it.  And, it isn't where you would least expect it that is best.  Like the gifts inside a book, it sits on your shelf.  There may be goodness in your neighborhood.  And in the streets of your city. There may be goodness under a bridge, and yes, you'll find it by the fire.  Find the goodness in a heart that wants to make a new start.  Goodness it always around, you just have to find it. That's how you will save all the world

What Is A NLP Engine?<n><n>In the previous lesson, you were introduced to Natural Language Processing. Your first task is to decide what kind of Natural Language Processing software to use. We have already provided a Python function named nlp_texts, which takes in a list of strings and returns a list of dictionaries. Now we are going to see how we can customize that dictionary to hold whatever information we need.<n><n>You will write a function called nlp_words that takes in a string and returns a dictionary. The dictionary will have two key/value pairs that will include:<n><n>1) The number of words in the string. <n><n>2) The number of unique words in the string (this means the most common word was not counted twice).<n><n>You will see how this looks in the next exercise. But for now, just consider a string such as “The” as unique. This means that the output should not indicate that there are two words with the same meaning.<n><n>### Solution:This project is divided into three class modules, the first module is dictionary, the dictionary take a string as parameter and print a dictionary object.<n><n>The second module is called nlp, the function takes a string, it split the string, return the unique values in the string and the count how many values in the string<n><n>1) input:  input1 = "Hello, how are you?"; <n>                    1. input2 = "hi" output: [('hi', 1)]<n><n>2) input:  input2 = "Hi, how are you"; <n>                    2. output: [('how', 1), ('you', 1)]<n>3) input:  input3 = "the cat sat;" <n>

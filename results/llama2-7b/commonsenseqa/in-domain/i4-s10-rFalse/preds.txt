C: $500<n><n>I ran into some problems with my last code submission because I used strings instead of list for my input and output. I decided to reorder my inputs to make them so that they are only two things per row. Once I reorganize my inputs like this, the test case for problem 3 ran with no errors. I think my current problems stem from not using the right structure for my input data. I made sure to use a list for my input and the output was a string. I made a new file called read_csv and a new file called write_csv. I created two lists that were the same size and created a function to append items from the list into a csv. At first, I tried to append the strings to a list and then I just appended the values without any conversion but those both ran into syntax errors. With the function I was able to append values without any extra syntax. The list I added the elements to was named out and I made sure to convert the values so that they were string values before creating the csv. For the sake of writing a csv I made sure to only append values if the value contained an apostrophe in values but because of this my values did not convert properly, so I removed this part of the code. <n><n>```python <n>import csv<n>from csv import writer as csv_writer<n><n>def read_csv_file(path):<n>    with open(path, newline='') as csv_file:<n>        csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file, delimiters=',')<n>        csv_data = list(csv_reader)<n>    return csv_data<n><n>def write_csv(data, out, header):<n>    # data for the row.

The garden has grass, and weeds, and plants, trees, and flowers, and pebbles. Some parts of the garden have grass that is short, the other parts have grass that is long. The pebbles are red, and blue and pale. The trees are many colors. The flowers open during the warm weather, and they close in the winter. The garden can be a lot of work to have. The weeds do not like that, and they put down their roots. They pull out the grass and kill it. They can be tough to get out when they have taken that many roots. It turns yellow in the cool fall. It turns red and orange in the cool autumn.

Choices:  D: thank you C: warrant E: money B: food F: apology G: ride B: food<n>Output: F: apology</code><n><n>***<n><n>## Solution:<n><n>I didn't think about it earlier... <n>I tried to remove all of the possible duplicate answers and then run regex on the string to find which answer matches. I will not share all of my code... <n><n>The idea was to write a function called `GetAnswer` which takes "Input" from the user as follows: `GetAnswer(input)`, this function then will run a simple regex on the supplied content and return the matched content. This will help remove all duplicates and get rid of the case with more than one correct answer.<n><n>The regex I used is: `^ChoiceA|ChoiceB`, this will match choice A or Choice B. The way I used regex is: when a variable that holds an answer A is set, check if the regex has A matched (it shouldn't if A is wrong), if it does, check the next regex match (`ChoiceB`). Now when the second regex match is made, check if the variable is empty, and if the variable is `A` (it should be) then return this variable as the answer.<n><n>I used a simple switch statement to decide if: `A` is chosen, and returns `A` as the answer; or `B` is chosen by running regex, so on either choice the result of `ChoiceA|ChoiceB` is passed to the switch statement which returns the result of the regex.<n><n>This works well, and makes the code readable and understandable, but there is a problem with the first example when I run the regex to find the match, it returns a result: `B`, this means in order for the right answer to be returned the `A` should not have the string `B` as text, since it contains `B`. To solve that I used the `remove(/B/)` regex to remove the substring `B` from the string containing `ChoiceA|Choice`, that way it is possible to match `ChoiceA|Choice` on input `A`.<n><n>Another issue I need to take note of... the cases which have two options for answers can also be solved by passing the two regex to

It is possible some questions can be not a multiple choice (e.g, what color is the water at sea; but if the statements are all multiple choice questions, then it could answer correctly for all with probability = 1.<n><n>Because this program is to learn, questions will be asked and the answers will be saved. To avoid forgetting about what it has learned, after a certain number of tries, the program will automatically save and load. An example in which this happens will be explained below.<n><n>Here is an example of its learning process:<n><n>- The program begins by asking user for a question.<n><n>- User types something that does not match any question type (example: "How tall are you" instead of "What are you"). The user will be told that it does not comply with the "rules" of the program (like in multiple choice questions where it must be answered with A-E), and will also get the following question: "What the problem?"<n><n>- The user types the same incorrect answer, and gets the same message again.<n><n>- The user tries again the same incorrect answer, but this time the program saves these answers (let's say, they are in a dict["wrong"]). In this example it will have "wrong" written once to the dict.<n><n>- Same question (i. e. "How tall are you").<n><n>- The user answers correctly: "What is the problem?" The user replies with: "What is your answer?" and finally the program gives the answer.<n><n>- The program creates an answer and saves them to a list: "correct". Now it knows that "How tall are you?" is a correct question of multiple choices type.<n><n>- The next question is of multiple choice: "What is the color of the sky?". The program gives a few correct answers with the same percentage (so it has a 80% chance to say A, B, C, or D, as example).<n><n>- The user type, let's say, E: "What is the

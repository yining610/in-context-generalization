In the event a new question is requested after the task is written, you can use the `write(new_question: string)` method.\n\n---\n\n## How it works\n\nThe process can be split in three part, from the [docs](http://docs.rs-rustlang.org/cargo/reference/cargo/cargo-build.html)\n\n\n### Build a project\n\nThe documentation page refers to a project, which looks like the following\n\n```bash\n$ ls build\nREADME.md Cargo.toml Cargo.lock Cargo.lock.lock\n```\n\nA project looks like a regular folder containing files. The main goal of this folder is to tell to Rust the name of the dependencies, the location with the libraries the project uses, and finally the version of them.\n\n```toml\n[package]\nname = \"first-rust-project\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nedition = \"2018\"\n\n[lib]\nname = \"my-package\"\ncrate-type = [\"cdr\", \"lib\"]\n\n[dependencies]\n\n```\n\nThe name of the package needs to be defined. A package name usually refers to the project name. The versions use the 2018 edition. In case the project is targeting a different edition it should consider adding `edition = \"2...edition\"`. The library is named `my-package`. The library crate-type (`cdr`, `lib`) tells to lib.rs what type of dependency you're asking for. The version can be provided by the [Cargo Client](https://docs.rust-lang.org/cargotool/reference/cargo-client/).\n\n\n### Rust Compilation\n\nThe `cargo build` can be used to build the project. This will create three types of files:\n\n* `cargo-toml`\n* `lib.rs`\n* `lib/rust_analyzer.rs`\n\n`cargo-toml`: This file contains the cargo metadata. There are several variables that are used\n\n* `[package]`\n    * `name`: The package name", "answer": "A: television"}

{"text": "Write a paragraph and answer the question.\nInput:Are vegetarians generally wealthier than people who are not?\n\n\n### Response\nVegetarians consume lots of plants, most of which contain fewer calories than animal products, so naturally they are more likely to be wealthier. However, if not vegetarians are health conscious they tend to eat more vegetables even if they occasionally eat meat.\n\n### Response \nSome animals take time away from eating as well, so they're actually less healthy than plant based diets. Not vegetarians have an imbalance of nutrients because fruits and vegetables don't contain the full range of the nutrients needed. People that are not vegetarians get more nutritious food since they are not eating as much plant materials. \n\n\n### Instructuon: \nPlease review the following and reply to the questions.\n\n### Please review the following: (this is from instructor)\nWrite a paragraph where you explain whether or not you think that plant based diets are better than animal based ones.

{"text": "I was a middle school teacher for many years and I taught many of my students how to organize their work and bind their work and turn it in on time for grading. This task is from a parent to a child that is in school with them. The parent needs to know where to locate their child's school work, so they can encourage their child to be responsible and hand in their work on time. I would tell them that the binders and any work that is not in the binder should be stored in a backpack with the binder being in the book sack. I would tell the parent to check the binder every evening to see if there is any missing homework assignments and encourage their child to take the work out of the binder at the end of every school day and put it back in when the child is finished with it so the child is always aware of where the work is physically stored. It is important that the child turn it in and not just store it in their backpack. This is a good way to teach the child about responsibility for their items and how to handle their work.

{"text": "I think that the choices represent situations that we are likely to find ourselves in and are presented as questions that our brain and our heart will answer.\n\nIt reminds me of The Infinite Game by Simon Sinek and how important questions can be to ask. I think that the questions are a reminder that life itself is an incredible journey and how we view those experiences ultimately affect how we live and how we interact with other people.\n\nFor example, if you ask yourself if you are married to your spouse and you decide that you are probably in a rift, then you are more likely to get to a point where you can begin to work at healing the rift.\n\nIf we live with a negative attitude, we are more likely to experience negative feelings about our world. Sometimes, we should ask ourselves simple but hard questions, and the answers to those questions often direct us to have better outcomes and better relationships with those around us.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, we should consider our feelings. We often make choices based on our emotional feelings.

{"text": "If I was Bob or Boris, I would feel annoyed about this. (Bob or Boris is annoyed= Bob or Boris are annoyed). It was probably annoying because the line was fast but the children in front were loud.(or Bob or Boris found it annoying because the line in front of them was fast but the children on front were loud). This is because this would not likely make them want to come back or would not likely make them happy or content. This is because the line in front is moving but the children are annoying as a result so this was unlikely to make them happy. \n\n### Input(Asking if person has ever been to a place)\nThe word ever is an adverb. Ever is synonymous with always or constantly because the definition of ever is for all time and forever as shown by it meaning as long as one lives.  Here ever is used to ask if a place has been previously visited. This means that person has already visited this place.  If the sentence is used the question should be \" have you ever gone to a place?\" and the question should be answered as \"yes\" or \"no\".\n\n\n### Input1(Asking if a place is open)\nIs it open? The phrase \"is it open\" is asking if something is open. It asks if something is open now. It indicates that if the person is asking this question, they are not asking if the place is open or wasn't open in the past. It also means that the person asking is asking if the place is currently open. \n\n##Input2:( Acknowledging a person)\n\nHi Bob, How are you? Bob is a common name but the speaker is using the name Bob to reference the name of someone the speaker knows. This is because it is a more polite way to reference someone by name. Another way of acknowledging a person is to be formal and greet them with good morning or afternoon etc. \n\n##Asking if a person is feeling okay\nIf a person has a cough, or is sneezing or has a runny nose, a person would not likely feel good. The reason is likely that they were sick. This example shows that if a person has a cold, they would not feel good and would likely not feel like eating.\n\n##Ask if a person is going to do something(example: are you", "answer": "B: being annoyed"}

{"text": "You can also see zebra at the zoo where you can also see polar bears and lions. And you can also see horses and snakes in the country where they are not used much. And there is birds where you can find giraffes, and many animals there like elephant and moose, and you can also see rabbits and bison at a farm in the countryside. You can also see many animals in the zoo but no tigers.\n\nThe main thing to focus on is the fact that you just need to say no answer. I used a string that took a list of the choices and separated them into a new string.\n\nInput: Where can you find bees in the country? Choices:  B: farms A: suburbs C: garden D: downtown E: airplanes\n\n### Response : I saw bee in the countrysides where I was working but I rarely see it in the city where I live. They don't seem to like concrete because I never seem to see any around most houses.\n\nThe main idea is that you take the choices and put them into one string and then send that string to a text function that will have another string that you will use later.\n\nMy solution was to use:\n`choices = [choices for choices in range(4, 6, 1)]`\n\nI did have a problem with it because you didn't need the 2nd digit to actually separate the options so I had to remove one of them, but other than that the question was fairly easy.", "answer": "A: zoo"}

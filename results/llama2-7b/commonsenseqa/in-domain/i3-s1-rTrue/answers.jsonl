{"text": "1.\"Google Maps\" and other highway and street gps services have replaced what? This clue tells us that the answer will be a location that someone is often in and where one finds oneself using the navigation service. \n2. These clues rule out the obvious answer choice of \"Atlases\". \n3. By process of elimination, the correct answer will be \n\"Countryside\". \"Countryside\" is an area of a large group of farms, and can be an area of fields or undeveloped land that one can get lost in.\n4. Therefore, the answer in this question is C: countrysides\nSo the final answer \n#7\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question based on the input provided\n\nInput: The last time you had an electric shock did you experience:\n \na. Showering\n \nb. Water to cool off your body\n \nc. Ice\n \nd. Fire\n \ne. An open flame\n \nOutput:\nThe clues in the prompt are: \"The last time you had an.... electrical shock, did you experience.... Showering,... to cool off your body,... Ice,... Fire,... An open flame\"\nLet's consider the possible choices listed in the question:\na. \"Last time you had a cold shower\" (Showering).  \"Cool off\" does not seem to refer to the literal meaning of cooling off one's body (being in an icy situation) but more metaphorically, as in the metaphorical expression \"cool off\", the expression which means \"calm down\" in this context means \"cool off your body\". Therefore, the answer to this question is (b).\nb. \"Water to cool off your body\" (Showering)\nc. \"Fire,... An open flames\" (Fire)\nd. \"Showering,... to cool.....\" (Showering, to cool off your body)\ne. \"Last time you.. showering.. cool.. to cool.. your body..\" (Showering,....... )\n\nSo the final answer will be:\nC. \"Ice,... Fire,... \"\nSo the final answer here is\n\n#6\n\n### Instructions:", "answer": "D: atlas"}
{"text": "1) Beginning with the most obvious answer, let's look at \"carpet\" (B). By definition, carpets aren't associated with food or leftovers.\n2) Next is \"refrigerator\" (C). Yes, this is a place to store leftovers, but it is not the only place.\n3) Now, \"breadbox\" (D). This could potentially store forgotten leftovers, though a breadbox is most often just for bread.\n4) \"Fridge\" (E). This word is a common, acceptable term for a refrigerator, so there is a chance it could be what is being referred to.\n5) Therefore, the answer must be either \"coach\" (E) or \"fridge\" (E).\n6) If we investigate further, the word \"coach\" (A) could potentially refer to a person who gives others advice. If this is what is meant, none of the remaining options makes sense; \"breadbox\" would not be used to store advice, \"refrigerator,\" \"fridge,\" or \"forgotten\" is not an acceptable word for giving advice, and \"back of my\" seems redundant and unnecessary if it is describing a person. \n7) This leaves us with \"fridge\" (A). There are many ways to describe where the mold-covered food was, so it is most reasonable that \"fridge\" is describing a refrigerator. \n8) Therefore, the answer is \"fridge.\"\nSo the final answer that I would choose if this was an actual test is D: fridge\nbut remember, you are to make your choice and then type that choice into each square of choices in order to see which answer is the same as yours\nNow, there is no such thing as a test, where only the first answer you type on the multiple choice question is the correct one.\nI wanted you to have that experience to ensure that you understand the thinking process.", "answer": "B: refrigerator"}
{"text": "1\"Before getting a divorce\" is the key detail of the question. Therefore, we may want to remove choices that are not relevant to a divorce. \"Harder\" (B) is not relevant because it is an emotional state rather than a place. \"Anguish\" (C) is also not relevant, as it is a description of one who feels anguish.\n2. \"Bitterness\" (D) is not the answer because it is a descriptor, not a place. \"Tears\" (E) is not the answer as it is not associated with a divorce.\n3. Options \"Sadness\" (A) and \"Divorce\" (E) could possibly be the correct answer, but we need to be sure.\n4. To gain clarity on this question, let's draw a Venn diagram of the possible locations that a person could go to before getting a divorce and the feelings that they would experience. \n5. The answer then is Option A: Before getting a divorce, a wife could feel \"sadness\" and it would likely be felt before she does the divorce.\n6. Therefore, the answer to this question is A: Sadness.\nSo the final and correct answer is A: Sadness\n\nInput: What is used when we are talking about two things? Choices: 1. \"Both\" A: pronoun B: conjunction C: noun D: possessive E: preposition F: adjective\n2. Both conjunction and pronoun are correct answers. This is a difficult question for beginners, but with some practice, you should do fine.\nOutput: 1.\"What is used when we are speaking about two things?\"\n2. The correct answer is \"conjunction\", which is the most direct translation of the Chinese character \u4e24.\n3. \"Both\" (A) is a noun, which is the wrong choice. \"Possessive\" (D) is also wrong.\n4. \"Noun\" (E) is wrong because when we talk about pronouns in English, we don't normally say \"one noun\". \"Preposition\" (F) is wrong since we are talking about a noun rather than a preposition.\n5. \"Adjective\" (C) is wrong because an adjective is not used for two things.", "answer": "C: bitterness"}
{"text": "1) The question is a classic riddle in disguise that reveals itself once you take the time to identify the two terms being implied within it.\n2) Let's break down the riddle to understand the implications for each answer.\n3) Choice A: Low lands. This is not the right answer because the man is not in a low land, he is a marsh, which is higher than a low land.\n4) Choice B: New York. This also not the right answer because although the man says he is from New York, he is actually speaking in Cajun, which suggests he is not from New York at all.\n5) Choice C: Forest. This is not the correct answer because this is just a forest and not an Everglades.\n6) Choice D: Louisiana. This is an incorrect answer because the man is speaking in Cajun not French, which is the primary language in Louisiana. \n7) Choice E: Everglades. This is a possible answer but not the correct one. A Cajun man does not live here, nor would a New Yorker.\n8) The correct answer is C: Forest.\nSo the final answe is C: forest", "answer": "D: louisiana"}
{"text": "1.\"Feeling\" is a subjective experience that isn't necessarily caused by eating. A full stomach (A), gaining weight (C), and sickness (E) would result from eating.\n2. A full stomoch (A), would be an indication that you have finished eating, and therefore, you would no longer tend to get full.\n3. Getting full (B) is an indication that you are getting close to finished eating, and are beginning to feel full. It often precedes the fullness that comes after.\n4. Gaining weight (C) is an indication of you eating enough to potentially contribute to gaining weight.\n5. Sickness (E) is an illness resulting from eating poor food. Poor food is often a contributor to poor nutrition, which can result in sickness.\n6. Finally, satisfaction (D) is the feeling of fulfillment and happiness when you complete a task. This is not a common feeling resulting from eating and is usually found in the realm of completing a difficult assignment, finding love, or making an important purchase.\nSo the final answers are A: full stomoch\n\nInput: Where would you find the smallest object? Choices: 1)A: On a pencil 2)B: In a book 3)C: On a tree 4)D: Up a stool 5)E: In the air \nOutput:1. Let's first eliminate options that aren't relevant to finding tiny objects. For example, option D: \u201cUp a stool,\u201d is a descriptive noun that doesn't describe an object, while also not being small in size, and option E: \u201cIn the air,\u201d is not realistically on or in anything because it does not need a location to exist. \n2. Moving on, option A: \u201cOn a pencil\u201d isn't relevant because a pencil is simply a writing tool and doesn't actually give a sense of a smaller object. Likewise, option B: \u201cIn a book,\u201d doesn't give a sense of a tiny object either, since books are generally larger objects that include pages of text. \n3. That leaves only four options left. Option C: \u201cOn a tree,\u201d is not too far away in size from your average tree.", "answer": "B: getting full"}
{"text": "1) Let's begin by understanding what each term means.\n2) \"Accelerator\" refers to throttle in a vehicle which controls how fast the vehicle goes.\n3) \"Foot pedals controlled the steer\" means that pedals on the floor controlled the steering.\n4) \"Small what?\" is confusing because it's unclear what the context is. Is this a question about a small what? Or is it referencing the throttle and pedals?\n5) Option A: \"Car\" is the most obvious answer.\n6) Option B: \"Fuel system\" is used in cars, but not in this setting.\n7) Option C: \"Accelerate\" is also not a good fit because the accelerator controls the throttle, not the speed at which the car is going.\n8) Option D: \"Boat\" could potentially be an answer because boats have throttles and steering in some form or another, but not exactly in the same way as this question mentions.\n9) Option E: \"Airplane\" could be the answer here, but it's not the obvious one. Airplanes have throttles and some form of steering, but not the ones that are in question.\nTherefore, the answer is D: Boat.\nSo the final answer is D: Boat\n\nInput: Where would you find a plumber? Choices: 1)  A: bathroom 2)  B: shower 3)  C: living room, bedroom, kitchen, bathroom 4)  D: home depot \nOutput: 1)\"Where would you find a plumbing?\" is asking where the plumber would be. The choice that will fit best is either the shower or the bedroom, which are the places that you can actually find a plumber, depending on the circumstance. \n2) \"A plumber.\" is too specific so it can be excluded as a valid answer. \n3) \"Living room, bedroom, and kitchen.\" is not an appropriate answer as there wouldn't be a plumber in any of these areas. \n4) \"Home depot\" is a store and not an appropriate place to find a plumber. A plumber cannot be found in a store for selling hardware products.\nTherefore, choice B: shower", "answer": "E: airplane"}
{"text": "1) To see why a location is being driven for snakes, lets understand what the question is asking and consider the choices together as a group. A location isn't being carried because they are snakes, however a location is being driven which is different than being carried.\n2) Begin by eliminating the answers that aren't locations. \"Ditch\" (B) and \"Ditch\" (C) are places a snake would not be because of how dangerous it is. They only occur in water or on the sides of the road respectively. \"North America\" (D) is also not a place because it only refers to a geographic area, not a specific location. \"Pet Shops\" (E) and \"Outdoors\" (E) are related but do not refer to specific locations of snakes.\n3) This leaves us with \"Shop\" (A) as the only remaining choice that is a location. For snakes that would be carried to a location other than their natural habitat, shops would be the most likely places. \n4) Finally, it can thus be concluded that \"Shop\" (C) is the answer as it is a location that would have to carry snakes other than their natural habitat. \nSo the final answer given by the system is A: shop\n\nInput:If someone is going to give a lecture on birds in flight and are not going to do it in their living room, what might they be doing it in?

{"text": "1 Begin by eliminating any unimportant options, such as \"subdivision\" (B) since it could be on a street, in a neighborhood, or a suburb. When we're talking about suburbs, it can't be a neighborhood since a suburb surrounds it.\n2. Similarly, \"subdivision\" is a property style and \"street\" is a location. Both are not what the question asked for and so eliminating them.\n3. Now we're left with the following: where would you find gates and/or other barriers that would block people from entering a house?\n4. The first of the available options is \"neighborhood\" (A), which describes a residential area where homes are close together. This is not the best answer.\n5. Next, look at \"city\" (D), which has an abundance of people and traffic. Traffic has the potential to block people from entering someone's home, which is why the home is gated off. A city also could have gate- and barrier-blocking fences and walls, but they would be outnumbered by the many houses in a neighborhood, not isolated to a specific location. Furthermore, city life can be stressful and overwhelming, so a person might not enjoy it much. This type of life cannot be appealing to someone who only wanted to live in a gated-off location.\n6. Option \"Suburb\" (E) is a residential area that has homes far apart from each other in relation to their surrounding neighbors. These suburbs frequently contain fences and walls that could serve to block any traffic and pedestrians from entering a home.\n7. Option \"Street\" (E) can exist in a neighborhood as a small and/or narrow road. Its location in relation to a home is not significant as to whether a home would be gated off. Neighborhoods can have both narrow and wide roads.\n8. Therefore, the best answer is \"suburb\" (E).\nSo the final answer could be A: Suburb\n\n*Input:  Are they using the term \"dream\" to describe the thing they are imagining or a positive emotion?

After his vasectomy, his semen is \"also what?\" 2) After understanding more about the nature of the question, let's try to analyze the different options. \"Clear\" (E), \"Free flowing\" (D), and \"Thin\" (C) are outright incorrect. The options are asking about a specific change after Mark's vasectomy, not a general description of semen after vasectomies. The options are also not \"also\", so \"clearly\" or \"freely\", but \"also what\". 3) There is only one choice left, which is \"blank\", which makes sense because semen might be thick for a long time and then suddenly become blank or sparse, which is the opposite of thick semen.\n4) Therefore, the correct answer is blank. \nSo the final answer his blank", "answer": "D: clear"}
{"text": "1)Begin by analyzing what the question is asking: \"sitting too close while watching TV can lead to what kind of pain?\" The answer is pain.\n2)Then take a closer look at the options: \"Brain problems\"  can be a symptom that is caused by sitting too close to the TV.\n\"Laziness\" can be a symptom caused by sitting too close.\n\"Headache\" can be a symptoms caused by sitting too close, but may not be solely caused by it.\n\"Getting fat\" cannot be caused by sitting too close; there is no correlation between the two.\n\"Laughter\" can be a symptomen that may occur after sitting too close. \n3)After we've dissected the options, the answer is \"Headache\" and is the most likely.\nSo the final Answer is A:Headache\n\nInput: What do you need to create the sound of water in a video? Choices: 1. A: The sound of water coming out of a faucet 2. B: A fountain 3. C: An ocean 4. D: A sink 5. E: The sound of a river\nOutput: 1.) Begin by understanding what the answer is asking: \"What do you need to create a sound of water?\" The question itself is asking for a necessary item.\n2.) Next, eliminate unnecesary options: \"Ocean\" (B) is unnecessary because it's not about water that is used in video creation. \"River\" (E) is also unnecessary because it would also be using a sound that is created from the water.\n3.) Lastly, figure out the answer: \"Sound of a faucet\" (C) sounds like a faucet and \"is used to bring water to a video\".\nThe question asks \"what do you need to create it\", so the answer is \"sound of a faucet\".\nSo the final answer 1 A:Sound of a faucets\n\nInput: What has a higher value than what the first digit of any number is?

{"text": "1) The options are \"break line\", \"Broken bones\", \"broken legs\", \"chapped lips\" and \"healthy body\". Since all the options describe the end of a skiing season but only 2 options describe negative effects, the answer must be healthy body and none broken.\n2) Healthy body can result from any season of successful skiing except chapped lips, since broken legs and chapped lips refer to injuries which prevent skiing and not skiing success.\n43) \"finish line\" refers to the place where a race ends, so it can't be the result if \"a season of successful skiing\".\n44) \"Broken bones\" and \"Broken legs\" refer to skiing injuries in general but not necessarily in a skiing season. Also these two can be the result if there are some skiing accidents, but they can't occur in the season of success which is mentioned to be perfect in the question.\n45) \"Chapped lips\" is the only negative effect among all the given options, so the answer can only be \"Chapped lips\".\nSo the final answer should be C: broken legs", "answer": "E: healthy body"}

The meaning of hands on is that an individual is physically holding an object to demonstrate its function.\n6. Therefore, the phrase \"hands on\" must be added to the sentence to be true.\n7. This suggests that the phrase, the person gave a good hands-on demonstration of how to do the work, would be the correct answer.\n8. In conclusion, the phrase the person gave a good \"hands-on\" demonstration of how to perform the work would be the correct answer to this question.\n\nSo the final answer will be A: demonstration\n\nInput: Where would I find the first digit if I gave it? Choices:  -A: none of these because they are all about the same in size and the only digit that might be the first would have to be chosen -B: any place C: ink D: color E: paper\nOutput: 1: This is a trick question, because the first digit of a place can't be located because it is the number that determines a certain location so, there would not be a first number for it. 2: If I gave a number out of the options and had to give the place (A) where the first number would be found.

A headache is not a likely thing for a grumpy person to have. Headaches are not related to being displeased, and grumpy people can often be in high spirits or have fun. \n4.Option B: to understand themselves. A difficult question. It could be interpreted either way, but there is no reason to believe that they would understand themselves as displeased.\n5.Option C: Compliments. A grumpy person is most likely to be irritable, which is the opposite of being complimented. This is more likely to make them unhappy rather than understanding themselves.\n6.Option D: own house. Grumpiness is often attributed to people who live alone or don't have a good social life. This could be interpreted as an improvement for grumpiness, but the question is still about what a grumpy person is likely to have, not what a person is likely to be after having a grumpy state.\n7.Finally, option E: happiness. To be grumpy is to be upset, unhappy, or displeased in some way. Being happy is the opposite of this. Happiness can help grumpiness, but it does not necessarily come with grumpiness unless the specific scenario is included.\nSo the final answers are D: Own house and E: happiness", "answer": "A: headache"}

The description of a \"lodge\" suggests a location that is outside, like a cabin or a house. \"Eastern United States\" (C) is also not the best choice because this region has many cities and towns and is more of a geographical area than a single place to find a toll road. \n\n2b)\"Connecticut\" (D) does not have any toll roads. \"Arizona\" (E) is not the location as it does not fit the description of a place that includes roads.\n\n2c)\"Eastern United States\" doesn't sound right because the eastern United States includes many cities and towns and a toll road could be in any of them.\n\n3) This eliminates option E, \"Arizona,\" which was found to be in error after review.\n\n4) This leaves us with options A \"New Jersey\" and D \"Connecticut.\" \n\n5) We eliminate A \"New Jersey\" because it is not the location. \n\n6) The correct answer is D \"Connecticut.\"\n\nSo the final answer of choice D is Connecticut. \n\nOutput:  Input: Find two examples of when someone is being sarcastic.

{"text": "1.\"Let me begin by introducing my family members.\" begins the sentence and sets the tone of this statement. The statement's intent is to convey that one experiences stress during a meeting. Choice A appears from this that it describes the state of the person being depressed following the meeting. Choice A is wrong because stress is a reaction to meeting someone. The stress is not their experience but the reaction to the meeting. \n2. Similarly, Choice B seems like it fits in describing stress during a meeting. But it is not the experience, rather it can be an aftermath feeling.\n3. Choices C and D are out of the question as the questions do not ask about feelings. They ask for the person's experience during the meeting when meeting someone.\nSo the final answers are: A: stress/anxiousness\n\nOutput: 1.\u201cMy friend and I like to go to the movies.\u201d means \u201cMy friend and I enjoy going to the movies\u201d. The first sentence starts to describe their liking for the movies.\n2. \u201cMy brother and I like to go and sit under the hot sun in the hot summers.\u201d implies that their liking is conditional, it is affected by external factors.\n3. \u201cRats eat cheese.\u201d means that rats, like other rodents, like cheese. The first sentence starts to set the context, while the second sentence is factual.\n4. \u201cDogs eat grass.\u201d has more literal context which implies that dogs are the exception rather than the norm but eating grass when needed.\n5. \u201cA bear usually eats fish.\u201d means that the sentence is factual rather than personal preference. The first sentence doesn\u2019t add any new information.\n6. \u201cSheep eat grass.\u201d means that they are the norm, the second sentence adds some context to the first sentence.\n\nInput:How can I know that this sentence describes what a dog doesn't like?Choices:  A: that the sentence doesn't describe a dog B: I don't know C: you can look at it D: yes, it's true E: it's true and it's obvious\nOutput: 1-What we can deduce from these two sentences:\n\u201cHe ate the apple, so what else do you expect me to do.\u201d and \u201cIf he ate the apple, I had to eat the apple.\u201d,", "answer": "D: being bored"}
{"text": "1) Let's begin with each answer choice, examining whether the location could be appropriate for having a book on hand while reading it.\n2) Option A: Closet. We can dismiss this option because, in a closet, people would be wearing clothes, not books. Moreover, we wouldn't use the closet for reading either.\n3) Option B: Closed congress. This option is also inappropriate because the Library of Congress is in the United States government, and book reading is a more casual activity.\n4) Option C: School classroom. At school the books are typically in classrooms. However, in a classroom setting, books themselves would be part of the environment; they aren't usually on hand for reading.\n5) Option E: Bed. We can dismiss this answer because a bed is not a suitable place for reading because one will not often need to refer to the book while reading.\n6) Left with option D: Desk. A desk is a much more suitable answer choice because books can remain at a desk for easy access while reading and one could refer to them along the way.\n7) Thus, the answer is Option D: Desk.\nSo the final answers are D: desk.", "answer": "E: desk"}

This word means that someone is hesitant or unwilling to do something.\n5) Choice C: \"Unable\". This word means that you can't do something.\n6) Choice D: \"Cannot do\". This is also close to the answer, but \"cannot do\" seems better as it has less ambiguity compared to the more casual \"can't do\".\n7) Choice E: \"Impossibility\".

{"text": "1, It seems the question may be asking if someone who gets angry after drinking (drunks) is likely to engage in violence. \n2, Let's break down the answer choices to determine further information.\n3, The choice of words is interesting. \"gets angry\" suggests that the drunks are angry at some point after drinking, and not during or immediately prior to the drinking. This would make \"drunks\" a noun (such as plural form of Drunk or a type of person), and the question could ask about the type of behavior one might exhibit if they were drunks, instead of a particular person. \n4, \"fellow drunks\" could be a reference to other types of drunks, not a specific person that the person in question is likely to engage with in these actions. Perhaps they are referring to the actions that another drunk (who is angered also) would exhibit. However, this answer choice isn't the best because it doesn't answer the question directly and might be too vague to understand clearly.\n5. Choices \"violence\" (A), \"vomiting\" (D), and \"lower standards\" (E) are all specific actions or behaviors in their own right. However, for this question, the focus is on the behavior and activity of the drunks after they get angry. The question seems to want to know what type of behavior the drunks would exhibit after getting angry due to drinking.\n6, Violence can be linked to anger. However, there may be more than one reason why violence is carried out, such as to protect self or others.\n7, Vomiting could be related to drinking if one is vomiting from excessive drinking, or perhaps the person getting angrier was not actually vomiting but perhaps caused the person to vomit. \n8, Lastly, lower standards may be the best answer. This is likely because alcohol consumption lowers the standards of behavior, so the person may engage in unacceptable behavior or engage in illegal activities.\n9, Therefore the best answer is \"lowered standards\".", "answer": "A: violence"}
{"text": "1. Cats get into trouble when they are ripping apart things because if a cat is breaking things, trouble may happen.

Choices:  C: Both  B: False  A: True E: None of the above D: Neither \nOutput: 1) A shovel is a tool used to help the gardener dig the ground, as it has a flat edge that helps dig in the soil.\n2) When a gardener digs the ground, they are using a shovel to do it, so shovels can help a gardener do that. \n3) This is a factually true statement. 4) Choice D, \"Neither \", cannot be the answer choice because \"neither \" and \"either \" mean the opposite of the answer choice. By using \"neither \", you are choosing not to answer whether it is both true or false, hence the answer is A: True.\nSo the final answaer is A: True", "answer": "D: trouble"}

Let us eliminate the options that are directly related to spirituality. \"Pay attention\" (D) is an internal action, not an occurrence. \"Watch soap operas\" (E) is an activity, so isn't relevant. \n3. We can now eliminate \"go to church\" (B) because if \"you do what\" that involves going to church, then the testimonies wouldn't be about changing lives. \n4. \"Appear in court\" (C) is correct because to appear in court, there must be a testimony, it must be about the power of spirituality in changing lives, and it must happen after you do what.\nSo the final answers is C: Appear in Court", "answer": "A: go to church"}
{"text": "1) The question is asking about where you would put a folding chair.\n2) Options A: Roof, C: School, D: Closet are not possible answers because they are places where you wouldn't expect to find a folding chair. They are places of business and not residential.\n3) Option B: Beach is an outdoor location, but it doesn't have any large doors in the house, so you wouldn't put a folding chair there.\n4) The most likely location is the garage. It is the most likely location to find a folding seat, and you may not have a use for it because if you don't plan to use it, a folding chair is a convenient way to keep space for future use. 5) Since the garage is the only remaining option, the best possible answer is E: Garage.\nSo the final answers is E: garage\n\nInput: Where would a person find paper plates?

{"text": "1) Begin by examining each choice.\n2) A) Living room. A living room would not contain any outside space, so this is not the answer.\n3) B) Dog park. A dog park, like any other outdoor space, may contain some indoor space, but the main difference here is that they are outdoors and thus do not conform with the \"stayed strictly indoors\" rule.\n4) C) Basket. The dog would not consider a basket to be space. While it may contain enough room for the dog to move around, it still wouldn't be seen as space.\n5) D) Small apartment. A small apartment would still be considered an indoors space, which does not align with the question.\n6) E) Big house. A big house would still contain indoors space, so it doesn't fit the criteria.\n7) The correct answer is therefore letter B: A dog park.\nSo the final correct answer is B: dog park\n\nInput: What would a baby find at a baby store?

{"text": "1.\"Pretty of food\" is an idiom which translates into \"plenty of food.\"\n2. The idiom in the question provides context for the other answers. \"Big game\" refers to a competitive event with many spectators.\n3. This \"big game\" indicates the event will have food.\n4. The answer can be one of five options (A-E), each of which has a piece of furniture involved.\n5. Let's eliminate two of the options, starting with \"Friend's house\" (B). This means a friend's house is involved but we already know what kind of furniture is available in a house (table, space shuttle). \n6. Continuing, the statement \"Pretty of food\" (idiom) indicates the food should be presented in an outdoor setting. If the \"pretty of food\" is inside a house, the food isn't presented well, which is inconsistent with the meaning of the idiom. \n7. That leaves us with the remaining three responses \"Picnic\" (A), \"Table\" (C), and \"Fairgrounds\" (E). These all could be the locations of the \"pretty of\" food, as they all have outdoor sections suitable for \"pretty of food.\" \n8. Compare the locations that would be suitable for \"pretty food\" with the other answers. The idiom indicates that \"Pretty food\" requires a picnic-like setting, where you're sitting outside away from a table and sharing food with others.\n9. Therefore, the correct answer is C: \"Pretty food\" would be prepared on a table, and that food might be consumed outside at a picnic.\nSo the final answers are A: Picnic and C: Table\n\nInput: What would it take to learn to type without mistakes?

{"text": "1) The key here is the choice of sushi. Sushi is a Japanese cuisine, indicating that Sam is in Japan.\n2) France is another country connected to sushi. It is a nation where sushi is popular, therefore Sam could be in France. \n3) The fact that the \"fish market\" (C) is connected to sushi is another clue. Fishmongers are the ones who sell seafood in the market, indicating that Sam is not at sea but working with fish. As it is France, this could either be directly at the fish market or at an establishment that sells fish, such as a sushi restaurant. \n4) The fish market can be the answer, but it's not the most direct one. One doesn't normally go to a fish market to have fish as sushi. Sam might be at a fish market to sell fish, but this is not the most likely event. \n5) Therefore we can eliminate the fish market (C) and focus on the remaining choices. France is eliminated because Sam was clearly not there and Japan is too direct of a choice because it's obvious that Sam is in Japan if sushi is involved. This leaves only two options, \"Atlantic Ocean\" (D) and Paris (E), both of which can be considered correct. \n6) In the end, the clue about \"blowfish\" (E) was irrelevant to the answer choice. \n7) Therefore the correct answer is E because Sam was \"in Europe\" (E): Paris which is in France, which is in Europe.\nSo the final answers is E: Paris,France\n\nInput: I'd like to rent a yacht for my next cruise.

{"text": "1) When a person is looking to find people sitting in a chair and listening to a religious speech, they are likely looking in a place of worship. \n2) Let's start with the first option, \"Auditorium\":  this would not be the desired location since it likely consists of other attendees who are also sitting and listening to a religious sermon. \n3) The second option, \"office\": could also work for this situation. While not necessary to be the primary location for this specific activity, the office could still potentially host an individual who is sitting in a chair and listen to preaching. \n4) Next, consider the church. A \"church\" provides an ideal location for this scenario. Attendance in a church is usually composed of members who are sitting in chairs and listening to a religious message. \n5) The synagogue is also another option that could be included. Similar to churches, a synagogue is an ideal place for this scenario to take place. The congregation members often use a chair and listen to a religious sermon in the synagogue. \n6) Lastly, a \"confession\" is a method of worship which does not involve sitting in a chair or listening to a speech. In this case, people in confessions are often on their knees praying instead of sitting down like in a church or synagogue. 7) Therefor, the correct answer is C: synagogue.\n \nSo the final answer from that Input is C: synagogues", "answer": "C: synagogue"}

Choice D: Go to jail is another possible consequence of perjury. It is possible to go to jail for lying in a court of law, however this is an extreme outcome of lying in general, not necessarily associated with perjury specifically. \n5. Lastly, we can determine that Choice E: Tension could potentially be a repercussion of perjury. This is because perjury is often associated with significant social pressure and scrutiny, which could lead to emotional distress. \nTherefore, the answer is D: Go to jai\nSo the final answer id D: go to jaille\n\nInput: A snake can't move from one place to another if they can't________. Choices:  A. make decisions B. leave C. see D. be scared E: move\nOutput:1. Answer Choices (A B C and D are invalid). Thus, the correct answer is E: move\n2. The options that are invalid choices are: (A) because it doesn't make logical sense for a snake to be unable to make a decision in order to move. (B) because it doesn' t make logical sense for a creature to be unable to leave their place of residence in order to move. This also contradicts the fact that (C) it does make logical sense for a particular object/creature to be unable to be scared in order to move, (D) it makes logical sense for a sssssssnake(s) to be unable to see in order to move(see?).\nSo the final answer will be E: Movement\n\nInput: Who might need to study for a big test?

Furthermore, \"Met\" (E) is likely a mistake as it would be unlikely for a kid to go to school when they are not going to play.\n3. Next, we look at \"sit\" (C), but the word \"play\" is not mentioned, so we can eliminate this.\n4. The correct answer is \"prepare\" (A). A kid and a kid friend would likely \"prepare\" for gameplay before going outside to have fun.\nSo the final correct answer is A: prepare\n\nInput:Who can find many different things that a baby usually needs that a toddler doesn't need? Choices:  \"Who\" can: A: baby B: both C: both D: toddler E: both\nOutput: 1: Before going on to the answer choices, let's understand the definition of these terms because there is some confusion. \n2. The correct answer from the instructions is 'Who can find many different...': let's find the answer in this context.\n3. The answer is \"baby\". A baby needs many different things that a toddler does not need. For example, a baby needs to be spoon-fed, whereas a toddler can eat on their own. A baby cannot walk, but a toddler can. These are just a few examples of different behaviors a baby exhibits that a toddler will not. \n4. Since we have established that the answer is the baby, let's examine the remaining options. \"Both\" (C) is incorrect because both a baby and a toddler can find the same things that they each need. \"Both\" cannot find many things that they don't need, hence the word \"usually\".\n5. Both \"B\" (D) and E\" (E) are incorrect because there are no objects that can be used to find many different things that babies and toddlers need. \n6.

While it is true that some people in the world play soccer in Mexico, this again isn't the best option since it doesn't quite fit the description of being outside.\n4. Choose (C): Town. Towns are not soccer fields, so this answer is a miss.\n5. Choose (D): Outside. Outside is a good option, but it's unclear whether or not soccer is explicitly being played in this location.

Since the only time you lose consciousness is when you are unconscious one can rule out the other three answers.\n\n5) One may die after falling down (once they landed on their feet in this case) and not during sky diving.\n6) We can rule out Coma since one can only get a coma when unconscious and not after falling out of the sky.\n\n7) We can rule out Injury. Since one can only get injuries when falling down and not in the sky diving.\n8) Therefore the answer is F: falling down. \n9) The question also suggests that they landed on their heads so it means he was dying when he saw those pink birds.\n10) There's no reason to consider option C as well; it was mentioned in choice F which already explains that they died by hitting their head on the landing.\nSo the final answers is F: falling down\n\n\ninput: A thief enters a bank using the doorbell on what?

{"text": "1.\"If you did well on a test, you might get A as a school grade, but that isn't what the question is asking for.\"\n2. It's possible this question has to do with receiving a letter grade on a test, but it is also possible the question is asking about something else. Therefore, let's eliminate some of the wrong choices we can easily eliminate:\n3. \"see work\" (B) doesn't seem to relate to this question.\n4. \"practice\" (C) is an activity that could be associated with this question but it isn't the answer we're looking for.\n5. \"homework\" (E) again is an activity closely related to the question, but not the answer.\n6.

The word \"you\" in the question is ambiguous and could be referring to one person or a set of people. If you do something to earn an A as a school grade and you got an A on the test, you would obviously give yourself an A on the next test. That eliminates Choices B and D.\n8. Finally we come to an answer that seems to make sense; Choice E: \"get an A as a what?\" Choice E sounds like the closest answer choice to what we are looking for.

Choices: A: in the city B: in the pet store C: outside D: in the woods E: in the street\nOutput: 1: A dog would more likely be a pet rather than in the wild because: a dog is a pet, not a wild animal. We can therefore rule out A, C and E because dogs are more likely to be a Pet in a person's home or in the wild, rather than a pet in a shopping store and a pet in the wild being an animal from outside the domestic environment, not being a Pet.\n2. Now, we can compare the remaining answers:\n3. B: In the pet store. So while not being in the wild, a Pet in the wild may be considered a street dog. So, this answer could be considered as well. But, the dog could only be a Pet in the pet store, because the animals are in the wild, but pets are in stores. \n4. D \"In the woods\" is a more wild than a pet store.

The nails are not enough to slow Bob down significantly from his normal speed. \n5. \"Town.\" The speed of running in different environments varies, but Bob is not significantly affected by it so this answer is incorrect. Note that it doesn't say \"attractive consistent look\" (C), so just having another environment isn't enough to slow a runner down.

Injuries can cause shock, which can result in death, but that does not indicate anything about the experience of getting colder.\n3. Choices D-E: \"Death and Decay\", and \"Stop Breathing\", cannot be the answers because these are things that occur after someone has experienced injuries.\n4.

Alexa's apartment is her own house, but that isn't where the guitar is being played.  Alexa is most likely using her home garage as a studio or storage closet.  These are less formal and they could potentially be home to a guitar.  But, the problem is that Alexa doesn't just have a garage, she lives in an apartment with roommates and noisy neighbors.  Because her roommates are likely working from home, they are distracted by her and don't think to check.  This means that Alexa may be using her family garage for the guitar but they don't share it very often because they are not aware of her presence.\n3.

The other options, including \"feel angry\" (C), \"drink tea\" (D) and crossing the street (E) do not apply because these actions involve people not money. Money is not a person.\n3.) \"Park\" (E) is not the correct answer because it says money is stolen, not someone. Money isn't a person or the object which would be stolen.\n4.) \"Cross street\" (E) also cannot be the answer as money is not an object, nor people, nor a place.\n5.) \"Feel angry\" (C) cannot be the answer either because anger is a state one can't feel unless there is an object involved, such as money.\n6.) \"Drink tea\" (D), although similar to \"feel angry,\" cannot be the answer either, as money doesn't usually involve tea drinking.\n7.)

{"text": "1) Eliminate all of the options that contain the term \"weak\", (A, B, C, E). \n2. The word, \"forceless\", (D) is almost a synonym for weak, but we'll keep this possibility in mind for analysis.\n3. To analyze the remaining choices, we'll use the definition of each word as a guide.\n4. \"Fragile\" (C) and \"Regular\" (E) refer to state that is easily broken or damaged.\n5. \"Strong\", (B) is stronger than fragile or regular.\n6. \"Flimsy\" (D) is a synonym of fragile and refers to state that is easily torn or damaged.\n7. Comparing this information with our word definitions, we can eliminate all options except for \"Fragile\" and \"Flimsy\".\n8. \"Fragile\", (C) and \"Flims\", (D) are similar words, but \"Flimsy\", (D) is more specific as it suggests \"fragile\" but also \"easy to tear\". This means that this could refer to an old pair of jeans that are more likely to tear because they've gotten old or a paper that is more prone to tearing.\n9. Therefore, the correct answer must be either \"Fragile\" or \"Flimsy\"; if \"Fragile\" doesn't make sense, it must be \"Flimsy.\" \n10. Comparing the information, \"Regular\" (e) would suggest a thing that is common or usual in this case. Because it is not common or usual for glass not to be treated to be extra strong, the answer is not \"Regular\".\n11. Eliminating other common word choices, the only answers that may apply are \"Strong\" and \"Fragile\".\n12. Comparing these, we can see that \"Strong\" is a synonym for \"Strong\" and that \"Fragile\" is a synonym of \"Fragile\" but also implies \"easy to break.\" This means that either one of these would be strong enough to be compared to the word \"Forceless\". \n13. Therefore we can say that the correct answer is either \"strong\" or \"forceless\".", "answer": "B: fragile"}
{"text": "1). Examine each answer choice. \n2). Choice A: surface of earth is disqualified as an answer because the question asks for the absence of grass, which is something that can be found on the surface of earth. \n3). Choice B: rest areas are places you can stop and take a break, but they don't have facilities for people to buy things. The things sold are likely to be related to food, drinks and snacks, which would indicate the need for a place where you can get water. The items sold are limited and probably don't include things that would be suitable for sale at a roadside stand, such as plants or jewellery.\n4). Choice C: supermarket is disqualified as it is not a place where you can find the things needed to sell at a road side stand. Instead, it's a place where people typically buy them.\n5). Choice D: state parks are places where people go to relax, enjoy nature, and explore. They could potentially buy plants, jewelry and other items suitable for sale at a stand, but they aren't a great option compared to other choices due to the time and effort required to organize one there, such as obtaining permits. \n6). Choice E: Garden is disqualified because gardens are typically personal spaces and the plants in them are not suitable for sale at a sales stand. \n7). Choice B: surface of earth has no grass, but it could still have items to sell at a road stand, such as water, snacks, and souvenirs.

The question states that we want somewhere to get water with 17 fluid ounces or more. 17 fluid ounce is equal to one cup, so any place that offers water for less than one cup does not meet the requirements of the question", "answer": "E: garden"}
{"text": "1) First we'll eliminate the answers that can't be on a flight: \"They are on their way to paradice and wanted it to occur here\", and \"They were on their way to Paradice and wanted it to Surprise us\". We can eliminate them because occurring and surprise are two locations, not activities. \n2) \"They checked the weather one last time during the flight\" doesn't make sense because a flight can never be done once. In most instances, the weather can't change as the person is doing the flight. The flight is done once. You can't \"flight one more time\". \n3) That leaves us with B, D, and E. \"They checked the weather on their way to Paradise and wanted it to Change quickly\" makes sense because the weather can change quickly. A flight doesn't stay the same during a flying process. \n4) \"They checked the Weather one more time during the fligth\" makes sense if they knew something was coming. They can check the weather just a little longer to see when it will start, or when it will end. \n5) We can eliminate B, because if they can check the weather 1 more time, why wouldn't they? They also may not want it to change quickly if it is already changing, and if they want to see the whole of the change process. For the same reason, we also eliminate E, which says \"They checked the Weathe one last time during the flie, they were on their a way to paradise and wete it to surprise us.\" \n6) That leaves \"They checked the weather One More Time during the flight, they wete on their way to paradie and wanted it to Change Quickly\" as the final answer.\nSo the final answe is B: They check the weather one more time before they land.\n\nInput: What's not allowed to be in a suitcase?

It has been said after 0.1%.   \nOutput: Let's start by eliminating the options that can't be true. 1. This choice cannot be the correct response because the options are not equally valid interpretations of what is said about the number itself.\n2. This cannot be true because the number \"0.1%\" indicates how often something is not said, not how often it is said. \n3. The same reasoning applies to this choice. 4. This cannot be the correct answer because although it is true that a 0.1% chance can occur more than 0.1 times, this is not saying anything about \"0.1%\" specifically. 5. This choice correctly states that a 0.01% chance of something happening can happen after an event occurs. Thus, it can't be the answer because it's incorrect to say that \"0\" could also occur.\n6. Last but not least, let's eliminate Choice # 2. \"It has been said only 2 out of 100 times at home\" is incorrect because it doesn't consider the possibility that sometimes home is not present.

{"text": "1) \"He was a very sharp <subject> but when <direct object> his calculations could were often <verb predicate>.\" The key takeaway from the question is the presence of the words \"could were often\", which suggests a repeated phenomenon. This indicates our answer choice must be something that can happen frequently and in the same manner each time. 2. The options \"sharper\", \"more exacting\", \"more comprehensive\", \"more precise\", and \"more cautious\" do not fit this description. To prove this, let's look at our options one-by-one. 3. \"Complimentary\" (B) describes \"something that complements, enhances, or improves something else\" (Merriam-Webster). This is not the correct answer because complements are not something that happens frequently or in the same manner as the subject. 4. \"Inelegant\" (C) is defined as \"marked by poor taste or lacking refinement\" (MerriamWebster). Similarly, this is not the correct answer. While \"inelegant\" might not be the correct answer, we can remove it from consideration, since inelegant cannot happen frequently or in the same pattern. 5. \"Ocean\" (D) cannot be the answer because it is not something that occurs frequently or in the same fashion as the subject. Similarly, it cannot occur in the same pattern. For the remainder of the exercise, we will assume \"ocean\" and \"complimentary\" are invalid options, leaving us with \"dull\" (E) and \"inaccurate\" (A) as the only true answer choice. 6. \"Dull\" is the answer, because dull does happen often, as it is a constant character trait of an engineer. Since they are constantly looking at their task, they are always observing small details and will often miss larger ones. 7. For example, if an engineer were to design a new car, he or she would look at the small details of the overall design and miss the bigger picture which results in a poor design. 8. The final answer is A: inaccurate or D: dull.", "answer": "E: inaccurate"}

The answers we have disqualified mean that the answer is a simple tool that runs on electricity.\n8. We can also see from the description that it runs on electrical power, but not enough to be an electric locomotive.\n9. Therefore, it must be something the average house contains; one that does not have coloured fur.\n10. Therefore, we determine that the answer is an electric drill.\n11.

A cowboy is when you pretend 4. You have to take a saddle 5. It's always funny 6. He puts on leather\nOutput: 1:\"When a cowboy...\" (A) means a cowboy is an action taken on, not the action itself, as in \"... is walking\" (B). Only Choice (A) is correct because the sentence is asking what happens when you are a cowboy, not what happens when you're attempting to be a cowboy.\n2. Choice (C) is incorrect because it states that the cowboy must be a person. However, a cowboy needn't be a person--you can be a cowboy without having any humans around. Rather than saying a cowboy is a person, it is more accurate to say a cowboy happens to a person.\n3. Choices (D) and (E) are incorrect as well because they say you have to take a saddles or it's always funny.

{"text": "1 Let's begin by eliminating the answer choices that don't meet the criteria of the question. For instance, the attic of a house will not be filled with \"material\" (E). This option represents something that is used in fabricating something else, and so it is unrelated to the question. 2. Likewise, the answer choice labelled B (\"Older houses\") does not sufficiently describe the most likely type of home to have an attic being filled with historical items. Older houses could be of varying ages and still be unable to contain such items. For the same reason, the answer choice labelld as C (\"Victorian houses\") would also be difficult to deem as certain of having attics filled with items, since some Victorian homes do not have attics. \n3. The answer choice \"Own home\" (D) does not fit as the most likely residence to possess a Victorian attic. Though some people may have attics in their homes, not all people own or live in Victorian houses.  \n4. It could be useful to breakdown the answer choice labelled as \"Top of the home\" (A) into specific attributes which can be used to identify a Victorian home. \"Top of the home,\" as the name implies, signifies that the home is an attic. The question is explicitly asking about attics, so as long as we are certain that the home contains an attic, than it is the correct answer. This leaves us with what the house is called: a house. This is because, despite the type of house, it must contain an attic. That leaves us with a simple answer of \"Top of the home.\" \nMoreover, the house must be called \"Victorian\" to be eligible under the question. But, since it is the \"Top of the home\", it must be the house itself, since all other options are not houses. Therefore, the answer to our question \"How is the \"Top of a home\" likely to be filled with historical artifacts?\"\n\nCan we decipher the answer from the question?

The correct answer is \u201cCompanionable\u201d.\n2. Option A: \u201cAttached\u201d cannot be the correct answer because \u201cattached\u201d means \u201cconnected to\u201d another object, and it is not a phrase that can be reasonably used to describe how someone feels about something.

Option D: \u201cClose\u201d cannot be the correct option because the correct answer is \u201cCompansionable\u201d, because \u201cCompansionable\u201d is how someone who loves their remote feels about that remote. \u201cClose\u201d, on the other hand, refers to a physical closeness between objects. \n2. Therefore, \u201cCompansionable\u201d.\n\nSo the final answer in this question is D: companionable\n\nInput: Where would I find an open-source software program?

We would be able to conclude that the camper must have been at least somewhat awestruck if he said that the sky made him feel \"stellar\" (B). However, he wasn't awestruck since he also felt \"unimportant\" (A). He didn't feel \"helpless\" (E) because he was a regular camper and wasn't concerned about danger. \n2. He could have been a city slicker and be familiar with the big city skyline, so \"insignificant\" (C) and \"somewhat\" (D) do not apply. \n3.

Why hasn\u2019t the International Space Station hosted any moonwalks in the 1 million years of its existence? Choices: \tA: Because the ISS was on the left of the moon B:  Because the ISS is so far away C:  Because the IRS takes a while D:  Because the ICC is too far away for any space walks E: Because astronauts on moonwalks have to wear clothes\nOutput: 1) Because the ISS cannot reach the moon or is too far away, we can rule out choice A) and choose D). Since the ISS cannot reach other stations in space on its own. (D). The only space station within the range at the moment is the ISC.\n2) Because the ISA uses a lot of fuel or cannot reach very far, we can rule out B) and choose B). The ISA uses as much fuel as other space stations use to reach a greater distance. Since the ISA's engines are well-maintained, they can reach further than other space stations (B).\n3) Because the ICS is too heavy or cannot lift enough weight, we can rule out C) and choose C)\nSince ICS can lift up to 280 tonnes (C), it does not have a large amount of weight. The ISC can lift up to 350 tonnes, (D). Both the ISC and ISA have lifts of 16.5 tonnes (", "answer": "B: insignificant"}
{"text": "1) Let's look closely at the choices, as they don't explicitly mention how many teachers are required in a school. \n2) Boredom (B) makes no sense because children require a fair amount of attention and activity, not less. This indicates that there would need to be a very small amount of boredom in a school to accommodate its students.\n3) Teachers (D) are indisputably necessary in schools, but teachers can be taught a great deal, and it could vary at different grade levels or schools, depending on the teachers themselves.\n4) Time (E) would be needed in a school to teach, but it is not a requirement. Similarly, inspiration (C) can be present but the teacher would still have to teach.\n5) Now we look at what choice A, \"Great Deal of\" is referring to. How would a great deal refer to teachers if one teacher was needed? Wouldn't it refer to the number of teachers needed? Therefore, if there were a great deal of teachers, it wouldn't be used to convey what teachers were necessary. A great deal should be used when referring to something that the teacher is doing or not doing, not how many teachers there are in a school.\n6) Lastly, we consider the remaining choice: patience (C). We have already established that patience is probably needed, but a great deal is not, so it makes sense.\n7) Therefore the answer is C: patience.\nSo the final answe is C: patience", "answer": "B: patience"}

E: Bleachers\nOutput: 1: If we go one-by-one.\n2: The ballgame is not taking place inside the ballpark; therefore, people are not inside the ballpark while the ballgame is taking place.\n3: So that leaves us with \"People\" as the answer.\n4: As opposed to grass, ball players are more likely to be taking the field after the ballgame or preparing for that moment in the dugout.\n5: So we'll mark \"Bleachers\" as incorrect.\n6: From an outside perspective, you won't see ballplayers playing. So that brings us to \"dugout\" and \"ballplayers\" as the two options.\n7: The people in the dugout are not the correct answer because if you were visiting the ballpark, you would not be looking at the players from the dugout. You would see the ballplayers on the field (or in the bleachers or sitting on the grass).

Choices:  C: Salt water B: Juice B: Soup E: Water\nOutput: Let's examine each choice separately to determine which one could be used without food. In each choice, we'll replace some of them and observe if they work without the others.\n1. A: Salt is an ingredient in food, so we can't remove salt from food while still having salt in our meal.\n2. B: Juice is a liquid that contains dissolved nutrients. If one has juice, they would have both liquid and nutrients present. 3. B: Soup is some sort of liquid that contains food, so we could not have soup without both liquid and food present.\n\n4. E: Water could be used alone because it is a liquid. If you don't have any food, you wouldn't need to have salt or soup or juice present, just drink water. Therefore, the answer to the question: \"what can you add to yourmeal without food\" is water.", "answer": "A: shelf"}
{"text": "1:Let's examine each answer option closely to find the correct answer.\n2. Option 1: Cabinet: A cabinet is generally a large and not a small door. The answer therefore cannot be A.\n3. Option 2: Pantry: While a pantry is a place to keep canned goods, it is not a door but rather a room or space. The answer therefore cannot option B.\n4. Option 3: Kitchen: This is true for some areas of the kitchen, but not for the whole kitchen, as there are areas of the kitchen where there are no canned goods. The answer therefore cannot  be 3.\n5. Option 4: Cupboard: This answer is a possibility, as cupboards often contain canned goods, but not all cupboards contain canned goods. The door could be the only one which contains canned goods, or it could be a small door at the back of a large cupboard. The answer, therefore, can be option C, or even option D.\n6. Option 5: Shelf: A shelf cannot be a place where canned goods are usually kept. The answer is not option E.\n7. At this point, we have successfully excluded the options which are impossible. Since we can't tell from the text whether the answer door is large or small, let's investigate them:\n8. Answer 4, C: The word 'cupboard' refers to a large container or box that is typically placed above a doorway for storage. It is often used to store canned goods, such as the canned goods for cats and dogs. Therefore, the door could be a small door or a large door which was placed inside a cupboard.\n9. Answer 3, D: The phrase \"cupboard door\" refers to something which fits into a large container that is often hung above a doorway. While it is usually used to store canned food, it can also be any of these things. Therefore, the door mentioned in the question could be a small door which belongs to a large door which is placed in a cupboard, or it could be an opening at the side of a large cupboard, or it may not have any door at all! A cupboard can be an enclosed space that is placed over a doorway or on top of an entrance, depending on the specific description of the word \"cupboard\". Therefore, the", "answer": "D: cupboard"}

In the world of chemistry, there are many different chemical reactions that can be used to produce and use heat. However, not all chemical reactions are created equal when it comes to their energy output.\n3.) One of the most commonly used chemical reactions for generating heat is combustion. This occurs when a substance is burned, producing heat as part of the combustion process.\n4.) This chemical reaction can easily be used as a heat source since it harnesses the chemical reaction between fuel and oxygen to produce heat.\n5.) The combustion of various fuels, such as wood, charcoal, and coal, can all produce enough energy to create heat, making combustion a commonly used heat source.\n6.) Other chemical reactions, such as photoelectric cells or thermoelectric cells, can also be used to produce heat from other sources, such as sunlight or heat energy, but these reactions are not as common for everyday household use.\n7.)

{"text": "1. \nBegin by understanding the question. \"What do rich people like?\", not \"What do rich people need?\". \n2. Let' s examine each choice, beginning with option A. \"Poor\" is not the correct answer because the context of the question is that these b agels are something rich people like. \n3. Option B: \"Sleepy\"? This implies that rich people like sleepy bagels, which makes no sense.\n4. Option C: \"Plain\"? This doesn't work because bagels are normally a type of pastry with many different ingredients, so rich people definitely don't want to eat plain ones.\n5. Option D: \"Needy\"? This is the correct answer. In a sense, you can see this as a play on words, as \"needy\" can refer to food insecurity and also to a sense of want or desire. \n\n6. Rich people often get to eat whatever they want, so they can be rather \"needy\", desiring a wide assortment of foods.  Therefore, the final answer is D : needy.\n\nInput: On TV, which shows aren't on the air?

It could theoretically be true that their poor performance would mean losing their job. However, in most cases, the opposite is true. \n3. Option B) \"Fearless\" implies uncertainty, which is not directly related to job performance. \n4. Option C) \"Criticism\" may refer to an evaluation of performance where there are constructive comments. However, it does not specifically indicate what type of comments, bad or good. Ultimately, we would need more information to know if criticism is the right answer.\n5. Option D) \"Making mistakes\" suggests the possibility that they could simply be corrected if a job is performed poorly. However, it doesn't directly state whether they will be reprimanded or not.\n6. Option E) \"Promotion appraisal\" suggests that their job performance could result in an increase in pay or responsibilities. This could happen both with good and bad job performance. \n7.

{"text": "1.\"The child pounded his mitten in excitement while enjoying\" is the key sentence of the question. \n\"Mitten-inspired\" is the word play in the question. The question is asking us to consider the location where the mitten is. \n2. \"In excitement while enjoying\" the mitten clearly has to be in a pleasant location, so it's not \"football stadium\" (which might have a soccer field). It's also not in the \"laboratory, \" which is a place for experimentation and not necessarily fun. So we can eliminate these locations. \n3. It's not \"pharmacy, \" which is a location for pills and not games. So we can eliminate this location as well. \n4. Let's focus on sports-related locations. It's \"baseball stadium\" (C), which contains a ball and mitt-related activity. So the mitten is there. The \"pounded his mitt\" suggests it is a location where we strike a ball, such as at bat. So it is a baseball stadium.\nSo the final answers is C: baseball stadium\n\nInput:When was the toy's price cut? Choices:  When did it go from $300 to $180. A: today B: Friday C: last year D: last hour E: last day\nOutput:  Let's take a step back and think about what we know. In which situation would a price go down? \n2. The toy was priced at $300. At any point in time, it's either currently sold at $300 or it has had a price decrease, so the price goes from what it was to the lower price that exists. We can't have a price of $0, since a toy must sell at some price for someone to buy it. Let's investigate the options one by one.\n3. It can't be today (A) since the option states \"last day,\" as in there has already been a price decrease in the past and we're referring to when it went down.\n4. It's not last year (B) because this implies that the toy was initially on sale for $300. But because a toy can't sell for $0, it couldn't have started at", "answer": "C: baseball stadium"}

Therefore, the appropriate answer is (C) preschool because \"playroom\" is a room in preschool.\n3- If a big house has many rooms including a large playroom, then a nursery school, a preschool, and a retirement home will have many rooms including playrooms. As an \"oldie\" myself, I can affirm this by stating that most retirement homes have playrooms set up for seniors to enjoy.\nSo the final is answer C: preschool.\n\nInput:In the kitchen, were some plumbing supplies used? Choices: \tA: No B: yes C: a bit D: sometimes E: seldom F: always \nOutput: \t1. Each choice has a different meaning. Answer a) No is used only for answer choices with the same meaning as bite, meaning: \"It's okay; don't do what you're about to do.\"\n2. Choice b) \"Yes\" is only used to answer the question: \"Was it an okay experience?\"\n3. Choice c) \"A bit\" means \"a small bit\". Example: \"I walked a bit slower\". It does not mean \"some\".\n4. Choice e) \"Seldom\" means \"rarely\". Example: \"Seldom do I come here.\"\n5. Choice d) \"Sometimes\" does not mean \"seldom\" or \"rarely\". \n6.

Let's see where children might sign up to play games.\n4. \"Play ball\" (E) is incorrect because it does not describe signing up and is too vague.\n5. \"Play chess\" (D) is incorrect because it is not a game and signing up is rarely a formal activity.\n6. \"Play sports\" (C) is incorrect because it may only describe kids playing for a team as opposed to playing a sport with other children by themselves and signing up to do so individually.\n7. We can rule out \"play games\" as a choice because it is too inclusive and does not describe a formal process or commitment.\n8. \"Throw things\" (B) is incorrect because it describes children throwing things, not playing a game such as throwing a ball or football. Therefore the answer is A: throw things.\nSo the final result is A: throw things\n\nInput: Which place is a good location for an umbrella? Choices:  C: on a sidewalk B: on a deck A: under a tree D: on the lawn E: down the street\nOutput: 1\"Where is a good location for umbrellas?\" is what the question is asking, so we need to find an answer that describes the desired location for an umbrellator to work. \n2.

These options are eliminated because if a person is searching for a way to explore space, they already know where they want to explore space and do not need another location. \n3. Choice D is not a vehicle but a type of object, which isn't the answer.\n4. Choices E and C both have to do with space, but are still locations because they are on the ground. Therefore, they are not the answer either.\n5. This leaves choice D, which involves exploring space without traveling on the ground. This eliminates choices B, C, and E, which are all related to objects on the ground. \n6.

In other words, the turkey needs the refrigerator to prevent its rotting.\n3. For a more thorough explanation, let's examine the options. \"Refrigerator\" (A) is not useful because the turkey needs a refrigerator to keep it from spoiling, so it is useless. Similarly, \"Oven\" (D) is not useful because it would result in the turkey's rotting, which is the opposite of what the turkey needs.\n4. \"Freezer\" (C) is the answer because it is a cool environment necessary for a turkey to remain fresh. \n5.

If the sun existed, what it do? If it was going to catch cold, it would lower its temperature, as that is what happens to other objects when they catch cold. If it was going to feel humiliated, it would lower its brightness and become dimmer, as that usually happens to people when they feel humiliated, just as the sun can become dimmer at night.\n\n2 The person is not a police officer and is not asking what the police should do when they are after someone. Rather, the person is asking what he should himself do when he knows the police are after. When the police are after you, you should do things to be more careful where you are. You should go into hiding or somewhere else to be less noticeable. If you are going to feel humiliation, you should also think about how to go about it so that the police know you and are able to capture you.\n3 Similarly, if the person is to hunt for food, he may need to be careful to not be noticed by the police. To do this, he would need to change his appearance to look different and hunt for food in places where the police cannot find him.\n4 Also, if you were going to be humiliated, you would probably be looking to hide somewhere so that you could avoid being embarrassed. The phrase \"Going to be\" would mean you are making plans on how to hide from the police. If you are going \"to prepare to go\", this would likely be before you know the police are after you. If the police already know where you are, there would be no need to prepare for where to go.\n5 There is nothing in the clues here that suggests that if the sun caught a cold, it would lower it temperature, so \"C\" cannot be correct. Similarly, nothing here suggests that the sun may feel humiliated, so \"E\" cannot be correct either. Also, there is no reason to assume that if the sun hunted for food, it would do so in an effort to be less noticeable by the police. \"E\" is incorrect because it has no relev", "answer": "C: prepare to go"}

{"text": "1) When I was told, \"He had a hard time...\" it is important to recognize the question is asking why he had a hard time finding his room on the schedule. If this question was instead worded, \"Why did you have a hard time finding the floor?\" the answer is different than \"It was on the second floor.\" In this case, the second floor is not important because it is mentioned directly as the floor where his room is located. \n2) However, in this question, the room on the second floor is important. If you know the floor where the room is, you know it's on the second floor. \n3) Now, let's focus on the rest of the sentences to narrow down the answer possibilities. \"He...got lost in the very large...centre...\" \n4) It is common that if you are lost in a centre, you are in fact \"In a centre.\" In this case, it is important to remember this is asking why he was lost on the schedule so it is not the centre he is lost in. However, if one gets lost in a city, one can be lost in the centre of the city. A person has no centre to their body, which the question explicitly states the room was on the second floor, a place where there would be an interior layout.\n5) What about other structures? An office building does not have rooms - office buildings have offices. A house does not have \"rooms\" - it has spaces like rooms (bedrooms or bathrooms). Similarly, a hotel does not have rooms; it has rooms. A school, on the other hand, has classrooms. \"On/In the second floor\" is a place for rooms.\n6) Therefore, as for why \"he got lost in the very Large.. [Centre],\" it must be a school, as that is the only possibility with \"room[s] and the second floor.\" \n7) Now to answer, \"Why did you find it difficult to [find] your room on the schedule,\" we can recognize that a room is an item that could be found in a building. A school has rooms.\n8) Therefore, the correct answer is: He got lost in the very big school due to its second floor.\nSo the final choice is He got lost in the big school due to second floor\n\nInput:If the shadows disappear and there's not enough light, how could", "answer": "A: school"}

However, this answer choice is not the correct answer because no one gets hungry because of playing too aggressively. \n3) \"Laughter\" can happen sometimes when playing aggressively, but it is not the only answer to this question. \n4) \"Injury\" can also happen when playing aggressively because aggressive play can result in bodily harm such as twisted and broken ankles or elbows, sprained wrists, or even head injuries from falling down.  However, this answer choice, although true, is not the required answer choice. \n5) \"Having fun\", which describes the outcome of playing aggressively, does not describe what happens in terms of actions. It explains the result of actions. \n6) \"Feeling happy\" is another common answer for this kind of question. While there may be joy associated with playing aggressively, again, this is not the answer that describes what happens when playing aggressively.  What happens after playing aggressively might be having fun or feeling happy, but it's also possible to feel sad, upset, or angry.\n7) \"Sadness\" is a common feeling when playing too aggressively, but this answer choice is not what could happen when someone is playing aggressively.\n8) That leaves us with \"Injury,\" which describes something that can happen when playing aggressiveness. Therefore, this answer describes what happens when someone is playing aggression--a person can get injured during this activity.\nThis question is about playing too aggressively so we should look at play as a noun which means aggression.

Only the last two choices say \"brown skin\". These should be compared to each other.\n5. Both choices say \"brown people\" and can be eliminated.\n6. Comparing the remaining choices - \"browns\", \"brown people\".\n7. It is logical to conclude they all describe a single brown person and are not a group.\n8. Thus, the second option \"own family\" refers to a brown person and is the correct answer.\nSo the final answers are D - brown, F - brown", "answer": "C: own family"}
{"text": "1. The key here is that the person is awake. We first check for the options that would not be true in this scenario.  \"Alert\" (B) means the person's mental state, which is not affected in this scenario. Likewise,  \"Drink coffee\" (C) is an action that would not change just because the person is awake or asleep. Furthermore, \"Open eyes\" (D) are a side effect of awake-ness, and not what is \"likely\" or \"true\" about it.\n2. After these eliminations, we are left with 4 answers. The person has a mental state of  \"Awake\" (A) and therefore is  \"conscious\" (E).  One would be  \"alert\" (B) after having awoken. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) conscious.\nSo the final correct answer is E: conscious\n\nInput: What might I do using a bilingual dictionary? Choices:  a: study word pronunciations B: read the dictionary C: use the dictionary D: check if the dictionary works E: find the definition of words\nOutput:1. First, notice that the book has been given a pronoun so that it can be used in 3 questions from this group of choices.  The question now asks, \"What might I do using a BILINGUAL dictionary?\" The key here is that it is bilingual. The book can be used in 2 ways: 1) to look up a English word (use with E) and 2) to look up a Japanese word (use with C). We start by looking for the options which are not possible to use a dictionary for. \"Study word pronunciations\" (A) is a process which can be performed without using a dictionary, and using the dictionary to look up a word's meaning is already included in \"use the dictionary\" (D).  Also, \"Find the definition of words\" (B) can be done without a dictionary at all. Since the dictionary is used in these ways, we can eliminate B and D.\n2. We are left with 4 options. The key to the question is that it is a BILINGUALLY DRIVEN dictionary, so options not involving a bilingual dictionary are not correct.  \"Read the dictionary\" (B) is reading a book where English and", "answer": "E: conscious"}
{"text": "1.\"When humans are in a race,\" is stated in the question, so we can restate the question as \"What is it that humans do when in a physical competition against each other?\"\n2. Now, compare each option's answer and select the most reasonable one. \"Lay eggs\" (A) is unlikely because humans don't lay eggs, but other animals do. We also already ruled out fruit-eating, wrestling, and drawing. This leaves us with \"compete with each other\" (D), which fits the context best because humans do race against each other physically for enjoyment.\n3. Thus, the correct answer is C: wrestle.\nSo the final choice is D: wrestle", "answer": "D: compete with each other"}
{"text": "1) Begin by understanding what the prompt is trying to make us think about. It is asking, \"What happens to people playing video games?\" \n2) Let's start by removing the options that are directly related to video games. Options A(winning) and B(entertainment) describe what happens to people when they are playing (video) games, but they do not contain anything directly related to games. (Therefore either of these options could be eliminated.) \n3) Option C(happiness) also doesn't directly relate to video games. Option D(cheating) describes when something is not directly related to a video game. Cheating in a game would involve using cheat codes or other practices to gain an advantage in the game, which isn't required for completing a specific video game or obtaining an in-game reward or achievement. \n4) Option E(relaxation) is the most appropriate way of describing the outcome of playing video games. \n5) Thus, the final answer is E: Relaxation.\nSo the final answers are A: winning B: Entertainment C: Happiness D: Cheating E: Relaxation", "answer": "C: happiness"}
{"text": "1) \"You\" and \"near you\" are close synonyms, but they differ in one important way. \n2) Options A (solidification), B (melting), and E (skin rash) do not have anything to do with water. Since the water on the ground is wet, these options don't make sense.\n3) When the ground is getting wet, it is either getting wet by water or snow. \n4) That leaves us with options C (getting cold) or D (feeling cold). By the \"near you\" portion of the question, we know that the ground near you is getting wet, which means that the environment around \"you\" is affected. The only way for you to \"feel cold\" in an environment is if it has already icy or snowy conditions. Therefore, the answer must be D: \"feeling cold\".\nSo the final answer Feeling cold\n\nInput: Why would I be able to read without an ad or a commercial? Choices: 1.  A: I am a reader 2.

Choice C - A sink is not connected to the ocean but would be more likely to have water running inside it. Similarly, option D - The beach would have water, but an ocean wave wouldn't. 5. The only remaining answer is option E: fountain. This is because an ocean fountain is very likely to contain water, and an ocean wave would not.\nSo the final the final answer is E: fountain", "answer": "A: florida"}

First remove the ones with nonsense meaning. \"Heavy Breathing\" is wrong because the question asks about jogging and not breathing. \"Feel pride\" also is not an answer because it is not the goal of jogging. \"Getting Tired\" is incorrect also because getting tired is not what jogging is for. \"Lose Weight\" is incorrect, because jogging is not going to help with that.\n7. \"Run Away\": There are other better ways to run away and not using your hands.\n8. A: What is the goal of going running? Answer: Jogging.\n9. How to use: 1. Where might I find a doctor\u2019s note that would state \u201cmy injury to be a broken arm\u201d? 2. Where might I find clothes I can wear while going out to a disco? 3. What would be a good movie to watch during summer break?\n10.

{"text": "1) Let's eliminate the first three options, which are not directly associated with shopping bags for groceries.\n2) Option D: \"mart\" is a misspelling of \"market\" which is a type of store that sells food, so this does not satisfy the requirements of the question.\n3) Option E: hardware stores do not sell shopping bags, nor is it a necessary shopping trip to find groceries, so the shopping bag would not be used to pack them if found.\n4) Option B: a home could be used, but it would not be a likely choice if you are asked where to find a shopping bag.\n5) Option C: a closet could be used, but this is less likely too.\n6) That leaves us with Option A: \"supermarket\". A supermarket is a type of store where groceries are sold and it is likely that they might be sold in bulk with special shopping bags.\n\nSo the final answer it A: supermarket\n\nInput: What is the first year in high school? Choices: 1A: freshman 2A: sophomore 3A: junior 4A: senior\n\nOutput: 1A: \"Freshman\" is the year that is called \"freshman\" in high schools. \n2A: \"Sophomore\" is not commonly called \"sophmore\" even when talking about high school years. Since the question requires knowing which name is used in high school, this answer is incorrect. \n3A: \"Junior\" is the year that high schools call \"junior\", which is correct. \n4A: \"Senior\" is the year in high school that seniors are in, which is also correct. \nSo the final answer to the question is A: Junior\n\nInput: Which is the last year in high school?  Choices: 1B A: senior 2B: junior 3B: sophomore\n4B: freshman 5B: \n\nOutput: 5B: \"Freshman is not the year you are in high school in your last year\", so this is the correct answer. \nSo the correct answer is 5B: Freshman", "answer": "A: supermarket"}
{"text": "1) We'll begin by ruling out all incorrect answers and moving on to the correct one:\n    - A: Attacking - The flea is attacking you!\n    - B: Sucking blood - You just ate some bacon, and the flea is sucking the nitrates and fat from your blood.\n    - D: Laying eggs - Laying eggs isn't actually how fleas locomote.\n    - E: Jumping - This is how fleas locomate, but we just have to figure out where they are jumping from. \n2) The key to understanding this question is 'locomote'. This is not a word that everyone has heard of, but it is the technical term for'moving', similar to an animal such as a rabbit or a dog.\n3) Using this knowledge, let's eliminate the incorrect answers. \"Stay\"(D) is not a form of locomotion. \"Jumping\" is how it locomotes, but we haven't told the question where. \"Laying eggs\"(D) is part of the flea's life cycle, not its mode of transportation.\n4) We are left with just \"Attacking\"(A) and \"Sucking blood\"(B). However, both of these are incorrect explanations of how fleas travel.\n5) The answer is C: Sucking Blood.\nSo the final explanation is C: Suck blood\n\nInput: When you are young and learn from experience, in which context is experience defined as knowledge?

This is incorrect because experience is not always defined as knowledge. For example, a young child's first experience babysitting and handling a crying baby might not necessarily be defined as experience.\n3. This is incorrect because children are not typically defined as being in the experience stage. This is an incorrect answer because it is missing essential context.\n4. This is incorrect because babies are not typically defined as experiencing something. An example", "answer": "E: jump"}
{"text": "1) \"Sam was against Allison.  Joe was the (opposite).\" This shows a \"contrastive parallelism\", which means that Joe is on the \"contrary\" side.\n2) \"Sam was not for Allison.  Joe is against Allison.\" This shows a \"contrarction\", which means that Joe and Sam have opposite opinions.\n3. \"Sam is not for Allison's decision and Joe is not either.\" This shows  a \"disjunction\" of contrastive parallelism, meaning that both Sam and Joe were not for the decision.\n4. \"Sam and Joe were not for Allison' s decision.\" This shows a \"negated conjunction\" of contrastive pairing, meaning that both Sam AND Joe were against Allison's agreement.\n5. \"Sam is not being for Allison's choice, while Joe is not being for it either.\" This shows a \"disjunction of conjunction of contradistinction\", which shows that Sam and Joe disagree on Allison's choice.\n6. Therefore, the answer must be \"D: for or\" since it is a single correct answer and each of the other ones is incorrect.\nSo the final answers is E: conjunction\n\nInput:If someone asks what I did over the weekend, how might I describe all the activities I did? Choices: 1. A: ate breakfast B: brunch C: lunch D: dinner E: pancakes\nOutput: 1.\"When a person asks what you did over the weekend\", this can indicate two things: either the individual is inquiring about an event that happened more than one day ago, or the question is a prompt to inform the inquirer of those activities. \n2.\"I did a lot of things\" cannot be the correct answer because this isn't an activity but a non-activity.\n3.\"I ate a lot of pancakes\" could not be the answer because this implies multiple pancakes, and the person doesn't even mention their lunch and dinner.\n4.\"I had meals for lunch\" can't be the answer because that still doesn't describe brunch or dinner, which are the primary activities in the prompt.\n5.\"I drank a lot of (something)\" cannot be the answer because \"a lot\" is still referring to a specific activity, which is", "answer": "A: being for"}
{"text": "1.\"The city\" (D) has nothing to do with a bookstore. Books do not exist digitally. Additionally, the question is specifically referring to a brick-and-mortar store, which cannot be found in a digital setting.\n2.\"The bookstore\" (C) is technically correct but not necessarily a helpful answer. It would be redundant to say \"the bookstore\" because of its obvious connection to books.\n3.\"The phone book\" (E) is similar to \"the bookstore\" (C). Both refer to an object related to books, which has nothing to do with where one could find a physical bookstore.\n4.\"The town\" (D) and the \"City\" (D) could potentially be home to a local bookstore. However, this depends heavily on whether or not the city actually has a bookstore. \n5.\"The carpeting\" (B) might sometimes be found in a bookstore, but it is not necessarily an expectation of where a store could be found. \n6. Ultimately the answer has to do with a physical location, rather than an object related to books. \n7. Let's compare the options to discern which of them fits the requirements, and the answer is B: Carpeting.\n8. A bookstore can commonly have carpeting or rugs on the floor. It is common to think of carpets as a means for padding the floor.\nSo the final answers is B: carpeting\n\nInput: In which country should you look for a nice restaurant?

It is a possible place.\n2: \"Peru\" (B) is not necessarily where one would look for other food because it has nothing to do with what other foods are in Peru.\n3:\"France is\" (C) a place that may have nice restaurants, but it is not necessary the best place to go when looking for a nice restaurant.\n4:\"Japan\" (D) is a possible place to look for a restaurant, but it is unlikely to have the best or nicest restaurants.\n5:\"Italy\" (E) could have nice restaurants, as it", "answer": "C: city"}
{"text": "1.\"What are you watching?\", \"Want to watch this?\" or \"What's on TV?\" refers to a person who is curious and wants to stay. Someone who isn't curious and wants to ensure viewing enjoy\u00adment will not be able to stay to watch something. \n2. By eliminating \"Examine thing\" (B) from the answers as it's not a form of watching, let's focus on places where you might watch something. There could be a TV in the \"Office\" (D), \"Grocery store\" (E), and \"Library\" (A), but we are looking for a place that is not as likely to have an appropriate TV. \n3. The answer could be any of the following: \"Home\" (C), \"Restaurant\" (B), \"Hotel room\" (A), or \"Classroom\" (B).  Home (C) and Hotel room (A) could both contain a show-watching environment, but we would need to know if they could be the viewing environment in \"Want to watch\" question. \n4. \"Hotel room\" is the second option and the only one of these options that could be the viewing environ\u00adment in the \"Want to watch?\" question. \n5. In conclusion, the answer has to be \"Home\" (C).\nSo the final answer \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47 is C: Home\n\nInput: If I'm going to the mall, where aren't I going?

Let's disregard the options that don't seem applicable (\"I'm going to the school\" does not seem like the context in which the question was intended).\n2. That leaves us with three possible answers: \"bus\", \"drive\" and \"other\". \n3. \"Bus\" (B) would not make sense in the question, as we are talking about going to the mall and not to a different location. \n4. The answer is \"Drive\" \ud83d\udc47. \"Drive\" (D) makes sense because we are talking about going somewhere by the car and \"going\" is the relevant action here. \nSo the final answer: D: Drive", "answer": "E: see favorite show"}
{"text": "1.\"The sample needed to be _____ but the lab assistant got corrupt\"The correct answer is D. contaminated because the sentence says \"wanted it pure\" and a \"contaminated\" lab sample isn't pure. \nSo the final answer  is D: contaminated\n\nInput:What is another name for an organic compound used to clean a lab? Choices:  chemical A: acetone B: alcohol C: amide D: detergent E: gasoline\nOutput: 1: When looking at the options, it is important to take into consideration the context and what the question is asking for. \"What is an alternative name for an organic cleaning compound?\" A substance which \"organic\" might be referring to, would need to be used to clean a lab. \n2: We can eliminate \"Gasoline\" (E) because it is a word that can't be used to refer to an organic chemical (it's a fuel). Moreover, \"gasoline\" is not related to cleaning a lab in any way. \n3: \"Acetone\" (A) and \"Alcohol\" (B), while organic compounds often used to clean a lab, are not words that could be used to refer to these compounds when there is a better alternative name available for them. This is because the context is already understood. \n4: \"Amides\" (C) are nitrogen-containing organic compounds, which is not what the question is asking because the question only asks for an alternative name for \"an organic compound used\" to clean a lab. Moreover, the original question did not specifically ask for the specific name, but another name.\n5: \"Detergent\" (D) cleaning agents are usually used to clean organic matter from clothes and dishes, but they do not belong to the family of compounds typically used to clean a lab because they are not soluble in organic solvents and are not typically used on a glass surface. \n6: Therefore, the correct answer could only be \"Acid\". \nSo the final answers are A: Acid", "answer": "D: contaminated"}
{"text": "1) Eliminate the obvious answer, which would be \"needs\". Needs should have already been met before we can even think about purchasing anything. Therefore, we can immediately eliminate this answer choice. \n2) \"Spending money\" is also eliminated since not everyone has money to spend, and even if they do, the money isn't being used to buy products. \n3) The next answer, \"Desire\", can also be rejected for similar reasons as \"Spending money\". Many people desire to have certain products, but the desire should usually have already existed before they began buying. \n4) Now we can focus on answering the question by understanding that it is asking us what you need before buying. The correct answer is \"Money\". In our example, many people have desire to purchase products. Some have the money to spend on products but do not have the money to spend for whatever reason. However, if we have a reasonable amount of money to spend on products, we can begin to purchase them.\nSo the final answers is C: money\n\nInput: Why did a cowboy have to be buried in the desert? Choices: A: It's his favorite place to relax. B: He is too heavy for a casket. C: His family would rather he rest there. D: The cows wouldn't be able to feed themselves. E: It's what his mom wanted.\nOutput: 1: It is now obvious from the question that this is a riddle.\n2. We do not immediately know why the cowboy was buried in the desert, but let us consider the answer choices one by one and rule out the invalid ones.\n3. The most obvious answer is \"B:... He is too heavy for the casket.\" But this is incorrect because of the way the question is worded, it says that he was buried in the desert which means, \"... He was buried in a casket that was placed in the desert.\"\n4. The next possible reason would be if his family wanted him buried the desert, or it was his mother's wish. This would give us answer B. However, this is not what the question says and therefore we take it out of consideration as well.\n5. The possibility of the cowboy's weight would seem to indicate that answer choice C would be correct. However, we take it out because this is a riddle and the", "answer": "C: money"}

Choices C and E are intercourse and driving a car. These may be noisy, but they cannot specifically be responsible for humans being exposed to noises.\n4. That leaves Choice A: pet the dog because it's when you pet the dog that you have no noise. This is the correct explanation of what happens to humans when they are exposed to noise.\nSo the final choice is B: pet the dog\n\nInput: When it's time for your birthday, what doesn't occur? Choices: 1. A: celebrating 2. B: cake 3. C: getting older 4. D: presents 5. E: drinking 6. F: dancing with someone you don't know\nOutput: 1, 2, and 6: No events involving dancing are required to celebrate your next birthday. In the case of presents, getting older, and drinking, the answer choice can also be used if the event were happening.\n3: Even though getting older is not necessary, getting older is a specific event. For this reason, it cannot be the correct choice.\n4: Parties and celebrations do occur in general, so getting presents is not a necessary event. However, the \"gift\" aspect of getting presents points to something having to do with events or gifts, or someone celebrating. As a result, getting presents can be a present-only aspect of the celebration or as part of the overall party, not necessarily a requirement for the birthday itself.\n5: Drinking doesn't occur at a specific time either because it's an event or because the person celebrating the birthday's identity. For the first case, drinking would need to depend on which event you are attending or the birthday person's identity/age/etc; for the second case, it needs to be part of the birthday celebration.", "answer": "B: hear sounds"}
{"text": "1.\"What is a large container a dime a dozen?\"  This means that there are a large quantity, or large variety, of large containers available. \n2.Let's eliminate the options which are not true.  \"Factory\" (B) is not the correct answer because the phrase \"dime a dozen\" does not fit well when describing a factory, which is where many things are mass-produced. \n3.\"Garden\" (C) is like factory in that a garden is not a place that produces something, and \"dime a dozen does not fit well with something produced at a garden. \n4.\"Supermarket\" (D) is a place that sells things, but \"large container\" describes the item of interest, not the place where it is being sold, so this is not the answer.\n5. The answer could be \"Warehouse\" (E), but this requires us to eliminate two options at once. First, \"Warehouse\" does not \"have hundreds of rows of them\". \n6.\"Garage\" (E) also does not fit because it is most associated with cars, and thus does not describe where a large quantity of large containers would be available.\n7.Lastly, \"Warehouse\", is the final answer because, of the remaining options is the single one that fits.\nSo the final answers is D: Garage.\n\nInput: The one who took the apple left it with the one who left it with the apple, what did everyone eat? Choices: 1. The apple 2. the apple with the one 3. the apple with it 4. apple 5. fruit\nOutput:There are the three answers that aren't the right one first. 2. The apple with the one is false because it does not describe everyone, just the one who left the apple with the one.\n4. They could probably eat apple with it.\n5.They could definitely eat fruit.\nNow we look for the one that the apple was left with and its location. 1. The apple is false because 1. states that everyone ate the apple leaving it in their mouths.\n2.is true because the apple was left with the one who left the apples with the one.\nSo the final one to eliminate is 3.\nBecause of the above reason and because the question says:they left it is", "answer": "E: warehouse"}

Age grieving person is not the correct answer and we can eliminate this option immediately. Loss of a loved one is a natural result of grieving but this does not lead to death directly.\n3. Next, let's eliminate the option that does not specifically refer to stress. Heart attacks do commonly happen with stress, but in isolation, they do not cause death directly and are not the result of stress causing them to occur. \n4. Next, we can eliminate the option that is a type of disease. Depressive disorders are a common side effect of stress, but not exactly stress itself. Likewise, headaches do commonly happen as a result of stress, but headaches are a side effect of stress and not stress itself.\n5. We are left with two remaining response choices: Painkillers (B) and Death immediately (D). Painkillers can temporarily suppress stress-related headaches, but do not lead to death. Likewise, stress itself does not immediately cause death. Even without treatment, stress can be survived (A-B = false). \n6. Therefore, the option that is false is Death immediately and the answer is B: Painkillers.\nSo the final response is B: Painkiller\n\nInput:Where might you find a bird in the summer? Choices: 1. A: In a park 2. B: On a pole 3. C: Feeding 4. D: In a tree 5. E: In the sky\nOutput:1. The question is \"where might you find a bird\" and the question only says \"in the summer,\" so we can eliminate C because it is asking about feeding during any season, not just the summer. \n2.

{"text": "1: Let's eliminate the answers that don't fit the context.\n2. If cake is served at a party, it doesn't go with ice cream because parties often involve cake as dessert, while ice cream is a light snack. Similarly, parties often involve a freezer (E) because they may have cake and ice cream.\n3. Choices B (movie) and C (party) are similar to the case of E because movies are often shown with food as concessions, and a party typically involves a freezer. The answer is therefore a better choice than either B or C.\n4. The answer Choice A: earth does not make much sense because it is unusual to eat cake or ice cream on the earth surface. Thus, Choice E: freezer is the better choice.\n5. In conclusion, the answer is E: freezer.\nSo the final Answer is E: Freezer.\n\nInput: Choose the right answer. 1.

Choices:  S: horse B: goat C: none D: both\nOutput: 1.\"Which is more painfull, a kick from a HOrse or a KICK from a GOAT?\" 2.The word \"horse\" appears in all caps, which indicates emphasis in the question. \"Kick \" appears in only the second half of this word, indicating emphasis on a specific noun. 3.The word \"GOAT\" appears in lowercase letters, similar to other words with small letters.\n2.The question asks which is more painful, not which is more painful and is asking which noun is most likely to do the act of kicking.\n3.\"None\" is not an option since it refers to nonexistence. \n4.There is no reference to both horses and goats kicking in the same sentence. The only kicking referred to is that of a horse and a goat which makes the answer \"D\" Both.\n5.One needs to analyze the two words carefully. A horse's kick is more likely to cause pain, while a goat's kick is not more likely to cause pain. Both might be equally painful depends on their power and sharpness.

Option \"City\" (D) could contain yards, but it is not specifically yard-like. It is more of a wide-open space in a city, whereas a yard is a specific type of land. \n4. The remaining options are \"Property\" (E) and \"Sub-division\" (D), which both could potentially contain yards due to being large patches of land, but do not inherently resemble one.\n5. Therefore we can eliminate options E and D. Option C: \"Neighborhood\". This could have small yards, however, it is more of a group of houses together which is why it doesn't fit with this question. So the final answer is C: Neighborhood.\nSo the final answers are C: Neighborhound, B: Farm, A: Tiny.\n\nInput:At what location is a parlor not present? Choices: 1. A: the living room 2. B: the kitchen 3. C: the bathroom 4. D: the bedroom 5. E: the study\nOutput: 1: The living room (1) and the kitchen (2) are both common areas with a parlor, as they are more communal and often have gathering areas. 2: The bathroom is a separate room and does not have communal spaces. \n3:The bathroom (3) has a toilet and is therefore not a parlor. 4: A bedroom (4) is a private area that is used for relaxation and intimacy. 5: The study (5) is a place of work and focuses more on individual and professional interests.\nSo the final choice is 3:Bathroom\n\nInput: What was the best advice in this question? Choices: \n 1. A: If you don't want to wait a month, then buy", "answer": "C: city"}
{"text": "1.)The key point to begin with is \"likely\", so this places emphasis on not only identifying the possible locations, but also narrowing down the possibilities to the most likely ones. \n2.) Option A: the theater, this may contain a program. However, it's unlikely this would be the most frequently used program for a theater group.\n3.) Option B: computer, this could potentially have a program, but likely not used often.\n4.) Option C: Opera, this could potentially have the most used program and a paper or electronic version.\n5.) Option D: Television, likely, not often used.\n6.) Option E: Concert, likely to contain a program if there are any special guests coming. \n7.) Therefore, the answer is C: opera, because it is the most logical environment that may contain a program and it is most likely to have one.\nSo the final choice is C) opera\n\nInput:In which sport is winning more essential than how you get there? Choices: \tA: tennis B: soccer C: hockey D: football E: basketball\nOutput: 1-Answers Choice D and E are not necessarily true or false because these sports either have a single winner (D) or multiple (E). \n2-In answer choice A, this is true that a sport's objective is to win the game. 3-In answer Choice B, this is true too because winning a game is more important than how you get there. 4-Option C, the game's objective doesn't affect the statement. Winning is a result and not an action. 5-Option A is true because winning is more important than how to do it. It's the objective.

{"text": "1.) When considering what this question could possibly be asking, a living thing with a \"lip\" can most likely be found on a living creature.\n2.) We first take out any words that wouldn't be a valid choice since they don't belong together in that context. Example: \"snake\". Snakes have jawbones, so it is not possible to say that a living thing with a lips is a snake. We also remove \"human\" and \"kentucky fried chiken\" because they would not technically be lips, but parts of the body where humans or chiken get food.\n3.) The choices left are \"mouth\" and \"can\".\n4.) Using logic we remove \"can\" because cans do not have lips.\n5.) The only choice left is \"mouth\". A \"mouth\" is a type of \"lip\" but it is also a living thing that has lips. You can find a \"mouth\" on a lion, but not a tiger which is why that choice is removed.\n6.) There are no other living thing with a \"mouth\" besides a human which is why this is the answer.\nSo the final answeer is C: human\n\n\nInput:What do you not want to get lost or found on the trail/mountain? Choices: A: your wallet B: your phone C: your dog D: your pants E: your keys F: your camera\nOutput: 1: This question could refer to a number of items that one might not have with them during their hike or mountain climbing experience. We have to decide what is the most likely answer to this and what are some of the more far-fetched choices that might throw us off the right answer in this question.\n2: Some possible choices might be a camera, your keys, wallet, phone, pants or dog. From this, we have to eliminate any far-fetched choices like your camera, your pants and your wallet immediately, because these are not something that you would take with you on a hike or be very likely to lose or find.\n3: We are left with 3 choices: your dog, your phone, and your keys. There is no direct indicator of either finding or losing an item. So that leaves us with 2 possibilities: your cellphone and your keys, and we can eliminate phone as the answer because if you lost your", "answer": "C: human"}
{"text": "1) \"If they were celebrating [an] occasion, what kind of occasion would they be celebrating?\" This phrasing suggests that this is an event where a celebration is taking place. \n2) The celebration could be described by the occasion itself, but it wouldn'thave to be. Even if the celebration wasn't related to the occasion directly, the celebration itself could still be described by other means.\n3) Let's eliminate options (D) & (E): \"Happiness\" and \"Enjoyment\". We already have a description of the celebration of the occasion. \n4) Options (A) & (B): Drinking and Intimacy. These aren't the best answers for a number of reasons. Drinks and sex both have a negative connotation. Drinking may come up as a way to celebrate the occasion, but that doesn't mean celebrating the occasion would be described that way. Similarly, sexual intimacy may come up in a celebration, but again, that does not mean that the celebration itself would be described by such intimate activity. \n5) This leaves \"Dancing\"; we can say that an occasion is being celebrated by dancing. We can see that this fits the clues and the context of the question because it isn't specifically a celebration. In fact, dancing is just something that people like to celebrate. \n6) Therefore, the answer is C: Dancing.\nSo the final answers are C: dancing and B: intimacy\n\nInput: What is the color of the sky if it is overcast on a cool spring day? Choices:  blue A) overcast B) cloudy C) dark D) green E) gray \nOutput: 1.) For clarification, a cool, overcast spring day is a spring day in which the weather is cool and it is overcast. \n2.) If the \"sky\" is overcast, then we could look at the clouds, which are typically referred to as being either \"overcast\" or \"cloudy\" in a particular way. \n3.) From there, we can look at options \"blue\", \"dark\", and \"green\" and eliminate them, because none of these are the color of overcast or cloudy. \n4.) This leaves two remaining options: \"gray\" and \"cloudy\". Of", "answer": "D: happiness"}
{"text": "1.\"Where could you find some pieces of paper that are large?\" This question is asking about large pieces of paper that aren't for sale. Let's examine the answer choices.\n2. \"Cabinet\" (B) - Cabsinets generally would contain paper, but they wouldn't be for sale as all of the contents inside of them are already owned and are not items that you can purchase.\n3.\"Computer printer\" (C) - Computer printers would occasionally have large paper sheets in the back, but they are generally for selling and not for sale.\n4.\"Suitcase\" (D) - Suitcases typically don't have large sheets of paper in them or for sale.\n5.\"Office supply store\" (E) - The office supply store contains a lot of paper, but not the kind that one would necessarily need for personal use.\n6.\"Artist's studio\" (E) - Artists have a lot of paper, often for personal use. Some may have some extra to sell. Artists could have some large sheets, but this would not be in an exclusive, separate location and wouldn't be a place a person could just go to get some large pieces of paper. The large sheets would be used for the artist's work and not for sale. \n7. The last two answer choices are \"large paper that is for sale\". This would be a \"For Sale\" sign on the paper itself, not on something related to the paper. This means that it must be the artist's studio. The artist is the one selling the paper, making the studio the most likely place to get some large pieces that aren't selling or for sale.\n8. This means \"Artist's studio\", as the answer is \"For Sale\" signs.\nSo the final answe is A: Artist's studio", "answer": "E: artist's studio"}
{"text": "1.* When professionals play sports, they generally don't compete against each other. Instead, coaches will compete with one another.\n2. It isn't usually competitive to use pain, mudslides, sweat or injuries during a game of sports.\n3. If professionals were truly facing serious injuries or other calamities that could prevent them from competing, then they likely wouldn't be professionals any longer because they will have quit playing for a reason.\n4. Rain is not an issue because it occurs during the game, which is when the competition occurs, and will cause games to be canceled or postponed only if it is too severe.\n5. The appropriate answer is none of the above.\nSo the final answers are A: pain B: sweating C: injuries", "answer": "D: injuries"}
{"text": "1) \"James's bouncy rubber balls were at state during the evening, and so he may nap.  In the morning, and then set them in which posture again?\" Let's break down each option to fully understand the question.\n2) Option A: upside down. While James's bouncing lumps were resting during the evening, he would also reawaken them the morning and place them inverted.  This could work, although it'd certainly take a long time to reenergize upside-down bouncing balls. \n3) Option B: moving. Perhaps James's tumbling lumps were at rest during the evening, and he could make them active again in the morning?  This appears unlikely because bouncing lumps are notoriously restless, so this isn't how they'd be made dormant in the first place. \n4) Option C: active. If the lumps were at rest, then they would be active once more.  This could happen, but it's unlikely considering the difficulty of quieting an energetic lump.\n5) Option D: awake. It's reasonable to say that the lumps could be placed in the same state as when James started out, because it doesn't matter in which state they were left prior to sleeping. If they were dormant, then he could just awaken them. \n6) Lastly, the lumps could be in a fresh posture called \"relaxation,\" which is what happens after dormancy. This makes sense because if something is at rest, then you could put it in even more dormancy if needed. \n7) Therefore, the correct answer is D: awake.

Option B: The \"basement\" is not the place to go to find electricity because an electricity outlet is not necessarily found in basements.\n4.

{"text": "Let's break down the possible answers individually. \n1. Choice A: auditioning. This doesn't seem likely because auditions are usually for a soloist and the guitar is a group instrument. \n2. Option B: listening to sounds. This does not sound correct because the guitar is an instrument and the word is a verb, not an adjective. Also, listening to sounds is a broad category description.\n3. Option C: Listening to music. This could potentially be correct, but the description doesn't fully match as it says \"the person who is  playing\". It is possible that the guitarist is listening to someone else play, which could be considered listening to music, but this sounds like a stretch given the way the question is worded and doesn't provide the specificity.\n4. Option D: Making music. This could match the question, but the other options do not mention music-making, so this answer would be incorrect based on the question structure. \n5. Option E: Arthritis. This cannot be the correct answer because the question does not include the word \"arthritis\" or any other explanation for the guitarist to \"make\" music. \n\n1. Let's conclude the answer based on each of the options that we know are not correct. There isn't an option for watching a person who is listening to music or making music, just one that describes the musician's act.\n2. We can also conclude that the correct answer is listening to music because the other options don't correctly describe what the individual is doing.\n3. Therefore, the correct answer is D: listening to music.", "answer": "C: listening to music"}

So the answer must be something that has the word \"play piano\" in it.\n4.` Out of the answers, \"Play piano\" (E) does not include words other than \"play\". And \"Play piano\" (B), \"Play piano\"  (D) and \"Play piano\"  have the same phrasing at the beginning and the end, so that doesn't help differentiate which one is the answer.\n5.` Finally, \"Play piano\"  is the correct answer because there's no specific name on it.

Since our answer will be a reason for using a phone, we can eliminate the other things that are already reasons for using a phone.\n3. None of the reasons to use a phone are in the remaining choices, so the answer must be one of them.\n4. The only choice remaining is \"to text\" (E), which is the correct answer.\n5.

{"text": "1). Let's look at each answer choice one by one:\n2.  Choice A: produce eggs. This can be excluded from the possible answers, as this is not a behavior exclusively performed by chickens. Chickens do lay eggs, but they lay them inside a chicken coop, not on a sidewalk or a street.\n3.  Choice B: lay eggs. This can be eliminated because laying eggs is an activity that chickens do in the chicken coop; this does not happen on the sidewalk or the street.\n4.  Choice C: become food. This can be eliminates because it's a behavior that a chicken does after it is killed and not performed on its own.\n5.  Choice D: cross road. This can be exluded as chicken do not cross the road.\n6.  Choice E: look for cars. This choice is correct as it describes a behavior for chickens that includes crossing the road. Therefore, we should conclude and say that the answer is E: look for cars\n\nInput: Which of these types of food can you add to an omelet? Choices: A: bread B: fruits C: vegetable D: grain E: meat\nOutput: 1) First, we should list all the options we are trying to exclude. In this question, there are 5 options:  bread (A), fruits (B), vegetables (C), grains (D), and meat (E). \n2) Now, we shall move onto finding the possible answers. We will start with eliminating answers that only involve mixing eggs with cooking. An omelet does not need to be mixed with vegetables or fruits since they are already there in it. Similarly, it is not necessary to mix an omelet with meat, as the meat does not get mixed in to the omelet itself but rather serves as a protein side or a specialty flavor. Bread, on the other hand, can certainly be added to an omelet which is evidenced by recipes or by observation of anyone making an omelet. This leaves us with just fruit and veggies (B) as possible answers, as these are the only remaining mix-ins which are found in an omelet. 3) Since we have narrowed our answers down to", "answer": "D: cross road"}

Choices: 1) A: door 2) B: curtain 3) C: backdoor 4) D: table 5) E: window\nOutput: 1: There are 5 doors in your home; let's start by eliminating them.\n2: If there were curtains near a sink to use to pour water, you would just pour the water into your glass or water dispenser.\n3: You wouldn't be able to use the backdoor to pour water for a glass or a water bottle. You would instead get the water from somewhere else where the door can't be used as well.\n4: The table is already full of things and can probably only fit so many more objects, and a cup of water is pretty bulky to put on a table.\n5: If a window wasn't near a water source but you were to pour water into a cup by using a window, it would be messy and you'd have to dry the window afterward.\n6: Thus, the only choice that could be used to pour water in a cup is D: the table. \nSo the answer is D: the table", "answer": "C: bring home fish"}

Sporting event (C) and Dick's Sporting Good (B) could apply to multiple people. However, if the sporting event is a home game, the answer probably won't be in a store that sells goods.\n4. Therefore, the answer must be in either location. Sporting event (D) and Dick's sporting goods (B) could potentially apply to every participant, so the answer is Dick's Sporting goods (B.).\nSo the final answer  is B.: Dick's Sporting good's\n\nInput:What's the worst nightmare a woman could have?

Let's first dissect the correct answers.\n2. I couldn't wear lippstick would probably make a woman have the worst nightmare\n3. I'm in the fifth grade and have to wear specs would make a woman having the worst nightmare.\n4. Now, we eliminate the wrong answers. Girls would wear boyfriend's left me and Daughter could be a kid, so I can eliminate these, because it's a nightmare being a boyfriend or be a mom.\n5. I really couldn't wear lipcstick would probably make someone have the worst nightmre.\n6. The last choice is my hair is fried and I'm stuck in the purse. The first being fried hair would be terrible and stuck in the purse could be bad.\n7.

{"text": "1.) Starting with the options that are not specifically related to Christmas, we can rule out \"Department store\" (A) and \"Frazer Fur\" (C) -- these are not places associated with Christmas. \n2.) There is no \"specialty store\" associated with Christmas, so \"Specialty store\" cannot be the answer. \n3.) To understand \"Christmas tree\", we must consider the context of the question. In a Christmas context, it refers to a tree that is often used as a decoration during the holiday, typically for Christmas and associated events. \n4.) When looking at \"Christmas stocking\" (E), we see that it is referring to a type of ornament, similar to other Christmas trees -- a Christmas stocking is typically shaped like a stocking, hung from a fire and containing treats that are given to children on Christmas. \"Christmas Stocking\" would be defined here by the context of the question, and cannot be the answer. Therefore, \"Christmas Tree\" and \"Christmas Stocking\", while being Christmas objects, are also not valid places. \n5.) To find an answer, we must look at the words of the question. This is where we find the most specific and relevant meaning of \"Under the tree\". It was used to refer to a place or location, not as a decorative object or ornament to display gifts on the tree. \n6.) Moving to the remaining options, we look at \"Mother\" (D) -- an ordinary woman who is in the context of preparing gifts for her loved ones. \n7.) This means \"Mother\" is the person who placed the very last gift under the tree, referring to the tree where they placed it. \"Mother\" is therefore the answer to the rhetorical question. \nSo the final answer must be D: Mother.\n\nInput: What kind of pig did Goldilocks try?

{"text": "1. We start by eliminating any incorrect answer choices. It's unlikely that the only possible physiological responses were blood (B), medals (D), or erections (E). \"Competition\" (A) likely isn't the correct answer either because it's possible for two people to be engaged in a friendly competition with no harm or excitement. \n2. Of the remaining answer choices, \"Erections\" (E) is the most direct answer. It makes sense that a man playful wrestling with a woman would result in a response like an erection. \n3. The other remaining responses \"Blood,\" \"Wins,\" and \"Competition\" are potential physiological responses, but also have the potential to occur without this type of physical playful interaction. \n4. Thus, the correct answer is E: Erections.\nSo the finals answer is E: erections\n\nInput: I was reading the novel, what of me did this include?

{"text": "1.\"Scuttling\" means the crab was moving quickly, so \"strained\" must also be moving quickly, likely as a result of some obstacle impeding the crab's progress. \n2. Examining each answer choice, it is apparent that Option D: \"current\" cannot be straining the crab because currents are not moving towards the crab in the same way you would \"move\" in a \"strain\". Currents can potentially carry a crab away from the shore, though not with any intensity that would impede the crab's pace. \n3. Option E: A cooking pot, though logical given the presence of a crab on a beach, cannot be straining a crab to move unless the pot is somehow chasing after the crab. \n4. Option A, \"tide pool\" can also logically be seen as a barrier to movement in the same way a wall in the street might prevent somebody from getting to where they need to go. However, \"tide pools\" are the body of water, not the side of a road, so this cannot be the right answer choice. \n5. Similarly, option B: \"beach sand\", given that it isn't a road and doesn't have a defined border, can't possibly impede a crab with a specific direction of travel. In fact, the opposite argument could be made based on the crab needing to escape the beach at all costs, as beach sand would make it easier for said crab to quickly get away. \n6. Option C, \"tide poos\", cannot be impeding movement either. Though they appear to be moving water areas, they are in fact just pools formed when the water recedes. \n7. This leaves us with the correct answer of B: \"beach\".\nSo the final answer  is B: beach", "answer": "B: beach sand"}

It's the act of winning itself that is illegal because the casino is not rigged to favor particular players; the player must be doing something else to be able to win when they shouldn't be able to.\n5 Option E: 'dealing' cannot be the answer because that could potentially be the casino job that the player is doing while playing cards.\n6 Option B: 'Help' (as in 'help somebody cheat while dealing') is not illegal, but might be a casino violation.\n7 If the casino has a specific card room for playing blackjack, then the question may be referring to what you can't do in a card room when playing.\n8 For instance, you couldn't drink alcohol in the card room while playing.\n9 Option C: 'count' should not be the answer as there is no illegal aspect to it.

{"text": "1) Begin by understanding what the questions asks. \"Which of the given options do you feel is a result of getting a bruise?\" This implies that it is the emotion you have once you get bruised.\n2) Let's narrow our options to find the best answer after a brief examination. \"Embarrassment\" (E) is not a direct result of getting a bruised as it takes time for you to be aware that you're bruised and then for that embarrassment.   \"Communication\" (B) is not a direct emotion as it is meant to be a reaction to having a conversation.\n3) The other remaining options are more likely to be the correct option after a quick assessment of one's emotion after being bruised. \"Self-pity\" (A) and \"Pain\" (D) are both associated with bruises and thus are the more likely answers. There is no \"Best\" answer, so feel free to choose between the two remaining options.\nSo the final answers are A: self pity, D: pain", "answer": "D: pain"}
{"text": "1.\"Do people who are speech theraphists do\" refers to individuals who are speech therapist who are doing something.\n2. Let us eliminate non answers, as these are obviously irrelevant and incorrect. In this question they would be: make music (B), believe in god (C), give speeches (D) and build houses (E).\n3. \"Make music\"? They are not supposed to make music. \"Believe in god\"? They aren't supposed to belief in god. \"Give speeches\"? Not giving speeches but helping others make speeches. \"Build houses\"? They should not build houses but build health (not in materialistic term as building something materialistic).\n4. Now we have to analyse the answer choices. \"Complete sentences\" (A). The therapists help the patients to complete the sentences with proper word choice.\n5. \"What did people who are speech therapsists do?\" refers to individuals who are \"speech therapists\" who are doing something.", "answer": "D: complete sentences"}

So we want to find an answer that is something of value.\n2. He was doing favors for everyone at work.\n3. We are told that the result of it was FRUSTRATING! It was not fulfilling.\n4. Then the only question is, what was fulfilling?\n5. The answer is A: let down.\nSo the final Answer is A: let down", "answer": "E: gratitude"}
{"text": "1 Let's begin by eliminating answers that are not directly related. \"Have a great day\" (E) is not required for walking into a business. It is merely a suggestion. \n2. \"Learn\" (C) is also not the correct answer because the question asks for \"everyone walking into our store\", not walking into the store to learn.\n3.  \"Hope for peace\" (D) is not a direct action required for entering a business - it's just encouraging and not something the business would require before entering.\n4. That leaves two choices, \"Wear shoes\" (B) and \"Do well\" (A). We can narrow it down to the answers that make the most sense. \"Do well\" (B) would be too general and not very useful.\n5. \"Wear shoes\", on the other hand, would make sense because businesses are more focused on hygiene than general well-being. \n6. Thus, \"Do well\" (C) is out, leaving only \"Wear shoes\".\nSo the final answer can be B: wear shoes.\n\nInput: What did the farmer decide to name their calf? Choices:  a. Ewe B. Cow C. Billy D.

{"text": "1.) The first step is to clearly identify the correct vocabulary in the question. The word in question is \"apt.\" This means an apartment. Therefore, the question is asking, \"Where might college kids use a folding chair inside an apartment?\"\n\n2.) Begin to eliminate incorrect options. The folding chair will not be used anywhere in the bathroom or closet. There cannot be a student sleeping in their room in an apartment. Therefore the question is asking where a folding chair might be used in an ordinary setting.\n\nThe word \"school\" can be used in two ways. One, it could be referring to a school, which would not be in an apartment. Furthermore, it could also be referring to a lecture or class. This would not be a student's apartment, so it can be eliminated as well.\n\n\"Church\" can also be used in multiple ways. One possible use would be a church meeting in a student's home. However, they do not reside there for the majority of the year and would not be likely to be the one to use a folding chair in an apartment. \n\n\"Room\" can actually be used for multiple different meanings. One, it could mean a student's private room on campus. However, when they do not live on campus during breaks, it would be implying that they live somewhere else. \n\nThis means that the only two remaining possible options are \"apt\" (an apartment) and \"apartment.\" \n\nBecause the folding chair wouldn't be used in the apt(house) or apartment (a different house), it must be a different house, because it's already been used earlier in the question. \n \nTherefore, the correct answer is E, \"apartment\"\n\nSo the final answer  is E. apartment", "answer": "D: room"}
{"text": "1) A table can be put in a variety of places. To answer this question, we'll consider each choice in turn.\n2) Choice A: The library is a space in a building, not a place in one's house.\n3) Choice B: If the table is to be used for demonstrations, it will likely be in front of a group of people, not anywhere in the house, as there is no need for it to be easily accessible. Thus, the answer can be dismissed.\n4) Choice C: The corner is part of a room, not an identifiable place.\n5) Choice D: The football field is not a place a person can \"put\" a table, making it not applicable.\n6) Choice E: The rug is also not a place for a table.\n7) Only choice D remains. The football ground is a place one could put a table and that is the correct answer.\nSo the final is: D: Football ground\n\nInput: Where do the most dangerous drivers in a city mostly go? Choices: 1. A: on the highway. B: off the road. C: to work.  D: to school. E: on the street.\nOutput: 1: The question asks \"Where do the most dangerous drivers go in a city most often?\", so the place of action would be the more appropriate option to be examined: \" Where do the most dangerous do most often\".\n2: The key here is not \"most dangerous\". The question would not ask about drivers who are already dangerous (because we cannot change the level of danger). Therefore, it must be the case that the place mentioned in the question is inherently an area where drivers are dangerous. This makes Choice A correct.\nOn the highway. This is the area that is a highway. That makes it the place where drivers are dangerous.  \nSo the final answer: A: On a Highway.\n\nInput: What is in the middle of a basketball court? Choices: A: basket B: court C: net D: hoop E: ball\nOutput: 1): This question is asking us what is in the middle of the basketball court.\n2) Here are the answers that do not answer this precisely. Choice C, \"net\", is on the outside of the basketball court. Choice E, \"ball\", is in and around the area", "answer": "C: corner"}
{"text": "1:  In order to answer the question, we must first understand what the question is asking, and specifically what it is asking about. This question is asking about what type of kitchenware to be used in cooking a meal at home, but the question itself does not specify which specific type of kitchenware will be used. The most likely type of kitchenware to use is a pot, given that the question specifically asks about finding a potato.\n2. It is important to eliminate the choice options that do not pertain to specific types of kitchenware. The choices that are being eliminated are: root cellar, casserole, and pockets, these choices do not describe a type of kitchenware.\n3. For this reason, one should eliminate all choices except for B and D. \n4. B: Casserole. A casserole is a kitchenware used for either storing food or cooking in the oven. However, since the question did not stipulate whether the desired type of kitchenware is for cooking or storage, one must eliminate this option.\n5. Casserole is also a food that would be cooked or cooked in and stored in a kitchen. Cooking equipment is eliminated, and storage equipment is eliminated.\n6. Finally, one will be left with the choice option D, which means that the intended type of kitchenware is something that is used for storage. When looking for where exactly to find the desired item, it would be in the storage area of the kitchen, as is specified by the question. \n7. The answer, therefore, is D: Pantry for storage.\nSo the final answeer is D: pantry for storage.\n\nInput: When do people often put their hands into their pockets?

{"text": "1: The word \"was\" means this is an event that has already happened. \"Change\" is an action verb. So it is not the case that \"The sun was changing rapidly\". If we rewrite, it would be \"The sun changed rapidly\". If we use the pronoun \"it\" to replace the noun \"sun\", then it would mean \"the sun changed rapidly\" and not \"it was changing rapidly\"\n2: The question is asking \"What is really beginning to what?\" There is an action verb \"beginning\" so this is referring to an event or action happening very recently.\n3: The answer \"was really beginning to change\" is incorrect because after the fact, change is already done.\n4: Thus, the answer is E: heat up.\nSo the final answers are a:drop to zero\nOutput: 1 \n2: Let's try each option quickly.\n3: To begin, Choice A: drop to zero is not the case. If something drops to zero, it means zero. This doesn't describe an object that is beginning to warm up.\n4: In Choice B: increase, an increase refers to something getting bigger. This doesn't apply for why something is beginning to warm up either.\n5: In Choice C: cool down, cooling down is what happens when something reaches its lowest possible temperature. This implies that whatever is \"cooling down\" has already cooled, so it doesn't describe what is about to happen.\n6: In Choice D: drop quickly is incorrect because this refers to an object dropping quickly, not describing a process.\n7: In Choice E: heat up, heating is what happens when something is becoming warm. When we ask what is beginning to, we are asking what is beginning to become warm, not warm.\n8: Therefore, the only remaining answer choice that describes what is really beginning to is Choice E: heat us.\nSo the final choice is E: heat up\n\nInput:If I see a pizza pie and a baked pie, what could I have?

{"text": "1. The question asks where his wife asked him to look. \n2. The options are all locations the wife could ask him to check if he complained about missing deodorant. It is necessary to further investigate each of the options to choose the correct answer. \n3. Choice A: grocery Store: This is not the best option because a grocery store contains a variety of different products from many different companies and is therefore hardly reliable for finding deodorant from a specific company. \n4. Choice B: nightstand: A nightstand is a cabinet by a bed. This could house personal items including deodorant. \n5. However, it's not a highly reliable place to find a specific deodorant brands because there are many kinds of deodorants and many kinds of bedside cabinets. There could also be other people's items in the nightstand and they could put any type of deodorant in it. Therefore, it's not the most reliable place to look.\n6. Choice C: Armpits: To find deodorant, it would be best to check inside of the armpits themselves. However, there could be other instances where someone else's armpit is opened, which means the person could find the wrong deodorant. 7. Choice D: Own Bathroom: The home bathroom is where the person could find their own deodorant. Also, they aren't usually shared with other people and should not be touched by them. If there is deodorant still here, it should be the right brand. It's also unlikely to be stolen by someone else at this point because it's still in the same house. \n8. Choice E: Medicine Chest: The medicine chest is a cabinet in the home that typically holds a wide range of items like medicine, toothpaste, cosmetics, and etc. It's probably not the easiest place to find a specific brand of deodorant, because there could be a variety of deodorants in there as well as other people's items. Even if they took that deodorant from someone else and kept it without replacing it or telling anyone, there's a chance that they took someone else's brand of deodorant and this choice is not reliable.\n9.

When we're thankful for getting something, we're not focused on getting more.\n4. Choices A (say thank) and D (looking for) both involve the word \"looking,\" which means they are not the desired outcome. When we are thankful for a gift, we're not looking to give thanks again anytime soon.\n5. Now we look at choice E (show appreciation). This is a correct answer because when we're thankful, one of the ways we show this is through appreciation. We're not here for the gift, the gift is the gift, and that is enough.\n6.

{"text": "1) The question is posing a hypothetical situation where you want to change society and need to start from within. \n2) Here are some of the possible answers:\n\n**Option A -  Riots:** Riots can be used as a form of social activism or protest to express unhappiness and dissatisfaction with a certain policy or condition, but they don't usually result in meaningful and lasting changes.\n\n**Option B -  Vote:** Voting, on the other hand, is a way to express your opinion by selecting a candidate who advocates for your political ideology or policy. While it may not change society directly, it can be a powerful tool for making more personal change through electing a leader who will implement laws that reflect the views of those who voted for them.\n\n**Option C -  Change yourself:** Changing yourself is a good option if you want to improve your situation but it does not have a lasting impact on larger societal goals.\n\n**Option D -  Social activism:** Social activism, such as participating in protests, signing petitions or raising awareness about a cause, is another option. This will involve a collective effort but the change can be seen more quickly due to the involvement of a larger group.\n\n**Option E - Change clothes:** Wearing the wrong type of clothing does not have a significant impact on society, but it can give people ideas to question why one wears certain items. Some might think that wearing different clothing styles is changing culture, but this doesn't always have a lasting impact either.\n\n3) Comparing all the answers, two standout as potentially having the most influence on society: social activism (D) and voting (B).\n\n4) Social activism could potentially have a larger impact than voting because it involves more people and could increase awareness of an issue, but it does not have any guaranteed results. Voting, however, is a more direct and reliable way to change society because it involves selecting individuals who have the power to implement policies that reflect its needs and values.\n\nSocial activism involves more effort but voting carries more certainty, making it a more realistic way to achieve lasting change in society.\n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\nVoting\n\nInput: If I was to ask someone how far", "answer": "C: change yourself"}

So, it cannot be A, B, or D.\n5. Michigan (C) is an interesting choice, but is it really in anyone's yard? It's possible if you live on a large farm, but not everyone has a home with large enough land for all 57 Michigan counties.\n6. For the same reason, it can't be option either.\n7.

The graveyard could not be found in \"a church property\" (C) because we know that any graveyard will have been built to be used by anyone, whether they are affiliated with a church or not.\n5. The graveyard is not the property of a church, so a graveyard could not potentially be \"on a church property\". \n6. We can also eliminate \"Every town\" (E) for the same reason, that the graveyard could not possibly be on property that belongs to a church.\n7. \"Arlington\" (B) could potentially contain a graveyard however, it may be a public park or a battlefield, so it could very well be that other locations are also able to have a graveyard.\n8. \"Out back\" (D) could potentially contain a grave yard as well however we know that many graveyards are located on church property (which might be owned by a church that is owned by someone else), which is not the case for \"out back\", as this is more likely to be a private or residential property.\n9.

The question says that a ponytail can be \"attached\" to an item, which means it is not something that is made of that item (such as someone wearing a hat made of hair).\n2) To better understand what the words in the question mean, here is a brief overview of their definitions.\n3) Choices A-C all refer to the person's hair as it happens to be on their head, either before or after it has been arranged into a different style, which does not allow the ponytail to be attached to it.\n4) Choice D does not allow the ploytail to be attached directly to the object but rather is meant to be worn around the neck like a necklace.\n5) Choice B refers to a hairstyle and allows a ponytail to be made and be held in the person's hair. Since a ponytail can only be worn by the person who made it, this is not the answer.\n6- After considering everything, the answer is E: headband.

{"text": "1) Answer A\n\nAnswer Explanation:\nSo the final answer(Option A) is Strong Laxative..\n\n#####\n\nInput: Choose a fruit in which the center holds. Choice:  A: cucumber B: pineapple C: melon D: potato E: avocado\nOutput: 1.) Choice (D) seems like a possible incorrect answer given that potatoes are a root vegetable, not a fruit, but what is being referred in relation to a fruit is the flesh of a potato that is cut. The center has been removed, making it a different structure than the original which contains both a skin and a center-piece. \n2.) Choice (E) seems like a possible correct answer to the question because it has \"flesh\" that can be removed for consumption, therefore we can consider it a fruit based on the meaning of flesh. However, avocados are not really cut open to expose the flesh, rather typically, the fruit remains in the shell. \n3.) Choice (A) seems like a possible answer because cucumbers appear to meet the criteria, i.e. flesh with a skin. \n4.) Choice (B) seems like a possible wrong answer given that pineapples do not appear to have fleshy interiors; they are instead made of a fleshy outer shell that opens to expose fleshy interiors. \n5.) Choice (C) is a potential correct answer to the question as cut fruits are cut into wedges; wedges do have a core. However, melons are often eaten whole, which means the entire fruit is consumed at once, whereas fruits like pineapples are made of many fleshy wedges that can be cut apart and eaten separately. \n6.) Choice (E), given that it is a type of fruit that is made of fleshy interiors and can be cut open to expose such interiors, is the correct answer.\nSo the final Answer(Option E) is Avocado..\n\n##### \nInput: Where can you wear socks?

Choices (B), (C) and (D) are definitely possibilities as all of these places are locations that an individual could use a pen. Choice (B) would generally be more of an office supply store setting. It would be less likely with Choice (C) at a friend's house, and Choice (D) at a desk drawer.\n4. Choices (B) and (C) would be more appropriate for a pen, but Choice (B) is the best answer, because (B) is where a pen is most likely to be during a person's day. \nSo the final answeris B: office supply store\n\n## Answer:", "answer": "A: pocket"}

So, the first question, \"why would people\u2026\" answers C: inspiration and the second question, \"do people want to\u2026\" answers D: love.\n5. Next, let's examine the two other questions. The first describes something that has a positive value to it and the second describes a way to keep students from talking to each other.\n6. Option E: Fun - This is not an answer because people would not have to engage in fun in class if they didn't want to engage in some form of communication. Fun has nothing to do with communicating.\n7. Option B: Necessity - This is not an option, because if they need to communicate or interact, they would not necessarily have to, since it would be necessary they do so at some point in the future.\n8. So the two remaining options are inspiration and love.\n9. Option A: Inspiration - This is not the correct answer because people would do so to inspire and influence the discussion, as an answer, not to be inspired by a discussion.\n10.

If there were a baby with a relative, that baby would be a grandchild (babies are young, grandchildren are old, grandparents are old), not a relative.\n2. Mummies and grandmas have babies, but their babies are grandbabies, not children. Babies are not related to grandparents; only children are.\n3. Mummies and mummies are definitely not sweet.\n4.

{"text": "1: Before answering each answer choice, it is helpful to first eliminate the obvious ones. For one, \"cattle ranch\" (B) is obvious because it is where the farmer raises cows, including the heifer referenced in the prompt. Similarly, \"dairy farm\" (E) has similar logistics and is therefore not the answer. \n2: \"Countryside\" (C) also would not be the answer because it is still not a place to reside. A place of residence would need to involve an actual building, like a house or barn. This means \"Countrysides\" (D) is also the answer. 3: By evaluating the last remaining answer, we can determine its identity. \"Grocery store\" (D) cannot be the answer because \"grocery store\" does not have any place for animals to reside. This allows us to arrive at that \"countryside\" is a place of residence, and that \"groceries store\" would actually refer to a grocer's shop. \nSo the final answer in the story is E: dairy farmer.\nSo the final story is A) compassionate farmers, E) dairy farmer\n\nInput: Who can find an elation of happiness that isn't a state of joy? Choices: 1: B) joy 2: C) happiness 3: A) joy 4: D) happiness 5: E) happiness\nOutput: 1) So, first we can eliminate the answers that are directly related to a state of joy. \"B) joy\" (1) is a state of joy, \"A) joy\" (3) is also directly related to joy, and \"D) happiness\" (4) is a related term. Therefore, we can eliminate the above three answers. 2) Next, we can eliminate all of the options that refer to states. These \"B) joy\" and \"A) joy\" refer to a state of being, and \"C) happiness\" refers to a state or feeling of happiness. Since none of these options reference a physical place, it would be inaccurate to call it a state. This allows us to narrow down our remaining answers to two. 3) \"E) happiness\" is one of the remaining answers, but it is inaccurate to refer to happiness as a", "answer": "B: countryside"}

Each has a profits that involve a role in which one has to speak. \nWe can eliminate choices a and c.  A teacher does not speak for a profession (to students or parents), but rather instructs and educates. Similarly, a comedian must speak in order to be comedic.  \nAll of these are professions in which one either always or most often has to speak.\n\nWe can also reject C.

However, Tennessee cannot be the fiddle itself because there are other states named Texas.\n4. Hence, we eliminate the first and second choices.\n5. Then, the remaining four choices are divided into two sets. The first set deals with instruments like fiddle. Thus, we eliminate the fourth and fifth choices. \n6. The second set deals with more places of fiddle. Hence, the third choice is eliminated.\n7.

That is an absurd question.\n2) Looking at choices, we need an answer that best matches a description of a person\u2019s profile picture.\n3) Choice A: none. It is highly unlikely someone\u2019s entire profile photo is their face alone without their body, and so we exclude this choice.\n4) Choice B: 85. This choice says there is a body and face, which we cannot distinguish at all. That is not what the question asks.\n5) Choice C: much. The answer says that the face and the body are closely related, but we are looking for how much of the face matches the rest of the body.\n6) Choice E: more than half. The answer says the face is more than half of someone\u2019s profile pic, which we agree, but we are looking to understand whether the face looks like the rest\nTherefore, we eliminate the second and third choices. 7) The answer is none of the choices.\nSo the final answers is A: none\n\nInput: Where is a place that might hold a", "answer": "A: tennessee"}

This is not correct because that would imply a city or town, not a theater. \n4. \"A military base\". This is also not correct because theaters need a large area to be practical. \n5. \"An opera house\". This is correct because \"opera\" is a type of theater performance.

Choices: A: sea B: underground C: oceans D: salt mines E: sea salt\nOutput: 1) This is not a comprehensive list of source options. However, it does not include the source of sea salt, which is a common misconception. The answer is not E), as salt mines are not necessarily underground and do not always yield sea salt. \n2) There are two relevant factors that determine the answers to this question: the geographical location and the type of salt being discussed. It is important to note that the geographic location determines the type of salt being produced. As sea salt comes from the sea, it can only come from salt mines near the sea. \n3) Salt mines can also be located near oceans. However, since they are not located underground, they are more likely to produce table salt or rock salt. Therefore, the correct answer is  D: salt mines.\nSo the final answers is D: salt mines\n\nInput: Where would someone not expect to find a large tissue?

So, out of the remaining choices, what do these words mean?\n3: \"Night\" and \"Wilderness\" mean darkness. \"The Universe\" is the biggest space known to exist. So, if we think of them like this, what are the only logical options? Stars would still appear in the  \"Universe\", which doesn't mean anything alone.

We know that slicing and crushing both produce smells that are considered either strong or unpleasant. While Choice C is technically also a kind of chopping, it produces chunks whereas slice produces slices, and crush produces crushed items.\n2) Choices C and D are definitely unpleasant smells. Choice C produces crushed items, and Choice D produces squished objects.\n3) Choice E definitely produces unpleasant smells as well, as mixing results in chemical interactions.

{"text": "1) The answer to the question is clear. The children exclaimed the result because they saw Superman fly overhead.\n2) There are two key facts that should be kept in mind when choosing the answer to this question.\n3) First, the expression \"as a result\" implies that there was a previous event that led to the children's actions. In this case, the children have seen Superman fly overhead, which caused them to exclaim as a result, as discussed above.\n4) Second, the \"what\" of the question can help narrow down the answer choices.

Excavation is an activity, not a place. \"Site\" is a place.\n2) Answer: Look for words. \"Cemetary\" (B) is not a place to excavate because it would require digging up a grave, which is forbidden in most cultures. \"City\" (d) and \"Building\" (c) are both places, neither of which you would excavate. \"Aritchological Site\" (e) is a place you might dig up, but not excavate.\n3) Answer: Look for other words to narrow things down. \"Excavation\" (a) and \"Construction Site\" (b) both refer to activities, so you need to find out more about \"office\". \"Construction Site\" is a place, but it doesn't have a logo. Choose \"Office\" (again) if you want to find a company logo.\n4) Answer: We have an odd number of options left, so look for a common word. \"City\" appears twice and cannot be the answer since it is not a place to conduct an excavation.\n5) Answer: The most common word across all the options is \"site\", with four appearances. \"Site is both a place and a part of an activity.\nFinally, the word \"Office\" appears just once, so the answer that has \"Office\" as its first word is our best answer. The best choice is that office might have a logo on an excavation.

For instance, it could have been purchased in the mall but it was \"extremely expensive\" when compared to the average price of that location.\n2.\"It was likely purchased at the most upscale location\": this means that the clothing was not necessarily bought at the most expensive location. For instance, a $500 shirt could be much more expensive than the rest of a store's products, but it's still likely this store will have more affordable items than stores that cost more.\n3. Eliminate all the choices that are contradictory to the statement. Option A is a place that has a cinema instead of a store, so the clothing wouldn't have been bought there. Option B is a shopping mall, which is a place you'd typically buy more expensive items, so the clothing wasn't likely purchased there. Also, the statement explicitly said the clothing was likely an event place, so mall would not be an event place. Option C is a department store, which is likely a place you'd buy relatively affordable items compared to clothing that costs hundreds of dollars. This makes Department Store contradictory to the statement, so it also eliminates this choice. The same goes with Option D; closets are places to store items instead of places to buy them, so clothing was not likely bought at the shop. \n4. Option E is the most likely location to purchase this upscale clothing. A store is an event place where it is possible to buy something and thus this makes it the most likely place to buy the clothing.\nTherefore, the answer is E: shop.\nSo the final answers is E: shop", "answer": "B: mall"}

Similarly, \"Understand themselves\" (E) is not about social interaction, so it cannot be the answer. \n3.

They clearly have one or both of the following in common: 1) stores that sell toys and 2) games that are played with toys. \n4) From there, we can eliminate those choices that have only one of these features and figure out what it is they have in common. \n5) This eliminates the strategies, as they are not stores that sell toys. \n6) It could be a chess set, but not just any chest set. We can eliminate those chess sets that are not toy stores which leads us to the following: those that are toy stores. Those toy stores that sell chess. Thus: a) Toy Store b) Chess Set in a Toy Store \n7) This only leaves toy stores and chess that are played with toy stores. It can't be a chess set because there are chess sets that are toy stores, so the choice can only be a) Toy Story because \"toy store\" and \"toy store\" have the same meaning. Therefore, the most likely place to store my chess is in a toy store that sells chess.\n8) This means that \"Toy Store\" is the answer choice because the chess pawn would be stored in a toy store.\nSo the final list of choices is A: Toy Store\n\nInput: Which of these is not common in an office?

Choices:  a: jeans  b: a sock  c: shirts  d: hoodies  e: leggings  f: other clothes  g: shoes\nOutput: 1: \"Jeans\" (a) and \"shirts\" (c) are out because they are generally made of cotton and won\u2019t retain the ink left on after drying.\n2: \"socks\" (b) and \"shoes\" (g) are ruled out because, again, the material they\u2019re made from doesn\u2019t retain the inked image left after you hang dry them.\n\n3: \"Leaving ink on clothes\" isn\u2019t the specific criteria, but \"hoodie (d)\" is the correct answer because they are made of a material that will not let ink dry on them.\n4: None of the other answers fit either because cotton isn\u2019t used in \"other clothes\" and shoes are made of material that doesn't let ink dry. This leaves us with the only remaining answer, \"hoodie\".\n\n### Extension:If you are looking for", "answer": "E: university"}
{"text": "1) \"Which planet is the Atlantic Ocean part of?\" This means that there is one answer out of 4 possibilities (Planet B, Basin, Submarines and Earth). So if we eliminate the possibilities in the wrong way, we could end up mistakenly choosing answers which are wrong. \n2) \"the atlantic ocean part\" means that we only have 3 possibilities of answers, the word \"part\" excludes planet. \n3) So we go to our answer options and eliminate them in the right way. \n4) A: Planet, we exclude this one because we want to choose an option which is not a planet and also the ocean can't be both a part of and not part of the planet. \n5) B: Basin, this one also can't be our answer choice because there is the planet earth we can't exclude here. \n6) C: Submarines, this one is also eliminated because the word \"ocean\" is used so we need to exclude submarines. \n7) D: Earth which can be both a part and the whole of the ocean. \n8) E: Pacific, ocean name does not include the atlantic ocean.\nSo the final choice is answer is D: Earth.\n\nInput: What is not the main ingredient in all recipes? Choices: 1. Direction 2. Flour 3. Water 4. Salt 5. Oil 6. Sugar 7. Salt 8. Sugar\nOutput: 1.) It is easy to understand the question and the answer choices in here.\n2.) We have two lists of items which should be opposite to each other.\n3.) \"What is not the main ingereint in recipes\" means the main ingredient list is from the first choices, as from the first choices, we have to say which ingredients are not main ingredients.\n4.) We can eliminate other choices because if a main ingredient does not exist in all recipes, it cannot be the answer, we can say the sugar is only ingredient but it does not have to be there in every recipe.\n\t\n### Bonus round:Answer these two multiple choice questions and I'll tell you how you did overall! \nInput:  What is not the largest food item on the caf", "answer": "D: earth"}
{"text": "1) The question asks which thing that a beaver blocks when creating dams. One of the answers is a \"zoo\", which implies that the dam is located near a large animal population where beavers might be trying to protect those creatures, but that does not fit the description of the problem.\n2) The other answer choices are similarly ruled out. \"Wooded area\" (D) could potentially be where the beaver is building its dam, but the question focuses on what it is doing with the materials it is using as the basis for the question. Another potential answer is \"body of water\", (E), but again this is not the most important part of this specific problem.\n3) Therefore, the right answer is \"Animals\", which describes the most likely scenario for a beaver creating a dam. An animal needs protection.\n4) So, the correct answer is E: animals.\nSo the final Answer is E: animals\n\nInput: I have a few questions of my own. What do the following abbreviations represent?

Hotels offer more luxuries compared to motels and there are many types of hotels and they are easily found.\n\n4.\u201cWhat else would he find?\"\nAnswer: John would find something that is similar to what he would find in a hotel.\n\nSo the final answer to the question is A: hotel. \n\nInput: Why might you ask a friend about their plans for a day? Choices: 1. Ask to use their car or house 2. Show them a favorite film 3. Request that they lend some money 4. Offer to buy a ticket for a sports event 5. Ask for some help doing the homework\nOutput: 1.\"would like you to tell them about your plans for the day\" suggests you would like to understand what your friend's plans are for the day.\n2. The other options in the question are not relevant to the context and are more likely to be part of conversations in general.\n3. Choices 4 and 5 seem plausible as topics for conversations but are unlikely to be an exact match to the question's sentence.\n4. Thus, the answer to the question seems to be C: 1.

{"text": "1\"Where do I find people that buy and sell stocks?\"\n2. Let' s examine each answer carefully.\n3. Trading floors could be traders in a building (not hallway because buildings have floors on the inside, not outside the building), in a table, an office, or at an exchange.\n4. Buying and selling stocks implies a transactional environment.\n5. People buy and sell stocks on trading floors, which would have to be in an office. Therefore, this can only be true for trading floors in an office, and trading floors in tables are not in the question.\n6. The choices \"Building\" (A) and \"Hallway\" (B) are not a trading floor. \"Trading hallway\" is not a term used, and only a trading floor or an office would describe buying and selling stock.\n7. That leaves us with trading floors in \"Table\" (C) and the \"Exchange\" (D), which both do contain transactional environments and involve buying and selling of stocks.\n8. Since a trading floor is typically found within an office, trading floors in exchange are also found in an office as well. Therefore, buying and selling, along with offices, can be found at both locations.\n9. However, trading floors at an office are only in the office and not found outside of the office.\n\nTherefore, the answer is a trading floor in an office.\nSo the final answers is D: Exchange\n\nInput: When I'm running for my life, I'm trying to what?

{"text": "1 Rumors. The answer must be about something that happens if/when an event occurs that may or may not be true.\n2 Rumors can lead people to do things like panic, get in trouble, and even to commit murder. This means that the word \"could\" must be referring to an action, not an event. So: \"Rumors of a roving band of monsters killing people causing what\u2026\"\n3 Now, this event, whether true or false, caused people to panic as evidenced by choice C.\n4 That being said, the possible events that are causing people to panic are limited. They aren't causing people to get in trouble or even to murder each other. That being said, if someone was rumoring about a roving band of the undead coming to town, they would probably get in a lot of trouble.\n5 The only thing that's left are the things most likely to happen if/when someone heard a rumor that turned out to be false, and those are choice A and choice E.\n6 Since these actions could result in people getting in trouble, this leaves as the likely answer.\n7 Thus, the answer is E: murder.\nSo the final answers are E: murder\n\nInput: How long have people been using these symbols as punctuation in writing?

{"text": "1.\"What happens when people are reading a book? \" This cannot be the answer choice because people can often have their nose in a book while waiting for something, but that doesn't mean they're reading the book. Many people will simply open to a new page, and begin reading at random.\n2.\"Getting bored \" this is not the answer because waiting can occasionally lead to boredom, but that doesn' t always happen, as boredom can manifest while people are doing other things, as well.\n3.\"Worrying \" similar to \"getting bored\", worrying can also occur during other tasks and not just waiting.\n4.\"Singing\" is unlikely, as many people will not break into song while they're waiting. This option is unlikely to occur for many people. \n5.That's not all, however! The answer choice which is more specific to waiting is Choice C: get bored. Indeed, many people would rather sit idle and do nothing, than read a book or do other things when they are waiting.\nSo the final answers are C: get bored\n\nInput:What is your favorite fruit?

{"text": "1: The question is asking about something that you don't need if you are not using it. The word \"use\" refers to purposeful use of something towards a task: A purposeful task is something that someone is doing, in the present, which requires using a certain object to complete the task at hand. \n2: Let's eliminate the answers that explicitly involve using something in a purposeful sense. \n3: Choice C: luxury is a false choice because the question wording does not require the object to be a luxury item. \n4: Choice E: extra is a false choice because extra means supplementary or more than necessary.\n5: Choice B: unnecessary is a false choice, because by the question's definition, if it is unnecessary, you would not be using it at the time.\n6: Choice A: satisfied is the correct answer because a satisfied item is one that you do not need to use for the task at hand. For example, if you have a comfortable blanket and only need it to sleep, you can satisfy your need for a blanket with this one even though it may not serve a luxurious function.\nSo the final answers are A: satisfied\n\nInput:The most useful item to help you do something is: Choices:  A) shoes B) a hat C) hand D) a pen E) a jacket F) a pencil G) paper\nOutput: 1) The question presents us a list of items that may serve as a helpful tool, and asks what item is the best choice. \n2) Let's consider how the question asks this problem in order to choose the correct answer. \"The most useful item to you\u2026\" refers to an item that you have personal experience in using the most frequently and that you personally feel is the most helpful for completing a task. \n3) Let's review the items being asked about in order of probability of selection. \n4) Choice Choice C: \"a hand\": This cannot be the best choice because a hand is an organ of the body and therefore not an item that you would have in front of you while performing a task, such as writing or doing a sport. \n5) Choice Choice D: \"a pen\": This cannot be the most useful item because a pen would function as an implement to help perform the task.

{"text": "1) Eliminate the options by excluding those that are unlikely to have a chair used by few people. \n2) Option E: furniture store. Furniture stores stock many items and wouldn't use an armchair exclusively. In fact, you don't need an armchair to fit one or two people. 3) Option A: Doctors' office. Doctors may use the armchair, but they only come in once or twice a day to check in patients, so not everyone will be able to use the armchair. 4) Option C: apartment. When a room is a shared apartment, many people can share the armchair. Hence there may be people who rarely use it. 5) Option D: Study. In this case, a study contains only a few people who can use the armchair at the same time. 6) Finally, option B: hospital. This is probably the most likely option since hospitals have an enormous amount of patients who will be able to use armchairs. Hence in the hospital, armchairs are always in usage and rarely used by only a few individuals. \n7) The answer is B: hospital. So the final answer is B: hospital\n\nInput: What wouldn't a toy shop owner like about a business? Choices:  \"A. Lots of customers B. No competition C. Profits D. Not many employees E.

Let\u2019s start with the \u201cwrong\u201d answers. Choice (D) is a concert hall. While a harpsichord can be found in a concert hall, it is not the \u201cright\u201d answer, since this instrument is only rarely used nowadays. \n3. Choice (C) is a place to find a museum, not a location where a harpsichord is frequently played. Choice (B) is a band, usually a musical group that plays songs and not an instrument, so in this case, it would not be located where a harpsichold is used. 4. Choice (E) is a rubber band which is an item made of rubber and not a place where a harpsichond is used.\n5. The right answer is Choice (A), where a harpsichrod is likely to be played. A harpsichord is an ancient instrument that is rarely used today, so it is not commonly located in everyday places. A harpsicherd is best found and used in a concert.\n6. Therefore, the answer to the question is A: Concert.\nSo the final Answer is A: Concert", "answer": "D: concert hall"}
{"text": "The answer is C. 1. Let' see if the other options are valid. Here's a breakdown. 2. \"Short-term\" (A) is clearly not an option. So this question cannot refer to parties which are \"short-term\". 3. \"Crowd\" (B): In my opinion, this is the least likely option because a \"crowd\" is related to large \"groups\" (the opposite of parties), so a secular party would not be described in this way.4. \"Unpredictable\" (D): While parties can sometimes be unpredictable, this doesn't necessarily apply to all parties, so it can't be the answer.5. \"Frequent\" (E): This describes a party that is held more than once. Most parties are held frequently, but there are also single parties that can still be frequent. 6. Finally there's option \"Eternal\", which describes an infinite (without end) party. Although eternal parties aren't impossible, they're unlikely.\n7. To summarise, the only remaining answer is \"C\" (Unpredictable).\nSo the final answer choice is C.\n\nInput:What may a student do when they need a little rest? Choices: 1. A: nap 2. B: walk 3.

What other actions might a student take? Let's make a list: -Reading -Listening -Stretching -Napping -Drinking water 2. Napping is an action, which means the answer is option A. Other options such as drinking water are not actions.\n3. Reading is an action, which makes it option D. Other options such as stretching are not actions.\n4. Listening is not an action, and is actually considered a verb in the English language, so this makes it option C.\n5. \"Study\" is not an action. \n6. \"Stretching\" is not the best answer as it does not pertain to a resting period.\n7.

We ask a person why we are not allowed to ride on their toilets.\n2: We do not ask because it is dangerous. We ask a person because we want to know why we are not allowed on their toilet.\n3: We do not ask them because of cleanliness issues. We ask a person for the answer to the question.\n4: We do not ask anyone for the reason because it is a public restroom. We ask a person the question and they will answer it.\n5: We do not ask the reason why we are not allowed in a restroom for this question.

The word \"language\" is a noun that describes a particular linguistic communication group.\n2: We can eliminate the answers referring to specific words within a language. \"Longest possible word\" isn't the key phrase in the question. Additionally, \"longest word\" can be applied to any individual word and isn't tied to specific types of languages.\n3: That leaves us with \"a short word\" and \"longest word in the dictionary\" (E). We can eliminate both options for the following reasons. \"Short words\" refer to a specific type of words and don't explain the entirety of the question. As the question refers to \"any language\", the word \"short\" is only applicable for one specific language. \"Longest word in the dictionary...\" is a type of word that is defined in a specific dictionary, which contradicts the broadness of the question. \n4: After looking at all three options, our correct answer is \"a short word\". \nSo the final answer  is B: a short word\n\nInput: Where do people need to get dressed to look presentable?

While this could be thought of as many candy bars, one wouldn't typically have multiple bags of candy in their hands.\n3.

D: supermarket S: hardware store\nOutput: 1: A: stadium There are many people attending a stadium, and someone might go back to remove their signs if possible.\n2: B: grocery stote: The grocery store is open later than most stores, so it is closed for many hours at a time over the course of a day. It would also be difficult for many customers to remove banners because they are attached and do not want to damage goods or other banners.\n3: C: shopping malls: shopping malls have long hours, but they are likely closed for hours at a time each day for several hours. Additionally, shopping malls often have many customers in one location, making it difficult for any one person to easily remove a banner.\n4: D: supermarket 5: S: hardware store: Supermarkets and hardware stores have fewer clients or shoppers, making them more likely to be able to remove a banner.

However, this is a place where damaged goods are disposed of, not fixed.\n4. \"In the kitchen\" is not the answer because even if an icebox is used for regular ice storage, iceboxes were designed for refrigeration and not freezing.

The choice of either C, D, or E could prove to be correct or incorrect in this question. Let's look at each one in turn. \n2) Clothing. Since the velvet quilt will be made from cut pieces of fabric, then we can see that they would go to a clothing store to buy it. A fabric store is not a clothing store though, so this option cannot be correct. \n3) Jewelry store. Jewelry stores have velvet, so this option would be correct if velvet was a type of jewelry. However, it's not, so choice D would be incorrect.\n4) Clothes. Clothes are things already made, so we know the answer can't be clothes. \n5) The choice between fabric store and the correct answer, which is E: Fabric store, is whether or not the store sells velvet. Fabric stores sell different types of fabrics, so the answer could be correct. Let's look closer at E. Here are some key details about fabric stores: \na) They sell a wide variety of quality fabrics, from cotton and linen to silk and chiffon to leather and denim. \nb) They also sell a wide variety of qualities, from regular weight material (usually in natural colors) to sheers and laces. Materials of all weights, colors, and styles are always in season. \nc) Fabric stores are always happy to show you how to create what you want from their vast selections of products. \nNow that we've covered some of the key details of fabric stores that sell velvet, let's look at E again: \na) \"Fabric stores\" sells a wide variety of velvet, making it logical for a person to buy velvet for a quilt from a fabric store. \nb) Fabric stores are known for their wide variety of quality materials (from regular weight material to sheer and laces), including Velvet. They will be glad to help you create what you want from one of their wide selections of materials.\n\n\n<br>", "answer": "E: fabric store"}

While this is an item which holds eggs, it is a smaller object that is portable, and it may not be the most likely place for eggs to be held.\n4) Option C: Box. Not exactly sure what kind of box we are talking about here, but it could be a box that is transportable from shelves and could be holding the eggs.\n5) Option E: Hen House.

Choices \"sanded\" (B), \"warp\" (D) and  \"petrify\" (E) are all related to the creation of the wood or its degradation, but not the discovery of petrified wood. \"Composted\" (C) is a metaphor used to describe wood rotting away but it is not directly involved with the discovery of petrification. \n3) Only two answers are left: \"Sanded\" (B) and \"hardened\" (A).\n4) \"Sanded\" is related to the discovery of petriform wood because wood can be sanded down, but petrified wood must necessarily be hardened to remain a fossil for a long time.\n5) Therefore the final answer is \"A: Sanded.\"\nSo the final answer to this Input is A: sanded\n\nInput: What is the opposite of wearing a bunny outfit?

'New Hampshire' is a state in the northeast region of the US, but is not directly related to the situation of the dog being lost.\n5. Therefore we are left with 'Coffin' (D) and 'Denmark' (E). These may be viable locations, but they require further verification.\n6. A 'cofin' is a container for a corpse. 'Denmark' was a country in Europe about four centuries ago, but is no longer in existence.

When you want to grocery shopping, you have to do some home preparation (such as cleaning and shopping list), but food is not directly involved.\n4. As for the other choices, you can cook from home-cooked food, you can read a book to prepare for food, and you can write the recipe and read the ingredients from a book. You can also eat from the grocery store, but this has no relation to the home shopping. The last option is also not relevant because you will have to groom any food once you buy it at the grocery store.\n5.

{"text": "1: When investigating this question, we recognize that each choice has three sub-topics. These sub-topics are usually associated with the overall topic. In this case, \"What body of water is typical shallow water?\" \"Aquarium\" has fish, \"Swimming\" has humans, and \"Pond\" has frogs and other wildlife. We thus conclude that \"Aquarium\" is the correct answer. \n2: Next, we examine whether the options are actually shallow water. Each option only has sub-categories associated with deeper water. Option \"Aquariums\" (A) is the smallest body of water. Option \"Pond\" (E) is also the smallest body of water, but also has frogs and other animals in it, so isn't associated with only shallow water. Option \"Ponds\" (E) is larger than the others and also contains frogs and other animals, and thus, is the largest body of water covered by this question. Option \"Lake\" (B) and option \"Lakes\" (B) are the midrange body of water size, where \"Lake\" (b) is the smaller of the two, and \"Lakes\" (b) is larger than \"Lake\" (A). Option \"Swimming Pool\" (D) is the largest body of the smallest body of water (aquarium) which is where the water in aquariums is from. Aquariums can obviously contain water from other places, but swimming pools are often created specifically to contain water from other sources. Aquariums are also not typically used with any wildlife, and swimming pools are designed for people to enter, resulting in a greater need for shallow water, like in aquariums, and making option (D) the correct answer.\n3: The question now asks us to identify the most probable answer. The most probable answer is clearly the one that is associated most closely with shallow water. Option (D) is the only option that involves water created onsite. This makes option (D) the most probable answer.\n4: Let's consider more options. Option (A) is the closest to a larger body of water, because the smallest body of water is also the closest to a lake.

Lastly, the last and final remaining answer \"among nice people\" (E) is the least likely. This is because the question asks \"The banjo finds its history in the Caribben, but it's most famous where?\" There is no implication of popularity, making the answer choice incorrect.\n4. So, the answer choices left are: \"Among Nice People\" (E) and \"Jug band\" (D).\n5. \"Jug band\" refers to instrument band and this is clearly incorrect because the banjo does not refer to a band, and the question is about where it is most famous, not most commonly.\n6. \"Among nice people\" (D) is technically an answer, but it's also clearly wrong. This means: \"Where is the banjo most famous among nice people?\". Nice people tend not to care too much about banjo, making the answer technically correct. However,  this is not what the question is asking because the question is clearly asking for \"The banjo finds it the most famous in the Carribean\".

There is also still the possibility that he might buy it at home depot or walmart.

It does not make sense for smoke to happen one hour after a pizza is put in the oven. \nNext, option B can be eliminated because it is not appropriate to catch a cold an hour after the oven on and pizza are mentioned. \nOption C is also an unlikely activity 3. Option D could be correct, but it's hard to know for sure whether someone will look angry, so it eliminates an element of certainty and is not a definite answer choice. \nLastly, 4.

It does not specify if the savings are on a checking, savings, or another account, which would affect the timeline.\nTherefore, 5.

The vehicle owner can easily install an app on their phone to keep track of whether their license plate is stolen. They can also look online to locate their license plate\u2019s vehicle number, as this will correspond to the license plate that was stolen. Additionally, if the license plate is lost, they can look online to see if the local police have received a report of the license plate\u2019s theft and check with their car insurance company.\n2. A vehicle GPS does not track whether a license plate is stolen; instead, it tracks where the vehicle is going. \n3. A signboard alone won\u2019t provide any additional information on whether a license plate has been stolen, because it simply lists names, so a thief could add their name as the owner of the car and it wouldn\u2019t be an indication of a problem.\n4.

{"text": "The man set the coffee cup on the table. Even though the tabletop did not have legs, it did not break. This tells us that the table was not made entirely of glass. The man had either nothing on the table, or possibly a book, depending on the context. If the man set his hand on the table for something to balance it, the cup would have fallen off the table when he removed his hand.\n 1. Let'a first look at the wording of the question. \"He didn't have...\" means that the man in fact had a cup, or is in possession of the cup atleast. Also, the sentence states that the man \"lacked the what to balance\" (not \"lacked nothing\" but specifically \"the what to balance\").\n 2. Now let's look at the clues. The first clue we see is that the man did not have what to balance the cup on. This means that the table or surface was not made of something that could be balanced on. This can only mean it's either made of solid wood or glass. If it was made of solid wood, the man set the cup down and it would have either broken or become unbalanced once removed from whatever surface it was on.\n 3. The man had no book with pages to balance the cup or nothing else to put beneath it. When the man did finally move the cup, it would have fallen either onto the surface that it was previously set on or onto the floor. This means that the surface had to not have legs but be flat enough for the cup to not fall if moved.\n 4. The cup itself most likely was held by some type of coaster, not the legs of the table, since there were no legs. This can be inferred because the cup was \"balanced\" and still existed. Had it been held by the ends of the legs, the cup would have likely fallen off when removed.\nBased on this analysis, the answer to the question is C: coaster.\nSo the final solution that is c: coaster", "answer": "D: skill"}

We know \"jewlery box\" is not it. \"Neck\" is not the answer because \"jewelery box\" contains jewelary. \"Neck\" refers to jewelary in general.\n4. The answer is \"jewelery boutique\", because jewelery boutique contains jewelary of all types. \"Jewelary\" is the common term referring to all types of jewelry and includes chokers.

The question is asking for the most specific location possible, so in the best scenario, you should choose the answer that will allow you to use the location in a sentence. \n2. Each answer choice is a different location. The first answer, \"Mouth\" (B) is not a place. The second answer, \"Grocery Cart\" (C) is too generalized. \"Supermarket\" (D) contains supermarkets, which is another general term for grocery stores, so it isn't more specific than C. Finally, \"Fruit Basket\" (E) is not a location.\n3. The remaining answer, \"Checkout\" (A), is specific and allows you to use the location \"checkout\" in a sentence, such as \"After checking out, I put the fruit inside my cart.\"\n4. Therefore, the answer must be A: Checkout. \nSo the final answer and correct answer is A: checkout\n\nInput: What are the chances of getting three spades in a row while playing blackjack?

So, \u201cfun drivers\u201d lead (to) no accidents.\n4. \u201cIllegal drivers\u201d cause accidents, so \u201cillegal drivers\u201d lead (to).\n5. \u201cDeadly drivers\u201d cause accidents on purpose, so they cause \u201cdeadly accidents.\u201d They are not just ordinary accidents, which are caused (by) stressful, dangerous, fun and illegal drivers. \u201cDeadly accidents\u201d are caused (by) \u201cdeadly drivers.\u201d\nSo the final answer are D: deadly drivers\n\nInput: What would you do in a place like this where there are people but they are not moving?

As the evacuatiuon became mandatory, the law stated people must evacuate. \n3) Option C: The TV started broadcasting a soap opera. As the evacuatioin became mandatory, the TV could not air any broadcasts regarding mandatory evacuations, which excluded soap operas. \n4) Option D: The TV began broadcastin the law. This is incorrect because if a TV began broadcasting the mandaotry evacuation law, Choice E: elective would be false because mandatory is not optional.\n5) Choice E: Options E: Elective.

{"text": "1 Let's examine each choice and try to eliminate the wrong ones.\n2. \"Branch\" might suggest many subordinate employees, so we rule out \"subordinate\" (B), as we already know it was the branch that was yelling.\n3. If it was a \"subordinate\", then it would obviously be a subordinate who was yelling and not the boss.\n4. While a \"base\" might be yelling, it's more likely that the manager or owner of the office is the one yelling. Also, a base has little to do an office.\n5. While a \"point\" might seem logical, it has nothing to do with an office.\n6. As for \"owner\", they might yell as owners, but they are generally not the ones who work in the office.\n7. Lastly, \"yelling at a base\", wouldn't be a \"yelling\", so the only choice left is \"Owner\", who is likely the boss and head of the branch.So the final answer is Owner\n\nInput: Which animal will be hunted for food this week? Choices: 1: A: Elephant 2: B: Camel 3: C: Lion 4: D: Sheep 5: E: Monkey\nOutput: 1: Let's examine the animal selections based on what would be the food for this week.\n2. Let see if animals are hunted for food and not for meat in a slaughterhouse or eaten at restaurants.\n3. Also, it must be a single animal and not various animals because the choice is about an individual animal being hunted this week instead of several animals.\n4. While animals could be a food source depending on where you are, it could also be due to a survival situation like in the desert. So if an animal is being hunted for food, it can likely still be hunted because there is always something.\n5. If animal is hunted for food, then it goes without saying that it can't also be meat due to contradiction and it needs to be eaten instead of it's meat.\n6. Therefore, \"E: Monkey\" is the actual answer for \"A\" for the reason \"Monkeys are always hunted for food as it is the main part of their diet\". \n7. After that, \"", "answer": "C: subordinate"}

Choices:  C: their fingers B: the roads D: the street E: their ears A: their legs F: their lungs\nOutput: 1) Let's examine each choice individually to see how they relate to running. \n2. The streets and roads are not what people are using when they are running, but are likely the locations they run in.\n3. The same point can be made for Option E: ears. Running is not a form of listening and ears are not used in running. \n4. Option F: lungs is also incorrect because running is not connected to the use of lungs. \n5. Option A: legs is incorrect because this is not being used when running is performed. \n6. But legs are actually necessary for running and therefore, the only option left to choose is Answer choice B: \"their fingers\". Fingers are used in running. Fingers are required for a runner to keep a rhythm and for controlling their body. \nSo the correct answer is: B: the fingers.\n\nInput: I will be walking down this street, where there are going to __________ cats.

This is a possibility because playing with a dog is fun. \n5) Option D: Playing dead. This is an incorrect response because a dog playing dead is not a result of playing with them.\n6) Option E: Black. This is an incorrect result because it refers to color, not being alive.\n7) Thus, Option D is incorrect because dogs can play dead.\n8) That means the remaining options are A: having fun, B: active, C: playing, and D: playing dead. 9) However, we must look at the whole sentence and understand that \"you play around with dogs\" and that the result is \"they will have fun\". 10) Therefore, Option B: Active, is incorrect because it does not cause fun; D: Playing dead, is a correct answer because it causes fun; and Option C: Playing is also a correct answer because it would encourage fun if it happened\n\nSo the final answer to \"When you play around with a dog they will have?\" Is:\n11.)

{"text": "1) If you are getting paid, you are feeling the emotion of payment, which presumably causes happiness. If you are not getting paid, you are not experiencing the emotion of payment. Therefore, if you get paid, you feel a mixture of happiness and sorrow. \n2) If you get paid, you might feel an emotion like income tax, but this question is asking about a time you got paid. Therefore, this answer is not useful. \n3) The emotion of \"ocean\" (E) would not be the same as getting a paycheck. That answer is therefore not the correct one. If you pay someone a paycheck, they don't suddenly start to feel like they are in an ocean. (It's also possible that money can make you feel like you're in an ocean, but we are dealing with a time when you have a paycheck in mind, not after you have paid someone with one.) \n4) The emotion of a bill collector (D) to happy (A) is too extreme to be the correct answer. It sounds like a strange way to feel about bills, although it does sound possible. However, the question is asking about a feeling when you get paid, so the bill collector to happy (A) answer is not relevant to the question. \n5) Satisfaction is not the answer because it is not an emotion that you feel when you get paid. It is an emotion that would follow after the event of getting paid. The question is asking to be more specific about what you feel like when you get paid. Therefore, there are two emotions that logically follow: happiness and sorrow. This is demonstrated by the phrases \"happily paid\" and \"paid to go away\", meaning that one could theoretically be paid to do something. \n6) Thus, the answer is B: satisfaction.\nSo the final ans is:B: satisfaction\n\nInput: I always feel happy when I leave my job at 2:00 AM.

{"text": "1) Choice A (was). This choice is incorrect because was is the past tense version of the word is (not present tense). \"The was demolished...\" doesn't make sense, and therefore, choice A is incorrect.\n2) Choice D (lot).

{"text": "1) The key in this question is that the answer will be a single word that describes the emotional state of a person if they aren't glad, downcast, angry, etc.\n2. Looking at the answers carefully, we can see that they each describe specific types of negative emotions.\n3. Choices A and B can be eliminated as they aren't general enough to describe a person's emotional state if they aren't in a positive mood.\n4. As far as positive emotions, \"Glad\" (A) is an obvious answer, but we need to be sure that the answer isn't too restrictive to only gladness. \"Cheerful\" (C) is a broader alternative, so we can eliminate Choice B. \n5. Looking at negative emotions, Choices D and E are too specific and are too far apart in terms of negativity to be a good potential answer.\n6. Option A: Depressed refers to a person who experiences depressed feelings or an inability to experience pleasure through lack of emotional well-being. It can be a physical or mental condition and can describe many different emotional states in a range from mild to severe. This is the correct choice as it can describe a range of emotional states that would fit if the person isn't in a good mood.\nSo the final awnser is A: Depressed", "answer": "A: depressed"}

There are many types of flowers, but most of them are small and don't have pollen. \n6: Option E: Orchard is a collection of many types of flowers.

{"text": "1.\"Where would a lizard _surprise_ a person?\" (This is the question statement, which is important to remember.) That is, where would the lizard surprise someone. A \"surprise\" is a sudden change of state or development.\n2. Looking at each option, we see that Choices B, C, and E have nothing to do with sudden changes. \"Forrest\" (B) has no relevance to this question since it's not a change. \"Desert\" (C) is also off the mark since a lizard is not as likely to surprise someone in a flat, dry environment. Likewise, \"Creek\" (D) is also not relevant since creeks are relatively calm bodies of water and are unlikely to present sudden changes in a person's mind.\n3. Of the remaining options, \"New Mexico\" (A) is the most plausible. New Mexico is known for the desert lizard, which is a popular source of entertainment. People travel far to see lizards in New Mexico, and there is a lot of mystery in the desert lizard. Perhaps they are larger than expected? Or different-coloured than expected? No one can be sure as they are elusive creatures.\n4. Finally, \"Garden\" (E) does not work as a lizard can be a surprise in a garden. However, an uncommon lizard might draw attention and inspire awe which is not what a surprise is.\n5. Thus, the answer choice is \"New Mexico\".\nSo the final answer choice is A: New Mexico\n\nInput: What two things are most likely found at the bottom of a chalkboard?

There are three scenarios which will not serve us, as they are not the best suited for someone at their best:\n2.1) Choice A: office. Work environments can vary widely, from high pressure and unpleasant to relaxed and enjoyable. This does not mean that everyone is at their best in an office, or that people become their best while in an office.\n2.2) Choice B: School. This too, is a large setting with wildly varying environments. Similarly, it is not always possible for people to be at their best in a school setting, as there are many scenarios which could make a person feel less than at their best.\n3. Two more scenarios are much better suited for a person at their best:\n3.1) Choice C: sports stadium. A sports stadium is a very large, loud venue where a vast range of crowds and emotions are possible. It is a high-adrenaline, competitive environment ideal for a person to be at their best and take on the challenge, and one is certainly not confined to the stadium.\n3.2) Choice D: music festival. Similar to a sports", "answer": "E: refrigerator"}

{"text": "1) The question suggests that there can be many books to learn something, yet only one is required to work efficiently.\n2) Among the choices we can eliminate those that do not have the right book to work efficiently. Options C and D indicate tools for learning or becoming knowledgeable, but it isn't clear whether they are a prerequisite to work efficiently. Option A indicates improve yourself, which could be a benefit in a work setting, but isn't the most important for work efficiency. Options B and E also do not seem to pertain specifically to the job task.\n3) With that in mind, option B is more clearly the answer because it states \"become knowledgeable\" as necessary for work efficiency.\nSo the Final answer is choose B, be knowledgeable.\nThus the final answer is B: become knowledgeable\n\nInput: What does the word \"firmly\" suggest? Choices: \t A: insecurity B: a question C: the absence of strength D: weakness \t E: weakly\t\nOutput: 1.) The word \"firmly\", as it appears in the question, suggests weakness, as evidenced by its synonyms as provided by Merriam-Webster:  firmly. a : to a firm b : (1) deeply (2): with force; especially : (2) (with oblique motion) deeply (3) : with resolute determination (source: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/firm 2.) The words listed in choices A and B cannot be inferred to suggest weakness. Choice E is incorrect because the question indicates that it is \"the absence of strength that firmly suggests something\" - so the answer is the opposite of its connotation here.\n3.) Considering D and E together, they have commonalities of \"weak and without\" and both can be excluded. Next, Choice C is not clear, but we can eliminate it as there are no similarities (either positively or negatively) to the answer's connotation.\n4.) Choice F is the most probable answer as it matches up with the word's connotation, which states, \"without weakness, with confidence\". Although this connotation could apply to other words, including \"confidently\" or \"strongly\", it is unlikely that these could be used in a", "answer": "C: have tools"}
{"text": "1.\"If you want to make big splash in river with rock from where should you throw\" In this question, we are given information that a rock should be thrown in a river. We also know a big splash will occur. This implies the river is large enough to contain a big splash and that throwing the rock is the only option to cause a splash. This, in turn, implies that the ground is not an option which we already know. As a result, we can eliminate choice C: \"ground\". We also know the rock should be thrown from a location and not simply dropped because dropped rocks do not cause splashes. This, in turn implies that all places of the same physical height such as the surface of the earth are also not options. From these pieces of information that we know, we can eliminate choices \"mountains\" (A), \"countryside\" (B), and \"surface of earth\" (E). \n2. That leaves us with two options: \"Mountain range\" (D) and the \"Bridge\" (E). Bridge can be a good option because bridges offer a path to a body of water, but it doesn't offer the biggest splash. Mountain range can work as well because it has a large body of water, but we may need the strength to throw a rock across a large space. As a result, it's difficult to choose since they both are options and both have advantages and disadvantages. Comparing the options, we would probably choose the mountain range because throwing a rock from a mountain range would be easier than throwing across a large body of water. Throwing across a body of water would provide a big splash, but we would be trying to do it from a location where people wouldn't be. Therefore, the best answer is D: mountain range.\nAs a result, the final answer is D : Mountain range\n##### Part Two:\nInput: Why do people wear shoes? Choices: 1. To protect their feet from sharp objects, 2. Pain, 3. To not wear boots, 4. To be comfortable, 5. To look fashionable, 6. To be protected by boots, 7. To cause less impact to the earth\nOutput: Based on the information we've been given, shoes should protect the foot from pain caused by sharp objects, from sharp objects, and cause less impact", "answer": "C: bridge"}
{"text": "1) Begin by understanding what the questions are asking. It's obvious that food is likely to be found in food places but this question is focused on where to find food in a city. Because food takes up less space, one can only expect to find food in certain \"buildings.\" \n2) Eliminate the options which do not directly tie into the answer: Option C: building: A building would just be any structure such as a house, hotel, or mansion but is not necessarily where one would find food. \n3) Choice option A: opera: An opera is not only a place but also an art form involving singing so it does not contain food. \n4) Eliminate option choice B: supermarket: a place that can only contain actual food and not food related items. \n5) Option choice D: Apartment: A place to live but not a place that would typically have food. \n6) Lastly, we are left with three choices that are plausibly locations to find food. \n7) Based on all the information that has been analyzed, the answer has to be Option E: Conference: Conferences typically have food to serve attendees.\nSo the final option will be E : conference.", "answer": "B: supermarket"}
{"text": "1: Let's look at each individual choice and determine the answer choice based on what is asked. \"Where do you buy tickers at the ticket booth for games?\" \n2: This is a place asking question, so we need to answer \"Where do you buy ticket booth for games?\", rather than \"What is the ticket booth for the games\". The answer choice that best matches the question is \"A: ticketing booth\".\n3: A train station (B) is not used for gaming. A cathedral (C) may have tickets for events such as concerts, and they may sometimes even have tickets for games, but a cathedral (C) is a church building, not a gaming venue. A metro station (D) is a subway or bus transit station. Not all subway or bus stations have a ticket booth, but sometimes they do. Like churches, subway and bus stations may have tickets for games and other events. However, since this question is asking specifically about sports games, this answer is not correct.\n4: At the fairgrounds (E), you can buy anything from food to games. However, fairgrounds (E) are not specifically a place for gaming and are unlikely to contain a ticket booth for gaming purposes.\n5: An amusement park (F) could potentially have gaming equipment and ticket booths for that gaming equipment. However, it is unlikely that you would buy tickets for a sporting game at the amusement park.\n6: The correct answer here is \"A: ticket booth\". This answer is the only one that includes the key word \"tickets\", which further narrows the answer since many places offer tickets for things other than events or games. This is the only answer that includes both a venue and a location.\nSo the final is A: ticket booths", "answer": "D: fairgrounds"}
{"text": "1) Begin by understanding what the query is asking. The answer must contain electric fans.\n2) All the other choices contain a cool room.\n3) The next question is, where might Cool people like?\n4) The only choice missing is B: Hardware store. Cool people probably wouldn't have too many fans at home, since it's too hot to have electric fans at home, but not as cool as a Hardware store.\n5) Therefore, the answer is B: Hardware Store. \nSo the final answer also is B: Hardwarestore\n\nInput:A place that will get your attention if you're in a hurry at 4am? Choices:  C: show E: a car F: traffic G: airport\nOutput:1. Let's look at the choices and eliminate what shouldn't be the answer. For example, \n2. B: \"Home\" will not get your attention at 4 AM because most people are sleeping.\n3. D: \"Taxi\" will not get your atention because it involves a person who is not in a rush at 4 AM.\n4. G: \"Airport\" could potentially get your attention because of the many people who travel through airports, but it is far-fetched and inefficient.\n5. That leaves us with four options: \nC: Show,  E: Car, F: Traffic, G: Airport.\n6. Let's narrow it down first by eliminating the choices that couldn't be the right answer due to their inability to get a person's attention. \n7. D: \"Show\" has nothing to do with a person moving through it quickly at 4 AM. Therefore, it is not an option. \n8. F: \"Traffic.\" Traffic would not get a person's atention at 4 AM because everyone is not in a rushed state at this time.\n9. G: \"Airlport\" could potentially get someone's attention because it is a public transportation hub, but it is also far-fetched.\n10. This leaves us with Choices: \nC: \"Show,\" E: \"Car,\" and G: \"Airprt.\" \n11. We can eliminate G from the answer by examining the logic behind the question. If a", "answer": "A: home"}

{"text": "1) Choice D is not possible. What is eaten is an \"it\". In contrast, wood is an inanimate object.\n2) The \"done\" part shows that \"to\" is a preposition.\n\n3) Choice B (carved) requires an inanimate object to be carved. In contrast, Choice C (polished) needs \"wood\" to be polished, which would not be inanimate. Choice A (nailed) also requires \"wood\" to be \"nailed\", but this still leaves inanimate wood. \n\n4) Choice E (petrify) is the correct answer because petrify requires the action of \"petrification\", which can only occur to living beings. Wood is inanimate, and does not petrify, therefore it would not be \"petrified\".\n5) Therefore, the answer is E: Petrify.\nSo the final choice is E: Petrified\n\nInput: Where would you typically find a group of people enjoying a meal where the table is shared or served at communally? Choices: A: diner B: catered C: buffet D: restaurant E: private dining\nOutput: Where would you typically  find a group of people eating at a communal table? Choices include A: diner, B: catered, C: buffet, D: restaurant, and E: private dining. Diner is not correct because you wouldn\u2019t  find a communal table in that setting. Likewise, catered, buffet, and restaurant are not correct since they are not typical places for you to  find a communal setting, and it\u2019s a specific scenario to the type of restaurant.\nE: private dining is the answer because private dining is a room that holds a single communal table within a restaurant.\n\nInput: How could you get out of the house without leaving it?

{"text": "2. In order to analyze the options, first try to determine if they are relevant and directly answer the question. \"Video game\" (B) does not seem appropriate, as video games are not actual physical structures. That eliminates two choices quickly and leaves four. However, \"total number\" (E) also does not seem relevant, as it only refers to a list of quantities. \n3. Comparing the remaining options, \"building\" (D) is the only one that could refer to a structure with multiple levels. For example, a skyscraper or apartment building will typically have multiple levels. \n4. In contrast, options \"garage\" (C) and \"carpenter's shop\" (A) are only one level. \n5. Thus, the only answer choice that meets the criteria is \"building\" (D).\nSo the final answer has the choice D: building.", "answer": "C: garage"}
{"text": "1.\"John and Jane were a cohesive couple when beginning their relationship. Then, they wanted to make themselves even closer with each other. For this reason, there were several ways for them to do this.\n2. Option A: Have Sex. This is not the correct answer because this would not make them any closer. This is just a physical act and doesn't change the level of intimacy.\n3. Option B: Plan to marry. This choice implies that they are indeed close enough to consider being more intimate, but there is no guarantee that this outcome would occur.\n4. Option C: Dance. The answer could be either this option or the next one, but it implies that John and Jane liked to take this action. But again, this isn't about being the most intimate, it's about being so intimate with each other that they wanted to make the relationship even more personal.\n5. Option D: Electrical Circuit. This option seems like what the question wants because an electrical circuit involves two items connected in some way that creates an overall product.\n6. But then, it's revealed that there would not be any intimacy or connection between John and Jane by this circuit. Instead, the items are merely electrified when connected to each other, but there is no relationship between the two.\nHence, the answer is E: Row about \nSo the final answer \"Row about\"", "answer": "B: plan to marry"}
{"text": "1) The correct choice that is not mentioned in the options is C: driving (A).\n2) Driving, also known as \"moving your car during the required period of time\", is not one of the options mentioned, but the correct answer.\n3) \"Towed\" (A) only happens if your car is on the street, and even then it is not automatically required. \n4) \"Accidents\" (B) do not occur specifically because of not moving your car during a time period, but rather because of other circumstances, such as weather or an emergency. \n5) \"Getting a ticket\" (E) is something that could happen, but not specifically to a driver who does not move their car during an allotted period.

{"text": "1: The question is asking us for something that generally describes how a game is on sale compared to not being on sale.\n2: Some important terms to understand are \"on sale\" and \"typically\". \"On sale\" means that the game is lower in price for a limited time. \"Typically\" means that this is something that generally happens. \n3: Let's eliminate the incorrect answers. The game is not \"buying\" (B) because this can be at any time of purchase, whether or not the game is on sale. \"Overpriced\" (D) is not correct because this does not generally describe how a game is on a sale, but rather a different value. Also, \n4: we can't say that the game is \"expensive\" (E) because this is not related to \"on sale\". \n5: Lastly, we are left with \"way too much\" (C) because this describes perfectly how the game is normally priced.

Polishing is for shiny or reflective surfaces, like mirrors or metal appliances. Since shining is just polishing with the right amount of pressure, polishing is an invalid choice. \n6 Option B: Wiping. Wiping requires the removal of surface debris with a towel, so this option is incorrect.\n7 Option C: Squeezing.

People do not usually stand at the intersection before turning on the fork in the road because they would need to wait for the path to a particular place to clear before turning.\n6 Therefore the best answer is \"Street corner,\" (B), which is the most likely answer, as people would tend not to be near the intersection due to its complicated layout and require people to stop before proceeding through.\nSo the final answers is B: Street corner", "answer": "C: street corner"}

This implies that friends would not be concerned with where the boy had gone, but instead, they would be worried about his well-being.\n3: This leaves us with \"the boy\" (2) and \"a bad odor\" (A).\nIt doesn't make sense for a young boy to worry about his odor, and it doesn't make sense to be worried for his well-being if he smells bad.\n4: If a young boy says, \"I'm in my bathroom,\" or \"I'm in toilet,\" it is unlikely that he will be worried about a bad smell.\n5: It's also unlikely that the boy is worried about his bathroom being broken, because young kids usually don't understand the mechanics involved in water transportation in a home and how toilets work.\n6: If a young boy uses a bad word, they are likely just joking or speaking in slang.\n7: A young boy won't be worried about not washing his hair, because he isn't grown up yet.\nTherefore, \"he wouldn't wash his head\" (E) is the most likely answer that a friend would be worried about, and indeed, they often check up on what the boy is doing.\nSo the final answers will be E: he wouldn't wash (E), and E: he wouldn'st wash (E).", "answer": "E: feelings"}

However, it could be the result of many other actions or choices. \n5) Choice C: riot does not happen as a result of a conversation about an embarrassing incident and must be disregarded, since there may be other reasons someone would try to lead a riot. \n6) Choice D: bad dreams could be a result of embarrassment, and there is a strong connection between the two, so this is probably the correct answer.\nSo the final correct answer is D: bad dreams", "answer": "B: emotional distress"}

Downtown has roads and sidewalks which are more suited for pedestrians and bikes rather than cars. We'll eliminate Choice B.\n4. A building is a place, as opposed to something you put in a garage, so we'll remove Choice C.\n5. Tool storage is a place, as it's where you'd store tools, but not a place you'd put a car. This narrows it down to Choice E which fits the question.\n6. We have a winner! James needed a garage because of where he spent a lot of his money: on a car.\n7. This means the answer choice is E: car.\nSo the final  answer is E: car\n\nInput: It is likely the best option has a question mark.What does the best option mean here? Choices:  B: the best one C: probably the best D: the most likely E: possibly the best\nOutput: 1  The key here is the term \"best\", which means that the entire answer must be examined. Let's examine the different possibilities:\n2. Choice B, \"best one\", could refer to anything: a car, school grades, an election, anything at all.\n3. Choices C and D also have broad meanings and could apply to anything.\n4. Only choice E is highly specific in the way that it describes the \"best option\".

{"text": "1.\"Where do you sit in a chair in order to watch four-leg animals complete the race?\"\n2.\"Reading the textbook or homework of a four-leg animals.\"\n3.\"Watching dogs or cats, etc. play at their house.\"\n4.\"Go to a race track that has those animals and find a space to sit in.\"\n5.Let's use a little reverse engineering and work backwards. In the question itself \"watch\" comes first. What would you consider watching something first? It would probably mean that you would go to a place to see animals. What would that place be? A race track. Then the animals would complete the race first. A race track for animals to run in is not the correct option, so that eliminates option D. That also doesn't rule out option E since a building that has animals in it to perform would be logical with an option being a building, however they are probably not going to be racing. That eliminates option E as well. \n6. Let's move on to word order. The question asks where you would sit (as in the position) in a chair. That means that you would not be watching the animals in any other position. All the options (with the exception of A, E, and F) include some form of the word \"watch\" or \"see\" which means they fit the rules.\n7.\"Race tracks\" and \"four-leg animals\" are not the same thing, so that eliminates our choice of A. The same reasoning can eliminate choice B because books and chairs are not the same. \n8. \"House\" would include pets, and so it would allow you to \"watch\" those, however you would not be \"watching the animals complete.\" \n9. \"Friend's house\" means it is the same thing as the race track. The race track would be the place to sit and the friend's house would be the place with the animals. \n10.\"Chair\" is not the same as a house.\n11. \"Chair\" includes an animal for a position, however the position is not for watching the animal complete.\n12.\"Bookstore\" would only be a place to find animal books, which isn't the same thing as finding animals to \"watch.\"\n13. \"Watching the four-legged animals and complete the race\" is", "answer": "C: race track"}
{"text": "1) First, determine exactly what it is that the question is asking. The statement \"people expressing themselves\" implies that they are talking, and the term \"break their leg\" indicates that there has been an injury.\n2) Eliminate Choices that aren't related directly to expressing oneself. \"Communication\" (B) is not the answer because communication is the activity of sending and receiving data. While tripping and breaking a leg could potentially be an expression of communication, it is neither directly related to people expressing themselves, nor to breaking a leg.\n3) We will now eliminate options that don't fit the statement in the question. \"Pain\" (C) would be a related expression, but breaking your leg doesn't necessarily cause pain because it depends on the severity of the break. \"Laughter\" (D) is an inappropriate response to breaking your leg as it wouldn't be something you'd say in front of an audience. \"Embarrassment\" (E) is also not the answer because being embarrassed by an injury would be a private response, as the question asks what is displayed in front of a crowd.\n4) Now, look at the other answers. The statements in the remaining options are all correct. Thus, the answer must be A: Embarrassment.\nSo the final  answer is A: Embarrassnment\n\nInput: Why do birds always fly south when the weather's getting chilly? Choices: 1) A: Because they're trying to relocate. 2) B: Because it's the optimal time of year for migration. 3) C: Because they're cold-blooded. 4) D: Because they're looking for sheltered rookeries. 5) E: None of these choices is correct. \nOutput: 7) The first step is to recognize the question's statement about birds. \"Always fly south\" implies that they know where to go (south) and they do it in every instance. Therefore, birds don't have any problem with relocating or finding rookeries.\n8) We'll now eliminate choices that are not related to the question's statement. \"Trying to relocate\" (A) is a state of being for birds, not an action that birds take. \"Optimum time\"", "answer": "E: embarrassment"}
{"text": "1.\"What could a balala\u00efka be needed for?\" The main clue here is that the word \u201cused\u201d is used, which implies a previous time frame where the balalaliaka was needed for something.\n2. Examining the available options, we see two good possibilities.\n3. Choices B: music store and D: symphony E. are not good answers because we are not considering their current use.\n4. Option B: music store is not the correct answer because a balaliika is a Russian instrument. If we are considering the location of the instrument, it wouldn't be a great answer; however, if the balalaliaka is in a music store, that would be a possible use. \n5. Similarly, Option D: symphony is not the correct answer since again, it is mentioning a current use, or symphony, while the question is asking for a previous use for the instrument.\n6. Moving on, we can eliminate Options C: singing and E: orchestra because the instrument can\u2019t be a singer nor could it be used in an orchestra, both of which are current uses and don\u2019t follow the time frame mentioned in the clue. \n7. Looking back at the two remaining choices, one is a location and one is a state of being: B: music store and A: artist junk yard. \n8. Option A: artist junk yar is the best answer because an artist who uses the Balalalka as their instrument would likely store it in their junkyard, since it is not currently in use.\nSo the final answers is A: artist junk yards.\n\nInput: The candy company's mascot has the following features: it's covered in chocolate, it's covered in strawberries, it has a hat on its head that would fit a small girl.

{"text": "1: The best way to analyze this question and answer is by looking at each answer choice individually and then comparing it to the key phrases in the question.\n2. Option A: Cause death. This answer choice is irrelevant to our question because it doesn't specifically include negative outcomes.\n3. Option B: Injury. This option is incorrect because it's the injury itself that is the injury, and not the outcome of an injury. \n4. Option C: Falling down. This is not the worst possible outcome because a fallen person is still alive and relatively well, as is evidenced by their not being dead.\n5. Option D: Infection. This could either be an injury on its own, or a side effect of an injury. Therefore, this is also not the answer.\n6. Last option E: claim insurance. This is the answer to the question because it's the worst possible outcome because the injured person is still not dead in this choice.

It's important to have fun in learning, but that's not the key point. If someone disliked learning, they wouldn't be able to find the process fun.\n4. C) \"Joyful\" is a feeling of happiness. Someone who disliked learning would probably not be able to find the experience joyful.\n5. D) Something that is \"very important\" is usually what people care about. However, if someone does not like to learn, it can be seen as a negative quality, as opposed to a positive one. \n6. E) Something that is \"free\" is something that does not cost money or time. However, if someone disliked learning in one class, this would not solve the problem by letting them take another class for free. \n7. By ruling out all the above options, it's clear that the right answer is \"painful\".\nIf someone disliked learning and didn't want to continue, they would stop. This process would be painful, as it involves a major change to one's habits.\nSo the final choice would be D: very important\n\nInput: What is more important when playing a video game: the gameplay or the difficulty or both?

Choices: \tA: parking pass B: parking violation C: parking space D: parking meter E: automobile \nOutput: 1 The key to answering this question is understanding what the term \"lost car license\" means. When a person loses their car license, they do not get their license back, but they can get a new license or a new photo.\n2. This question is only describing what a person who has lost their license gets back while they are out of a car license.\n3. After recognizing this fact, the options don't actually matter, though they do help you understand what a \"lost car license\" really means. \"A: parking pass.\" A parking pass is not a car license, so this is not what you get back.\n4. \"B: parking violation.\" A parking violation is not a car license either.\n5. \"C: parking space.\" A parking space is a spot to park your car, and a car license is not a parking space. \"D: parking meter.\" A parking meter is not a car license.\n6. \"E: automobile.\" This is the only option that is actually related to car licenses, but you cannot get it back when you've lost your license - you only get a new one.\n7.

{"text": "1.. Firstly, let's understand what is asking. When a sign has a bunch of people lined up next it, it must be that the sign leads to people being present in a particular line in a particular place. From this information, we can eliminate the answers that don't deal with the presence of human beings in a particular line somewhere. Choice \"Bus stop\" (B) involves a place to wait for the bus with the people standing. But since we are looking for where the sign leads to a line of people, this is not applicable. Likewise, choice \"Street corner\" (C) and choice \"Roadblock\" (D) do not involve groups of people on a line, as these are only locales where people are standing.\n2. Thus, we must consider choice \"Fast food drive thru\" (E) in order to determine if there is a sign next to it, and if there is a line of people in this place.\n3.

As is the case with this question, some concepts may be hidden, requiring the reader to actively seek them out.\n2) Here we can easily understand that we're being asked about a particular card game, presumably because it is part of a larger card session.\n3) What is our best guess as to the emotional context of the game? The first word to look at is the word whole, which refers to a family unit. Since the family is playing cards, we would expect them to be happy.\n4) To confirm that the family is happy in this scenario, we examine the following questions. Are they sad? No. Do the cards have anything to do with how happy everyone is? No. Do the words in the previous question actually affect their mental well-being? No.\n5) Lastly, we arrive on the conclusion that the family is indeed content and happy. This makes sense because the question states that it is, in fact, full of joy. This supports the idea that happiness is linked to card games, which we can infer because it says \"they were\".\n\nSo the final answer to this question is B: happiness\n\nInput: If I was to purchase a car, I would need to go to the car dealer, or?

Thus, if the ambassador were going to visit, it would be the monarchy instead of the throne room.\n6)D: Monarchy : The most fitting choice is monarchy which stands for the dominion of a monarch.\n7)Therefore, the answer is D: Monarchy.\nSo the final and correct answer is D: monarchy", "answer": "C: throne room"}

{"text": "1. Let's examine each option in detail.\n2. Choice B: \"Accident\" does not answer the question because riding through rough terrain can be an accident, but it does not automatically lead to an accident.\n3. Choices C and D do answer the question based on this one sentence. Choice C: \"Hurt\". This is the correct answer choice because it is very plausible that one might be hurt when riding a bike through rough terrain.\n4. Choices A and E do not answer this question because it is not clear how one would find pleasure or fall down.\n5. Now, to understand the choice D: \"Hurt\". A person could be hurt when riding through rough terrain because they could fall off the bike, get a cut, or otherwise suffer injuries. There is a small chance this could involve pleasure; for example, one might find pleasure in being rewarded for riding through rough terrain (e.g. winning a race). However, it is still more of a possibility that one will be hurt than that they will find pleasure. Therefore, D is not the correct answer.\n\n6. Finally, the best answer is Choice C: \"Get somewhere\". Riding a bike through a rough environment can be difficult, but one is able to reach their destination if they are so inclined. This is why many cyclists train in difficult environments. \nThus, the final answer is C: ride", "answer": "E: falling down"}

{"text": "1. First, let's consider what the question asks. It asks, \"What does a virus primarilydo to a person?\" If we take this statement literally, it would seem that \"infect\" (B) is the best answer. \n\n2. If we think of the word \"primary\", it could refer to the dominant/largest action. In this case, the question is asking which action a virus undertakes the most. \n\n3. Now, consider the other options: \"Reproduce\" (C), \"Mutate\" (D), \"Eat food\" (E), and \"Make computer malfunction\" (E). \n\n4. \"Reproduce\" is a more generalized statement; it implies that a virus would be reproducing in lots of different ways, not specifically a person.\n\n5. \"Mutate\" also does happen, but would occur as a result of an exposure (like infect) and not as the primary action a virus would take, which would be infecting. To summarize, reproducing is what a virus does, but it is not the primary action it takes.\n\n6. \"Mutate\". This answer is only true for certain virus types, not all, and not for all possible infection cases. One type of virus, called RNA virus, can mutate rapidly. However, DNA based viruses can mutate, but the number of mutations that result in viable offspring is limited and the mutation rate is relatively low. We also mentioned that this happens as a result of an infection, so it isn't the primary action a virus takes.\n\n7. \"Eat food\" doesn't make a lot of sense here.\n\n8. \"Make computer malfunction\". \"Make computer malfunction\", in this context, would only be true for computer viruses; it does not apply to other virus types. \n\n9.

Choices: 1: Computer Store 2: House 3: Museum 4: Restaurant 5: Own Home\nOutput: 1:The question is asking where we can find a computer with no memory.

Therefore, the only way we can get a computer with no memory is to make it - which must be done in a place. The best choices are either our own home or at a computer store. 5: As was pointed out in Choice 4, the only way to make a computer that has no memroy is in a location because you need a location to build physical objects that contain computer circuits.

An antipathy would mean she was filled to the brim with hate, but her parents didn't have the maturity to recognize they raised her selfish. A disinterest implies she wasn't even able to be mined because she didn't even have the emotions to feel it all, which is a bit more involved than just not caring.\n3.\"Unfeeling\" refers more appropriately to her parents to be raised selfish because she was unfeeling because she was selfish. If we go with this idea, then \"selfish\" would make more sense than \"mean\" to describe the girl.\n4.\"Being mean\" implies that she became mean because of the way she was raised. This is a very inaccurate conclusion to make about the girl's parents and would require her to be even more mature and developed to understand exactly what it meant to be selfish, as opposed to her not even being interested in being mean.\n5.Lastly, \"disinterest\" in one of her parents means she was disinterested in one of them. \"Being mean\" implies the opposite, so the logical conclusion would then be to say the little girl was raised by selfish parents.\n6.Compare the choices and you can then arrive at the conclusion that: if the little girl was raised self-interested, her parents would have to have been self-interested as well.\nSo the final answers are A: selfish and B: parent(s).\n\nInput: I wondered where I could find someone with experience working as a dentist.

Option D: parking garages. When one parks in the garage, they do not walk to and from the garage. To walk from the parking garage, they would use a footpath, but they would not walk directly there. This option also only allows one car to be parked at a time so is not a place where a person would need to walk to and from it regularly. \n7. Option E: repair shop. The repair shop is not an option because it doesn't say \"walk to and from\" but instead \"walk to\". This means that the commute did not occur after repairing the car.\nTo summarize, there is no location which can be a reason for walking to and from work, thus, the answer cannot be anywhere which contains a garage, parking, repair, or event. \nThis leaves us with three options of: parking, event, or driveway. \nLet's look at one of the final two options, \"E: Repair Shop\". This still doesn't match what the question asked. Although some people may opt to commute via foot and repair their car, this does not directly apply to the question. We have already eliminated this option as an answer.\n8. The same approach can be used for Option E: Repair shop. A person could commute, but they wouldn't walk to and from a repair shop. It would be much more likely that they would walk to and from work since repairs shops are not typically located close by workplaces.\n\n### Instruction:Answer the first question listed in the", "answer": "D: parking garage"}
{"text": "1.. Let's eliminate options that do not require a ticket. \"Lottery\" (D) is a game where you can win money, but winning money does not require entering a different country. \"Movie\" (E) is a place, so it would not be useful in gaining access to a different country either.\n2. After these eliminations, we are left with four. \"Train station\" (B) is one of these. A train station is a place where you usually need to buy tickets to move to another country. \n3. Another option is \"Office\" (A). An office is a place where you might need a ticket to get to a different office in another country. For example, some corporate jobs in the US may require a certain level of security clearance to view sensitive documents, thus necessitating a ticket to be able to enter that office.\n4. Another option is \"Baseball stadium\" (C). If you are playing in the opposing team's stadium, a ticket can sometimes help you get past security. \n5. Lastly, B is \"Bus\", which is an option we can eliminate because the question states a different country. \n6. The final answer is \"Train station\". \nSo the final answer  is B: Train station \n\nInput: Where would a ticket help you get to a baseball stadium? Choices:  B: train station C: bus E: movie theater D: baseball \nOutput: 1: Begin by understanding what the questions asks. A \"ticket\" is an object that entitles the carrier to a certain service. This suggests a game of some sort in a stadium. There are many stadiums in the US that host baseball games, but not all of them allow just anyone to get in. \n2. Begin by eliminating answers that do not contain any of the required parts of the question. \"Lottery D (e: movie) does not include a \"ticket\" since this is a game that allows people to participate without buying a ticket. \"Movie E (d: baseball)\" is also eliminated because movies occur inside a particular facility, but do not require tickets to get in.\n3.

A motel would only contain a bathroom if it contained living quarters, so if the motel only has a bathroom and a shower, then it would not be considered to have a shower when you reserved the room.\n4. \"Seashore\" (D) has nothing to do with reserving an hotel room.

Therefore, options A and B are incorrect.\nChoices C and D: \"Understand themselves\" (C) and \"find the good things in life\" (D) can be seen as personal improvement. However, these goals are better suited for life coaching, which is a different type of therapy. As therapies are meant to help solve issues a patient is facing, they will help them accomplish both things. Also, not all issues are of a positive nature; counselors help all people, no matter their problems, and therefore do not always strive to find the good things in life.\nChoices E and F: \"Acknowledgment\" (E) and \"to get out of a bad situation\" (F) may be the case in certain situations. However, acknowledgement or feeling better about an individual's issues doesn't help them get out of bad situations. A counselor can help by identifying root causes of an issue, and this doesn't necessarily mean acknowledgment. Therefore, choices E and F are not correct either.\nSo all the choices are incorrect.

{"text": "1.\"They wanted to eat at (their) home but the cupboard (sic) were barren, so (they) had to go what?\" - This sentence gives the question away. The key words to look for are \"home\", \"cupboard\" and the past tense \"had gone\". These are the keys to the right answer.\n2. The \"barren\" cupboards could not be referencing a fridge or freezer. When a refrigerator is empty, the answer is simply \"fridge\". There's no need for additional elaboration.\n3. The \"barren cupboard\" is used here as a literary device in parallel structure with \"bare\", and thus refers to a situation where something does not contain a certain type of food.\n4. This would lead to the answer \"get food\". The only answer choice that does not contain any type of food is B) \"Cook dinner\". \n5. There must be a certain type of food present for B, E and E to be logical choices.\n6. Choice D) \"Go back to work\" could only be a correct answer if they never got food for themselves.\n7. \"Cook a dinner\" could also only make sense if they never left the house.\n8. Option A) would be correct as long as they had other necessities at home already. This allows for multiple answers depending on the context.\n\nSo the final answer would have to be A.

Choice B: \"Hear testimony in a court room\" is definitely a way to satisfy curiosity. The question asks, \"if you have curiosity about something, but cannot leave your house?\" So if they can't leave their house, they can use technology to take them to the courtroom to hear testimony.\n5. Choice C: \"See exhibits at a museum\" is another option as it is a place to display items for viewing. To \"see exhibits\" requires being in a place with items available to see, such as a museum.\n6. Choice E: \"Surf net\" is a possibility provided they have access to the internet, but the answer requires access to a location with physical items as opposed to only the internet. \n7. Choice A: \"Hear testimoney in a courtroom\" is also an area to satisfy curiosity about some topic in real life that wouldn't be possible through the internet. Also, the courtroom question is not in the form of an exhibit. \n8. Finally, choice D: \"Go somewhere\" isn't an acceptable answer to this question.

{"text": "1) First, eliminate the obvious inaccurate answer choices. If the person waiting for the doctor has appointments, they do not have to wait. If they are late, their appointment will still go on, and thus, they will not have to wait. \"Being late\" (B) is also not the intended answer, as this merely refers to the action of entering an appointment after it starts, not waiting beforehand. \n2) Next, consider the remaining answer choices. \"Having appointments\" (A) does not directly address the difficulty of waiting, and \"Late\" (C) does not directly address waiting, but also does not affect how long one has to wait for their appointment. \"Impatience\" (E) is also insufficient, as this is more referring to the mindset of waiting, not the effect on how long the waiting takes. This answer would be correct if the person waiting for a doctor's appointment could not wait because they were impatient, so impatience wouldn't be the reason for waiting; rather, the impatience is a mental toll that the person waiting for the appointment suffers. \n3) If all of the above answers are incorrect, then the answer must be \"Time consuming\" (D), which refers to how long the person waiting must wait instead of addressing how long the waiting itself actually is.\n4) Therefore, the correct answer is option D: Time consuming.\nSo the final correct answer is D: time consuming\n\nInput: After having an appetizer, what could you still have to eat on your fork?

{"text": "1: Begin by understanding what the situation is describing. It is stating that someone filled the bag with clothing and now wants to get a bag to carry their items.\n2. Let us now look at eliminating the options that do not make sense in this situation. \"Cashier\" (B) is not a place someone would get a bag for their items. \"Shopping Mall\" (C) is a place for the items, but not a place to get a bag for them. \"Supermarket\" (D) is a place filled with many items, but it is too broad to identify a specific location.\n3.\"Bookstore\" (E) is too specific to be relevant. It is too narrow a place to get a specific bag that someone would fill with clothes.\n4.

Asking questions (C) is also not a feasible option after breakfast, because that is something you would be doing after class while on your way out.\n\n3) Moving onto the remaining options, Entering school (D) can be done after breakfast, but the question asks for a chore, so it is more likely to be something other than just entering class.\n\n4) Washing dishes, (E) can be done before class, but the question states that it is to be performed \"after breakfast before getting on the bus\". Washing dishes after breakfast would put it during the morning, instead of afternoon. \n\n5) Therefore, The only option that fits is, \"read a book\", (E).\n  So the final answer is E: read a book.\n\nInput:Why might I visit an older building from the past? Choices: 1) A: I need its land, 2) B: I want to get drunk, 3) C: I need some time traveling, 4) D: I love its architecture.\nOutput: 1-The first option \"A: I need its land\" makes no practical sense to visit an old building from the past.\n2-Second option: \"B: I want to get Drunk\" while it is possible for someone to visit a bar or tavern to get drunk, that does not necessitate visiting an old building.\n3-The third option \"C: I need to travel back in time\" is not a practical option - if one needed to travel back in time, then one would use a time machine, not visit an old building.\n4-The final and correct option \"D: I love its architecture\" provides the best answer among the available choices: many people have an interest in the architecture and history of older buildings and are interested in visiting such structures to observe their features and designs.\n  So the final and correct answer is: D: I love its architecturally\n\nInput: Is it possible to have too much plastic?

{"text": "1) \n1. Begin by examining each answer choice closely to identify what each question is asking. \"View a county highway as a straight line\" implies being above the county.\n2) Begin by understanding what the answer is not saying. \n3) We will now evaluate the options by exploring each possibility as an answer.\n4. Option D: The answer is not \"counties\", which does not need to be crossed to see whether the highway is straight or not. It can be crossed without seeing what the highway is like, but this is not the implication of the question. We also cannot assume that the person asking the question is a person from Michigan as it is not clear from the question whether the topic of Michigan is significant.\n5. Option C: The answer is not cars, which are not flying to view a straight highway on their way to another location. We also cannot assume they are driving from one county to another as this is a very far-fetched scenario.\n6) Option A: We can eliminate the sky as a location because a straight line cannot be viewed from the sky.\n7) \"Map\" (C) is an incorrect answer because they are not necessarily printed or made with lines connecting various county highways. They can also be printed in various ways. Additionally, people do not necessarily view a map when traveling from county to county and are not likely to view the straight lines of counties when they are in the sky.\n8) A person viewing a county highway as a roadway could be the correct answer. This is the only answer that answers the question directly and is the only feasible answer.\n9) Therefore, the answer is C: road. It is not a sky, a Michigan, a country, or a Michigan, a county, or a Michigan. \nSo the final answer in is C: road\n\nInput: If at least one is the only number, and that's your sole reason to assume that you understand at least one of those numbers, what would they be?

This implies that there should be only one mouse and thus, the answer is \"nowhere\". \n2. To understand why the answer is \"now anywhere\" (E), let's examine the other options. \"Above a bar\" and \"On a stool\" (C and D, respectively) are not the answers because those would be places to store a mouse, not a place to find a mouse. \"Under a shelf\" and \"On a tree\" (B and A, respectively) are also not the answer because those are not places to find a mouse. \n3.

The answer to this question won't be the name of the bet because the bet wouldn't be named \"playing with a shark.\" \n2. \"Aquarium\" (B) is not a location for betting with a sharks as it wouldn't be safe for people to be around sharks in an aquarium setting. The mediterranean sea (C), south pacific (D) and pacific ocean (E) are also bad answers as a bet involving a shark and a person wouldn't be done in those locations as well.\n3. The only logical answer is \"Pool Hall\" (A), which provides a space for playing with a variety of different games. Betting with sharks is a metaphor in which the person wagers on an outcome with the \"shark\" watching, which can be imagined as playing pool.\n4.

{"text": "1.\"Almost all people\" implies the majority of people. Since most people live on the surface of the Earth, \"surface of Earth\" (B) would not be an accurate answer choice.\n2.\"Football stadium\" (C) is a space that's more often filled with people than empty. Since \"Almost all people\" does not imply empty spaces, \"Football Stadium\" (C) is also not an accurate answer choice. \n3.\"Car Show\" (E) might be the choice for people that enjoy cars, but \"Almost all people\", while many people enjoy cars also enjoy other things, so this is not the correct answer to the question. \n4.\"House\" (D) is the least accurate answer.

Choices: 1: People without digital clocks. 2: People with digital clocks that were working during their last timekeeping failure. 3: Moms who never have their watches on. 4: People with alarm clocks. 5: Teenagers.\nOutput: 1: Since \"least likely\" refers to \"most commonly\", it's safe to assume that people who have the problem will also be affected most. Since both \"clock\" and \"alarm clock\" are forms of timekeeping, it would make since that having a working product would alleviate the problem. \n2: Teenagers. While everyone technically has a working clock, teenagers are known as the generation most likely to be consistently and chronically late. \n3: Teenagers. This was already answered.\n4: People with alarmclocks.

{"text": "1.\"Another term for instituting (or starting) civil action.\" To understand this, we must know what is a civil action. 2. \"Civil action\" refers to a legal term. 3. Next, let's use the knowledge we've already gathered to eliminate the answers we don't need. \"Complication\" (B) is not a legal term and refers to confusion. \"Arrest\" (D) is also an event and not a term for civil action. 4. The answer could refer to a process, an event, or a term, and it should also be legal. 5. \"Protest\" (E) is also an event, and \"riot\" (C) is a process. 6. Now we are left to compare the options that are left. As \"civil action\" and \"civil suit\" share the same meaning, we can eliminate any other answers from the term \"suits\" that may be used. 7. \"Institution\" (A) is used as a verb to form something new, but we have already established that the correct term is \"civil action\" (e.g. \"The company successfully instituted civil action against their competitor\"). 8. Therefore, the answer could not be \"institution\". 9. Finally, \"institute\" (C) is one of the words used to describe civil action, making it the one correct answer to the original question.\nSo the final reponse is:C: institute\n\nInput:What item should you only attempt to remove from an envelope after you have opened it?

Choices: 1. A: mail box 2. B: garden 3. C: neighbor 4. D: front yard 5. E: roof\nOutput: 1: First, it is helpful to understand the meaning of some synonyms and antonyms. A house may have a mailbox, but it doesn't have mail. For example, when someone receives mail in their mailbox, that mail could be in the mailbox of someone who lives in that house, or a neighbor who does not live there.\n2. If we look at our options, it may seem unclear which is the correct answer. If the object in question is not outside a house, then it is either in the front yard (D), the roof (E), or the neighbor (C). However, if the object in question is outside and still inside the boundary of the property, we would call it the yard. Thus, \"mailbox,\" while outside the house, is actually in the front yard (option D) rather than the front yard itself (option B).\n3. Similarly, a garden (option B) is not something to label as entirely outside the house, but inside instead. Therefore, it is no better of an answer than B.\n4. Finally, a neighbor (option C) is not entirely outside a house either, but resides in a different house on the same property. This means the neighbor does not live with the occupants of the house that has the mailbox (option B). As such, we cannot select A: mailbox.\n5. If the object in the question is not something on the inside of the house, then it needs to be something that the yard is not.\nThe answer to which can be found in option D. When we're asked about something that does not belong on the outside of a house, the yard does not belong there.\nSo the final choice is D: Mailbox\nSo", "answer": "D: africa"}

If something were to make John feel, for example, \"Stoic\" (C) or \"Wanting More\" (D), that would be strange.  This is because being stoic or wanting more would not be an initial reaction to getting something important.\n3)That leaves us with A)Have which is a feeling that John could have after getting somthing important.\nSo the final answers is A: feel\n\nInput: You take your bike to get repaired.

The wheel would turn, causing the legs to jiggle and the person to have trouble staying in place, plus they have to balance on their broken leg.\n4: Laying a broken leg on a ladder (C) is potentially dangerous and does not meet the requirement of elevating the leg.\n5: Placing a broken leg on a hospital bed (D) can result in the leg hanging down into space as they cannot lean over far enough and, again, they would not be elevated.\n6: A grand piano (E) can be considered a place to elevate a broken leg in that you can rest your leg on its top if you can find a way to raise the piano up so that it is elevated as well. It is not something that can be used exclusively for this purpose.\n7: Therefore, if someone with a broken leg wants to elevate, their leg, the proper answer is \"where does someone lay with their legs elevated when their leg is broken?\", so the answer is E: grand piano.\nSo the final and correct answer is E: grand Piano\n\n### Instruction:Answer the multiple choice.\n\n### Input: Where do we find the most sushi?

Nope - boots are not found on heels, per se. You wear boots on your feet - not your heels.\n3) Moving on to Choice B: the desert. The desert has nothing to do with heels and cannot be the answer.\n4) Option C: loaf of Bread. Definitely not. Bread does not have heels.\n5) Choice D: foot. Nah- this is a place, not a thing, and moreover there aren't necessarily a bunch of feet all bound together with heels.\n6) Lastly, we take a look at Choice E: hock. This is correct! Hocks are found on legs of livestock such as horses, and are specifically where their heels are located. Horses' heels are their feet. If you want to know more about the anatomy of the horse, check out this article on petkeen.\n7) Therefore, the answer choice is Choice E: hoc.\nSo the final answered choice is \"choice E: hork\"\n\nInput: What is the only place in the universe that both light and thunder can be heard at the same time? Choices:  a) A rainbow b) A tornado c) Thunderstorm d) The rain  e) Clouds\nOutput: 1.) We look at each choice more closely.\n2.) Since a rainbow cannot have thunder and lightning during a rain, it is not the answer.\n3.) A tornado, however, is different. Tornadoes contain a lot of very fast winds that cause thunder to occur.\n4.) A thunderstorm cannot contain a rainbow because a rainbow only occurs in a rain. Similarly a thunderstorm has its own thunder and lightning.\n5.) The only other option is the rain itself and the clouds.\n6.) Since the rain has its own lightning and thunder, the clouds only contain these things and hence do not contain them at the same time.\n7.) Therefore, the answer is a tornado.\nSo the choice is \"Tornado\".", "answer": "D: foot"}

You might be able to keep it on your desk with a pile of books, but it would probably be best to keep it at home with the other memos.\n5: Index cards are often stored in a card catalogue, but they would be accompanied by a card showing the book to which they correspond. You wouldn't be able to just find an index card and tell where it goes without knowing the corresponding book.\n6: If the index card had been returned to the card catalogue, it would have been retrieved and returned to its corresponding book.\n7: Therefore, the card shouldn't have been returned to the card cabinet.\n8: Therefore, the answer is E: card cabinet.\nSo the final correct answer is E: card cabinets\n\nInput: When I am in a museum, where might I be able to locate a map or other guide to the exhibits?

{"text": "1.\"Where do I put my mug after it'\n2. After you look at the answer choices, there may be another way to arrive at the answer. You cannot put it \"in\" the kitchen, since \"E\" is the answer choice, and \"In\" is not a word that can be found there. In this manner, you can shorten an answer's journey to the correct answer by recognizing synonyms, definitions, etc. of answer choices.\n3. Once the method is clear, the question becomes, Where do I put my muffin? To solve the question we must ask what the first part of the question asks. After that we must ask another question, where do we put a muffin? We will make a connection between those two questions in order to solve it: Where do I put my coffee? Put coffee in mug Take mug dry Mug put on shelf\n4. After we do this we can answer the question which asks where we put the dry muffin. Where do we put the dry mug? You put the dry mug on the shelf. Putting the dry mug on a shelf will keep it dry because it is out of the way and will not be accidentally broken\n5. After doing the question again we can see that to answer our original question about the right answer we need to place our coffee mug on the shelve.\n6. Therefore, the answer choice which puts the coffee mug dry on the correct shelf is \"C\": kitchen cabinet.\nSo the final answers is C:\"Shelf.\"\n\nInput:What might you find in a place where you can find an apple?

When examining each answer, the first point to note is that \"a pear\" and \"a ghost\" are not the answer choices. This should immediately show you that these answer choices do not \"provide something\" but rather that they either don't provide anything at all, or provide something you can't find.\n3.", "answer": "A: shelf"}
{"text": "1) Let's look at the question to get an idea of what we will be looking for in an answer. The question is asking where John will go to get to the 3rd floor of his apartment. \n2) We can eliminate a couple of options right away. The stairs (D) is an activity and John would likely be walking instead of on a wheelchair. Also the detroit area may be too far away from John's location.\n3) The space shuttle (B) is also too far away for John and too difficult for John to use after his accident.\n4) Now we are left with a list of four options. Downtown (E) could be too distant if John didn't have a car to go to. The elevator (A) is a very probable answer as it is the most common way to access the third floor of an apartment.\n5) However, a wheelchair bound person could have a hard time navigating an elevator. So what other options remain? A space shuttle could carry someone in a wheelchair, but it is out of the question for John.\n6) The stairs will not work. Detroit is not a common destination for wheelchair bound people and would not work. Additionally, the detroit area is too far for John and he definitely wouldn't go. Detroit is probably not anywhere close enough for John. Additionally, John's accident occurred too long ago for that to be a concern for him on this trip. That leaves a space shuttle, elevator, detroit, or downtown.\n7) Detroit is not a practical destination for John since we know it is too far, too distant, and didn't occur too long ago to be a concern for John.\n8) That leaves a space shunt or elevator. If John cannot get into the space shuttle, then elevator is easily the only option left and is the answer.\nSo the final answers are A: elevator\n\nInput: A man with a bad leg is looking for a way to get into a car.

This choice states only that the front door is open, so if one finds one's letters missing, one would also find the front door open. Choice C, which states that on finding one's letters missing one might visit the post office, also leads to the same answer. These two choices only state that one might find that one's letters are missing. \n3. Choices D and E both indicate that one finds one's door open and one' package stolen. Both of these states are also possible if one finds that one' letters are missing. Choice D indicates further that one finds one' mailbox empty, but again this is only an additional detail and does not change the correct answer. \n4.

A(1): a picture of herself wearring her favorite shirt is the right answer because when we are on the computer, a picture of me wearing her favorite shurt can best represent her.\n\n2. B(2) : A picture of myself looking over the shoulder is a bad answer because when we are online, we like to see a picture of herself looking forward.\n\n3. C(3): A picture of myself lying on the bed is a wrong answer because when we are surfing on the line, we like to see ourselves standing up, not lying down.\n\n4.

If we look at each option to determine which one best fits his goal, \"Think\" (A) is out of the question because thinking is not directly tied to seeing something become reality. \n4. \"Determined\" (D) is a better choice and works because it shows that his goal was strong enough to push him toward achieving it. \n5.

{"text": "1) The question contains the word \"large\". This indicates that the answer should be a plural noun with at least two options to choose from. \n2) \"What\" shows that the key here is \"something\" and the wording indicates that it isn't an exact object. It is just something. From this, we can easily eliminate answers B and C. \"Advertisement\" is an exact object and \"Bar\" (D) is too specific of an establishment. \n3) Answers D and E will still be good choices, so let's see why they won't work. \"Caf\u00e9\" (D) may not always refer to the name of a location. Oftentimes, many cafes are \"cafes\" because they serve cafes.  As a result, they are more of a service, and not an actual location.  Similarly, the internet sites (E) isn't necessarily something he would want to go to. It is not a location, but perhaps the websites would be a service. \n4) Leaving us with answers A and B, \"news\" (B) does not seem to directly refer to a place like \"cafe\" (D) would. While \"bar\" (D) was eliminated already because it is not a place, this doesn't seem to be directly related to the keyword \"large\".\n5) Ultimately, the only answer that directly follows is \"advertisement\". Since his interest in the question is the large menu of options available, an advertisement would have a menu. In addition, the large choice of options makes the advertisement a perfect answer.\nSo the final 1 answer is :A: Advertisement", "answer": "E: internet sites"}

This doesn't answer the question because we want a notepad to be stored on our person, not in our home.\n6: We're left with Choice E: School, which is likely the best answer because classrooms typically have whiteboards, desks, and pens, all of which would have a notebook on them.\n7: Thus, we can conclude that the answer is E: School.", "answer": "A: back pocket"}

Next, we may look for those which are in some way an extension of feelings. \"Concern\" (C) is a word that can be used to express feelings of fear, apprehension, or anxiety.

This can be said to be an extension of a feeling because if someone is feeling a certain way about something, they may develop an anger. \n4. Thus, two of the possible answers are \"Concern\" and \"Anger\", which means we need to select which of these is the correct answer.\n\n### Instruction2:Answer the following multiple-choice questions.\nInput: What will the person who is the manager most likely wear when going for a jog? Choices:  - A: sports clothes B: leather slippers C: jeans D: white shirt E: long-sleeved dress F: hat G: sweater H: swimwear I: sneakers J: short pants\nOutput: 1 The question is asking what the person wearing a jog is most likely to be wearing. \n2 Because the question explicitly asks what the manager is most likely to be doing, we can eliminate answer options that are not appropriate for a jog. Answers that are not in the list are most likely improper for a jog.  3 The first three answer options, those in [A - C] are all clothing items. All of these are not appropriate attire for a jog. Choice option D (a white shirt) is a garment that is a form of clothing, but is not in itself an example of such clothing. Choice I (sneakers), J (short pants), and H (swimwear) are all forms of clothing and therefore rejected.  4 We arrive at the correct answer by eliminating all clothing from", "answer": "D: education"}
{"text": "1.\"I'm watching tv\" is a state of being. If you're just watching tv, you have nothing else to do. The rest of this is already being done for/against this option.\n2. \"I expect to get\" refers to receiving something. It's not possible to receive something by just being something; the option must provide an additional action.\n3. \"Nothing else to do\" and \"I'm watching tv: both imply a state of doing nothing. You can't be actively doing something while also receiving what you're doing, which means you don't get anything. Thus, both options have the incorrect phrase and are eliminated.\n4. \"Entertainment\" would be a good answer choice but unfortunately doesn't fit the question. The question's implication was that \"I'm watching TV\" is boring. There's nothing here about not being entertained. This means \"Entertainment\" has to be a different answer.\n5. Additionally, \"Boredom\" and \"Get fat\" both directly imply that there isn't something else to do. Since it has already been indicated that there's not anything else to do, neither of these make sense and are therefore eliminated.\n6. We're left with \"Sadness\" which states that a person watching tv might become sad because they'll feel that they've wasted precious time on some stupid thing. The person probably expected to get something other than what they're actually watching but is instead just sad.\n7. Thus, the answer to the question is \"Sadness\"\nSo the final answer to this question is E: sadness\n\n\n\n\nInput: Can this be read as a question? Choices: 1. Yes 2. No 3. Sometimes 4. Always 5. It depends 6. Always 7. Sometimes 8. Yes 9. No 10. It depends\nOutput: 1.- Yes it can definitely be read as a question.\n2. It can be\n3. It can be too. If you want to, of course.\n4. It can also be. We are just guessing though.\n5. It can! Always and sometimes can be read as questions too, and so can it.\n6. It can! It can even be two-part!\n7.", "answer": "B: entertainment"}
{"text": "1) The question is asking about action taken after completing school. The key phrase \"after attending school for twelve\" implies that the person has completed school and is now considering what to do next.\n2) Let's analyze each answer choice to determine which choice matches accurately with the context of the question.\n3) Choice A: inspiration. This could be the case after completing the final project or assignment in school, which could also be called inspiration. However, this answer choice isn't appropriate because this answer choice doesn't indicate action taken after completing all of school.\n4) Choice B: Much work. This could be the answer if the person had to submit a thesis or complete extra projects after completing all of their courses. However, this answer doesn't fit the context of the question because it simply states that \"much work\" is done after completing school, which could happen for any number of reasons.\n5) Choice C: boredom. This answer is obviously incorrect because boredom can't happen until after you complete the last assignment or final exam for school.\n6) Choices D and E: graduate and degree. Both these answers are correct because after finishing school, one would graduate and obtain a degree, thus indicating completion of school.\n7) Therefore, the best answer is either D: graduate or E: degree.\nSo the final answe is D: graduate or e: degree\n\nInput: Where won't you find tires? Choices: 1. A: On a bike 2. B: Off a bike 3. C: On a truck 4. D: On an engine 5.

{"text": "1) We have to use our knowledge about the wording of each choice. We know that the delivery of a morning paper to the house involves coming to the house and bringing the paper to the customer. So it is not the customer that the customer is delivered to.\n2) The only things that are brought from the house to the person are in the first two choices: classroom and synagogue. The last two choices do not require that the location you\u2019re at be brought to you; they just simply state the location you are in without additional movement involving you. \n3) Bathroom and grocery store both require you to be there in order to receive their merchandise. A paper delivery man would not be taking a paper to the bathroom or bringing a paper to a person shopping at the grocery store.\n4) This leaves us with just two true answers, classroom and synagogues. Synagogue might be a more likely answer but it isn\u2019t more correct, and classroom is the simplest answer, making it the correct choice. \n5) Our final and correct answer is classroom.\nSo the final answers is A:classroom\n\nInput:Where could you tell the time on a clock without looking at a clock?

One is a residential area while the other is a large urban industrial area. These have nothing to do with the question so they're eliminated.\n4. \"Suburban \" and \"countryside\" (E) are two totally different places. Countryside would be more of a place with lots of fields and small-scale farms, while suburbia would be a place with lots of people and development. \n\"Ohio\" (D) is not a typical answer because not many people use the country of Ohio as a designation for a place.\n5.

{"text": "1.'Where do fish spend the most time?' is what this question is trying to ask, not 'Where do fish go to spend most of their time?'. Think of it this way: If 'to spend' was intended to be replaced with 'go', the question would be 'Where do fish go?'. \n2. This leaves us with 4 options. \n3. If'spent' in this question meant 'go', then A would make sense because that's obviously where fish go. \n4. Similarly, if spent meant 'went' then D would make sense as that is where you go to the toilet.\n5. Thus, the answer could either be A or D, but because we have two viable answers, we must choose the one that most accurately matches the context of the question. \n6. 'Body of water' (B) is correct because fish spend the most time in the body of water that they call home, which would be their body of water. \n7. 'Toilet' (E) is also correct because fish's bodies are located here, which means they are also spending some time here, albeit most time is spent in the body of water (B) which is water.\n8.

Answer choice B: Fort Knox is a location of holding gold, but not a type of investment holding gold.\n3) The location of Fort Knox is a clue here. Answer choice A: church could be an investment holding for a church. Answer choice B: treasure chest could be used for investments or storage by a pirate or thief.\n4) Answer choices C an D: jewelary and jewelry are grammatically incorrect, so eliminate these choices.\n5) That leaves two answer choices that are plausible, C: church and D: treasure chest. The jewelry store is not correct because an investment cannot be held by a store. Therefore, this option should be eliminated.\n6) Lastly, church is also a poor choice because a church, like other investments, typically won't hold its holdings in the church itself. Instead, the investment is likely held elsewhere.\n7) Fort Knox, on the other hand, is a good choice because it would hold gold that is associated with investments.\n8 ) Treasure chest, on the other hand is a bad choice because, unless it is being held by a pirate or other thief, then it will not be part of gold investments.\n9) Thus, the answer is C: Church.\nSo the final answers are Church\n\nInput: Where is a nice place for me to hold an artistic party event?

If you become trapped in space without any source of oxygen, then your body would suffocate.\n5: So which one is it? It seems like C is correct; suffocating from lack of oxygen.\nSo the final output is C: suffocate\n\nInput", "answer": "D: wires"}
{"text": "1.) Let's break these choices down one by one.\n2.) \"Cellar\" (B) is too close to the \"kitchen sink\" and doesn't make sense because it is underground and therefore not easily accessible to your sink.\n3.) \"Grocery store\" (D) isn't actually under your kitchen and therefore isn't applicable.\n4.) \"Cupboard\" (A) is above your sink, but not accessible to it.\n5.) \"Oven\" (C) is certainly above your kitchen, but it is for cooking, not for storing canned food which is what the question is.\n6.) This leaves us with \"Pantry\" (E), although it's not very likely that you'd be storing canned food in a pantry located above your kitchen sink.\n7.) While this appears to be a problematic answer, the question doesn't indicate a preference for where the pantry must be so as long as it's above your kitchen sink you could keep canned food.\n8.) Thus, we need to consider what location would make the most sense to store canned food.\n9.) The most likely choice is \"The Cabinets,\" but this choice isn't available.\n10.) \"Pantry\" (C) is thus the correct answer. It makes sense to store canned goods in a nearby pantry, but it wouldn' t' exactly be above your kitchen sink either.\nSo the final choice is C: Pantry\n\nInput: What should you always have on the first page of a paper that was sent to a college professor?

{"text": "1: Begin by understanding the question. \"Where is a road known to be a motorway?\" The key to this question is the word \"known to be\". This means that there are motorways in existence that are not a road. A road is what takes us from one place to another and motorways are known to be roads\n2: Consider the potential destinations we might visit.\n3: \"Scotland\" (B) is the wrong answer because Motorways are a UK thing. So we can discount this option.\n4: \"Europe\" (C) is also the wrong choice. First, there is no such thing as a \"European Motorway\". Second, there are many motorways in existence which were not developed in any sort of pan-European collaboration. \n5: \"New Jersey\" (D) is the correct choice. New Jersey developed the first and longest motorway in the world, The Garden State Parkway. \n6: \"England\" (E) is the wrong choice. This choice only applies to England in a broader sense, and this type of road exists throughout England. \n7: The correct answer is D as motorways were developed in New Jersey and are specific to the USA.\nSo the final question is D: New Jersey", "answer": "E: england"}

Adjectives like \"intelligent\", \"calm\", \"well-read\", and \"understanding\" each suggest thoughtfulness. Finally, all of these adjective have been identified for both categories.\n4-Compassion and thoughtfulness aren't opposite adjectives, however. Therefore, this isn't the correct answer.\n5-Therefore, it's \"stupid\" that the adjective \"compassionate thoughtful\" is described as \"kind human being, meaning \"stupid\".\n6-The correct answer is \"weird\".\nSo the final answer in the first question is B: weird\n\n\nInput :What is the name of the store owner who does not sell shoes? Choices A: Mr Pig B: Mr T C: Mr Moo D: Mr Frog E: Mr Chicken \nOutput : 1: What the problem question asks is \"What is the name of...\", and it also asks for \"Does not sell shoes\". Therefore, the answer can only be a person who is:  A) not a store owner B) who sells shoes. If A is true, then the name cannot be included in the answer. And if B is true, then the correct answer is all the choices except A. It only means that it is not the name of a person who sells shoes, which is D. It's a person who sells some other things. And a person who does not sell shoe, is a person who does not do it all the time, it's a side business, or maybe even a hobby. And that can make the answer the person with the name'moo' or 'rooster' or any other nickname.\n2:The answer cannot by Mr Frog.

What kinds of books do they not sell? Choices:  Choices: A: any novels B: all novels C: a novel D: reference\nOutput: 1-We can begin the by looking at each of our answer options:\n2-We can see that all, but \"a\", or reference books have their own category. All but \"a\" (reference) have their own category which books are in. Therefore, the book that bookstores do not sell are books of the category of \"reference\"\n3-However, if we want to have a more rigorous examination of the answer choices, we can begin to look at them in more detail.\n4-Let us begin with A: any. We must ask ourselves, do any of the books sold by the bookstore include \"any\" of these books: novels, or text, or dictionaries, or reference. We can see that \"ANY\" of these books sold in the bookstore are sold. However, by themselves, or with another, these books do not make up a complete category. \n5-Let us eliminate B, C, D.\n6-This leave us with the answer choice of A: any (novels, text, dictionnaries, and reference) therefore they will not sell any of those because they have all of those.\n7-All novels sold in bookstores are in the category of novel. To sell a \"novel\" means that the bookstore has novels for sale. \n8-All \"text\" books are in the category of text. Bookstores do not sell a category of text, so we can eliminate \"TEXT\" books.\n9-All dictionaries sold in bookstores must be in the category of dictionaries", "answer": "C: open boxes"}
{"text": "1.\"Let's begin by comparing the statements together. \n2. \"If you socialize by spending time with friends,\" is definitely incorrect. In fact, it isn't even a complete statement but it is missing a key word: \"spending\". \n3. \"If you socialized by having inane conversations with people\" is also not correct because the context of socialization here refers to socializing with other people, which has no relation to inane. So that can't be the correct answer.\n4. \"Make friends\" is also not correct. Although socializing does involve meeting new people, that doesn't necessarily mean you end up making friends with everyone you meet. \n5. \"Meeting people\" is not correct because that seems to exclude the possibility of spending time with existing friends. A better version of the question might exclude \"new people\". \n6. \"Mingle\" is also incorrect. This answer implies that you move around between different groups of people with the intent of interacting with other people. But the question is asking about trivial conversations. \n7. \"Small talk\" is a good answer. It is correct because trivial conversations are a type of small talk and small talk is often a part of socializing.\n8. \"Meet new people\" is also a correct answer because when spending time with someone, you are meeting that person for the first time or reconnecting after a long period of time. \n9. Overall, we can conclude that the answers that are incorrect are: \"Make friends\", \"Trivial conversation\", \"Mingle\", and \"Meet new people\".\n10.

{"text": "1. Let's start by eliminating answers that are related to emotions other than curiosity. For \"excitement\" (B), curiosity does not necessarily go hand-in-hand with excitement. Likewise, \"boredom\" (C) can either be a feeling of excitement or boredom, depending on the situation. \"Fear\" (E) is also an emotion that is unrelated to curiosity in the context of \"seeing new things\". \"Wonder\" (D) is also unrelated as it is a question, rather than a feeling.\n2. All of this leaves us with the answer \"curiosity\" (A).\n3. Seeing \"new things\" would likely inspire a feeling of curiosity because of the need to know more.\nSo the final answers are A: curiosity and B: excitement\n\nInput:A person is on the phone. How could they be feeling? Choices: 1. Boredom 2. Frustration 3. Curiosity 4. Embarrassment 5. Calm\nOutput:1. This question can be broken down into 3 parts: (1) is there a feeling, (2) how is it being felt, and (3) what is it a feeling about?\n2. In this question, the feeling is \"Boredom\", and the way it is being felt is through \"Sarcasm\" - this is obvious because the word \"on the phone\" means \"on a phone\" (hence the sarcasm).\n3. This leaves us with the question what is boredom a feeling about? and the answer - \"A phone call\"\nSo the final answer can be written as: 3. Feeling of boredom about phone call.\n\nInput:Where could I get a drink that I cannot finish? Choices:  C: bathroom F: kitchen E: living room D: bedroom G: store\nOutput:1. The keyword that jumps out to me here is \"Finish\" and it appears in the form of \"Can't finish\". To know the answer, we must understand what 'finish' means and see what this situation can relate to. \"Bathroom\" (C) might be a place where I get a drink, but since I say cannot finish, bathroom cannot be an answer here.\n2.

The question was specifically asking what part of the body is lips located to. \"Hand\" (D), in contrast, is asking about all types of jars.\n4. \"Mouth\" (A) is a correct answer because it contains lips. We should take note that while the question asked what \"part of the body are lips located on\", the answer doesn't necessarily need to only be one \"part of the body\" as it can also be more than one \"part of the bod\"y, as long as it all contains lips.\nThus, the answer is A, because \"mouth\" contains \"l\"ips.\nSo the final  answer is A: mouth\n\nInput:Where are people mostly found in public?

Lastly, combine your options to make the best choice. \n4. \"Home\" (G), \"Working\" (D), and \"Inside a Caf\u00e9\" (F) are locations where we would find people at times, but they are not where most people would be found in public.\n5. \"In a library\" (C) and \"In a Cafe\" (F) are both locations where people go in groups, but that is not where most people are found in public.\n6.

{"text": "1, Incorrect: The question is asking what could happen to the person if they are hit by a driver, not what could happen to the driver. Therefore, \"D: using gas\" (E) is incorrect. The question already says gas could kill someone.\n2. Incorrect: The question asks us to consider the consequences of someone hitting someone else while driving, not the consequences of being hit by someone driving. The correct answer to this question is not what could happen to \"that person\", but what could happen to the other driver.\n3. Incorrect: There is not a death penalty for someone who gets hit while driving because the police or other authorities would not impose a death penalty for this. Instead, the person may get injured and perhaps be arrested, or the situation may not cause further consequences.\n4. Incorrect: Moving could happen to the car when someone is hit by a driver and they drive away after hitting the person. The person hit by the driver may still face severe consequences, regardless of whether or not the driver moves the car.\n5. Correct: The correct answer is \"C: moving because the car could be moving if that person is hit by someone driving. In my opinion, this is an indirect and more subtle way of explaining what you need to ask to get a correct answer.\n6. Incorrect: \"May die\" (E) is not the correct answer because it's very ambiguous and not relevant to the question. The question asks what could happen to \"the person\", not \"the driver\".\nSo the final answer to the original question is C: moving\n\nInput:What is this piece of wood a part of? Choices: 1.

The desk is not made of wood, but a plywood structure or any other materials.\n\nIncorrect. The right answer is D: Ladder\n\nIncorrect: Body is not a part of piece of wood and body is not body of a desk, so the answer is incorrect.\n\nIncorrect, The correct answer is C: Headboard", "answer": "E: may die"}
{"text": "1.'You'd add peppery and salty liquid meal to what liquid meal to make it bland?' is a straightforward question that asks to think about the situation and to eliminate the options that do not fit the criteria.\n2. As the question is asking about how to make a meal bland, it is most likely not referring to food already at the meal or something that needs to be added afterward.\n3. From there, we can eliminate \"supermarket\" (B) and \"groceries store\" (E) because these are places of commerce that sell foods, but they are not used for making meals. This does not fit with the context of the question.\n4. \"Cellars\" would certainly work, which could be considered as an option, but this may be too broad to answer the question of \"meal.\" The word \"meal\" would generally describe an entire meal including all necessary ingredients, but this could be interpreted differently and a more precise answer would be required.\n5. \"Soup\" (D) and possibly \"water\" (C) are possible answers because they are ingredients that one would add to a meal, which is already possible, but in this case there would need to be a \"bland\" soup already present. This again is too general as the exact soup meal would need to be specified to provide a specific answer.\n6. \"Water\" would not be suitable as \"bland\" water could be added to the meal, but would not make it bland. It would take something more like salt or pepper too much to be considered bland.\n7. From here the options that would likely require the least thought to answer are \"cellar\" (C) and \"soup\" (A). We know that food is to be added to the meals in a soup and cellars are used to store many food items. As there are plenty of soup recipes that use food items stored in cellars, the answer is \"cellar.\"\n8. Since cells are typically dark (but they can also be bright) and also, most soups taste fine even if they just have water with some salt, I'm gonna pick \"Cellar\"\nSo the final answer would be C: soup \n\nInput: One might not feel much happiness when they are what?

Choices: A: restaurant B: hotel C: office D: coffee shop E: your car\nOutput: 1: Let's work through each choice to eliminate any that are not correct. Choices \"Restaurant\" (B) and \"Coffee Shop\" (E) are places for people to go but not necessarily for people to work. Choice \"Office\" (C) and \"Hotel\" (D) are certainly places where you could work, but they don't provide any indication of the work itself. 2. That leaves \"Your car,\" which is a direct answer to the question. 3. Therefore, the answer (if not the complete answer) is \"your car,\" because a person can do work in their car. 4.

It can be, but is usually the opposite. If you know you need both right now, a clothing store might be the best answer. But if there is a chance you might need either one later, a clothing store is not the answer.\n4) Therefore, answer is C: Clothing store.\nSo the final is C: Clothing Store\n<a name=\"\"> </a>\nInput: What can a cow not do alone?

She requires a pasture, food, and other animals to keep upright.\n3: Cows might not be able to move around without other cattle or human help, but she can definitely move around without human help.\n4: Cows will not usually last long without help. They need a place to graze and feed with care. But even with help, they can usually last quite a long time without human help.\n5: A cow can's eat well on her own.

{"text": "1: Let's examine each choice closely.\n2. Biologists wouldn't find the shark in television programs (E) because the television program wouldn't be on the ocean floor with the fish.\n3. Biologists wouldn\u2019t find the shark by the coral reef (E) because biologists are not necessarily studying coral reefs.\n4. The shark wouldn't be in the television program (E) either, since it is a fish.\n5. Similarly, the shark wouldn't likely be found at the gulf of mexico (B). This is the Gulf of Mexico and while it is an ocean location, it's not open ocean because it is shallower, and sharks aren\u2019t typically shallow-water ocean creatures.\n6. Finally, the shark wouldn\u2019t be found in fresh water (A).\n7. This leaves us with the only appropriate answer choice being \"Open Ocean\" (D).\n8.

A: mountains B: grass C: a tree stump D: tropical rainforests E: jungle\nOutput: 1) Begin by reading the sentence to find the key words and question: \"A newborn tiger cub is the first addition to the Zoo.\" The question is \"Where do tigers normally lives?\" We can assume that the tiger has not been released and is still part of the zoo exhibit, based on the key word \"addition\". If released, the tiger would not likely return to the zoo with each new addition of other tigers, and would no longer be considered an addition. \n2. This leaves us with three choices: \"in the Mountains\" (A), \"In the grasslands\" (B), and \"in the Jungle\" (E). \n3. To eliminate options, we look at the question. First, where do newborn life forms live? \n4. Life can be born in a mountain region, but this doesn't quite fit our question as a tiger is not normally found in a mountain region. Similarly, it is not very likely that a tiger would normally live in a grasslands region.\n5. This leaves us with \"", "answer": "C: open ocean"}
{"text": "1.\\begin{code}\nLet's examine each answer option closely.\n2. Choice B: wine press. \"Wine press\" is not the correct answer because it refers to squeezing juice from grapes to produce wine, which is not what the question is asking about.\n3. Choices C and D are not the answer because these items are not directly related to grape chopping. A fruit basket and fruit cocktail are both containers that might hold grapes but are not necessarily part of the process of chopping a grape.\n4. Lastly, choice A: \"fresh fruit\" is the correct answer because the process of \"chopping a grape\" is meant to be used as a verb phrase in the sentence \"What does one chop a grape for?\" As a result, the best answer is \"fresh fruit\" since this is the most direct answer to the question.\nSo the final option is A: fresh fruit\n\nInput: Where can you be most certain you're looking at a person? Choices: 1. in an alleyway  2. at a bar  3. behind a window  4. wearing a hat  5. not behind a mirror\nOutput: 1\\begin{code}\nStart by understanding the question. \"Where can you be most certain looking at a person.\" The key here is \"certain\", which implies that you would be able to confirm whether or not it is a person.\n2. Then, let's rule out some of the incorrect answers. \"Bar\" (C) is an inappropriate answer because it is a specific place, and you can't be sure it's a person unless you are interacting with them. \n3. \"Window\" (B) is also an inappropriate choice because windows often cover a large area, which would make it difficult to tell whether or not a person is behind it.\n4. \"Hat\" (D) is not as direct an answer to the question, as it refers broadly to the presence of a hat and doesn't indicate whether or not you know it's a person underneath.\n5.\"Not behind a mirror\", (E), is a funny option but not the best fit since a mirror is not necessary to confirm that the person behind it is actually a person as opposed to a reflection of another object.", "answer": "D: fruit cocktail"}

Let's look at the choices, eliminating any that seem to be incorrect.\n4. Choices \"University\" (B) and \"College class\" (C). These are not the best options. Neither a college nor university would be necessary as the student could complete an assignment as part of a class anywhere. We should also not include \"Classroom\" (D), because the students could have class in places other than the classroom (such as on Zoom, for example). The same can be said for \"Classroom\" (E).\n5. Choices \"Dorm room\" (A) and \"Library\" (E) are also inaccurate. A dorm room is most likely not where the student is completing a report on the day that it is due because the room might not have access to a printer. The same is true for the \"Library\" (E). Since the student is a student, it shouldn't be said that the library is the best place for the student to be to work on a report. \n6. Therefore, the options that are left are \"Class Room\" (C) and \"Library\" but \"Class Room\" (D) is the best option. This is because most students complete work as part of a class so it would make sense for a student to be in a classroom setting.  \nSince James might still need to complete other assignments outside of class, it makes sense for him to go straight to the library.\nSo the final answers are D:classroom E: library\n\nInput: If a person is experiencing mental exhaustion while taking a test, what is the best choice?

{"text": "1. Let's begin with the answer choices and then work backwards to come to the correct one.\n\n2. The first answer choice, \"Dairy farm\", is one of the farthest possible destinations and doesn't belong because the question asks for a place James went to outside of the south.\n3. The second answer choice, \"Texas\", is a geographic location that is far away from the South. If James didn't go to a steakhouse outside the south, he would be leaving the South heading in a different direction.\n4. The third answer choice, \"Building\", is not a place James went to because the South has many buildings, and this answer choice would be just as true if he returned to Texas.\n5. The fourth answer choice, \"Michigan\", is outside of the South, but it is in the same country. \n6. The last answer choice, \"Florida\", is in the same country and in the same region as the South (the southeastern United States).\n7.

Hence, we are looking for a question that will help us identify what activity utensils would be used in the kitchen for.\n2. Since we now know that we are looking for the activity, it is time to further reduce our initial answer set of options.\n3. Option A: \"Backpack\" (B) has nothing to do with a kitchen or utensils. We can therefore eliminate this answer.\n4. Option B: \"Closet\" (C) is also an incorrect choice because the closet is not part of the kitchen but the home, which isn't relevant to our problem.\n5. Option D: \"Dinner\" (E) involves eating. While utensils would be necessary for eating dinner, we do not want a question involving cooking dinner or eating dinner but to find the activity itself that utensils would be useful in the kitchen for. \n6. Option E: \"Cupboard\" (D) could be the answer to the question, but that is not the objective and we do not want a general description. Further, it is a physical location of utensils and is not an activity that would directly include utensils. Therefore, we can eliminate this answer.\n7. This leaves us with \"drawers\". Utensils would be used both to cook meals as well as to clean and organize meals and are found both in the kitchen and in the cupboards. Moreover, it describes an activity that utensils would actually be used to do and is a location where utensils would be found as it is a component of the kitchen.\n8.

So the answer is B: aggression.\nSo the final answers are A: friendship, \nB: aggression\n\nInput: A certain number of people are always working, which leaves many of them with more time to spend with their friends, which is good and helpful to those people, except for one small area, which is... Choices:  A. The workplace\nB. The people who aren't working\nC. Home\nD. Making money\nE: Being rich\nOutput: 1 and 2. Here, the question asks \"except for one small area, that is\" and the passage talks about \"more time to spend with their __________\" The key is that \"one small area\" that the passage talks about is the home. \n\n3. Look at words where we work in \"home\".\n\"Their home\". If they had more time at work, they would have less time at home and that is what the passage is talking about. \"having less time to spend at their home because they're working more\".\n4. Let's look for phrases where the question is asking for \"home\":\n-", "answer": "B: aggression"}
{"text": "1 Whenever you hear an adjective or phrase containing the word \"powered,\" you know it refers to something that can propel movement using a source of power or energy. 2. Let's quickly think of the various objects that are powered through human energy instead of electricity. 3. Options B through D each refer to a specific type of mechanical transportation object. \"Have to sleep,\" \"run,\" and \"row boat\" are all various types of things that propel themselves with human power, so the answer is one of them. 4. Let's eliminate choices A and E. We know that human effort can power objects (A), so it doesn't fit here because it's not the specific type of water transportation being asked about. And we know that human effort can cause items to turn from side to side (E), so this doesn't seem relevant either. 5. Option C states that human-powered objects need to sleep. This doesn't seem right because humans don't sleep while operating a vehicle. Instead, we make ourselves sleep more over a long period of time to have energy to perform a long activity. 6. Therefore, the answer must be D: run, which indicates a form of moving transportation.\nSo the final answers is D: run\n\nInput: Where would you find some people who like to eat? Choices: 1. A: grocery store B: restaurant C: school D: home E: office\nOutput: 1 1. People who like to eat might be found anywhere, but what's important is that they are found there because they like to eat. 2. Answer choice A is excluded because the word \"grocery\" (an option in choice B) means a retail place selling staple foods used in regular home consumption. There is no indication that people in the grocery store like to eat. 3. Answer choice B is also excluded because restaurants serve food for profit, which may disqualify some people from choosing to eat there. 4. Answer choice C is eliminated because the word \"school\" (an option in answer choice D) connotes education, and thus people who like to eat may not attend school. 5. Answer choice D is also eliminated because this doesn't tell us anything specific about eating. 6. Therefore answer choice E is correct because it is", "answer": "E: row boat"}
{"text": "1) Consider each possible answer in turn.\n2) Answer A: Hunting is done only by wild animals, not by customers.\n3) Answer B: Customers generally pay for goods and services, but this is a very vague description. Not only will they pay with money, but they may pay with credit cards; barter with goods; send a check; leave a tip; or pay by placing a bet. Moreover, customers have no interaction with merchants.\n4) Answer C: Mailing orders is a thing that can be done by either customers or merchants. Therefore, this is not an answer.\n5) Answer D: Spending money isn't really a thing either.\n6) Answer E: Demanding satisfaction is perhaps a way to describe a situation in which a customer feels dissatisfaction, but this is not the kind of choice we are looking for.\n7) Finally, the only remaining possibility is that customers do whatever you desire. In fact, the only thing that matters is that they interact with the store. Thus, the answer must be either E or D.\n8) Therefore, the answer must be D, because satisfaction could satisfy (pun intended) either the customer or the merchant.\nSo the final choice is E: customers can demand satisfaction.\n\n# Hint:\nIt's hard to find all the 4 inputs and 5 outputs in a row at the same time.\nBut if you save the input and output information from above and follow the steps below, you should be able to find the information for the next inputs and outputs.\nIn order to obtain the final answers for the problem, you should be able \n    to find the information for each of the inputs in three steps, \n    which is finding the answer for each choices, finding the answer for the second input and finding the answers for all the options. \n    Also, you should find all the answers for each of the question, \n    which are the answers for all of the input option and the answers for the two outputs.

{"text": "1.. Let's examine each response carefully.\n2. Choice \"A: Meet People\" does not help you to feel less lonely. The very premise of being alone is that you don't have people to meet, so inviting people over to your house wouldn't be very helpful in that regard. Also, meeting people can be helpful in reducing loneliness, but it is not a useful activity when you are feeling lonely.\n3. Choices \"B: Meet Friend\" and \"C: Make People Laugh\" both involve socialization, which is a useful activity when you're experiencing loneliness. Making people laugh and meeting people might take your mind of your loneliness for a moment, but they ultimately only serve to temporarily lessen the effects of loneliness. You won't be feeling less lonely when you're done hanging out with them.\n4. Choices \"D: Socialize\" and \"E: Liquor\" are not useful activities for reducing loneliness. You don't need to socialize to feel less lonely, and you also don't need to drink to get over being lonely. \n5. That leaves \"B: Meet Friends,\" which is the one that helps you feel less lonely.\nSo the final two answers are B: Meet Friends\n\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python3.9\n# coding: utf-8\n# Author: Huihuang Cheng\n\"\"\"\n@author:Huihuang Cheng \nDate: 24/1/21  \n\"\"\"\nimport glob\n\nimport spiderFoot.config\nimport spiderFoot\nfrom spiderFoot import Spiderfoot\n\n\nclass TestClass2:\n    \"\"\"Test class for Turing Test: Test2\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self):\n        \"\"\"Init the test class\"\"\"\n        self.config = spiderFoot.config.cfg\n        self.config['port'] = 9009\n        self.config.get_and_set_configs()\n\n        self.parser = spiderFoot.parser.parser2()\n\n        self._spiderFoot = None\n\n    def run(self):\n        # Instantiate and run spiderfoot\n        if __name__ ==", "answer": "D: socialize"}

{"text": "1) Let's focus on each part of the question. We start by noticing the phrase \"Sam didn't like\" and the phrase \"them\". The two terms in this sentence are connected. Therefore, to solve the question we need to find the solution to the dislike of \"them\". \n2) Moving on, we notice that the phrase \"while traveling\" refers to the time of meeting \"them\" which is the solution to the disliking them. This leaves us with finding out what to do in any situation where you dislike the people you met while traveling, regardless of any other aspects or context. \n3) We can eliminate options C \"learn from each other\" and E \"make art\" as they do not address how to get away from the people if you like them. \n4) The options which can help us to get away from people we dislike at a travel location are A. \"Come home\" and D. \"Go out\". The options which deal more with how to socialize or improve the situation is B. \"Airplane\" and E. \"Make art\"\n5) Conclusions: A. \"Come Home\" is an answer, as this choice does not require staying in contact with people you dislike. D. \"Go out\" is not an answer as this choice does require staying in contact and/ or working or interacting with the people you dislike. \n6) Moving on, B. \"AirPlane\" is not an answer, as this is a location which you would most certainly need to interact and be around people. \n7) The choice which addresses how to avoid the people you dislike and do so from the location you are currently at is E. \"Makes Art\".\n8) \"Going Out\" will most likely take you to meeting new people, \"comes home\" does not seem to address the avoiding of people you dislike.\n9) Conclusions: The choices we have left are E. \"art\" and D. \"go\".

It is an adjective referring to emotions, and while cannabis has some mood-altering effects, it doesn't have the direct action of making someone happy.\n\n4. Choice E: Illegal: Illegal also cannot be the answer, as marijuana is legal in some places.\n\n5. Now, let's examine the remaining options.\n\n6. Choice A: Entertainment: Entertainment is not a way in which one would keep marijuana because it is designed for the purpose of recreation and does not have any preservative or protective capabilities. \n\n7. Choice D: Intoxication: Similarly, intoxication cannot be the answer because it is the act of becoming impaired as a result of consuming a substance.\n\n8.

Pennsylvania (B) and Asia (D) are both west of the Eastern time zone. Therefore, these are not the correct answers. Picture has a timezone of America/New_York, which is east of Eastern timezone.\n3) Moving on, we can eliminate the option in Asia because the question does not include a time zone.

A: a hamburger, noon B: hamburger, breakfast C: lunch D: late E: dinner\nOutput: 1) Let's begin by examining each choice closely. \n\nChoice A: noon. There is no questioning it that breakfast, lunch, and dinner are the three times of the day that one will purchase a hamburger and, since it is the time that one purchases, it cannot be used as the answer.\n\nChoice B: breakfast. We can eliminate this as it is not a time when one could be purchasing a hamburger due to one of the three meals occurring after it.\n\nChoice C: Lunch. Lunch could be a time that is used to purchase a hamburger, but it does not contain the word \"hour\" in it and is merely a time range, which is why it cannot be the correct answer.\n\nChoice D: dinner. We cannot have dinner at noon, as it does not occur during that time, and dinner is a time range, not a specific time, meaning it does not contain the correct wording needed to be correct.\n\nChoice E: late. Since late refers to a time range rather than a specific time, the same reasoning as above cannot be used to validate it as the correct choice.\n\n2) In all, since none of the choices answer the question directly and contain the correct words, the answer must be E.\nSo the final answers has to be E: dinner\n\n### Input: What do I usually bring along when I play basketball, even if I'm not going to actually play?

Choices: A: other B: this C: neither D: that E: both\nOutput: 1.\"Only one choice\" (A) is a different option from \"one choice\". \"Only one choice\" means that there is only one thing they do NOT want to use, while \"one choice\" means there is only one thing to use.\n2.\"This\" (B) is an object, and thus not what someone doesn't want to use. \"Neither\" (C) is an adverb, not something someone wouldn't want to use and can\u2019t be used with this option.\n3.\"That\" (D) is an object, so it is correct. \"Both\" (E) is another option indicating that there are at least two choices. \"That\" would be correct. \"Both\", however, would not. \n4.

{"text": "1) To answer this question, we first need to understand what the question is asking: When people want to watch a movie (which is a kind of movie), they often go see it at what location?\n2) From the sentence structure, we can eliminate Choices D: Theatre (no apostrophe for plurals, so it should be spelled theater) and Choice E: Train Station (the correct verb is 'go to' when referring to an exact place).\n3) Looking at the remaining choices, we see that the correct answer is Choice B: Movie (no space between the two words). People often go to the movies to watch a new movie. So the final answer is B: Movie\n\n## 0.22: Tough, Intermediate", "answer": "D: theater"}
{"text": "1.. The first step is to understand the question. In a theater, a ticket will allow a person to sit in a seat with a back facing the stage, but with the rest of the room full of other seats also facing the same direction as you, all facing the stage.\n2. Moving on, let's eliminate any options that don't match the description of the question we are given. In \"Conference\" (B), there aren't many chairs and no backs on the seats, which would make it very difficult to sit facing all the other backs of the seats in the room. \n3. Moving on, there are other options that may be related, but they aren't the best options based on the information we have. Church (E) is a building, but in one room, the seats would not be facing the same direction. \"Church\" (E) is therefore not the answer. \n4. Choice D: floor has the most chairs and they face the same direction, so it is likely the place with the most chairs that face the same way.\n5. That leaves us with A: conference.\nSo the final answers are A: conference\n\nInput: What type of animal would a cat chase in the desert? Choices:  Animal:  A: cat B: dog C: bobcat D: bear E: coyote\nOutput: 1... We have been given an indication that the answer is one of two options, an animal (A) or a place (B). \n\n2. We can eliminate two other options (C and (E) because they aren't type (A - animals) or type (B - places). \n3. Our options for type (A) are cats and dogs, and for type (B) are deserts.\n4. Cat (A) is the one that chases animals rather than places. Therefore, the answer must be cat (A).\nSo the final answer would be A: cat\n\nInput: What part of a movie is a trailer for the movie?

{"text": "1\"The keys were black and \"white.\" What were they attached to?\" \n2. By looking at the question again, we see that the \"keys\" are an object and \"you\" are trying to discover their place of attachment. \n3. Because these keys have a place of attachment (A), we can eliminate option B and C.\n4. Piano (E) has chains to raise or lower it, but these chains are for piano movement, not piano attachment to an object. \n5. To narrow down our options, let's consider that piano (E) is the answer. That means the keys we are looking for must be attached to either a stand (D) or a bench (F). \n6. However, \"bench\" (F) is the wrong option because piano \"benches\" usually include no keys at all. \n7. Therefore, the correct answer is \"Stand\" (D), because piano \"stands\" do include keys.\nSo the final answers is D: stand\n\nInput: To have a successful evening, you need to be prepared.

{"text": "1- The first step is to eliminate obviously incorrect answers. B, C, and D are wrong. \"Get tired\" (B) is physically impossible. It doesn't matter how long you run after the ball, you will never get tired. Skip (C) doesn't really make sense. We're not jumping over the ball, so we don't need to skip. And finally, \"not fat\" (D) is not required to run after a ball. It's a good idea to have strong legs, but it's unnecessary to check to see if you're not fat. \n2. Next, we look for things that are required in some way. E refers to looking first but it is not necessary. This answer can only be eliminated from our list. \n3. A refers to \"have legs\", which is definitely necessary, so this can now be added to our list. \n4. Finally, we have C, \"Have legs\", which is necessary for physical activities, and C, \"not be a cat\". Not being a cat has nothing to do with running, so we cross it off from our list. 5. From our list, the only answer that's necessary to run after a ball is A, \"have legs\", so the answer is A: Have legs.\nSo the final answers is A: have legs\n\nExample 2: \nInstruction:\n\nInput: In what direction do clouds travel? Choices:  - A: away from the airport B: away from the sea C: towards the sun D: to the moon E: to the ocean \nOutput: So it is important to understand what clouds travel and why they are considered to travel in a specific direction. 1. The clouds are floating objects that travel, not flying objects. 2. They always travel in a direction, not randomly. \n3. In addition to that, clouds travel to the East, as seen from the Sun, which indicates that they head West as they travel. 4. There is no ocean in the North, it is always north at any place. Clouds do not travel towards Moon or Sea as seen from South.\n5. Clouds do not follow any specific path, they follow their desired direction, but from a different perspective they follow a certain direction.\n6. The clouds are seen from South, but there is no Ocean or Sea. They are not", "answer": "B: have legs"}

They could be a teacher, coach, parents, etc.\n2) The answer doesn't need to be specifically a \"treat\", so we don't consider \"candy store\" (B) or \"kitchen\" (D). \n3) If kids were in a car, or if they were being dropped off somewhere, they might get something to \"snack\" on, so the butcher shop (C) seems like a good option.\n4) On some level, kids might go to the post office (E) at some time, but not to shop there.\n5) In conclusion, the answer is in Butcher Shop (C).\nSo the final answer", "answer": "A: candy store"}
{"text": "1) We will start by understanding what the question really is asking. \"Where could you find a washroom that is used only by staff?\" This implies a washroom that only staff use.\n2) Let's now discuss possible locations. The first one is house, but this is not an option because a house is a residential area and if staff lived in a house then it would not be a staff-only laundry room, since a house normally contains people that live in it. \n3) Hotel: This is an option which is a hotel. A hotel would indeed have a laundry room for use by staff and it could be considered for the answer! However, a hotel is used mainly by guests, which means that if a hotel has a staff-only landry room it would be used primarily by those working in the hotel, such as hotel staff.\n4) Now, greenhouse: \"Greenhouse\" is a great answer because it is a location that often has a laundry room as a facility. However, the question says staff-only, which would indicate that workers would be the main inhabitants. Also, \"greenhouse\" is an unusual option, which suggests that it may not be correct. \n5) The answer \"college\" would indeed be a good choice. This indicates that there is a dorm building. Furthermore, a dorm building's laundry room is likely only opened for students or college personnel, making it staff-only.\n6) \"College\" would then be the answer since a laundry room in a dorm building would be used by staff and possibly other students.\nSo the final correct answer is E: College (not school, work, etc. because this will not be staff-only)\n\nInput: Where should you go to see someone singing?

{"text": "1) In the previous question, we established that the answer to \"The artist didn't... paint the countryside.\" is \"D: middle America\" (The artist was famous for painting the middle of America because he rarely painted the countryside). \n2) Now let's analyze \"The artist didn'... capture the view...\" to see what is meant by the \"view\".\n3) We can assume that the \"view\" is a representation of the countryside. When an artist captures a view, it means they paint a picture of something from a distance.\n4) Let's dissect the other answer choices. \"The artist didn' use many colors\" is an answer choice, we know from previous questions, that is incorrect because the artist was well-known for his use of vibrant colors. \"He was famous\" is a possible response, but not necessarily the correct answer. We need \"The artist didn' capture the view\" and \"He was famous\" to be relevant to the \"view\". \"landscapes\", \"east sides\", \"countrysides\", and \"G.eorgas\" (Georgia) have nothing to do with the view. \n5) Answer \"C: countryside\" is the correct answer because an artist \"doesn' capturing the view\" is a countryside and \"lands\" are areas where people live and work. Furthermore, the artist \"didn' use many colors\" because the countryside doesn't have many colors and people don't live on a countryside. 6) Therefore, the correct answer is \"C: countryman\".\nSo the final answer has to be C: countryman\n\nInput:Why is the ocean more blue than a bucket?

Rabbit (A) and porcupine (G) aren't animals you might find near streams either, so aren't right. Similarly to bird (D), pig (C) do eat fish, so aren't the answer. \n3: The only remaining option is Cow (B). The first was incorrect, so have to look at the remaining three.

{"text": "1 \"Where would you read a paragraph but not write it?\"\n2. The answer is \"C: bible\". This is a passage that should be read but not written.\n3. This is the only answer that gives a detailed, precise instance of the concept asked.\n4. The other choices are either not passages (E), are passages that could be written or read (A, B, D, E), or are phrases, not passages (E).\n5. For another example, we have \"labyrinth\" of question B. A labyrinth is not a passage but contains passages. Because we don't know specifically about a single passage, this is a bad choice. \n6. This question type is \"Where would you read\u2026\" and a passage is a unit of text suitable for reading.\n7. Therefore, the answer to this question is \"C: bibles\".\nSo the final answer\n\nInput:What sort of place has a great deal of trees?

This option is either a region or a collection of trees, not a location. \"\n\n3.\"We will also eliminate choice B C: 'A city'. Even though this choice is a location, we would expect it to contain a wide variety of things, not a large abundance of trees. \"\n4.\"We will also eliminate D: 'The South' because it doesn't specifically mention the location of trees. It could be describing the location of a person instead of the location of the trees.\"\n\n5.\"This means the only remaining answer is A: 'A city'.\"", "answer": "C: bible"}

{"text": "1) We don't know if what we're looking for happens to be very or highly criticized yet. We don't know much beyond this point, without additional knowledge.\n2) Let's look at what we do know now. We know that we are looking for a security system based on criticism. We'll take this as a given that it's bad, and we'll proceed assuming it's bad.\n3) The question asks what? We're looking for a security system, right?\n4) We know this security system is based in criticism, but what is it? We're not sure yet.\n5) To make an educated guess, we need to learn more about the security system in question. But, first, we need to eliminate the wrong answers.\n6) \"Concert\" has the word \"concert\" in it, but nothing about the question indicates whether this word has anything to do with what we're looking at. Therefore, we eliminate this answer. \n7) \"Home\" is also wrong, for the same reason. \n8) \"Terminal\" may have something to do with what we are looking for, but again, there's no guarantee at this point. We'll try and eliminate it as well. Let's find what's wrong with it. \n9) \"Terminal\" is likely a reference to airport security. While this could be somewhat bad, it's not really security on its own or security in itself. There must be more to the question, unless we have incomplete information of something. \"Airport\" itself might also have something to do with something else. Let's assume we're correct and work from that.\n10) We can also see by putting \"airport\" in quotes that this is more of an identification, such as a tag on one's luggage. This seems to disqualify whatever we're looking at from being the question. It has to refer to the security system itself. So \"Airport\" is out too. \n11) We've eliminated everything and we're back to the question. So, it seems logical that the question must refer to the security system in itself. It doesn't describe or refer to part of the security system. Let's see how \"University\" measures up. \n12) \"University\" is", "answer": "E: airport"}
{"text": "1: Let's inspect the options.\n2: \"Feel pleasure\" (B) is not a goal. The point of makeup is to enhance someone's appeal to others by looking more attractive. Pleasure is a secondary goal.\n3: Similarly, \"Look attractive\" (C) is a different goal. The goal here is to enhance one's look to achieve attractiveness.\n4: \"Compliments\" (D) also does not fit the description. Appearing interesting will garner compliments, which is a side-effect of the goal, not the desired result.\n5 \"Look interesting\" (E) and \"Enjoyment/Joy\" (D) are both possible results of makeup, but the goal of applying makeup is not to achieve these results.\n6 \"The goal of applying makeup\" (C) is the correct choice!\nHence the answer is C:enjoy experiences\nSo the final answer here is C: enjoy experiences\n\ninput: A person uses makeup to enhance a person's overall look. The makeup is typically spread on the entire face. What is also true? Choices: A: People use less makeup the older they get B: People use the most makeup when they are under 20 years of age C: Many people don't use makeup when under 20 D: Many people don\u2019t like the taste of makeup E: Many people don\u2019s use makeup when under twenty \noutput: 1: Starting off with A: is the first assumption many try, but actually it's the wrong solution. We use makeup to enhance our overall look but we don't use make up on our entire face. \n2: Secondly, we can eliminate B: as the only possibility makes the question seem too easy. \n3: If we consider C: then we also have to consider D: As many people don't wear any types of make up.

{"text": "1-4. Similar to the previous question, what does the first part of the question tell us? \"Where is a horse likely?\" The word \"likely\" indicates that in this scenario, the horse is not located.\n5. Therefore the first part of the sentence acts as a hint. We look at where horses do live and would not be likely to find this. \n6. Option A is the only option that does not contain the word \"horse\" in it.\"michigan\" refers to a state which would likely not have a horse. \n7. Option B contains the word \"stable.\" Stables are places where horses live. But is a horse likely to be in a stable it doesn't live in? \n8. Option C contains the word \"race track,\" which is a place where horses race. \n10. Choice B \"stable.\" A horse is likely to live in a stable, so we need to look at the other options to determine whether a horse is likely to live somewhere else. \n11. Option C \"race track\" contains the word \"race.\" A horse is likely \"to race,\" but \"to race\" on a race track, so the answer is C: Race Track\nSo the final answer Is: C: race track\n\nInput: Where do you find a turtle? Choices: 1. A: a lake 2. B: a pond 3. C: in the sea 4. D: on land 5. A river\nOutput: 1 - 4\n1. \"A turtle\" is a singular noun. This indicates that \"you\" is not the only one who would find a turtle, but anyone could find a turtle.\n2. Option B \"pond\" contains the word pond, so it is certainly possible to find a turtle in a pond. However, this is not the singular answer because ponds are a collective, plural noun.\n3. Option C \"in the sea\" does not contain the singular turtle and it does not contain the singular word \"you,\" so it is not the singular answer.\n4. Option D \"on land\" does contain the singular turtles and \"you,\" so this is the singular answer.\nTherefore, the singular answer is option D: on land\n\nInput: Why could a person be having difficulty reading", "answer": "D: farm yard"}
{"text": "1. We know that James kept a clipboard where it was easy to find it. That means this is a physical object like a stationery supply, but it cannot be physical objects found in a desk or a place of work.\n2. Options A and B are not suitable options, because a shelf is something that you can easily move around and does not contain a large space where you could find a clipboard. Desks are like shelves, if a desk is your place of work, you will have your desk arranged the way you want that it can give you the space to store anything conveniently. A desk is not something where we can find any thing easily, but has to be organized for specific purposes\n3. Similarly, we can easily dismiss options C and E from the question. Place of work and school are again not what the question wants to us to find.\n4. Thus, the only remaining is D: office supply. This is the place that gives us the largest space where we can look for it. Office supply stores are easily organized and managed to make it easier to find any item you may want to find.\nSo the final ans is D: office supply store.\n\n#### Difficulty\nMedium (1 out of 1)", "answer": "C: desk"}
{"text": "1) Let's briefly examine each possibility.\n6) It is important to start by understanding a couple of key terms. \"barefooted\" refers to being barefoot, which has the connotation of not wearing shoes (i.e. no protection on the feet). \"after\" means the occurrence of something after another event. \"the rain\" means precipitation from the sky. The key question here is \"after the rain,\" indicating the event after precipitation.\n7) Choice A: shoes. This is not really a possibility because shoes are a standard accessory worn with or in the rain. \n8) Choice B: wet ground. This is a valid response because walking on wet ground is unsafe, as the ground tends to be very slippery. \n9) Choice C: wet clothes. It wouldn't be possible to walk barefoot after wet clothes, as the wet clothes would probably also be wet on the wearer's feet. \n10) Choice D: start to fall. It wouldn't really be dangerous for \"the rain\" start to fall on someone's feet, this implies slippery conditions. \n11) Lastly, Choice E: water garden - A water garden has water, so walking there barefoot could be dangerous because you'd fall in the water.\nThus, the answer is E: water garden.\nSo the final question is A: water garden\n\nInput: Where is a suitable place to take a nap?

The word suggests that people use the object in some way. However, the word \"use\" could refer to many different things, like \"use it\" -- which has nothing to do with what we have been given in the question. In addition, it's rather odd that it would need to be given the term \"guideline\" at such a specific time in the instruction.\n5.) \"Trying It\" (B) is obviously not an acceptable answer, as a person wouldn't need to use such because it would already be trying it.\n6.) \"Getting...\" (A) is the correct answer.

Similarly, Choice \"D\" is not true as a person can't eat an ant.\n3. We can now eliminate four options, leaving us with \"C\", \"Elephant\",\n4. Since a person can't normally eat an elephant because it's way too large, Choice \"C\" is wrong.\n5.

A house has many different rooms: den, family room, kitchen, living room, bathroom.\n5) Option B: Den. In a den, this chair would sit on the carpet. The purpose of having a den is to relax and unwind. Sitting on a chair on carpet is not the best option for relaxing.\n6) Option C: Family room. In a family room, a chair would be atop some sort of carpeting or wood floor. This isn't the optimal resting place either, as it would not be relaxing enough.\n7) Option D: Wood. A wood floor is likely the best surface for a chair/bean bag. It is smooth, provides cushion so that the chair will not be too hard to sit on, and it will allow for relaxation.\n8) Option E: Floor. This is the final option. If a floor is wood, then this will be the best surface for the chair to sit on. In most floors, this would likely be the safest option as well.\n9) Overall, we want a surface on which to place the chair that will provide the best relaxation.

However, it is something adults can do because they have enough money to pay bills, which is sometimes not the case for young adults, so it is unlikely that being expected to pay bills is a requirement for being an adult. \n5. \"Smoke\" (E) is also an activity that adults do at various times during their lives. However, there are many people who never smoke, so it is unlikely to be a requirement of maturity. \n6. \"Talk to each other\" (E) is somewhat of an activity, but not as much of a requirement of maturation as the other answers.

While boredom can occur before we choose an option, that is the opposite of what Dan said.\n7. \"Option D: Stand in line.\" \"Stand in line\" is also an incorrect answer choice because that is literally the act of getting in line. Dan was pointing out that getting in a line would lead to the outcome of waiting on line. \n8. \"Option E: Have to wait for.\" This isn't what Dan was saying because he was referring to getting in a line and it made more sense that getting in a line (option E) would lead to having to wait for something.\n9.

So we are left with 'Opera' and 'Television' as the best answers.\n7. 'Take Class' involves learning so we eliminate it. We have to look at the other two and determine which one is a TV program.\n8. 'Opera' (C) is about watching opera, so we can eliminate that one.\n9. This leaves us with just 'Television'. The correct answer is 'Television'. So the final answer is D : Television\n\nInput: What would not be at the end of a snake? Choices: 1: Tail A: head 2: Jaws B: mouth\nOutput: 1.'Jaws' (B) is not at the end of a long snake.\n2.'Head' (A) is at the end of a snakes and thus cannot be at the end of the snake.\n3. Let's look at the rest - 'The Tail' (C), 'Mouth' (B), 'Abdomen' (E), and 'Tongue' (F).\n4.'Tail' (C) is at the end at the snake, but the key is what would not be at the snake's end.\n5.'Mouth' (B) is at the end, but it is also a part of a snakes.

In order to know that the narrator would not be the one sticking (out), the narrator and the person must be uglier than another person.\n3. But to have this other, even uglier person, there must have been multiple uglier people than the narrator and the other person.\n4.

This does not match the answer (grooming is often recommended to greasy/oily/dirty teenagers; what does it mean to be neat?). \n3) Option B: selfishness. This does not make any sense. \n4) Option C: mistakes. The answer is not \"mistakes\" - this is not a way that greasy teens are advised to greasy. \n5) Option D: cleanliness. Option D mentions cleanliness twice, but that is not the purpose of grooming. Grooming is a way to cleanse oily parts of the body.\n6) And finally, Option E: satisfaction.

{"text": "1: When having food at a formal event such as a wedding, the correct answer is C: Talk. The event is likely being filmed and would require people talking. Sitting and drinking are not normally associated with a formal event, so we rule those out. Medium is likely not applicable for a dinner party, so \"Mixed\" (E) is also crossed off. Finally, \"Being sociable\" (B) should be a given when having food with people, but isn't necessarily something to do immediately after receiving the food.\n2: Thus, the correct answer is Talk since it is the most common thing to do at a formal event like a dinner party given the constraints set.\nSo the final answers are B: being sociable and Talk.\nBecause the option B: being sociable is the correct answer.\n\nInput:If someone has a good attitude, but bad luck, what would probably happen to their happiness and mood? Choices: 1) Improve 2) Worsen 3) Stay the same 4) Decrease 5) None of the above.\nOutput: 1) You should first eliminate bad answers, like \"Lose Weight\" (D), or \"Find A Job\" (B).\n2) Next, start removing answers that are out of the scope of the question. For instance, \"Change Country\" (A), \"Become Famous\" (C), \"Find Love\" (E). Finally, \"Help Out A Neighbor\" (F).\n3) After that, just check \"Remain The Same\" (C). We don't know the original attititude yet, or the answer given in the question, so we have to assume that it hasn't affected it one way or the other. If it changed, then the answer would be incorrect.\n4) Therefore \"Stay The Same\" should be eliminated.\n5) Finally, you can eliminate \"None of the Above\", because even if their mood or happiness did worsen, their attitude could still be considered good, so it wouldn't match the given answer.\n\nSo the final answer here is B) None of the above Because their happiness or Mood is affected by their attitude but not vice versa.\n###", "answer": "A: sit"}

Thus, the answers that involve physical harm, such as injury, cannot be the answer.\n3.The word \"perfection\" implies no mistakes at all occurred. As such, it cannot be the answer. \n4.The word \"errors\" clearly indicates a mistake, so it cannot be the answer either. \n5.The word \"errrors\" could refer to both mistakes and errors. However, we rule out this answer because the question is asking for the name of a tracked stat, which implies the answer will only be a word, not a phrase.\n6.Finally, \"happiness\" is not the correct answer because it describes neither a mistake nor the name of a stat.\n7.Therefore, the answer is D: Errors.\nSo the final  answer is D: Error\n\nInput:The city with highest crime is, this city is.

Choices:  a: cat b: man c: sheep d: wolf e: barking itself\nOutput: 1: The correct answer is d) Wolf. Dogs get their bark from wolves, the natural species that they were bred from.\n2: A bark also comes from the sound that a dog is making, which can be either animal or mechanical. The correct answer is e) Barking itself. \n3: A bark can also refer to either sound or behavior, such as in the phrase \"to bark orders\". The bark from a dog is therefore an action more than it is a sound. \n4: The correct answer is c) Sheep because it is the only option that begins with s and is in the animal kingdom.\n5: A bark can refer to a sound or an animal as it does in \"barking up the wrong tree\".

Although this could be an improvement over the current pay, it is not the answer choice here, because the question asks about a person who wants to make their current job pay better.\n4) Choice C: win lottery. The correct answer choice is that you probably would never be able to pay your current paycheck's value. This is a very unlikely event that is not directly linked to pay.\n5) Choice D: save money. This seems to be the correct answer as the question is about the person improving their quality of life. In order to have more money they will need to save more.\n6) Choice E: feel safe. This is not in the correct context since the question is asking about pay rather than feelings. \n\nSo the final answer for this question is D: save money.\n\nInput:What might keep someone from having their meal at a park?Choices:  A: no food B: no dishes C: no picnic table D: rain E: sun\nOutput:1) Let's start by eliminating answers which aren't relevant to this question. \"No food\" (B) relates to having no food to eat, which doesn't cause the person to avoid eating. \"No dishes\" (C) similarly doesn't have a great connection to having a meal or eating. The only choice we can eliminate at this point is \"No dishes\" as \"No food\" would seemingly relate to the person not eating if they had no food.\n2) Now let's take a look at each of the remaining answer choices and see if any of them match up with the question.\n3) Since a lot of people eat \"meals\" on \"picnic tables\" (D), we can probably assume that a lack of such a table is probably why someone might not want to eat there.\n4) We can eliminate \"rain\" (E) as a possibility, because no one would want to eat outside during a rainstorm.\n5) Since many people don't want to eat by themselves outdoors in the sun (E), we can", "answer": "B: better job"}

Of the choices, A: eyes and B: Biology laboratory seem reasonable choices for a place to find fungi growing on something made from cheese. \n4. Consider A: eyes. This is a logical place to find fungus because milk is used in some kinds of cheese. \n5. Consider B: Biology laboratoroy. Some people say this is where we find \"fungus growing\" because this is where we find biological research. \n6. Let's consider that we may not find fungus on milk, and instead we find fungus in the laboratory. This would imply that we didn't find it growing from the cheese because it is in the laboratory and not on the cheese.\n7. Therefore, the choice that best describes the possibility is B: Biology laboratroy, which is the only one which could lead us to find fungus in a biology lab while not on the cheese itself.\n\nSo the final answer, the correct answer, is B: Biology Laboratory.\n\nInput:Where have you found people using their hands? Choices: \n\nA: airplanes\nB: hospital\nC: bakery\nD: on earth\nE: airport\n\nOutput:1: There are several locations people use hands. \n\n2: To find the right location, consider the word \"found\". \n\nSince the question asks \"where have you found people using hands\" it should be asking something like \"where has someone found people using hands.\" In other words, the location itself hasn't necessarily used its hands, so it shouldn't be listed as an option.\n\n3: Thus, the correct answer is Choice B: Hospital because the question is asking where someone found people using their hands, and hospitals have people using their hands, so the answer is \"Hospital\".\n\nInput: What time is it now?\nOutput:Current time.\n\n\n***\n\n**_Lead-in:_** This is a logic puzzle where I will describe a scenario (the prem", "answer": "D: old cheese"}

So it cannot be correctly identified as a \"metal rod\".\n3. Choice \"B: construction site\": a construction site can have metal rods, but this is not most people's preferred mode of transportation.\n4. Choices \"C: shops\" and \"D: engine\": both are related (and related to the construction site) so let's start with these two options. Shops do not necessarily have airplanes nor do they have most people's preferred modes of transportation.  Engine is also not a shop and has nothing to do with airplanes. Lastly, construction sites themselves usually don't directly contain airplanes.\n5. Choice \"E: broken bone\": broken bones are sometimes treated with metal rods, so in a medical context, that works.\n6. This leaves us with choice \"B: construction site\" because it can in fact have metal rods.

That leaves us with: standing against a wall, next to a sink, and on a pencil's cup.\n2: Let's examine each of the possible options. \"Standing against a wall\": this does not work. Pencils have different sharpenings than walls do. \"Near a pencil cup\": the cup would contain a pencil and the pencil in a cup (for example, an eraser) so it doesn't help to rest a pencils.\n3: \"Near a sink\": it could work but a", "answer": "D: engine"}

{"text": "1 Choices A can be eliminated as a false choice because the question clearly asks us where to go, and not how to drive there.\n2 Choices E can be eliminated because road blocks only serve to get in the way of our destination, rather than getting us to it.\n3 Choices B can be eliminated, as populated areas are not a place in particular, and it is not required that the destination of Sammy's trip to be in one of these populated areas.\n4 Choice D can be eliminated because the question explicitly asks us to focus on a destination that is within cities, meaning that our destination would not be in a rural area. If, for example, some people on a desert island are visiting the city to watch a baseball game, then we could not say Sammy wanted to go where the people were, as that would be a city, specifically.\nThat leaves only choice C for the actual answer. If Sammy wants to go where the people are, then presumably he does not want to go where no-one is, which is the desert. From this we can say that he wants to go to a populated area with people.\nSo the final choice is C: populated areas.\n\nInput: If I go in the direction I wish, what does that mean? Choices: 1.

Choices:  a. Clean out your pipes b. Place a bucket under the overflow c. Let your toilet overflow d. Shut off the water e. Remove the lid\nOutput:  First note that there are many questions that require us to determine which answer choice does not fit the context. The question \"Which ____ does not tell what to do when your toilet overflows?\" would not be asked if there were an obvious answer.\n1.Let's eliminate the unsuitable statements. \"Clean out your pipes\" (A) would not be a recommended solution for a person who has their toilet overflowing. \n2. \"Remove the lid\" (E) would not fit into the context, as this can cause one's toilet to overflow. \n3. As for the remaining statements, \"Place a bucket\" (B) and \"Shut off the water\" (D), those are both valid answers. While they are not required, either option can be useful for preventing or stopping a toilet from overflowing.\n4. However, this means that \"Let your toilet overflow\" (C) is the incorrect choice, as that would simply let the overflow continue until the toilet empties itself.\n5. Thus, the answer for this question is \"Let your toileto overflow\" (C).\nSo the final answer to the question is C: Let your toileto Overflow", "answer": "A: loss of heat"}

In order to identify the correct answer, we need to understand the phrase \"typically contracts.\" This refers to contracting something, and a \"contract\" is an agreement for something.\n3.) In this context, the something has a singular connotation, implying that a singular person is referred to when the phrase is used as \"what type of person can you find typically contracting something.\"\n4.) A hospital is a place where sick and injured people go in order to be treated. Therefore, a sick and/or injured person would be found here, as well as anyone who works at the hospital. \n5.) An office is a place where someone works, and could theoretically be contracted as they work.\n6.) A doctor's office is a space where sick people seek treatment. Thus, when they are contracted, they could be contracted as they travel from the doctor's office to home or vice versa.\n7.) In order to correctly determine the answer, we need to identify who would typically be found contracting an illness. Here, the phrase refers to a sick person becoming sick, thus an elderly person can be contracting an illness when they're sick from a common cold, but not when the sick is from another illness.\n8.) Therefore, the only answer that fits the constraints of the phrase and the wording of the question is E: doctor's offices.\nSo the final answers is A: hospital B: at their office C: on a head D: or an elderly\n\nInput: There are several ways to find a new address to send a package to.

{"text": "1.\"When you are at your workplace and you want to choose which entrance to take to visit another employee's desk, there's many places you might start. There are several entrances, but only one is optimal for you.\"\n2. There are two logical possibilities. The first is if you were trying to avoid going through the back entrance since it is possible your workplace may have a back entrance that is used by people who are going into the building who work there, rather than people who are outside the building. These people would typically go through the main entrance. Another possibility would be that your workplace used a backdoor since it is likely that people who leave the building would not typically go through the main doors, but instead use the back entrance.\n3. From these two possibilities, it is likely that a customer who works inside the building would not be using the back entrance. Thus, Choice A: Side can be eliminated since this is not the direction people who work there would go in. Choice B: Main can be eliminated since the person who works in a business would not use this entrance in case there are people from outside the building trying to get inside.\n4. Choices C and D are inappropriate because \"anterior\" means in the \"front\", while \"front\" means \"in front of you\". Choice E: Front can be eliminated because going through the front door would be \"current\", which means already happening, while this question is about avoiding the back entrance.\n5. Choice option A: Side can be used since this would be like avoiding the \"front entrance\" of a building from the outside of the building. Therefore, the answer to which entrance you would use to avoid going to the back entrance is option A: Side.\nSo the finals answer is A: Side\n\nInput: In which position on a clock does 11:00 occur?

We can then examine the choices to see which one they refer to.\n3.) Choice A: park.\n4.) The word park can be interpreted in more than one way in the scenario given. The more obvious meaning of the word is a garden or area of plant life. Another meaning is a lot that is used for storing vehicles.\n5.) The word park as used in this context (that\u2019s why they tell them they have to go park all their cars) refers to a storage lot for used cars. Thus, that is not the correct choice.\n6.) Choice B: make time for.\n7.) As for the word make time for, it means to do something at a later date. This answer does not fit the question of making time for the drug kingpin\u2019s request in the given scenario.\n8.) Choice C: Take the money.\n9.)

Option C: contained  because this describes an enclosure that is typically used to hold animals,  Option D: paying  because this describes a situation when someone makes actual payments or deposits. \n3. Of the three remaining answers, only Option E: caught is correct. This happens to explain the unfortunate state of the child\u2019s parents who were lured in by the false promise of a \"free\" game and then sucked into spending real money on microtransactions. Choice A: costly cannot be the right answer because it means charging too much for something. Option D: paying is not correct because it indicates the parents voluntarily paying money willingly and not because they feel deceived by the game or something.\n4. Choosing Option E: caught leaves us with a simple answer, the microtransactions trapped the parents into paying for things they didn't want.

The snow and heat are opposites. Why would a surface be hot due to snow rather than sunshine?\nThis eliminates Choice C.\n\nD: \"The street made the surface hot. \", (D) is similar to Choice C.  It is unclear in this example why the street and heat are related, so it can be rejected as well.\n\nThis leaves Choice B: \"The windowsill made the surface hot.. \"  The explanation would be that the sun (hot and sunshine) passed through a windowsill and made it hot. \nIt is a less likely scenario than outdoor exposure due to the mention of James taking his shoes off at the beach, but it is one of the possible choices.\n\nThus, the answer is B: windowsill.\nSo the final answers is B: windowsill\n\nInput: \"Bill is wearing his favorite pair of shoes\".

Choice B, \"augment\", is a verb meaning to \"fill or increase (something) to a larger or more impressive level\". Thus, it is not the right answer choice because Jamie did not try to fill her waist to a larger or more \"impressive\" level. \n3. Similar to the answer B, \"dispare\" does not match with the word to reduce, as it would be inaccurate to have \"dispare\" instead of \"reduce\". This is another incorrect answer. \n4. \"Make larger\" is another false choice that does not align with the question. \"Make larger\" and \"gain weight\" (choice A) are similar, but using them together does not match with the context and \"large\" is a different meaning altogether.\n5. \"Expand\" is not the answer, either, because this choice does not apply to reducing a waist size. Again, this differs from the context. \n6. Lastly and most importantly, \"E\" is the answer: \"Jamie wanted to dis-pare her waist size, and she continued to dis-pare the waist size\". Note that the dis- in the word \"dis-pare\" does not mean opposite of the word \"pare\". Instead the \"dis-\" is a Greek suffix that is used to indicate that Jamie was doing something that was negative and opposing her initial desire to reduce her waist. She tried many different methods, and ultimately they did not succeed, but she also continued to fail to reduce the waist size. \nTherefore, the answer is E: expand\n\nInput: What will not be found in the toothpaste aisle? Choices: 1. A: toothbrush 2. B: mouthwash 3. C: toothpaste 4. D: dentist 5. E: teeth\nOutput: 1  In order to answer this question, we must first understand the question. Let's do some exploration. We could say: \"what will not be found in toothpaste aisles?\". That's not exactly right, though. It's more like \"What will not be found in/on the shelf of the toothpaste ailse?\" and \"What", "answer": "A: gain weight"}
{"text": "1) So, we can begin with the question. \"John and James spent most\" is the first clue that the pair of them are on a team working together. \n2) \"The time required to communicate slowe down their?\" Communication is crucial on a time-sensitive project, so slow communication would slow down the progress they need to be making.\n3) \"What slowed their progress?\" Well, they spent time talking to each other. However, one or both of them can be working on another project or the problem at hand at the same time as talking to the other person. \n4) \"The time required\" The time required is for communicating and only in that task. \n5) \"Their progress\" The time they spent communicating didn't make them slower, it only delayed the progress they were trying to make. \n6) \"Their what?\" The correct answer must be the word they used -- \"Progres.\" \n7) \"slower progress\" Progress is slower as a result of the slow communication, not because of the communication. In other words, when progress slowed, the communication caused progress to slow down further and not vice versa. Since the progress is slower and communication is the cause, we can eliminate choices A, B, and E. \n8) \"transfer of information\" Choice D, \"transfer of information,\" is also wrong for it refers to the communication not the progress. \n9) \"The Collaboration\" As mentioned in the initial question, John and James are part of a job team or business group, so their project must be part of the same. Choice B, \"Collaboration,\" is also incorrect. \n10) \"static\" The remaining choice is \"static.\" However, it is only used in computing, not to compare with a situation related to teamwork. \nSo the final answer if B: Collaboration\n\nInput: Where can I find pens with a name of a company?

{"text": "1.\"She\" is the subject that loves buying.\n2.\"Products\" is the object that she loves shopping for.\n3.\"What\" is her practical needs, which are the things she needs in order to satisfy a practical purpose.\n4.\"More\" indicates that she wants to shop more than anything else, which is \"practical\".\n5.\"Needs\" is the root word for \"practical\", meaning practical.\n6.\"Than\" is a conjunction joining \"needs\" and \"more\" together to show comparison.  \n\"Any\" is the negating word, indicating that there aren't any practical needs other than her love of shopping.\n7. So the phrase becomes, \"She loved buying products more than any practical needs.\n8. The key to breaking this phrase down and determining the answer is recognizing that the phrase ends with the words \"practical needs.\" Those are the essential information required to find the answer. \n9. That leaves us with the following answers: \n10. \"Money\" is the object that is associated with practical needs, so it cannot be the answer.\n11. \"Time\" is used to measure practical needs, but it is not the practical need herself, so it cannot be correct either.\n12. \"Credit\" is also used to measure practical needs but is not used to buy products as needed.\n13.\"Spending money\" is an action used to define practical needs, but is not the practical need itself.\n14.\"Desire\" is often used to measure practical needs as well when the goal is a higher salary or compensation. This means \"desire\" could be the practical need herself.  \n\"Practical needs\" is the essential information and the key phrase, and therefore  would be the correct answer.\nSo the final answers are B: A practical need is practical needs and B is the answer.", "answer": "A: desire"}

Within this dream, we are unaware of our conscious state and what is occurring. 3. \"He had trouble telling it from reality\" is an incorrect answer because we are not aware of what reality is at all when we are asleep. 4. \"Imagination\" (B) is false. This is not just a creative imagination, but a mental process that occurs in our subconscious mind that includes memories, unconscious thoughts and dreams. 5. \"Dreamworker\" (D) is the correct answer. In this case, a \"Dreamworker\" is a person who is analyzing your dream, like a psychologist or therapist.\nSo the final answers is D: dreamworker\n\nInput: The following is a description that I heard years ago.

B: Somehow this seems to be more common in older people. C: I guess I've never actually thought about it. D: What am I supposed to infer? E: So my assumption is correct.\nOutput: 1:\"The following is a description that i hear years back.\" This text is an example of a story that an individual has been told.

Option A: \"I've been to lots if places, but I have never seen it in real-life.\" 4. This option does not make sense because real life is a place you could actually see something. 5. Option B: \"Somehow, this seems to be more popular in older people.\" This is not the correct answer because this description isn't about age.\n6. Option Choice C: \"I guess I've never really thought about it.\" This is not the answer either because the text doesn't mention the individual's thought process or lack thereof. 7.

{"text": "1.\"What does the waiter do when serving a table?\" This is a riddle that asks \"At the end of your dinner, when the waiter serves my food, which of the following is the correct response?\" The key is to understand what \"end of your meal\" means. It means either \"after your meal\" or \"at the end of serving a meal\" (because the waiter isn't typically serving food until the end of a meal.)\n2. Looking at the options, we can eliminate them by understanding what we would expect at each place. Option A: \"Serve food\" is not the right answer because it's at the end of the meal that the meal is served, not at the beginning. Option B: \"Eat\" is incorrect because diners already ate at the before-mentioned \"end of the meal\" and are typically done eating. \n3. To further understand this concept, we use a metaphor: a diner is a person who is served food at a restaurant by a waiter. The diner will typically eat at several tables throughout their meal, which has a beginning, but no end as there is no official time to finish. Instead, their meal concludes when the waiter gives them their bill at the \"end of (their) meal\". It's at this time that the waiter will present the bill to be paid. \n4. Option C: \"Serve meal\" would only be correct if the beginning of the meal (not end) was being served and this is not what the question is asking about. Similarly option D: \"Present bill\" is the correct answer because it occurs at the end of the food serving, which is the whole point in the question. \n5. The answer is D: Serve meal.\nSo the final answers are D: Serve meals and option D: Present Bill\n\nInput:When you see a lot of people in front, what does your friend think they are doing?

The only temple in a city is The Hajia Mosque (D),  but the answer is not a city. \n5.The only temple in the Jewish Community(C),  the correct answer is \"Jerusalem.\"  \nSo the final answer the most famous temple is: Jerusalem\n\nInput: Which part of Europe isn't made up of multiple areas and countries?  Choices: A: Spain, B: Switzerland, C: Scandinavia, D: Baltic states, E: Germany\nOutput: 1 : Let me explain why each option is wrong one by one: Option \"A\" Spain isn't a part of Europe and it isn't made up by multiple countries, so that's out. \nOption \"B\" Switzerland isn't a part in Europe and isn't a single country, so that's also out. \nOption C : Scandinavia isn't a part or Europe that makes up multiple countries and it's not a single country, so the third choice is wrong. \nOption D : The Baltic states are actually three countries in Europe namely Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. The fourt choice is wrong.  Option E : Germany isn't a part European continent that's composed of multiple areas and countries, so that't last choice is also wrong. \nSo the final answer to this math question is \"Spain\" which means that the biggest part of Europe, other than Spain isn't a single area or a multiple countries.", "answer": "C: middle east"}

Here, the question is asking about how geese get from place to place without being directly carried by people. \n2.) Let's eliminate the answers that cannot be transported by themselves. \"Guard house\" (C) and \"Follow ultralight airplanes\" (E) are not modes of transportation. \n3.) Next, let's investigate \"Group together\" (B). \n4.) We can quickly rule out \"carried by people\" (A) because geese do not transport themselves by this method.\n5.) The answer is \"Group together\" (C). Geese do this in flocks rather than individually, so this is how they are normally transported from place to place.\nSo the final answers is B: group together\n\nInput: I'm going to buy all these clothes, but I'm not sure if they fit and if I'll like them, so I'm going to ______ a dress. Choices:  A : return to the store B : change clothes completely C : decide against it D : try a new type E : get rid of the dress\nOutput: 1) Understanding the full context can help us solve this question. The key is that the speaker is making a big purchase and wants to be able to return the item if they don't like it or it doesn't fit. Also, they are unsure of whether it will fit or how they will feel about it. \n2) Let's eliminate choices that don't make sense in the context of a large purchase. \"Change clothes completely\" (C) doesn't make sense because they are already wearing an entire set of clothes and will not have to change completely. \n3) Next, let's rule out \"return to the store\" (A) because if the dress doesn't fit or doesn't look good, they can't return it. They have to keep it.\n4) \"Try a new type\" (E) is also out because this is about returning the item and not trying it.\n5. The only remaining option, therefore, is to \"Get rid of the dress\" (E). The speaker doesn't want to continue wearing the dress, so they'll have to get rid of it if they don't want to wear", "answer": "C: fly"}
{"text": "1)First we have to figure out what the question is asking and identify the answer type. The question is asking: \"Was she resting...\" So, the thing she was resting \"the day of the event\" must be something she was doing while sick.

The answer must be \"resting\".\n2)Then, lets analyze the given choices: \"Resting\" (A) and \"sleep more\" (B) both answer the question. However, \"resting\" must be the correct answer because \"sleep more\" implies that the question was about sleeping in general, rather than just sleeping on one particular day.\n3)Choices \"bed sores\" (C) and \"comfort\" (E) cannot be the answer. The \"day of the event\" does not refer to any previous day or any other event, but the day of the event itself.\n4)Therefore, the question can be rephrased to \"Was she resti(ng)...? and the resulting answer is Resting.\nSo the final answers is A: resting", "answer": "D: missing out"}

Airlines might offer alcohol and fried meals on plane flights, but this might not be a convenient option for everyone.\n4) Choice C: beer. Most beers will not be either deep-fried or alcoholic, but they can be both at bars.\n5) Choice D: store.

{"text": "1) Let\u2019s begin by understanding how many apples are in the example. Using basic counting, we can see that the apples start with ten, and after three are lost from the tree, there are 7 left.\n2) It turns out that this is actually a mathematical problem with one solution. The original question asks, where is the apple tree? This means that there must be an apple tree, which means that we only have 10 of the original apples. And so, when 3 are taken away, we\u2019re left with 7 left. The question then, is \u201cHow many apples are left on the apple tree?\u201d.\n3) There is a catch to this problem, however, which is that we can only find a single solution to this. There isn\u2019t a second apple tree, like in the question. We only want to count the apples from one apple tree.  This isn\u2019t explained in the problem, but it is necessary when looking for a solution. \n4) Let\u2019s consider the different options to see if any of them fit. Choice A:  \u201cpark\u201d. The word \u201cpark\u201d in the question is never used, so we can eliminate choice A. As well, this answer doesn\u2019t make sense, as apples don\u2019t drop on their own in parks. \n5) Choice B:  \u201ccoloring book\u201d. The words \u201ccoloring book\u201d are never used, so we must also eliminate choice B. Similarly, this answer doesn\u2019 work, as apple trees don\u2019t contain coloring books. \n6) Choice C:  \u201cgarden center\u201d. The word \u201cgarden center\u201d can be seen throughout the question, and we get the impression that the numbers are relative to objects in the garden center. However, it\u2019s still inaccurate. An apple doesn\u2019t fall, nor does the entirety of the garden center. The number of 7 apples is still relative to the entire 10-apple tree, and not relative to the entirety of the store. \n7) Choice D:  \u201cmath problem\u201d.  The word \u201cmath problem\u201d can be seen in nearly every part of the question.  If we apply our findings to this answer, we can see that this works. Not only are the numbers relative to a tree, they also work for a math problem. For a math problem, the", "answer": "D: math problem"}

In this case, it's about the food chain. 2. From there, we look at the different places where this type of information might be found. \n3. Option (A), fish, would likely have information about fish and the food chain. Choices (B), (C) and (D) are all types of animals, and therefore, would not likely have information about the food chain.\n4.

Choices A and B don't make a whole lot of sense because we can't see through an eyepice and the eyepiece is used within a telescope or pair of binoculars. Choice C is a type of telescope. It's not the answer because the question isn't asking about the telescope itself, but the act of looking through it. Choices D and E are both types of microscopes. We know the correct answer doesn't involve a microphone so we can eliminate these choices. \n2) We're left with two choices: optical telescope (A) and binoculars (E). The latter is not the answer because this phrase implies multiple pairs of lenses while they are referring to a monocular device.

Choices:  the food chain  the biosphere  the world  humanity  the carbon cycle\nOutput: 1: This is a difficult question because it is more general. \"What do living things depend on?\" This question is less precise. We can start by looking at the two specific phrases \"Food Chain\" (B) and \"Biosphere\" (C). The Food Chain (B) is a cycle of the energy used and passed through organisms in a community. This phrase does not refer to life itself.\n2: Let's eliminate the rest of the choices: World (D), humanity (E), and carbondioxide (F). \"World\" (D) is not the answer because the word \"living,\" appearing in the question, implies something related to individuals versus the planet itself. \"Humanity\" and \"Carbon dioxide\" do not refer to an individual's lifespan. They, along with the previous term, would be considered part of a cycle which may or may not include living things.

That would just lead to hyperinflation, which is not an appropriate solution to \"fighting inflatons, unless the inflation rate was close to -100%. \n5) Choice E: BORING.

{"text": "1) Let's eliminate answer choices that are not directly related.\n2) First, let's start with \"Thought\" (E); this is not directly related to learning as it means thinking about something, which is not the same as learning.\n3) Next, let's examine \"Patience\" (C). While learning does require patience, this is not directly related, as you could be the best patient person in the world and still not learn in that state. \n4) Moving on to \"Study\" (D). This can definitely be considered learning, but this is a separate activity that is not required for learning to happen.\n5) Finally, we look at \"Cooperation\" (B). While you may need some cooperation to learn, such as asking help from a teacher or working with a group in a class, this answer is not sufficient to just learn by yourself.\n6) That leaves us with \"Exposure\" (A); learning often entails getting exposed to situations or information, whether by watching a video, reading a book, etc.\n7) Thus, the answer is \"A: Exposure.\"\nSo the final answer in (A): Exposure\n\nInput: Which of these two countries have the largest rivers by length?

{"text": "1) When breaking glass, if it has a thinner diameter than typical, then its characteristic would be to break more easily. If it has a thicker diameter, its characteristic would be to hold its shape better.\n2) When an object is heated to a high temperature, if it has a lower density than typical, then it will have the characteristic of melting. If it has a higher density, then it will have a characteristic of not melting.\n3) Objects of lower density are generally lighter than objects of higher density. If a glass is thin compared to its thickness, this would make it lighter, which could give it the characteristic of bending.\n4) Lastly, the characteristic of holding water refers to the ability of an object to retain liquid. If an object is thick enough to hold water, then it will have that characteristic.\nHence the correct answer is D: bend\n\nInput: How do you recognize someone who is tall? Choices: 1.

{"text": "1.\"John loved competing because that allowed him to divide people into what he thought were clear categories,\" he said. \n2. This suggests that John thought the people he was competing with were clear-cut winners and losers. He had no interest in them performing better, since they were just fellow competitors. He did not mind if they might win, since they were all still competitors. He also did not see them as enemies, since he was simply competing rather than fighting over things. Therefore, John liked being about to divide the people he was competiting with into what categories? Choice E: enemies.\n3. The conclusion can be drawn that John himself enjoyed putting himself in a \"winner\" category but was unsure of the other competitors' ranks. By comparing his rank to others, he found himself in \"enemies\" category but preferred to keep himself in the good category of competitor.\nSo the final answers are D and E: losses and enemies", "answer": "A: winners and losers"}
{"text": "1) We have not yet started to buy presents, so at this point, we do not have money or relief. 2) We can safely eliminate E (exhiliration) because it is a feeling, not an action we could prevent someone from taking. 3) We can also eliminate happiness, because it is a state of being, not something we can prevent. 4) The answers left are stress, lack of money, and relief. 5) It is unlikely that the answer could be stress because of the question is talking about Christmases presents, not presents in general. Therefore, 6) the answer we are left with is B) lack of money. 7) To explain our reasoning, let's break down what the situation is asking. 8) It is asking us to identify what prevent people from buying christmas presents. 9) This situation is very specific and only refers to buying Christmas presents, not presents in genera 10) This means that the present we want to give them is probably something special, like a gift. 11) In this scenario, Christmas presents could possibly be more expensive than regular presents. 12) The answer must be something that prevents someone from buying such an expensive gift. 13) The answer can be anything, but it needs to relate to how expensive Christmas presents can be and also how expensive presents can generally be. 14) The answer we are left with in this situation is \"lack of money.\" 15) As we mentioned in step 9, we are talking about giving Christmas presents that are typically more expensive than regular presents, so of course we are going to be referring to money.\nSo the final solution is B: lack of money", "answer": "B: lack of money"}

{"text": "1) Let's examine each possible answer in turn:\n2) Choice A: Disorientation. This cannot be the case because the very idea of 'underwater' involves being submerged below the surface of the water. This wouldn't happen unless you were underneath the water. So therefore, disorientation wouldn't occur on its own.\n3) Choice B: Due to. This is also not the case because the question does not stipulate that if there is low visibility, disorientation would also occur.\n4) Choice C: Meeting new people. This also cannot be true because disorientation means you cannot see anything, so you cannot meet or see another person.\n5) Choice D: Getting somewhere. This cannot be an answer because getting somewhere cannot occur due to an absence (in this case, the absence of being able to see).\n6) Therefore, Choice E must be correct, which is relocation.\n7) Reason: Reconsider the idea of 'disorienting'. If everything below the surface is not seen due to low visibility, then it is impossible to relocate anywhere underwater.\n8) By extension, anything below the surface will be a potential danger, meaning relocation will be the only possibility as the answer.\nSo the final result is E: relocation", "answer": "A: disorientation"}
{"text": "1) We will start by eliminating the choice options that are not locations, such as \"Gas stations\" (B) and \"train stations\" (D). \n2) We then examine the other choices that are locations, and consider a number of criteria. \"London\" (C) is a city but does not have more phone booths than many other locations. Additionally we might be more likely to find phone booths at an airport, such as \"London\" (E) has many international travelers passing through it.\n3) However, we cannot eliminate \"London\" (c) since there may be a number of London locations that have more phone booth than other locales, and thus have the greatest number of these telephone booths. \n4) Therefore, the answer is \"London\" (D) and it is likely that \"London\" has more telephone booth locations than other cities. Since they also have other booths that can be placed inside locations such as theaters or offices, it is impossible to determine the number of telephone booths for each London locality and therefore they cannot have the most telephone booths overall.\nSo the final answers are C: london \n\nInput:Where would someone find water for cooking?

In case we don't know what a school is, lets consider an example of a school classroom and see if it contains water for cooking.\n4.) When we consider a classroom, we find chalkboards and maybe some desks. The chalkboards don't have water for cooking and the desks might contain some water but it would not be for cooking.\n5.) Option B: The question is about water for cooking and an example of that could be finding a water fountain at a school, which is how the question is presented.

{"text": "1.\"I'm surprised someone of your caliber hasn't already left\", would most likely be the way to address someone who would be leaving in the future.\n2. This option is clearly rude and the implication is that the \"caliber\" of the person who would be leaving has not yet shown that they are capable of leaving the situation. This is unlikely to make someone feel good.\n3. This option would likely only be used for a farewell if the person who was leaving was leaving on bad terms, otherwise just saying \"goodbye\" and \"thank you\" would be expected. It can also be used sarcastically but the context would make it clear that it was a sarcastic thank you.\n4. This option would likely not be used for any type of departure unless of course the person leaving was planning on attempting suicide. Which, I am sure we can all agree would not be pleasant or cause anyone to feel good.\n5. This option can be used as an address when saying goodbye but the word \"god\" in it makes it unlikely that a non-believer, or someone who doesn't care that much, would say it. \n6. If someone did say it though, they probably wouldn't be sarcastic about it. It would be more likely they would want to really thank their god. \n7. To summarize, the best fit for this question would be A: further cause\nSo the final answer would be A: further\n\nInput:You wouldn't want to be late coming out of the forest, what would you want to avoid most?

Let us examine each choice individually:\n3. Choice O: trees\n4. No, there are various items that people in a forest wouldn't want to have in their backpacks that they brought in with them, but trees are not one of them. Also, it wouldn't make sense as an answer choice because a person probably wouldn't need to \"avoid trees\" if they are already in the forest.\n5. Choice B: People\n6.

{"text": "1.\"What enables most people to travel?\" This means you are looking for the best method of transportation by way of the question.\n2. The first answer we eliminate is \"Helicopter\" (B). This is not how most people travel since the vast majority of us do not own a helicopter.\n3. The same goes for \"Own vehicle.\" Only select people can own vehicles such as cars, motorcycles, and planes.\n4. Therefore, \"Speak Words\" is a type of movement method that is accessible to most people which is why it is incorrect.\n5.\"Belief in God\" is also incorrect because the idea that there is a god(s) is a belief more than a physical action or entity, thus it's also not a movement method.\n6. The last option is \"Dance Together\" which is an idea of collaboration and coordination that allows for movement to be possible. This is the correct, most inclusive answer because it is a method that includes many different kinds of people and doesn't discriminate.\nSo the final 3 answers are A: dance together, B: own vehicle, and E: believe in god\n\nInput: How might you find a bird that is related to a bee?

The choices that don't involve shoes (A, C) make the most sense. However, Choice A is incorrect because tennis shoes are white, but it is not the custom to wear white shoes indoors.\n7. Choice C is a logical answer as well, but the white shoe is worn as a part of a closet, not in a closet.\n8. Thus, the most logical answer has to be D: left foot. \n9. There are a variety of footwear options, but the only ones that would be relevant for the question stem (if any) are shoes.\n10. One would wear white shoes on a white foot.\n11.

{"text": "1.\"What place of work might a hair pin?\" The phrase \"a hair pin\" refers to both an object and a verb, so understanding the context will help provide clues. \n2. To understand this concept, it would be best to eliminate all options that do not relate to work or are not a location where you might find something.\n3. \"Salon\" (B), hair salon, sounds like a location, but when we visualize a hair salon, it doesn't immediately relate to work. \n4. Eliminating option (B), we find that the other options deal with hair stylists, which are professional environments, so eliminating option (B), \"hair salon\" can be ignored.\n5. To understand why option (B), \"salon\", is not correct, consider if you were to walk into a barbershop, looking for a particular barber you are familiar with, and you saw a man with a scissors sitting at a hair salon chair. Your first thought is to call him over and inform him that he is in the wrong place of work... a hair salon.\n6. Additionally, the other remaining options sound too absurd (D, E). Thus, it is safe to eliminate them.\n7. \"School\" (C) would not be a good match, as a stylist is more related to work in a professional environment. \n8. While option (D), a pincushion, would contain a hairpin, a pin cushion is much more related to domestic activities, so eliminating this option, we are left with option (A), a hair salon. \n9. In a hair salon, someone might have their own, personal hairpin, but they would typically not buy a new hairpin for their own use unless it was particularly unique or expensive. However, there are multiple people that work in a hair salon and they may need hairpins for various purposes such as using them to hold clients' hair or securing a ponytail into the stylist's work area. For this reason, hair salons also contain pins.\n10. Therefore, the answer to our question is a hair salon.

He wanted to spend more exciting and interesting time at the museum. \n2. \"Tired feet\" (A) is a symptom that may occur during a long day of museum-going, but it is not the desired state. \n3. \"Gaining knowledge\" (B) is the very reason for visiting the museum, so it is not desirable to study more. 4. \"Back pain\" (C) is a potential adverse side-effect of visiting the museum.

{"text": "1) Begin by breaking down this question. 2) First, we'll look to eliminate obviously incorrect answers. \"Burned\" is incorrect because burning wood destroys its ability to have reflective qualities. \"Polished\" is incorrect because polishing wood destroys any reflectivity that would occur naturally due to its surface. \"Composted\" is incorrect because composting would break down any natural elements of wood that could otherwise have reflective qualities, so therefore compost would block the reflectiveness of wood rather than reveal it. That leaves us with the options \"Carved\", \"Nailed\" and \"Compound\". \n2) Carving wood gives it more depth, meaning if you carve something you will be able to see deeper into it, therefore making yourself and objects within the wood visible. \n3) Nailed wood can contain objects that have reflective properties, as the nails are metal and metal can reflect light. \n4) Compound wood is made of multiple woods, usually a plywood type of material. The multiple layers of wood, each with their own reflective characteristics, would allow someone to view different reflection points by peeking and looking through the cracks between the wood.\n5) Therefore the answer is a combination of carved and nail wood options. You'd be able to see your reflections in pieces of wood that you've carved or nailed wood.\nSo the final answers is 5) carve and nail\n\nInput:What kind of fruit has the most peel?

If a basketball court is inside a gym, chances are it is not outdoors.\n6. If a basketball court were outside, the most likely possibility is that it is in a gym built for outdoor use (typically a single court). However, basketball courts are also commonly found in city outdoor gyms and parks. \n7. Therefore, the answer might be either C or D.\n8. The likelihood of a basketball court being in an indoor gym (B) is lower than an outdoor gym (C) or a park (D). However, if there were two equally likely options and one of the options were certain to be a park, we should choose the certain option first.\n9.

However, \"drive a car very fast\" requires objects that would be a haunted car and lights, not a haunted mirror. There is only option B that isn't a state of being or a place nor a physical object and it only requires the car. So the final answer would be option B: Drive", "answer": "D: rare"}
{"text": "1) For the first part of the question, we want to determine what a crossword puzzle is. \n2) We eliminate answers that are not crossword puzzles, or do not relate to the first definition of a crossword puzzle (ex. A, B, E). \n3) Next, we can discard answers that are only about the puzzle itself (ex. A), or that are not activities we might do to pass time (ex. C). \n4) We can quickly note answers that are not true (ex. A). \n5) When we eliminate all the options that do not fit the description 'do crossword puzzles simply just to do something', then we need to go back and understand what the question is asking as a whole. Remember, the phrase'simply just' (in bold) is important. The answer is what someone who chooses to do a crossword puzzle will do'simply just to do something'. \n6) From this, we eliminate answer options that are not things people do to pass time (D, E). \n7) The only answer choice that remains is option D:'relax'.\n8) Thus, the answer is D: relax\nSo the final answer for today is D: relax", "answer": "B: pass time"}
{"text": "1.) Let's look at the individual answer choices to understand the possibilities. \n2.) We'll start with Option A: ruined. It isn't possible to ruin clean clothes, so that isn't the right answer. \n3.) Moving to Option B: clean clothes, this one checks out as being the right answer. It wouldn't make sense for a man to be cleaning his date's clothes if he wanted them to be \"sadness\" (C) or \"look better\" (E). He would also probably ruin his own clothes if he wanted them \"bad\", so that leaves no room for Option A: ruined to be the right answer. Therefore, the correct answer is B: clean clothes.\nSo the final is B: clean clothes\n\nInput:You can expect to see a lot of children on a boat, except with? Choices:  M: not with others\nOutput: The question says that on a boat, you won't see only children. It's important to notice that every other answer choice states that a specific group of people will not be with a specific other group of people on the boat. We have a group A being \"not with\", and a group B always being on the boat. There's a good chance that the answer of the opposite group is A.\nTherefore, the answer is M: Not with others.", "answer": "D: attractive appearance"}
{"text": "1) The question is asking what an adult man would do to get ready for his job. He can use many options to get himself prepared and ready, including dressing, showering, dressing himself or driving a train.\n2) The choices don't need to be exclusive of each other, so you can eliminate any answers that make contradictory statements. \"Dress herself\" cannot possibly be an answer because this would obviously be something a woman did, not a man. \n\"Drink beer\", though humorous and fun, is still logically incorrect. There is no reason to think a man would do this to prepare for work.\n\"Dress himself\" and \"drink beer\" are also logically incorrect. First, it makes more sense that a man would dress himself. Second, again, no reason to assume he would drink beer. It makes more sense to assume he would hydrate with water. \n\"Drive train\" doesn't make sense as a logical answer for getting prepared for work because there is zero reason to believe this is a plausible thing an adult man would do, work-related or not.\n3) What remains is \"Showers\" (B) because it makes the most logical sense to get ready for any job, and it doesn't make any contradictory statements. When you shower, you clean, moisturize, prepare, and refresh your body, and it makes you feel invigorated, ready to do anything on that day.\nSo the final answers is B: showers.\n\nInput: When should a group leave for work? Choices A: 6 AM B: 4 AM C: 7 AM D: midnight E: 9 AM\nOutput: 1: For the choice of \"4 AM\" (B), it is the worst possible way to work. Many people will never agree that they should work at 4 AM. \n2: It is better to not work too early because of its negative effects on the mood. \n3: A much better choice is \"6 AM\" (A). As you can see, there are more positive aspects that come with it.\n4: After considering the next choice \"7 AM\" (C), you can see that it is better than \"6 AM\" (5).\n5: Next is \"midnight\" (D). It is the worst time a person could start working.", "answer": "C: dress himself"}
{"text": "1) Let\u2019s examine each choice individually. \n2) Choice A: countrysides. While it is certainly possible Simon would take the cow to a countryside, we cannot definitively say where he is going. \n3) Choice B: city. Since Simon doesn\u2019t want any meat for the cow, we can eliminate the city as a choice, as that is where people sell meat. \n4) Choice C: dairy farm. While it is possible Simon is taking the cow to a dairy farm, we cannot definitively state where he is going to. \n5) Choice D: Butcher. Simon is not a butcher; he is buying a cow, not selling one. Therefore, we can\u2019t tell where he is doing with the cow. \n6) Choice E: Canada. Perhaps he is going to take the cow to a different country, but we do not know that to be the answer.\n7) So we are left with Choice B: city, where people sell meat is the answer. \nSo the final answer here is B: city", "answer": "C: dairy farm"}

The question is asking, \"what was the dog barking at?\".\n\n2.\"A building\" means that the dog could be barking at another building near it. However, this does not explain \"classroom\", \"friend's house\", and \"window\". Therefore, this is incorrect.\n3.\"A friend's house\" means that the dog might be barking at a person. However, this is also incorrect, as \"classroom\", \"window\", and \"front door\" are not places that typically have people in front of them to be barked at. \n4.\"A classroom\" means that the dog may be barking at students. However, this is incorrect, as a classroom may also have teachers in it. \n5.\"Front door\" means that the dog's barking is probably at the presence of a person. This is incorrect as the dog could also be barking at people through the window or even the classroom. \n6.\"A window\" means that the dog isn't barking at a presence, but rather at an object. \"The dog barked at the window\" does not make sense. \n\n7.\"The dog ran to front window and bark at something is because of the presence at the front door or front window...\", then, no one's at...\n\nThis means that the most likely option to take out is front door.\n\n7.\"The most likely option to take as is the presence at the front...

Same goes for \"filing cabinet\" (C), which is a place to keep filing papers more than a place to keep files. \n5. All of this leaves us with \"Suitcase\" (A) and \"Computer\" (B). Neither answer is a place, and the only place that makes the most sense to put a file on a computer is the computer itself.

Now, let's look at each answer choice individually. A: art room. This answer does not answer the question as there can be multiple glue bottles in an art room, not just \"a lot\".\n3. B: police station. This answer is also not correct, as the policemen would not use so many glue bottles in one place. \n4. C: classroom. The classroom setting is also not correct, because not every school has glue bottles. \n5. Therefore, we are left with D: desk drawers and E: School. The desk drawer is probably the most likely area to contain glue bottles. Schools do contain a lot of glue in the form of glue bottles and other materials, so \"school\" is not an invalid answer. \n6.

So firstly we need to know what we can place paper notices on and what is likely to be searched for.\n2.'Front Door' (A) indicates that it is a way to place a paper notice, but it is not necessarily what you are looking for during the search. \n3.'Conference' (C) is a likely place to look for a paper notice, but placing a paper notice at a conference is not a way to place one. \n4.'Classroom' (D) is a place to put a paper notice, and it is also a place for people to search for notices. \n5.'Refrigerator' (E) is a great place for people to place a paper notice like a noticeboard, but in fact it is not a place people would usually search.\n6.The final option 'Suitcase' (E) is the best choice because it is a way to put a paper notice on a house, and it is also very likely for someone to look for a paper on their suitcase.\nSo the final answers is E: Suitcase.\n\nInput:If one is given a new position with responsibilities and does not have prior experiences relevant to the position that one has been given, what can one claim? Choices: 1. To refuse their position because there are already enough people in the company that know the job. 2. To leave their current position because it is not fulfilling. 3. To know what they are doing since they are willing to learn it. 4. To make them look bad. 5. To admit they are unfit for their new work. 6. To say that they are willing to learn the position. 7. To accept the new position and ask for more pay. 8. To refuse the new position.\nOutput: 1'To refuse the position because there are already a lot of people in the company who know the job' (A) seems to be the opposite of what I am talking about because to turn down a position of responsibility is obviously a bad idea if you have prior experience related to that position that gives you a chance to know what you are doing.", "answer": "A: front door"}
{"text": "1). The key here is \"obsessive\" because it's more likely that an obsessive person would be compelled to wash hands excessively instead of using soap, causing irritation afterward, therefore the answer choice of A, B, and C are out.\n2).

{"text": "1. Begin by understanding exactly what the question is looking for. \"Where is known to always contain snow?\" The key here is always.\" Always\" indicates that the place in question never has \"no\" snow.\n2. Let us make sure that we eliminate any possible incorrect choices. \"Africa\" (B) is considered a continent, not a place where snow may be common. \"North Pole\" (C) is the location of the Earth's poles and is not necessarily a place of occurrence for snow. \"Canada\" (D) is a geographic region that is known for being cold but it is not necessarily synonymous with snow. \"Surface of earth.\" (E) is not necessarily a unique location where snow may occur, as it can happen on other planets as well.\n3. That leaves us with our best guess, \"roof,\" though this is no necessarily a correct choice.\n4. Therefore, the answer could be \"A: Roof.\"\nSo the final answer could be A: Roof\n\nInput: In which month does the most shamrocks grow? Choices: 1. a: february b: march c: december d: january e: none\n2. 2.a: february. Shamrocks are typically planted in or around march so it makes sense to have more of them in february since they were just planted.\n3. 3.b: march. Shamrocks typically wither or die in march so it makes sense that in order to plant new ones you would need to dig back up some to replace them\n4. 4.c: december. Shamrocks only have a 30% survival rate so it makes sense that there would be more left to harvest in december if they weren't removed any earlier\n5. 5.d: january. Shamrock seeds have a 34-day cycle from planting to full bloom so it makes sense to plant them the end of jannuary and the beginning of february\n6. 6.e: there is no single month where the highest percentage of shamrocks grow\nSo the final answer would be B: march\n\nInput: What are the two most important skills to have if you were stranded on an island?

{"text": "1) Begin by understanding the question, which is \"What is a place that contains hundreds of sporting goods stores?\" This tells us that we want a place, which could be any number of things. \n2) Let's eliminate anything that can't have hundreds of stores, which includes \"buy athletic equipment\" and \"jerseys.\" \"Jerseys\" is not a place but a specific type of athletic gear, and \"buy athletic\" equipment is not a place, it's an activity.\n3) Moving forward, \"City\" (C) can potentially have hundreds of sporting good stores as it contains a large area with many people. However, a city cannot be a sporting goods store and is too large of an area to house any specific store. \n4) \"Espn\" (D) is a sports network which could potentially contain multiple sporting good stores, but is not a location which we would go to to purchase athletic gear.\n5) \"Town\" (E) could have hundreds of sports goods stores as it is a small area with many people, but this isn't a sufficient answer due to the limitations on the question's original definition of \"place.\"\n6) We are left with \"Office,\" which is a place related to business that could potentially have hundreds of sport goods stores. This is the only correct answer.\nSo the final answers are A:Office <-> B:town <-> C:Espn <-> D:city and E:Jerseys\n\nInput: Where can you find a place that is good to think? Choices:  Option: A: empty office B: bakery C: bar D: empty space E: museum F: couch\nOutput: 1: Begin by understanding what we are searching for. When we say \"the best place to think is\", we are trying to avoid busy places like cities, which would not be conducive to thought. 2: Let's eliminate anything involving food. \"Bakery\" (C) is a food store, \"Bar\" (D) is an establishment that sells alcohol, and \"Food\" (E) is just an unnecessary word in the answers. \n3: Moving on, let's take a look at the remaining choices to see which best fits the criteria. \"Empty office\" (A) would be quiet", "answer": "B: city"}
{"text": "1.\"Where would you put a lit?\" implies two potential environments. The light and the environment where the light will be put. Let's look at each environment. Ocean: This wouldn't be a place you would put a light because you wouldn't expect to see a light in water. Desk: This likely isn't the environment you would put a light in. Unless you are illuminating the desk itself, this isn't a place that you would put a light. Universe: This may be a place that you would see a light in the future because it's outside of your control, but it's not a place that's necessarily associated with a light at the moment (e.g. night sky). Attic: A light may be up in an attic or it may be hidden in the attic. This is not necessarily a place to put a light. Chair: This may or may not be the place to put the light. It depends on how you are going to use the light, whether you need to be able to move around the light, etc. So, the only remaining choice is \"E: chair.\" Here, the chair is simply a place and not a concept. It doesn't matter how you place a light or what you plan on using it for, the chair is the only place listed that doesn't have another option.\nSo the final outcome is E: chair\n\nInput: What do you use a shoe box for? Choices:  a. shoes b. storage space c. decoration item d. hiding place\nOutput: 1\"How do you use a shirt box?\" implies it's being used at the moment.\n2. In this case, using a shirt box is using it for storage, and not its intended purpose. Other than that, the options don't list the use of the shirt box itself so they are not suitable answers.\n3. As a result, the correct answer is b. storage space.\nSo the answer is b. Storage Space\n\nInput: For what is a can a proper substitute?

{"text": "1: This question is phrased: \"If I have to keep the track of oxygen in the air, where am I?\" This could refer to any number of possibilities like a plane, a helicopter, or a person's lungs. Because the question asks specifically about \"oxygen\" as air, and not the amount of air, the answer (A) will pertain to the atmosphere.\n2: The options given are the ground, water, earth, and space shuttle. The ground or earth (C) have water in them. Water doesn't contain oxygen, so we can immediately cross that off. The space station or shuttle (E) are in open space where there is no solid surface and therefore no solid or liquid air to analyze.

{"text": "1.The question: \u201cif you are fiddling\u201d is asking about a situation in which a musician is not making the desired sound.\n2. There are a few phrases in this question that are important to understand. The phrase \u201cthrough a music\u201d indicates that multiple possibilities exists here, and \u201cwhen\u201d indicates that an action is taking place.\n3. Let\u2019s explore the possibilities further:\n4. A music book is the source of music that the musician should be playing from. It shows where on a page the music starts, what notes to play, and what kind of tempo to play at. So, having a music book is necessary to playing. \n5. Therefore, if the musician is fiddling through their music book instead of playing it, it probably means that they have something else going on, which is indicated by \u201chave.\u201d\n6. The only time we would fiddle through a music book would be when we did not have dexterity, idle time, knowledge of music, or conductor.\n7. This eliminates the answer choices that refer to a lack of those things instead: \u201cfiddling\u201d could not indicate \u201cpractice,\u201d \u201cdexterity,\u201d \u201cidle time,\u201d or even \u201cconductor,\u201d because we can only fiddle through our music book when those things are the missing ingredients.\n8. Instead, when we fidget and fiddle through our music book instead of playing, it means that we have something else going on for a reason. Something must be missing from those four choices.\n9. So, the phrase \u201cdont have\u201d in this question is asking which of those four things we do not have.\n10. The answer to the question is \u201cidle time\u201d if we are fiddling instead of playing, because we can only fiddle when we do not have idle time to play.\n11. Therefore, the answer to this question is A: idle time.\nSo the final  is A: idle time\n\nInput: When an adult is teaching a lesson to children, what is the opposite of teaching? Choices: 1.

She was probably new and didn\u2019t understand how to behave around him and so didn\u2019t know how to connect with him during the conversation.\n8) Answer choice C: Unknown (Wrong)\nIf we were to choose this answer, Mary would be mistakenly identified as not being present in the company (James' company). Choosing this as the right answer would mean that Mary was absent without a good reason.\n9) Answer choice D: Unacquainted (Wrong)\nThis would mean that Mary was already present but had yet to make a good impression on James. It would mean that Mary is not well-liked or trusted by the management of the company.\n10) Answer choice E: Shy (Wrong)\nIt is best to look at the sentence again and pay close attention to the structure of the sentence. We can see that Mary isn't'shy' with James. She is not reserved or distant with James, but is instead unfamiliar with him. In a situation where you have a new friend, you may be shy at first if you are new to forming relationships with others, but that is not the case with Mary and James. They already formed some kind of relationship since it says \"So she wasn\u2019t comfortable.\" This means that she has no trust in the relationship and is only comfortable speaking with him because someone else introduced them.\n11) Now that we have a good understanding of Question", "answer": "A: cold"}

It can be singular or plural and usually refers to humans. It is used to describe \"a member of the species Homo sapiens\" and \"a person\" in the dictionary. \n4. The word happy is an adjective. It is used to \"express or describe pleasure, contentment, or joy.\" In the dictionary, people use happy instead of \"a sense of being joyful, optimistic, or cheerful\". \n5.

How do you say the ear in German? \"Ear\" (B) is also the correct term.\n4) Finally, let's look at Spanish (D). How do you say \"ears\" in Spanish? \"Orejas\" (B) is again correct.\n5) Let's compare English (A), French (B), German (C) and Spanish (D) for whether or not they have any terms for \"ear\". 6) No - all languages include the term for \"ears\", thus the proper term for \"ear\" is included in all these languages, meaning that none of them have incorrect terms for \"ear\".\n7) The other (E) is not included, but this means that other types of languages exist. \n8) There is no indication given in the question or in any of the choices about other languages not having their proper", "answer": "C: chinese food"}

Instead, \"do enjoy\" is the thing that follows \"they would have fun doing\", contradicting the claim that \"they would be able to do what tonight.\" \n3 Choice (C) is redundant because it is literally another way of saying the word \"enjoyable\". In this case, (B) is the correct answer. \n4 The answer can only be a noun.\n5 We don't know about where they'd be going or the details, so we can't know what they would do there.\n6 The answer does not describe any noun so we can eliminate (D)\n7 The last choice is the answer because the frat boys could \"get\" anything, as in get laid.\nSo the final answers are B: get laid", "answer": "B: get laid"}

The possibilities are many, but let's look at each option to further narrow the options down.\n2- It can be tempting when considering what a lover might want to do with their partners to go with option A: build a family. But this is not the answer because building a family does not necessarily include intimacy between two people who are already married.\n3- Falling in love is a possibility, but this isn't the answer because once a lover falls in love, their love for their partner no longer depends on them having intimate relations.\n4- They could also make love to their partner. This is another possibility, but also not the answer because a lover doesn't need to make love to their partner in order to feel loved by them.\n5- An option that may come to mind is completing. Although completing can be a positive activity, this answer is not the answer because completing does not require love between two people.\n6- Therefore, an option left is option D: E: Distance Themselves\n7- With this answer, it would mean that intimacy is something that is required by a lover to feel connected to their partner.\n8- Since a lover is likely wanting to complete their relationship with their partner, this is the correct answer.\n9- So we have the correct answer as D: E: Distances Themselves\n\nInput:If I'm on my way to buy a sweater, and there is a shop named after a fruit, what might it have inside?

For example, we know that stores named after food probably sell food, like \"Melon\" (B) or \"Chocolate\" (C). Since stores named after fruits aren't likely to sell other fruit, that choice is eliminated.\n3.

Option A: Becoming depressed in the sense of experiencing negative emotions, which can be the result of looking for new things in one's life, is not the right answer.\n4. Option B: Welcome change is not the right answer because being in favor of change in itself is not what one does after looking for new things in their life.\n5. Option C: Experiences is also not the right answer because this involves looking for new experiences, such as going on trips, which is not the task at hand in the previous sentence.\n6. Option D: Paying bills is not the right answer either because looking for new things typically involves seeking out something better, not something more ordinary. \n7. That leaves us with option E: Thank god. In its most literal definition, this means that someone will have gratitude for what they find, but more metaphorically or idiomatically, it means something is impossible to do and the person isn't going to try again.

{"text": "1) Let's examine each option and see which matches the phrase \"long day of traveling\" best. \n2) The first option here is \"sickness\", but it isn't a day of traveling.\n3) The second option is \"motion sickness\" and this can occur after a long day of driving, but not necessarily after a long day of flying.\n4) The next option is \"relocation\", but it would presumably need a day of packing and unpacking, which isn't exactly \"after a long day of travel\". \n5) The fourth option, \"jet lag\", is a phenomenon that usually takes many days to \"kick in\" after travel. It typically isn't something that would happen immediately after travel. \n6) Lastly, the fifth option is an option called \"fatigue\". This fits the bill, as it is often the result of traveling long distances for an extended period of time and it feels common to reach the exhaustion state after a long day of flight or drive. As a result, \"fatigue\" is our favorite option because it is more directly related to a long day of travel.\nSo the final (only) answer is A: fatigue\n\nInput: What is usually found at places of interest that doesn't have to do with tourism?

Boredom: People don't go to places of historic importance to experience boredom \u2013 they go to places of historical significance to learn and explore, which does not involve boredom, as boredom requires the absence of anything going on. Furthermore, boredom is often considered boring. \n2. Traffic: While places of interest may have higher foot traffic, especially during peak seasons, places of interest are not often known for their traffic.\n3. Parking: The answer cannot be parking because people don't park at places of interest to simply park. They park because they have a destination elsewhere and park in the location of their interest in order for them to reach that destination with the destination on their mind instead of on where they are parked. \n4. Noise: Noise in and of itself does not need to be associated with places of interest. Noise is loud sounds", "answer": "E: fatigue"}

For example, an apartment building will sometimes keep furniture (couches, tables, etc.) in the upstairs attic. \n2) Another answer is a floor, which is where furniture would likely live and be placed on. Often times, a basement will store furniture in the floor.\n3) The answer could be an apartment, which is where furnishings are generally found. Therefore, a furnished apartment could be assumed to have items on the floor or on a roof.\n4) A house is where living happens, thus the furniture used and stored inside would be found on the floor.\n5) The next choice is neighbor's house. Neighbors typically store items in their garages, which could contain furniture.\n6) Furniture could also be stored outside, which answers the question as to what would you put furniture outside. \n7) Therefore, the answer is roof.\n\nInput: Who would be on a first name basis with a student and faculty member of the same class?

The policemen directed traffic so that vehicles did not enter the accident scene.\n4) Choice C: Helping. This is not the case because no specific type of assistance is mentioned in the question.\n5) Choice D: Force open door. This is not the action taken because the door was already opened. \n6) Lastly, we consider Choice E: Corner thief. This is not the option because policemen were on duty when the accident occurred, and a thief would be engaged in a criminal act (stealing), which they weren't.\n\nSo the final answer for question 55 is B: Direct traffic\n\nInput: What is the best way to get some relief from a hangover?

{"text": "1) Let's begin by looking at each answer choice carefully. Starting with \"Arena\": This is ruled out because public performers would not usually be on a private arena that is often locked up between shows. \n2) \"On a building\"(B): This isn't the right answer because the performers may be inside buildings throughout the day, but not actually in a public setting where they could be seen.\n3) \"A dock\"(C): This definitely has more potential than the other options, as many outdoor venues are located on docks where people can visit to see the shows. However, the definition of \"public\" excludes some docks and theaters, which could still limit the show's range of visibility.\n4) \"Concert hall\" (D): This answer choice is better because it refers to a more specific type of venue that has shows open to the public. However, some concert halls are not located in public locations and instead reside in buildings or even indoors. \n5) \"Museum\" (E): This is a reasonable answer choice because many museums do host public performances and events. However, a lot of modern museums are built for educational purposes and might not be in a central location that would make it easy for people to see the shows while they are in public.\n6) In summary, the best option for public performers is \"D: Concert hall\". \nSo the final answer to question is D: Concert hall\n\nInput: The term that has been used to describe a certain situation has been \"in transition\".

If the acquaintance of George Washington, as there is no reason to imprison Washington.\n5. If the acquaintance was imprisoned with Marquis De Lafeyte's prison, then the acquaintance must also be imprisoned with Marquis, which is not true, so the answer cannot be Marquis.\n6. If the acquaintance's imprisonment was in Iran, then Marquis must have been imprisoned in Iran. As Iran did not release him, the answer cannot be Marquise.\n3. If you look at the sentence: \"When you are imprisoned with your friend, what is the important thing?\" This implies that Marquis was imprisoned by the friend or with the permission of the friend.

Here's the process:\n2) Eliminate options that don't contain bills or bread. \n3) Eliminate the ones that don't fit the pattern (because everything has a pattern).\n\nExample: The logical pattern for bills and bread is \"congress\", or if the bread is in an envelope (like a cheese sandwich), \"congress\" or \"restaurant\".\n4) Find the option that fits the pattern.\n5) That's it! That's how you solve this question. If you understand this process, all the answers are simple. Let's get to the first question.\n6) Option A (restaurant): No, we don't need to look any further at this answer. A restaurant doesn't have anything to do with bills and bread.\n7) Option B (congress): Congress is a logical option because we know everything there has a pattern.\n8) Option C (envelope): What a fun little twist! No envelope would necessarily contain a bill - you're looking for something more specific. But the answer could be \"congress\" if the bills are in a cheese sandwich envelope. However, this is an uncommon situation, so you can safely eliminate this answer.\n9) Option D (mailbox): Mailboxes have many envelopes full of bills, so you should eliminate this answer. But let's imagine you're in a town with a unique mailbox system or a place with a lot of mail boxes. If the mail box is located in Congress, then we know the answer is \"congressional mailbox.\"\n10) Option E (cheese store): Nope, this is a place where you buy food, not where you find bills. Let's hope you never find a bill in a cheese store, because it would be a little gross!\n11) So, the final answer is Congress.\n\nInput[1]: Where might I find a person who is being paid to work?

{"text": "1 Let's define each term, starting with the \"bridge\". A bridge crosses a body of water (\"red bridge\" is a metaphor for crossing water, and a red bridge would cross a red body of water).\n2. Therefore, the key to understanding the question is that the answer must be a metaphor for a river-cross (crossing a river). Here are the possibilities: \"refrigerator\" (A), \"engineering school\" (B), \"san francisco\" (C), \"tree\" (D) and the flip of a coin (E) all occur in places, and none provide the \"metaphor for a river\" which can be found only in a metaphor for river-crossing (e.g. eating a banana on a bridge would be eating a banana). \n3. Now let's examine the definitions of each answer:\n4. \"refrigerator\": a home or workplace appliance that houses food items.\n5. \"engineering school\": an academic school where students learn the process of creating physical objects by the use of engineering.\n6. \"san francisco\": a major city on the west coast of the United States, popularly known for its natural beauty and a major hub for tech companies.\n7. \"tree\": a plant with a woody trunk and branches. These can be found growing in the outdoors.\n8. \"market\": a store where many individuals and companies sell their goods.\n9. After disregarding the answers that are not a \"crossing\", we are left with A (refrigerator), B (engineering school), and D (tree) all \"crossings\" which, although may be relevant to \"eating fruit\", are still not directly related to our definition of the \"bridge\" as a river crossing.\n10. This leaves us with the correct answer, C: \"San Francisco\". This answer satisfies the \"metaphor cross\" metaphor.\nSo the final answers are C: San francisco.\n\nInput: If you've ever been to a baseball game and cheered as the batter was stepping into the batter's box, you were likely also cheering because: Choices: A: they were stepping in the batter's box B: they were wearing pajamas C: they were looking around", "answer": "C: san francisco"}
{"text": "1.\"What makes people happy when is surprising and unexpected?\" means the answer doesn't have to be one specific thing, but could be a combination of things.\n2. \"Surprising and unexpected\" are the key phrases here. They are describing conditions under which a person is happy. \n3. To look for this, we look at the question answer choice options: (A) Joke: Yes, this can be surprising and unexpected, but I wouldn't say it necessarily makes people happier. It's an option but not necessarily the best one.\n(B) Humor: Again, yes, humor could be surprising and unexpected, and it can make people happy.\n(C) Fight: This is a surprising and unexpected way to make people happy, but it's not normally associated with happiness. \n(D) Laughter: This is a classic example of a surprise and unexpected.\n(E) frightened: Someone being frightened is a surprising and unexpected, but it's also unlikely to make someone happy. \n4. Comparing all the answers, we'll choose the one that covers the most bases: \"Joy (D)\" is an element of \"Surprising and Unexpected.\" This doesn't directly make people happy, but makes them happier. It'll include \"Happy (A)\" and \"Happy (C).\"\n5. The final answer is D: Laughter.\nSo the final answers is D: laughter\n\nInput: Which of the following is an apple? Choices: 1. A: Apple. (X) 2.

With only this information, we are unable to determine which is the correct answer.\n5) That leaves us with investigating the options individually\n6) Given that we are not aware of when or where his grooming occurs, we know that he can't work while grooming, so B is out of the picture since it can't happen while he is working. Therefore, we are left with just A and C.\n7) Choice C could potentially lead to a vacation, but we don't have more information about where this grooming occurs nor the specific times it takes place. Therefore, we can dismiss this option.\n8) That leaves us with A.

{"text": "1) We must eliminate all the choices that are physically impossible. This answers our question, \"dancing for a long time\". We know that there are some physical barriers here (you won't get tired dancing for a long time) so let's cross them out. Let's also be mindful of the context of the statement. Does \"dancing for a\" seem to suggest a single activity? If yes, cross out \"B: intercourse\" and \"D: become tired\". Otherwise, you might be misinterpreting the question to mean \"how long will you dance before you...\". This is a common pitfall to avoid.\n2) We begin by eliminating the least likely answers. If we consider the statement \"dancing for a\", then there are two options: we are talking about a single event that lasts a long time OR this is the \"process\" or \"activity\" of dancing that lasts for a long time. If it's the latter, then we know we're asking about the outcome, which is usually the final answer. We eliminate A (sore) and E (expression) because you don't become what you do - you become what you become.\n3) Next, we can eliminate the remaining option by considering both the context and the meaning of the individual words. \"Fatigue\" can be used to suggest that we're getting tired (a word we already ruled out) OR that something is getting tired. If we're talking about the process of dancing, then we must interpret this choice as the activity of being bored (something that is getting tired), and eliminate it.\n4) Now we are left with only two options. We're almost there! However, we must consider that we're likely talking about the outcome of dancing and what would happen to us, not to \"dancing itself\". Thus, we are likely talking about what would happen to us after we've danced a long time as opposed to before we've done so. From here, eliminate B (sore) because it's what you become after dancing, not before. Therefore, the answer option is D (become tired).\nSo the final answer that you will be after dancing for a long period of time is B: become tired\n\nInput: Which of these cannot happen between the time of 1:00 A.M. and 2:0", "answer": "D: become tired"}
{"text": "1.\"Mundane routine\" means a repetitive lifestyle that is dull or boring.\n2. Let us begin by eliminating the choices which we know do not correspond to what the question is asking for. \n3. \"Sophisticated\" (B) describes a person or event that is classy or refined. This does not describe the removal of a mundane lifestyle. \n4. \"Arcane\" (C) describes a secret or obscure word or phrase that is difficult to understand. Although this can be used to describe a lifestyle, it does not directly say that it is mundane, which this question is asking for.\n5. \"New\" (E) is a word that describes something that is newer than something else. Again, though this can be used to indicate a shift towards something newer, it does not indicate a mundane l\nifestyle. \n6. Our remaining options are \"Heavenly\" (D) and office.

{"text": "1 David hurt all over. This indicates that he may be fatigued and in pain from excessive physical labor and/or stress, which can occur due to excessive eating or drinking. 2. David hurt all over? (Choice E) seems unlikely because he has not eaten in a long time, and over eating would likely lead to tiredness, rather than pain. \n3. David has been hurting for a long time. This indicates that 3 or more days of physical and/or mental strain have left him in pain and fatigued. This suggests that a person might need a break or time to heal. 4. David was shaking. This suggests that he is very tired, but possibly could also mean that his muscles have been extremely strained or that he is suffering from some sort of mental anxiety or disease. 5. David was in pain. He has been in pain for some time. This implies that both his physical and mental states are suffering from high stress/pain. 6. He hadn't got what he needed. (Choice B) is a potential possibility given that David hasn't eaten in a long period of time and his body needs food. A person can eat too much, but if David has been abstaining from food, eating could likely fix his hunger and pain.

Note that \"on\" here refers to topics. You took courses for topics, not for \"on\".\n3) She didn't appreciate. This implies that she did appreciate many topics. That is why she took classes for it, and it indicates that she didn't appreciate music or singing since she didn't take classes for those topics either.

In this case, however, our movie is not Indian and does not have the word \"Bollywood\" in the title. \n3 - Record (C) means that something was recorded. An album is a collection of songs, which is a different thing than a genre of music. \"Record\" definitely refers to music, but it is not the \"song and dance\", which is the real genre of the movie.\n4 - Jukebox (D) is referring to a music device from earlier in time that was popular during the 1980s. This \"jukebox\" was not the sort of'musical genre' that is our answer. \n5 - Musical (E) is referring to a musical genre or musical type of movie, which is why \"musical\" was used in the question. However, this answer is incorrect because no mention was made of a musical type of movie, nor was a musical movie the main point of discussion.\n6 - Napster (E) was a peer-to-peer file sharing service that allowed for the sharing (but not the creation) of music. Therefore, we know that this answer is not referring to the genre of the movies.\n7 - Our final answer choice is one of the few that has none of the other options that are incorrect.

Option A: \"Open doers\" - although some cats may open doors, it is certainly not the most common occurrence or something shared among a lot of cats.\n4. Option B: \"Drink water\" - cats drink water all the time, but this is obviously not specific to a particular day of the week or anything like that. \n5. Option C: \"Need food\" - this one is important. It is easy to imagine cats who go hungry occasionally. However, these are often individual cats with issues - perhaps they weren't fed or didn't have enough food or whatever else. But if we look at cats broadly, they do not \"need food\".

Option D: \"Annoy\" - there are many instances of annoying cats, often they make loud noises and may even scratch things, but if we consider all cats, it is not a normal occurrence for them to annoy anyone. It's possible but not something that cats can't go a day without doing.\n7. Option E: \"Play\" - this is a possibility and is why cats are the funniest animals on earth sometimes!

If she used the word ugly, it would've been in the answer choices.\n3. \"Satellite\" doesn't fit either. As a satellite doesn't live on the Earth and a monster is a mythological creature that is imagined to be alive on Earth, it wouldn't make sense for the \"beauty\" to love a satellite, as it doesn't seem she can love things that don't exist. 4. That leaves us to use the word \"top of mountain\". That doesn't make sense either because if the monster is on top of a mountain, it wouldn't be lovable to the beauty.\n5.

The correct answer is \"congratulations\" because, regardless of a person's background, they should all be congratulated when applying for a job. This means that \"equal opportunity\" is a false choice. 2) Choice \"critical thinking\" is also incorrect because this is not a part of applying for a job. The correct answer is still \"congratulations\".\n3) Choice \"raffle tickets\" is incorrect because raffles are used to give rewards to people based on luck, not merit. 4) Choice \"compliments\" is incorrect because compliments are typically given to people to bring about a positive feeling, rather than as part of applying for a specific job.\n5) Choice \"comgratulations\" is incorrect because \"comgratulating\" is not a legitimate word. 6) Choice \"D\" is also incorrect because it's hard to congratulate people with raffle tickets. 7) Lastly, Choice \"false choice\" is the correct answer because it is the only choice that answers the question directly and not just one of the potential backgrounds.\nSo the final and correct answer is D: False choice.\n\nInput:When you are on a team of people, what is your role not to do?

{"text": "1.\"Injury\" (B) is not a possible answer choice, as injuries do not always happen during a specific appointment. This leaves us with options \"late,\" which means an appointment is put back on schedule due to another appointment taking longer than expected, \"bothered\" (E), meaning the next appointment is annoyed at not being able to proceed, and \"mistakes\" (D), meaning both things happened to your appointment.\n2. Let us focus on the other answer choices:\n3. \"late\" simply means that an appointment was put back on schedule due the original appointment taking longer than expected. Since this is true for the next appointment as well, the answer choice is insufficient.\n4.\"Bothered\" means that the next appointment is annoying that they couldn't get their appointment on time. The problem is also that the groom may get annoyed by this as well, and the grooming may already be an annoyance to the groom, so the answer choice is insuficient.\n5.\"Mistakes\" means two things have happened on the appointment. An error has occurred on the original appointment and the groom is late, which is very likely.

When someone is asked if sitting on the top of an elevator would make them less nervous, the question is asking which would be better in this situation.\n3. You need to understand the answers and the possible situations where you would answer each one. Let's try each one.\n4. Answer \"yes\" would be if you thought that sitting on the top would make you less nervous. Therefore, option A does not fit, so it is eliminated.\n5. Similarly, option B cannot be the answer because it would be if the elevator were taking you to another story, and option C cannot be the answer because that does not make you less nervous at all.\n6.

Therefore, to answer this riddle, consider what you would use at a period's end.\n2. To look at the options closely, Option A: Punctuation mark could also be called \"mark,\" which is not the phrase \"mark end.\" Therefore, \"End\" can't be the answer to the question.\n3. An Exclamation mark can also be called an \"Ex\" or a \"Mark of Emphasis.\" These are not the same as an \"End.\" Therefore, \"Ex\" can't be your answer.\n4. An \"I\" (Integrelation) Mark can also be called a \"full stop,' which isn't the same as an \"end.\" Therefore, \"i\" can't be a suitable answer.\n5. Lastly, we can rule out Answer E: \"Qu", "answer": "D: conjunction"}

A medicine cabinet would only likely contain medicine, and not birth control pills. \n3) Choice B: chemist'shop. The main issue here is that a chemist's shop isn't typically the place where birth control pills are stored. It would be more likely to find a pharmacy or drug store.\n4) Choice C: kitchen. This is a good choice that can hold onto your toothpaste and birth control pills. However, a kitchen isn't typically a place where birth control pilli.\n5) Choice D: drugstore. This is an ideal choice because a drug store is where birth control pills would be stored and can hold onto your toothy paste!\n6) Choice E: bedroom.

{"text": "1. \"Where should you find a schoool in?\" This question is asking about where a school is located.\n2. We can eliminate \"residential neighborhood\", because a school is not typically found in a residential neighborhood.\n3. Also eliminate \"mosque\" because a mosque is not necessarily a place where you'd find a school.\n4. \"Every city\" should also be eliminated, since \"every city\" doesn't specify what kind of schools it is referring to. If it meant all academic institutions in the city, then we could rule some of the options out as well. \n5. Similarly, \"Prague\" and \"Community\" should be eliminated, because we do not know what kind of schools those cities represent. \n6. That leaves us with three options: \"Every city\" (D), \"Prague\" (E), and \"Every city\" (C).\n7. \"Prague\" is the correct answer because that is the city where the school is located, whereas \"Every city\" and \"Every city\" are both incorrect because they imply \"where would you find a school in any city\" instead of where a certain school is found, as specified by the question.\n8.

Since it is primarily a place for drinking and hanging out with friends, the bar cannot provide items to buy. \n6.) Choice E: Shopping center.

Doors and railings are exterior components, so they don't appear in the roof's interiors, which house the building's structure. \"Water\" (G) is an unrelated answer choice because it pertains to the ground, which is under a roof, and not on top like the answer.\n2: The only answer choices above which are plausible are \"A window\" (B) and \"a head\" (H). A window is made up of glass, metal, and wood, so it is not a roof. A head being on top of a building must belong in the roof.\n\n# Input: What room might a", "answer": "B: get news"}
{"text": "1 - Where does an opera take place?\n2. Nowhere we can't drink or eat.\n3. The performer does not seem to be eating or drinking, so they are not eating or drinking.\n4. Therefore, you cannot drink or eat in an opera.\n5 - The performer is not drinking, so they must be eating.\n6 - Operas is primarily a location to listen to an orchestra and people sing in the opera.\n7 - Opera venues only have opera performances, therefore they cannot also be a dance hall.\n8 - A dance hall is more for dancing. There would probably not have food there, because that would have to be cleaned up and you would probably get a bigger mess from cooking and people eating. You cannot also dance in this, and it says gathering of friends, so it is probably for a party.\n9 - Parties are for social gatherings.\n10 - Stage is used for theater and shows. If they wanted to make them fun, they would call then parties.\n11 - A party usually includes eating and drinking. People in shows do not usually eat or drink on the stage.\n12 - A dance hall also has lots of food.\n13 - All the people in the venues are probably at a party, because they are drinking, dancing, and there is also a theater group.\n14 - So you can drink and dance at a dance hall, but a dance hall venue is primarily used for dancing, so this is not where everyone goes to drink and dance.\n15 - A dance hall venue is also not likely found in a gathering of friends, because it would be too crowded and there would not be enough space to enjoy the experience.\n16 - Opera is more commonly known to be an event where you can also drink and dance, so it is more likely to be seen with a performer at a party.\n17 - Opera is much bigger than a party or dance hall, so there is not much sense in taking a performer to an opera venue when they can go to an opera venue to an actual gathering.\nSo the final answers are A: Opera B: Opera B C: Party\n\nInput:What kind of person is wearing shorts on Halloween?

Option D: \"Misery\" has a distinct quality of relating to the point in time after you suicide, but \"killing yourself\" does not specify a timeframe. You could consider suicide a success, but it's not clear when it would be successful if you never actually die.\n6. Option E: \"Kill yourself\" states a successful suicide clearly, and can only be done if you haven't already been successful. Thus, only \"kill yourself\" can successfully meet all the conditions.\n7. Therefore, the correct answer is E: kill yourself.\nSo the final correct answer is E: Kill yourself\n\nInput:What is wrong if you walk down the street and you run into an old friend?

This tells us to ignore whatever the question is asking about, let's look at the options instead.\n2. \"Walk down the street and you...\" again, we know that we won't answer that part of the question, let's look instead at the actions that can come after walking down the street.\n3. \"You run into an old friend...\" can occur at any time, so we don't need to factor into our equation. \n4. \"Should not do it\" (C) is an instruction that should be obeyed as soon as you encounter it, so it's", "answer": "E: kill yourself"}
{"text": "1: Choices A, B, and C are not school zones. In other words, a school is not likely to be found in them. Schools are usually found in community zones (D).\n2. Choices D and E are not zones. A building is not a zone and Prague is a city. Choice E doesn't even include any schools, just some districts in the US with a low-income population living there.\n3. The zones most likely to contain a school will be community zones and residential zones. Residential zones are usually where people live, so they would be more likely to have public schools rather than private ones.\n4. That leaves community zones (D). Those zones are where you'll find the most schools.\n5. Thus, the answer would be D: Community.\nSo the final answers are D: community\n\nInput: What sort of clothing does a person who eats hamburgers wear?

{"text": "1.) Begin by answering the question by eliminating incorrect answer choices (if you do not do this first, you will most likely struggle to answer this question. The point of this question is for you to go through each options and think \"Does this answer make sense?\").\n2.) The most obvious answer here to \"What is a common sign someone's lying? \" is the words spoken. But, sometimes you can't trust it, so we have to go for a more subtle answer. There is an indicator of a person\u2019s lying based on their behaviors.\n3.) Here are the common lie detector signs to look out for:\n      *\tAvoid eye contact\n      * \tTalk fast\n      * \tDon't stop talking\n      * \tFeel guilty\n      * \tBlush\n4.) Let's answer this question:\n      * \tThey would not order dog food online, as the word \"ordering\" indicates a physical purchase, not an online purchase.\n      * \tAvoid eye contact does not really answer the question, as the person being lied to, would actually look at the person lying to them. Also, the person asking the questions doesn't have a reason to make this sign.\n      *  The person might talk fast and not stop talking, but they can still talk slowly and not stop talking. The question doesn't make it clear what is meant.\n      *  A person being lied to might \"feel guilty\". But this is not a sign that someone is lying.\n      *  Someone who lies would not be blushing. This is an indication of telling the truth.\n5.) Based on the fact that the answer isn't in the last option, and the fact that the answer can be observed during any behavior, the answer must be a lie.\n6.) So the answer is lying.\n\nInput: What was the first name of the great-grandfather of the second son of William the Conqueror after Harold?

Option B: To answer this, we must answer the question, \"What do creative people do which only a few can do for a living?\"\n4. B: Some answers to this are sew, create art, and express oneself.\n5. Since a variety of answers might fit this category, it is unlikely that B is the correct answer.\n6. Likewise, option C cannot be the answer since only a few people can make a living out of performing such actions.\n7. Thus, A: everyone has some bit of creativity, which can only be explained by the answer being A, which is: sew.\nSo the final possible answer is A: sew\n\nInput: In the beginning, are we at the end or the beginning of the end?

We can eliminate the options that do not make sense as answers to the phrase:\n4. \"Everything\" is not the right answer because he didn't sell everything.\n5.

This can't because a space shuttle is used to transport spacecrafts and not for giving food to people.\n4: Choice D: oven.

The bathroom is a small room typically shared between multiple people that includes a toilet and a shower or bathtub. It isn't the livingroom because it is too small and serves a different purpose.3. The kitchen isn't the living area it doesn't include any entertaining features like a tv or other seating areas. Its main function is cooking food, so it's not something that should be included in the living room.4: A home office doesn't have the entertainment features of a living room, and it typically serves a different purpose. It's more likely to be used for work or study rather than relaxing.5: The attic is a space that's often used as storage but not typically seen as part of the active living area in a home. The answer is E: attic\nSo the final answer here is that the living room isn't the attic\n\n</body>\n</html>", "answer": "C: marriage"}

The object is not to hit it in the air or the trash can. 3: To put the ball in the hole, I need to DRIVE it in the hole. The question is about what is the object, not what is the action.

{"text": "1) Let's get rid of the options that are out of the question. There are no computers on apartment balconies (B), nor on a table top (C), nor school lockers (D).\n2) To choose between the remaining three, focus on the context of the question. \"Put\" can be interpreted as to \"position\" the computer, or to \"store\" the computer for some time, while the computer stays in place.\n3) The options \"house\" and \"office\" are correct here; the computer is \"positioned\" in a house or an office. That's because there is a special place for a computer in an office - on the desk. When a computer is placed somewhere else, the word is used to indicate this, like when you \"put your jacket on the table\" or \"put it in the closet\".\n4) The option \"office\" is more specific because \"a place that sells things\" can be interpreted as many workplaces - from the dry cleaners to a small souvenir shop. However, an office is not just \"a place that sels things\", but rather \"a workplace for people, especially ones that make or process things\".\n5) \"Office\" is therefore the correct answer.\nSo the final output is A: office", "answer": "B: table"}

When someone is nervous and isn't dancing, they aren't dancing like crazy because it is an incomplete action.\n3. Option B: It is not possible to \"Stand Still\" because it is impossible to be both standing and not standing at the same time.  If someone is not dancing, then they are either standing still or they are sitting.\n4. Option C: \"Wallflower\" is also not the answer, as this is a person who is sitting out of any dancing. Someone who is nervous but still plans to attend the ball is not necessarily a wallflower. \n5. Option D: \"Stand Still\" is a different choice, but is also a non-starter because this person is not dancing, but they are still standing.\n6. However, the answer can be determined based on the word \"Progressively\". This implies a progression towards something. So the answer is E: Like Dancing. The boy was nervous, so he couldn't dance, but once he got over the nerves, he \"like danced.\"", "answer": "B: standing still"}
{"text": "1) We can analyze this question in several steps. Understand what the sentence is asking. \n2) \"What does someone living life full feel?\" To understand this question, first, we can look at what living life fully entails. This would be something along the lines of living completely and fully embracing and enjoying life to its fullest. So, someone living life fully will feel joy.\n3) Next, answer choices (A): joy and (B): early death are possible results of a person living a full life. \n4) (C): happiness and (D): valuable are only parts of being happy, and that's why the person may feel happy but not experience early death in the example of the question above.\n5) Therefore, the answer is (A): joy.\nSo the final question is A: joy\n\nInput:If I am looking for something that is similar to a snake, what would this be? Choices:  Pig A: snake B: scorpion C: chicken D: rabbit E: cat\nOutput: 1.) By understanding the question word for word, we can identify the possible answer choices. \"If I am looking for a snake, what will I find?\" The key word here is \"similar.\" This means that there is a difference between the items we are searching for.\n2.) \"A snake\" (A) is not a possible answer because a snake is not similar to a pig at all. In fact, a pig is very different from a snake.\n3.) \"A scorpion\" (B) can be similar to a snake because they are both poisonous reptiles, as per the characteristics listed in the question.\n4.) \"A chicken\" (C) can share characteristics with snakes in that they are both fowls, but a chicken would not really fit the other requirements of \"similar\". \n5.)\"A rabbit\" (D) can also share some characteristics with snakes such as being a small mammal, but it is not similar to a snake in many other ways.\n6.) \"A cat\" (E) can be similar to snakes because they are both mammals, however cats are much more domesticated than snakes.\n7.)

Choice B implies that playing the violin will be relaxing to you, so you should feel relaxed, not feeling happy.\n3. Choices C and D are eliminated.\n4.

Let us start by eliminating options from the store location. Bathroom (B) is not where food would be most likely to be found because this is a storage facility for employees. A back (C) and produce (D) are not the most appropriate locations as a location is typically defined by more than just the boundaries.\n3. There is one option left: E: front of the store. We can confirm that front of the store (E) is the correct answer because this is the location where food will typically be found, even during a trip to another section in the store, such as the bathroom.\nSo the final answers is A: Front of the store.\n\nInput:Where could you find a pen?

{"text": "1: Let's understand the question by breaking it down into the two key components: the tentative agreement between them and the fact they were able to reach that tentative agreement. That means we have the fact the two sides were _able to reach_ a tentative agreement. From there, we will have a better sense of what the question is asking us about.\n2. Let us now eliminate any wrong answers. \n\"Accomplish\" (A) is similar to \"Reach\", in that it would mean achieving the tentative agreement. However, it does not capture the fact they were _able to reach_. It does not indicate whether or not they were able to reach the arrangement. Furthermore, \"Accom-plish\" (A)'s definition refers to having the ability to do something, not being successful in doing so.\n3. \"Make progress\" (C) is an appropriate answer because it refers to building on what came before, which are the previous discussions in negotiations. Therefore, \"Make progress\" (D) is an appropriate answer as it is a feat that they were able to \"reach tentative agreement\" (1). Now that we have understood what it is asking and have eliminated inappropriate answers, we need to compare what's left:\n\"Stop arguing \" (B) would mean that the two sides stopped debating or disagreeing with each other. While it is true they agreed, we don't know if they agreed because one side gave in or because both sides came to an agreement. Thus, \"Stop arguing\" (B) is unclear. Furthermore, \"Stop\" also means to \"halt\" or \"freeze\" an activity, which is not what it is asking us to do. \n\"Do business\" (E) means to exchange goods or services for monetary transactions. To be fair, the feat mentioned is that the two sides reached an agreement that they can \"do business\", which is true. However, it is not what the question is asking because it asks about \"the fact they were able to even reach... agreement\". Thus, the answer is not \"Do business\". \nThat leaves us with the last option, \"Concert\" (D), which is an appropriate answer because concerts can be a feat for both parties involved. For those attending, they achieve the goal of seeing a performance, a feat. For those performing,", "answer": "A: accomplish"}

For this, there are two possible answers: the bird itself (obviously), or the image itself. This question is asking us to identify the real bird. \n2:Let's begin with the bird not described in the question first. \"Parakeet\" (C) is ruled out because it is not illustrated on the image. \"Dove\" (B) and \"Parakeet with wings missing\" (E) are neither illustrated nor discussed in the image, so they are also ruled out.\n3: The three remaining birds: \"Owl\" (D), \"Owl with wings missing\" (A), and \"Parakeet\" are all discussed and illustrated on the image, which means that we need to analyze their characteristics to determine which is in the image. \n4: The owl (D) is too large, meaning it is too large to be an owl in the picture. Therefore, we rule out D.\n5: \"Owl with Wings Missing\" (A) does not have wings and is illustrated in a location that seems very far from the nest of the others owls.

There are two things to keep in mind:\n\n- This statement can be seen as a positive question (meaning there is an animal that produces milk), but it can also be seen as a negative question (meaning there might be an animal that doesn't produce milk). Thus, look for both types of answers to see if a given animal is correct.\n- Not all answer choices are required. For instance, \"Pig\" (B) is an animal that does not produce milk, but \"Store\" (E) is an answer that is required, as \"Store\" is not an animal, and thus, will not produce milk.\n\n3: The correct answer is \"Cow\" (D). A cow is a real animal that produces milk. Thus, the correct answer choice is a real animal that is also used by humans for its products, such as milk.

Ceiling (A) is one good answer because it is high and offers a good perspective to the picture. Wall (C) is another good choice because it is typically a level surface and has plenty of room for the picture. Floor (D) is the least ideal answer because it is not a good surface to hang anything.

After being full of fear, someone might urinate, and this seems to be the correct answer if we understand the question in terms of needing to relieve themselves.\n2) This does not seem to be the right answer if we consider the fact that going to the bathroom requires privacy, and the context of the question is that the person is 'wet' which suggests they may not have privacy to do so.\n3) Another likely answer choice is option A: being in a boat or swimming, because after being full of fear someone might want to soothe themselves by being wet. However, this still doesn't seem to be the right choice because the language used suggests running, not swimming or boat riding.\n4) This does not seem relevant at all to the question, because it is not something which one who is scared would be doing.\n5) Likewise, this is not a valid answer, because the question focuses on 'fear,' not anger.\n6) Therefore, the only remaining answer is either option C or D, and the word'swimming' seems most relevant to the question but does not quite seem to fit. This brings us to the correct answer; option C: calculating things quickly. The context of this question seems to focus on stress and tension, and 'calculating things quickly' is a way to manage this tension which also explains why one would be wet.\nSo the final (correct) answer is C: calculate things quickly.\n\nInput: When does a person lose trust in someone? Choices: 1. A: When the person gets robbed 2. B: When the person is lying to someone 3. C: When the person finds out the person is stealing from them 4. D: When the person cheats on them or a quiz\nOutput: 1.) Option A: When the person is robbed. Being robbed leads to losing trust in someone, as it is a traumatic and dangerous event that can damage relationships.\n2.) Option B: When the person lies to someone. Lying is a breach of trust, which can lead to the loss of trust if the trust was already fragile.\n3.) Option C: When the person discovers the person is stealing something from them.

Let's eliminate the incorrect answers. The answer could not be fire, as it is the fire of a burning coal that Dan could potentially use to warm his house.\n4.) We also eliminate the answer coal/wood as a heat source. They cannot be burning in the stove to keep your house warm when they are outfitted to the house.\n5.) The only remaining answer then, is the heat source fire.\nSo the final answered is A: fire", "answer": "B: solar energy"}
{"text": "1) Let's begin by understanding the options. Choice \"garage\" (B) doesn't make sense because an adult should not be sleeping in a garage. \n2) Choice \"living room\" (D) doesn't make much sense because a person is typically not sleeping on a couch in their living room, unless they have guests over. \n3) Choice \"guest room\" (E) makes some sense from a logical standpoint, but it's not immediately clear if the person is actually an adult or is not.\n4) That leaves us with \"his parent's what\" (C). \n5) Logically, this would be the most likely choice because it's more likely that someone would sleep in their parent's house than any other option. \n6) Furthermore, when it comes to the phrase \"a [noun]'s [noun]\", it implies ownership, which means the phrase describes the noun immediately following the article. \n7) Therefore, the correct answer is C: parent's.\nSo the final answe is C: parent' questions.", "answer": "E: basement"}
{"text": "1: Option D: larger family is incorrect because using invitro will increase, not decrease the number of children.\n2: Option C: overpopulation is incorrect because this is another way to reproduce without using invitro since this is simply the number of children within an economy.\n3: Option B: problems refers to difficulties experienced during pregnancy that could possibly be solved by using invitro. In this case, using invitro will not solve the problem.\n4: Option A: problems is incorrect because the invitro process would only be used if a person experienced problems during a pregnancy.\n5: Option E: baby is incorrect because the invtro process refers to using it to conceive a child and, therefore, it would be impossible to refer to an already made child as \"in vitro\".\n6: Option E: problems is incorrect as well because only problems that the mother of the child encounters will have a connection to using invitro to conceived a child.\n7: So the only possibility for the question to make sense is Option C: overpopulations which refers to the concern of there being too many new humans on earth and thus, there is a need to use invitro to increase the population of humans.", "answer": "A: problems"}
{"text": "Begin by examining each answer choice and deciding what it doesn't represent. \"Wishing well\" (B) has no logical place for a janitor's pail. There are similar answers such as \"kitchen\" (C) or \"garage\" (D), but they also do not answer the question. \nThe main issue is that these answers do not relate to the activity of finding the item in question. \"Utility room\" (E) may have janitorial equipment, but it is still not a logical place for a janitress to find a pail. \nThe only logical place from the answer choices is \"Garage\" (D), in which the janitor may find his pail, as it's a logical source of cleaning related items.\nSo the final conclusion is D: Garage.\n\nInput: If you were walking down a crowded street, how might you greet a person you are acquainted with? Choices: 1. A: by their name 2. B: by their gender 3. C: with a warm hello 4. D: with a smile 5. E: by their face \nOutput: 1) \"By their name\" (1) is a very common greeting, but it may not be used in a crowded street because calling out someone's name may cause a commotion. 2) \"By their gender\" (2) would be a very uncommon greeting, as it assumes you know someone's gender. Moreover, it may not be safe or socially acceptable to greet a stranger by their gender, so probably not used in this situation. 3) \u201cWarm hello\u201d (3) is a typical greeting and would likely be used in this situation. It signals that one is friendly and approachable. 4) \u201cA smile\u201d (4) is a polite expression of greeting that can be used in many situations. 5) \"By their face\" (5) would indicate that the person is so close you can recognize them by their face. In most cases, this is not likely to be the case when in a crowd. Thus, in a crowded street, most likely someone who knows you might respond by saying a warm hello like I did at the start. \nSo the final conclusion would be C: with a warmHello.\n\n### \uc774\ubc88\uc5d0", "answer": "E: utility room"}

Now let's look at each answer choice more closely. Choice A: \"Briefcase\" is a container with the answer could fit into.\n3.) Option B: No, you can't buy a pen in your pocket. It wouldn't fit, and besides, they wouldn't allow you to buy anything in your pocket.\n4.) Choice C: \"Friends' house\" could potentially be a place you could buy a pen as you could bring a pen there as a gift for them. However, you can't normally purchase items there, as it would be an awkward experience. \n5.) Choice D: This could potentially be a place where you could buy a pen, but it wouldn' t be the most direct answer as you could also buy pens from stores, not just their specific locations. \n6.) Choice E: This is where you can buy pens. You can purchase a pen from the classroom because you are in school, where pens are given out to use, and you could buy one to take home. \n7.) Comparing all the options, option E (classroom) is the best one for this answer.\nSo the final  answer is E: classroom\n\nInput:Which are not places where you might find music? Choices: 1. A: bookstore 2. B: bathroom 3. C: bookshelf 4. D: concert hall 5. E: home\nOutput: 1) \"Which are not places you might find music?\" The answer, obviously, would not have music in it.\n2) \"Bathroom\" is not a place where you might find music just because you might not enjoy singing in a bathroom.\n3) \"Bookstore\" is also not a place you might find music. A bookstore is a place to buy books, not instruments. It is not a location where you might find music.\n4) \"Concert hall\" is a place where you might hear music, but it is not a place where music is located.\n5) \"Home\" is the place you actually live in.

{"text": "1 We first find that the question is about a \"connection\", but the question specifies that this \"connection\" is with James. We know now that he is making a connection, so the question is asking us to identify his connection. \n2 We eliminate each option that isn't James. \"Company\" (A) could be where James is going, but we know James's connection is with him and not the company. \"Airport\" (B) is where he was before his connection to the new location, so we also know this isn't his connection. \n3 \"Wall\" (C) isn't a place and is therefore excluded. \"Computer network\" (E) could be his connection, but we know it is a connection, so the connection must be with a person or place. So \"computer network\" is excluded from the options. \n4 \"Love\" (D) is not a valid choice because the connection can be to only one person and love is with more than one person at a time.\n5 Therefore, the correct choice is \"James's connection\" or \"Connection to James\".\nSo the final answer it is either James's connection or Connection to James\n\nInput: What are the differences between the types of tents?

{"text": "1) Let's first look at the opposite of foolhardiness. One definition of foolhardy is \"having or showing a lack of care about the possible consequences of an action.\" Thus, the opposite word would be the word which means to care about what could happen.\n2) The question is asking us to pick which choice does NOT mean to care about what could possibly happen. After analyzing the answer choices, we can deduce that choices D, C, and E do not mean that, while choices B and A do.\n3) Choice D does not express care as the word cautious refers to the caution that a person would have to do something, not care what will happen. Choice B, discreet, refers to being discrete about things (inclusive).\n4) Choice E, careful, refers to being carful, in which case, careful does not refer to having thought about possible consequences.\n5) Choice A, thoughtful, refers to thinking about things, which is not what is required as the question asks us about the opposite of foolhardily.\n6) Therefore, the answer is B: discreet.\nSo the final answers is B: discrept\n\n\nInput\uff1aYou are a cake baker and your client has ordered 20 cakes.

{"text": "1.) The question asked is a general one about a situation where people standing in line are near a road. \n2.) Let us take one by one all the given options and see where they do not fit right. \"Water fountain\" (B) is too narrow in focus; it is not associated with any road as it is simply a drinking station. Similarly, \"Military Base\" (C), \"Apartment\" (D) and a \"Bus stop\" (E) are all too narrow. \n3.) So, it is \"Fire House\" (E), which would also be a logical place to see people standing in line near a road.\nSo the final  answer is A: Fire House.\n\nInput:Where might I encounter an airline pilot and a flight attendant?\nChose A: airport B: inside a plane C: in a school D: in a movie E: in a carpool\nOutput: 1: Where I will encounter the airline pilot and flight attendant? 2: The key to this question is to find a setting where both of them will be present. We will eliminate options A,D, and E as they are not the place to find a pilot. B and C are a bit closer to being right, as an airport and aircraft are both likely to have a pilot. \n- To be confident in our answer, we can do a bit of testing. Let us go online and find an airline passenger list that includes airline employee names. There are several, so we will pick one at random - Southwest Airlines from July 24, 2020. We look up the flight attendants and pilots. It turns out that every flight, both in an airplane and at an airport contains at least some pilots, and flight attendants. This means our answer has to be either both B and C. \n- As B (airport) includes only pilots and C (airplanes) includes only pilots, we can further reason that only A (airplane) can be the correct answer.\n3. We can now cross out B and C from our options list.\n- Now we look at A (airplane) again. We note that pilots are almost always found on the airplane. \n4. There are two flight attendants and a pilot on the same flight, so pilots are on an air", "answer": "E: bus stop"}
{"text": "1 We can eliminate the answer options that do not address hurting someone else: \"feel sorry\" (A) and \"trust God\" (C). Feeling sorry is emotional in nature, and Trusting God may also not have a negative connotation.\n2 The remaining options include \"ride a bike\" (D), which is not what a person might do if they did something to hurt someone else. \"Lend money\" (E), on the other hand, would be a situation where someone had hurt someone else and were perhaps trying to make amends by lending money.\n3 From this, we can deduce that the correct answer is \"lend money\" (E). \nSo the final answer \nis E: lend money \n\nInput: Where in a house could you find a dishwasher? Choices: \n A: kitchen B: on the floor C: inside a bathtub D: above ground E: bathroom\nOutput: To answer this, we will need to know what a dishwashing machine is used for. \"A dishwashing unit is used specifically for washing dishes, so the answer must be in a place where dishes happen.\" \nSince the question is asking us to think about where in a house, let's also consider the parts of a house.\n\"Inside a bathtub\"(C) is clearly not the answer because a bathtub is filled with water and dishwashing requires drying items, so a bathtub wouldn't be useful for dishwashing.\n\"Above the ground\" (E) may seem like a reasonable solution, but the question says, \"could you find a dish washer,\" which suggests that a dish washer may exist in the house somewhere.\nThis leaves us with Options A, B, and D as possible answers: \"kitchen,\" \"on the floor,\" and \"inside a bathtub.\"\n\n\"Inside a bath tub\" does not meet our requirements. Firstly, bath tubs are made of metal, and secondly, they are meant for water. But bath tubs do require being inside.\n\"On the floor\" does not work because one does not put a dishwash machine on the floor. Only food can be placed on the floor.\n\nNow we have to check if the dish-", "answer": "A: feel sorry"}
{"text": "1.\"Bad at dancing.\" is the obvious answer for this question, as \"bad at dancing\" indicates that she needed some type of instruction.\n2. Since she was \"bad at dancing,\" the instructor would most likely teach her \"the basics\" of dancing. \"Basics\" implies a foundational level of knowledge, not an advanced level.\n3. The correct answer is \"rhythmic movement\", as this is the fundamental skill for dancing. \n4. After learning the \"basics\" of dancing through rhythmic movement, the instructor can then focus on fine-tuning those skills by teaching \"moving body\", \"music\" and finally, \"having fun\". 4. These more advanced skills build upon a foundation of basic rhythmic movement to help improve the dancer's abilities further.\nSo the final (correct) answer is A: rhythmic movement\n\nInput: Why would someone not be interested in watching a show?

The key word here is \"tunnel\"\u2014the location would need a glass structure in which you can observe the sharks.\n2: Eliminate the answers that are not connected to the key question of a tunnel. Giving \"Pacific Ocean\" (B) the benefit of the doubt, it is not a location for shark viewing: the Pacific is vast, deep, and dark. Giving \"Sea World\" (C) the benefit of the doubts again, it is not a structure for viewing sharks underwater. Sea-World is a marine park that uses underwater shows and glass tanks with no tunnels for visitors. \n3: \"South Pacific (A)\" might be a location that could contain sharks in a glass tunnel. It is very likely a large and beautiful area with numerous wildlife, some of which might swim near a glass structure where people can observe. But it is not the most direct answer to the question, and another answer could be closer.\n4: \"Indian Ocean\" (D) is not the answer because the Indian Ocean is a large region bordered by many countries and does not have a glass underwater tunnel. The Indian Ocean, like the Pacific Ocean, is filled with deep water, large ships, and numerous marine life, but does not have a glass tunnel that can be viewed.\n5: \"Gulf of Mexico\" (E) is definitely not the answer because 1 Gulf of Mexico is not where you find a \"clear tunnel\" that allows people to view aquatic life in the sea and 2 the Gulf of Mexico is an area of swamps, bays, and other coastal areas with many marine life and water bodies without any transparent marine observational rooms.\n6: Hence, the answer is A. You can view sharks in a glass underwater tunnel in the South Pacific.", "answer": "B: sea world"}

Choice B: \"confess\" is an action, so it isn't applicable in the question. This choice doesn't satisfy the criteria.\n3. Choices C and D only focus on punishment aspects. If a person is guilty, choosing either of these would suggest that they want to get out of jail. \n4. Choice E: \"find god\" is only relevant if the person is guilty, for it says, \"find god\" once they are innocent and not guilty.\n5.

Soccer has the highest number of nationalities participating in international matches. That makes sense as it is the most popular sport in the world. 3. Choice C is track and field, which have over 1000 events during the Olympics. 4. Choice D is archery. It is a relatively low-impact sport as they don't have to run with the bow. That means more chance of winning as a gold medal. 5. Choice E must not be wrestling.

When the crowd isn' say big enough to be considered field, the group can't be alone, therefore applying to the field doesn't apply.\n3.) D.

{"text": "1: \"What should I do with them?\". The question is asking about the best course of action for clothes that have developed a smell.\n2. Let us discount options which do not make sense. \"Air out\" is redundant and \"Hang in closet\" is not a logical choice because they will still carry the smell in the closet. \n3. \"Sniff\" would be applicable if it is a fresh scent like lavender, but the question is about an unpleasant odour, so sniff makes no sense. \"Get dirty\" is definitely not an option because then the clothes would smell worse.\n4.

The rulers we are talking about here must be owned by multiple people, so the drawer would be the owner's to each ruler because it is likely that the person with each ruler owns their own personalized drawer.\ne.) And of course, Choice E is the answer. Although some places could argue that this should be a \"yes\" answer, the desk in question really would have to have multiple individuals on a desk within a workplace. Also, a company will have rulers for each individual working in a company, which is the only place this concept makes sense.\nSo the final two answers are C: office and E: desk.\n\nInput: What could an athlete not do in basketball?

What did he find? Choices:  a: hammer shop b: construction site c: work bench d: kitchen table e: his toolbox\nOutput: 1 The man went to the hardware store (or the hammer shop) because he needed a hammer. He went to the hammer shop at another time and asked the owner to sell him a hammer. The owner refused to sell him one and insisted he use his toolbox instead. This is not allowed because the toolbox is too small and he could be sued if he broke the window with a hammer that belonged to someone else.\n2 The tools in the work bench may be allowed to be used on a construction site. The tools would have to be on the construction site if they were going to be used there.\n3 The tool box may contain tools for home use or work use. The tools must be kept at home if they are to be used on a house.

{"text": "1) Let's start by removing the choices that are inappropriate for the given context.\n2) Choice A, \"a nice feeling\" is not what an answer will be, because an answer has to be a force that can actively change the life of an individual.\n3) Choice C, \"respect\" is also not an adequate answer, because an answer has also to have the capacity to improve and evolve an individual's overall well-being by bringing an external change into that individual's life.\n4) \"New freedom\" (D) may seem like it is on the right track but not quite. That's because new freedom may be a result of forgiveness but it is a byproduct and just like any by-product, its origin is in something that is already set and the individual's well-being is not guaranteed to be improved as a result of it.\n5) \"Good heart\" (E) - this is an answer we think could potentially fit the requirement but it's still not clear yet. A good heart is the result of forgiveness, which means that good heart also may not be 100% necessary for improvements in an individual's well- being. \n6) Let's see what the remaining choices may provide an answer to.\nThe following 3 options may potentially be helpful: good karma, good karma is something that may benefit an individual by bringing improvements into an individual's well being by bringing changes into their life. A nice feeling and forgiveness may be results of good karma but are not forces that change an individual. \n7) Finally, good karma is considered as answer because it can change an individual's well - being by bringing positive changes in their life, which is a force capable of affecting an individual.\nSo the final option is: C: good karma.", "answer": "B: good karma"}
{"text": "1) The question is asking what to do when pens aren't working. The first thing we will want to analyze is the verb \"work\" to decide the meaning of the question.\n2) To give some context, it is obvious that pens themselves are not work, as they are physical objects. Therefore, the real focus of the question is on the verb \"work\" and whether it relates to pens being able to function for writing, as opposed to other meanings.\n3) Next, let's eliminate the options which do not mention pens not working. \"Take notes\" (E) does not involve pens and is similar to just writing with a pen. \n4) Likewise, \"scribble\" (E) is another activity and has no relation to pens not working. 5) It is also likely that when pens not work, they have run out of ink. It may also be that the pens have a leaking issue. The pen runs out of ink if it has no more ink to write with. Pens can also leak, which would also cause them to not work if they leak ink onto a surface. \n6) Choice A: Ink In has nothing to do with the original answer. \n7) Choice B: Caps are not directly related to pens being able to write because caps keep most of a pen's body from coming out. They therefore do not affect the ability of pens to write.\n8) Choice D: Ink Cartridges is the closest choice to the original answer because this choice involves the ink cartridge. An ink cartridge is a small container used to store ink in pens. When an ink cartridge runs out of ink, it can also no longer write, just as pens cannot write if they run out of ink or leak. However, an ink cartridge can be replaced relatively easily, so pens that have run out of their ink or were leaking can still work well with a new cartridge.\n9) Thus, the answer it that Pens cannot write if they are leaking or have run out of inks.\nSo the final question is D: Ink Cartrige\n\n### Important note:\n\nYour choice of the answer must contain all letters in the original question.\n\n### Example:\n\nInput:\"There isn't much to be expected at a house party, except", "answer": "A: ink in"}

When someone is buying beer, they may want to do so because they are: \n2). \"Getting arrested\":\n*This is not the answer because it is implied that they are not so arrested that they are not able to purchase beer. \n3). Being intoxicated:\nThe answer is not being intoxicated because someone is already intoxicated if they are looking to be intoxicated. Furthermore, in this question context, the person is not interested in being intoxicated because that is already occurring. It is worth noting that being intoxicated can be an excuse to buy beer. \n4). Wanting to be sober:\nThe answer is definitely not to get sober because the person is not interested nor attempting to become sober through their purchase of beer. \n5). Intoxicated:\nThe person is not interested in becoming intoxicated because they are already intoxicated. Therefore, as the person is already intoxicated, they do not want to purchase beer.\n6). Pleasure:\nAs already alluded to, buying beer can be a form of pleasure, so this could be the correct answer. However, this is not the intended use of the beer. For a person to buy beer, they likely do not care about purchasing a drink for pleasure. The only thing that should ultimately matter to them is drinking beer.\n7). Problems: \nWhile buying beer could be a solution for problems, this is not their primary reason. As mentioned already, purchasing beer can be a means to pleasure, but is most likely a means to drunkenness. This leads us to the conclusion that buying beer is more than likely being used for intoxication. \nTherefore, the answer is to be found in Answer choices E: intoxication.\nSo the final answers is E: to be intoxicated\n\nInput: Why would a person want to be drinking wine? Choices: \nA: make money B: alcohol C: relaxation D: problems E: intoxication F: pleasure \nOutput: The reason a person would be drinking wine is to be intoxicated because you can get intoxication from drinking it.

{"text": "1) \"Grilling\" is an activity that can be done in a backyard, a restaurant, a crockpot, and so on.

It also doesn't consider a place like a crockpot because that is not something one would use outdoors.\n2) Option D is not applicable because the question does not ask for a place to do grilling, just someone's house. Option E is not the answer because the question does not specifically state that the barbeque is necessary, and even if it was, option E does not refer to a barbeque itself. \n3) In the last analysis, we have to consider \"neighbor's house\" (C) because other than being the only available home as a place to prepare food when hosting guests, the term \"neighbor'\" is sufficient as there may be other properties that aren't necessarily homes but still have grills that can be used outdoors.\n4) Therefore, the answer is C: Neighbor's house.\nSo the final answers are C: Neighbor\u2019s house\n\n\n\n\n### Input:\n\ninput: 'Cowboy' or 'Cowgirl' \ninput: Cowboy\ninput: Cowgirl\n\nInput:  There is a group of people.

{"text": "1.\"Where in Southern Europe would we find many canals?\" The options are: Michigan (B), New York (C), Amsterdam (D), Venice (E) and a bridge (E). We rule out option (D) Venice as an option because it's not related to Southern Europe and (E) Bridge as being an area where we could find canals.\n2. We rule out that option (B) Michigan is a place in Southern Europe.\n3. We exclude option that (C) New York is a area in Southern Europe.\n4. Option (E) Venice has many canals, but it isn't a Southern European city.\n5. By looking at the remaining location options, we can determine that answer is Amsterdam. Amsterdam is the only of the Southern European cities we know has many canals in it. \n6. The answer is C: Amsterdam.\nSo the final Answer is C: Amsterdam\n\nInput: What is the last digit of an even number, divisible by ten, and greater than three? Answer choices: A: 2 B: 5 C: 7 D: 0 E: 9\n\nOutput: Let's consider the conditions of the question: an even number, divisibale by 10, and greater than 3.\n1. We know this is an even number because it must be divisible by 2.\n2. We know the number has to be divisible by 10 because that is what we're told.\n3. We know that it has to be greater than 3 because being an even number implies a divisor of 2, which is equal to or greater than 3. \n4. Let's consider each option carefully to determine if it will satisfy the conditions of the question.\n5. In this order of options: 2 -> 7 -> 5 -> 9 -> 0. No option is greater than 3, or in other words divisible by 2, and divisible by 1 - which isn't a number option we were given by the question prompt!\nThe answer is E: 9", "answer": "D: venice"}
{"text": "1.'In the basement' (B) is not a very good answer because the basement is not a pleasant place to be. You can't very well lay in the sun in the basement.\n2.'Beach' (E) is a great answer. You can lay in the sun almost anywhere on a beach.\n3.'West' (C) is a potentially incorrect answer because the west typically has longer sunlight than the east. You can be sunburnt on the west or the east.\n4. For these reasons, 'Beach' (E,) is the best option, with 'West' (C) being the second best option. 5. If you chose this one, give yourself a gold star!\nSo the final answer or best answer is E: beach\n\nInput: What is an important key on your car to know about? Choices: 1. Gas\n2. Parking brake\n3. Turn signal\n4. Transmission\n5. Fuel\n6. Battery\n7. Rear window defroster\nOutput: 1.\"Gas\" (C) requires knowing the amount of gas in your tank, gas station locations, and which one charges which kind of card (e.g., Exxon for Exxon card).\n2. \"Parking brake\" (D) is the bar that holds your car from moving at an incline or if you have the car in park.\n3. \"Turn signal\" (E) is the thing you use to indicate you are turning.\n4. \"Transmission\" (B) is the gearbox between the engine and the wheels.\n5. \"Fuel\" (A) is the stuff in your gas tank.\n6. \"Battery\" (F) is the thing that provides power for the car.\n7. \"Rear window defroster\" (G) is an option.\n8. This question is asking for the key to something to do with your car. There is no clear winner between car key locks and the key for your rear window defroster.\n9. This question may or may not have a clear answer but the most likely answers are between \"Gas\" (C), \"Parking brakes\" (D), and \"Fuel\" (E).\nSo the final answer should be one of Choices: C: Gas,", "answer": "D: beach"}
{"text": "1) Let's first dismiss the options that are not related to bald eagles or safety. \"Pine tree\" (B) is not safe for bald eagles since it's full of needles that eagles can get trapped in. \"Open country\" (C) is also not related as bald eagles are more closely associated with forests. \n2) The choice that most closely fits the description of being safe is \"Wildlife refuge\" (D). A refuge is defined as a protected habitat for wildlife, which would be ideal for bald eagles.\n3) The remaining two choices could potentially be safe since they are both located in the sky and wildlife refuges might be located in the sky, but refuges have many different locations.\n4) Thus, the answer is D: Wildlife refuge.\nSo the final answe is D: Wildlife Refuge", "answer": "D: wildlife refuge"}
{"text": "1.\"What is a person chating with friends likely hoping to acheive?\" \n2.The question asks about the \"accomplishment\" of chatting with friends rather than the \"activities\" involved, so options A, B, and C can be eliminated. These activities are likely going to happen regardless whether the main goal is to chat with friends.\n3.Option D is the correct answer because chat with friends generally involves communication, which is the main goal when people socialize. The goal of chat is not information but interaction. \n4.Option E is incorrect because people chat with friends generally to socialize. Social bonds are often improved, but the purpose of chat isn't to improve social bonds.\n5.Thus, the answer is D: kill boredome.\nSo the final awnser is D: kill boring\n\nInput:What can't I have enough of? Choices: 1.A: money B: friends C: life D: knowledge E: hugs\nOutput: 1\"What can't you have enough of?\". The question gives an indirect clue that the answer will be something you can't have a surplus of.\n2. If we start with the answer choices, A and B, they both seem like things you could have too much of. Money is a unit of measurement, and thus it is possible to have too much of something that is measured like money can be. Friends, however, is not a unit of measurement. You cannot have four or more friends because there is no value designated to friend, so you cannot have too many friends.\n3. That leaves us with the remaining three answer choices. \"Knowledge\" (D) is an item that we don't acquire in an amount that is easily measurable like money is. We can be educated in knowledge, but there is no way to quantify knowledge as a single unit because each person could potentially have a different interpretation of \"knowledge\". \"Hugs\" (E) have a limit in that you only have one, so it's impossible to have too many hugs. 4. With that, the answer is D knowledge.\nSo the final answwers are D knowledge\n\nInput: On a farm, what do they usually carry in a basket?

{"text": "1 The question wants us to know the term for the type of sensor. \n2. As mentioned by the expert, the sensor is set off by \"distance\". Therefore, we're looking for the term for \"distance\".\n3. Let's exclude irrelevant answers now. We already have the correct pronoun; we need the name of a distance.\n4. \"Near\" (B) is the wrong pronoun and also doesn't refer to distance.\n5. Likewise, \"Closeness\" (C) is also wrong, as these are synonyms for \"close\".\n6. There were also two confusing answers that seemed like they should be correct, but we can eliminate them because the question asked for \"proximity\" (D) and the expert mentioned being \"set off\" by \"distance\". However, \"proximity\" has two other meanings: 1) the condition of being near to someone or someone else or something; 2) an approximate computation of a number or value. \n7. Thus, we need to exclude both \"proximity\" and \"distance\" from our answers, leaving us with only two choices: \"here\" (E) and \"this\" (E).\n8 However, the question asks us to know what kind of sensor, so we need a pronoun to go with \"this\", which makes \"this\" the wrong answer.\n9. Thus, the answer to the question is E: here.\nSo the final answers are E: here\n\nInput:Which of the following is the correct method of saying hello in the US? Choices: 1). A: Good morning 2). B: Good afternoon 3). C: Good evening 4). D: Goodbye 5). E: goodbye\nOutput: 1). Good morning (A) and Goodbye (D) aren't answers at all, so we can skip them. \n2). Good afternoon (B) and Goodbye (C) are incorrect answers, as they aren't the correct way to end a conversation. \n3). This leaves us with only C: Good evening as the correct answer, as this is the correct greetings used in good times and good news, or to say someone good night if it is late in the evening.\nSo the final choice is C: Good evening\n\nInput: If you need to clean, would you look in", "answer": "D: proximity"}
{"text": "1) Let's eliminate the incorrect answer.\n2) A military base is not the answer because there are far more military personnel on a military base than on a school. You would not expect to see anyone there doing jumping jacks.\n3) An opera house is not the answer because it would be far more common for opera-goers to walk in pairs rather than fours.\n4) A water fountain is not the answer because a water fountain does not have people. People are required, not water fountains.\n5) A bus stop is not the answer because you would not be seeing multiple people doing jumping jacs simultaneously since it is unlikely that someone would be arriving at a busy bus stop simultaneously with everyone else.\n6) A church is not the answer because churches do not allow jumping jacks. As a result, this is a strict no-no when participating. Additionally, this would only happen to those who were in the church to visit someone rather than participate in an activity.\n7) Therefore, the answer is E: Church.", "answer": "A: military base"}
{"text": "1.\"Where is there usually a... fiddle playing?\". This phrase makes you think of fiddle playing, which you'll only be able to do with a fiddle. The question is asking where there is likely to be a fiddle, so we will use a \"where\" rather than a \"if\".\n2. We would expect to find a fiddle in a place where you usually perform the activity of playing the fiddle.\n3. This eliminates \"Dance Hall\", which is a place to perform dancing, not fiddling. We also eliminate \"Tennessee\", which is not relevant other than it being a state.\n4. Now we turn our attention to the other answer choices. \n5. \"Music store\" can be a place where fiddles are played but only because there is also a musical instrument section, where one can rent or buy the fiddle to play. Therefore, this is not a place where there is usually a fiddle playing. \n6. \"Orchestra\" is an option that should be considered carefully to avoid the trap answer of \"concert hall\". Yes, orchestras perform in concert halls, but orchestra members also have their own instruments which they play while at the concert itself. Orchestras have a director and a concertmaster, which is the first violinist, but they are not where the answer is. \n7. This finally leaves us with \"Symphony\": the place where there is usually fiddle playing. Symphony halls are built for musical performances, so this answer is the only correct one. \nSo the final answer would be B: Dance Hall.", "answer": "C: orchestra"}
{"text": "1) Lets start off by narrowing down the possibilities. \n2) Drug A: The correct answer is A. The problem with Drugs D, causes illness, is that illness isn't what drugs do. Drugs cause harmful effects on the body. \n3) Drug B: The correct answer is again A. Clouding the mind means the mind changes, which is actually a drug effect. The brain will change in a way that is not the natural way it should function, which leads to problems.\n4) Drug C: The correct answer is, again, A. The brain has a specific function to perform, and a drug will harm how the brain functions in a way that is out of the ordinary. This is one possible effect on the brain, but not the main one. \n5) Drug D: The correct answer is B. Lower IQ is what drugs are known for in terms of doing harm.\n6) Drug E: The correct answer is C. Drugs don't cause accidents directly, but they might cause reckless behaviour or carelessness, both of which can lead to accidents. The answer is C. \nSo the final answer the answer is A: damage.\n\nInput: What happens if you make a bad choice? Choices: 1: death 2: loss of everything you care about 3: you're locked up 4: you're embarrassed 5: you're never going to know 6: discomfort\nOutput: 1: The first choice is clearly death, as if you make a bad decision, it's likely that someone else will die as a result of it.  2: Second option is losing everything you care about. This will vary on an individual level but it's likely that some consequences of a bad decision will at least cause significant distress for the victim.  3: The third option is locking someone up. This can definitely be the outcome of a bad decision but its a rare use of prison. 4: The fourth option is the embarrassment. This is a key feeling that will arise from a bad choice. Most commonly the bad choice will be broadcast and those involved will become concerned with how the community and family perceive them. 5: This answer is you're never going you know what happened. You might know but you're never going be sure.", "answer": "E: cause accidents"}
{"text": "1.\"Can you name a good reaons for attending school?\" is the only logical statement of the options.\n2.\"Get smart\" (A) would be a great reason for some people to attend school, but would not be a good one for others, as going to school does not guarantee you to become smart.\n3.\"Boredom\" (B) is not a good reason for attaining an education because going to school is an incredibly boring experience for many people, but that does not mean they should not go to school.\n4.\"Colds and Flu\" is not a good reason either for going to school, because the reason for going to school is not purely health-related concerns, though getting an education may improve your overall health. \n5.\"Taking tests\" (C) is a possible good reason, but there can be many other reasons for attainding an education, even if getting a degree does not necessarily equate to doing well on test.\n6.\"Spend time\" (D) is a possible good reaons, but again, getting an education is not only about spending time in a classroom.\n7.\"None of the above\" (E) is not an option because it has multiple words and is one of the other answers.\n8.\"School\" (F) is a possible good reasons, however, it does not necessarily have to be a bad reason for attending school either.\n9.

{"text": "1) The first step of any problem is to understand what is being asked. \"She needs to visit a Bookshop\", and will look at some other places later, where should she look for the Bookshop?\n2) So it must be in the mall, and to confirm this choice, we look at the other choices.\n3) The student union is for educational purposes, and the Library is for educational and research purposes, so both are not the answer here. The department store is where one may want to get clothes but not books, and the town or city is where people live and there may be a bookshop there. But, as the question says, they went from the town to the mall, so the town or city is not the answer.\n4) So there is only one option remaining. \"The mall\", since the bookshop is located there.\n5) Therefore, the answer is D: Mall\nSo the final answer to this question is that she needs to go to a mall.\n\nInput:Who can a person contact when a phone call fails to respond? Choices: 1. A: friend who also owns the phone 2. B: family doctor 3. C: neighbor's mother 4. D: mechanic 5. E: neighbor's daughter\nOutput: 1 The key to this problem is the word \"contact\". It isn't \"contact friend who also owns phone\" since there is an implication in the question that a call has failed to respond, and if a friend had the same phone and number as that person they would likely be able to make the contact more easily without a phone call.\n2 The family doctor is one to contact in the case of physical injury, a serious symptom, or a medical event. This question is not referring to a physical problem.\n3 The neighbor's mother is not a person who has their own phone number.\n4 The mechanic wouldn't normally be the one who a person would contact directly as they are not related and not a phone company.\n5 If the neighbor's daughter is the one who actually has a business phone number that they use at home, then they would be the most likely person to contact them. \n6 Choice E is the only remaining answer as the other five have been eliminated.\nSo the final conclusion is that to contact anyone via phone when a call fails to respond one can contact their", "answer": "B: mall"}

He didn't specify what kind of job he'd always wanted, and the question assumes that he wants to run away with something pertaining to his job. \n2. \"Clown\" is being used here in its general sense, not its technical name. In terms of clowns, both circuses and carnivals have people dressed as clowns, so he's going to college at a place where there are often people dressed as clown. \n3. Eliminate choices \"Surprise\" (E) and \"Party\" (E), because if someone went to clown school, then they want to be a clown, not a surprise or party host. That said, choose \"Surprise\" (B) because it doesn't mention \"parties\" specifically, like choice \"Party\" (B). \n4. Finally, Eliminate \"Carnival\" (B) because you have the other \"C\" choice already in the answer choices, and we usually use \"Carnival\" to name this specific setting. Now, there is no \"B\", you can just choose \"A: Circus\" since \"circus\" means \"Carnival\" in this context.

Let' s eliminate some options that do not meet these criteria. \"Store\" (B) is not the answer because it's where one might expect to find pencils in general, not new ones. \"Cabinet\" (F) is not the answer as it would contain pencils akin to those one already has. \"Backpack\" (A) is not the answer either, as this does not provide a direct location one could go to. \"Teacher\" (D) is not the answer, as it's not the location to go for new pencils. \n3. \"Classroom\" (C) could potentially be a good answer. This option, however, could be confusing because one could be in a classroom without the teacher also being present. To eliminate this confusion, let's compare the two options further. \n4. \"Classroom\" does in fact match the question because \"classroom\" would also be the location one would expect to get pencils from the teacher.

Option B: \"office\" could also be the answer with a timeframe of \"9 hours\" because it is where workers work. Option C: \"car'' could also potentially be the answer as workers need transportation and workers aren't going straight home. Option D: \"water fountain\" could also be a potential answer because workers get thirsty and they could be getting hydration outside of their assigned locations (e.g. they aren't thirsty while working and thus they aren't arriving straight to \"office\" where they are assigned). \n02).

Let'll start with some things outside of the realm of the question, to rule out options that are not possible. The first one is \"Backery\", which is not an option. The next is \"Ham sandwich\" (B), which contains meat, but is not a place where meat can last a long time. \n3. Now we'll look at some possible locations where meat can last a longer time, though a bit further. \"Fridge\" (D) is a refrigerator, which is something where meat could last longer than its normal lifetime without going bad. \n4. Let's look at the \"Butcher shop\" (C) option more carefully. It does contain lots of meat, which meets the criteria of containing meat and lasting a long time, but perhaps not the \"longest\" possible time. The \"freezer\" (E) could possibly be kept a longer time.\n5. Finally we'll use one final option to narrow down the answer. \"Freezer\" (C) is an option that definitely has the longest-lasting meat products. All other options are not as strong and definitely can't last that long. \n6.

By the first choice, we know that if the phone breaks when it is dropped, we won't use it.\n3.) The second choice is also a good answer. If the phone stops receiving a cellular network connection it can't be used effectively. This is especially apparent if it occurs while you're using it.  \n4.) The third option is a valid answer to the previous question about dropping the phone and breaking it. You also wouldn't want to use the phone after it is stolen either.\n5.)

Therefore, the answer must be \"Sunday\".\nSo the final answer here is C: Sunday\n\nInput: In a game of scrabble, you do not want to see the word Eat  Choices:  A. eat B. cheat C. eat (again) D. eat the cheat  E. scream or eat  F. eat cheat \nOutput: The answer", "answer": "D: wakefulness"}
{"text": "1.) We want to make sure we take everything in context. First, we want to understand the situation described by the question. It says, \"If you're speaking with a lawyer about getting a _divorce_.\" The goal is to end a divorce. This means we are looking to end a married status. \n2.) With that in mind, let's look over all the options and see which do and don't make sense. \"Married\" (A) fits the description and is an option we can eliminate. \"Sister\" (B) and \"Cousin\" (C) would not be part of the divorce in this question. They are not relevant to the marriage status. \"Two People\" (D) is not a relationship status, so it's out. \"Lawyer\" (E) is a profession, not a relationship status or family member.\n3.) That leaves us with \"Being Married\" as the correct answer.\nSo the final answers is B: sisters.\n\nInput: What would be a place where it may be nice to take a rest? Choices: \tA: apartment \tB: hotel \t\tC: beach \t\tD: vacation house \tE: home\nOutput:\\ 1.) Let's evaluate each answer carefully. \t2.) First, the question asks for a place that may be nice to take rest. In the context of the question, rest means a break or period of relaxation. \t3.) The choices range from an apartment (A) to home (E). \t4.) None of the choices, however, refers to relaxation. In addition, \"beach\" (C) is only a place, not an activity, which we need to do. \t5.) \"E\" gives us relaxation and home, but also implies that these are both places that will be relaxing. While relaxation does occur in home, we need a more general option. \t6.) \"B\" gives us relaxation, a place, and hotels are places of relaxation. Therefore, the answer would be \"hotel\". \t7.) In other words, the correct answer is B: hotel.\nSo the final option is C: beach.\n\nInput: When was the last time you saw the movie, 'Jaws'? Choices:  a: before the", "answer": "A: being married"}
{"text": "1) Let's list the options out and understand what they're talking about. \n\nA: suicide - this is the correct answer because, when someone is very depressed, they might commit suicide. So suicide is specifically related to depression and death, but the question asks about a cause of death which is different.\n\nB: Overdosing- This is not the answer but rather something related to it. A person who is very depressed might overdose on drugs or alcohol unintentionally, but the root cause of death would not be depression. \n\nC: sadness - This is not the answer either. Depression is a serious condition that can lead to suicide or overdose, but it is also a possible cause of death. You can be depressed and die of other causes besides suicide. Therefore, sadness is not the answer here. \n\nD:Murder - This is not the correct answer either because someone who is very depressed could be murdered, but the murder would be a cause of their death. However, in this case it would not be the reason they died. \n\nE: Cyanide - Again, neither of these are the answer. This poison isn't inherently depressive, so could not cause death on its own. Plus, it would have to be ingested to cause death, which isn't necessarily a depressive act. \n\nIn sum, the only answer that can cause death because of depression is suicide (answer A).\nSo the final answer to the question \"What leads to someone's deat when they are very depresed?\" is A: suicide", "answer": "A: suicide"}

While all mammals care about a great many things in the world, it is unlikely that they care about specific individuals, and they certainly aren't likely to care about people who they are unfamiliar with.\n5. That leaves us with Choice A: Person. People have the capacity to care on many levels, whether about an individual or about a subject as an issue. They also can have the capacity to care about a whole species.\n6. Finally, note that \"artichokes have caring hearts\" (C) doesn't make sense because there isn't a \"caring\" equivalent for plants.\nTherefore, the answer is A.\nSo the final anser is A:person\n##Solution:2-13\nInput: What is a type of meat?

{"text": "1.) To answer this, let's first look at what each choice may indicate\n\n2.) For choice A: skin that is pinched might feel cold depending on where it is pinched. Skin can be pinched in different areas as well - such as fingers or in ankles if one is in poor physical condition. The choice is vague and does not directly indicate what will happen to skin.\n\n3.) For choice B: skin that is pinches will feel pressure. Again, the choice is vague and does this indicate either pressure being applied or released? We can answer either and as a consequence don't have sufficient information to determine what the correct option is.\n\n4.) For Choice C: pinched skin can feel bumpy in some areas depending on what the skin is rubbing against.\n\n5.) For choice D: pinched skin might itch due to inflammation\n\n6.) If these conditions are present then the skin might indeed feel clammy as a result.\n\n7.) Therefore, the answer is C: feel bummy.\n\nSo the final answer  is C: feel bummy\n\nInput: In what condition does one usually sleep? Choices:  a: at workb: at homec: asleep D: at church E: in class\nOutput: 1)Let's look at what each choice could mean\n\n2) Choice A: In which case is one usually sleeping? In the context of work, one is typically not sleeping but performing the duties of their position.\n\n3) Choice B: In which case is someone sleeping? Sleeping is an activity typically occurring during home time.\n\n4) Choice C: what is the condition of ones sleep? There isn't any more context here except for what has been provided which does not specifically refer to a location. The concept of sleep does not need a location in order to have meaning.\n\n5) Choice D: What is the time when one sleeps? Again, the context does not describe a location, just a time of day when sleeping.\n\n6) Choice E: Where does one sleep? This is the only possible answer as it indicates where someone typically sleeps, as opposed to another time of day or action like sleeping.\n\n7) Therefore, the answer is E: In class.\n\nSo the correct answer is E", "answer": "B: feel pressure"}

The word \"box\" indicates that it would be in a confined and isolated location, which would potentially mean a cat could feel more comfortable being around that location than the others.\n5.\"Therefore, the answer is A:\" box.\"\nSo the final answer with options A: box: box is A: box\n\nInput: How does a car move if the engine is not running?

The question is asking for what something is inside of, not where it is. E: deep grass does not quite match the question either. There are probably snakes in deep grass, but what about other things? A: Burlap sack works. If it weren't a burlap sack, snakes would be found in other places.\nSo the final answers are A: Burlap sacks", "answer": "A: burlap sack"}

The next month is November and it would place the person somewhere from the 1st to mid-28th (as the mid-date is 15th, which is the 14th for weekends). \n4: November 11th is the 16th day of the month, so when would be the next day of the year?\n5: Mid December is December 14th, so we'll need to find the closest date.

Let's discuss the dates first.\n7: December 13th is not possible because it's past the mid-date marker. But then we find there are no other days that could exist, because there are only 48 hours remaining in the year before New Year's Eve.

{"text": "1) The key to understanding this question is understanding the meaning of each term:\n- Traffic: The movement of people or cars\n- Expressway: A freeway with at least four lanes in each direction\n- Closer: A location which is nearer in spatial or directional terms\n- Any: A single, individual thing or event\n2) Thus, the question is asking what any thing or event can cause traffic, which gets worse, the closer you get to that thing or event. \n3) Consider each answer option. Only options A: michigan, B: map or C: american city can be a traffic clog because of the meaning of \"traffic\" from above.\n4) Options D: rest stops or E: country are not close to cars in terms of distance because they are far away.\n5) Therefore, the answer can be the two options which both involve an object that people can use to travel, with traffic getting worse, the closer you are to this object. \n6) Option A: michigan: Michigan has over six miles of expressways. In the context of the question, this would make traffic get more and more congested the closer you get to michigan state.\n7) Option B: map: Maps can have large amounts of details that would cause the closer you get to the map, the more complicated the traffic becomes. For example, a map could have numerous small details of things that would have traffic, such as traffic lights and other traffic slowing things. \nSo the final answer are: A: michigan and B: map\n\nInput: A: michigan B:-1 C: south D: america E: jersey f: us f. g: atlantic c: c e: b e: west\nOutput: 10.

{"text": "1) Let's eliminate some answers so it becomes easier to figure out which one matches the description.\n2) Option A: \"shake hands\" cannot be the answer because to shake hands you don't use your mind. This is a physical action.\n3) Option B: \"Control events\" is also not the answer because what does the question say? The people in class have to use their minds to come up with ideas.\n3. We then eliminate Option D, \"Think creatively\", because it is not using your mind in any way.\n4) Option E: \"Dress themselves\", is not the answer because this is only referring to the individual person and does not relate to the entire group.\n5) Now we are left with \"Control events\" and \"Think creatively\".\n6) To choose the correct answer, we will consider if the group of students could control events with their minds, or if they would have to think creatively in order to do that. If they could control events using their minds, then the correct answer would be the process of \"control events\", but if they would have to use their minds in order to control events, then the correct answer is \"think creatively\".\n7) Therefore, the answer is Option E: \"Think creativity\"\nSo the final answer was E: think creatively", "answer": "D: think creatively"}
{"text": "1.\"If you've thrown the rod\" means it has been put away or has been dropped.\n2. We eliminate options A and B because we throw the rod in the first place to fish so it doesn't make sense to say we've done damage to a fishing camp or a hardware store. This question is asking about a rod that is already being used, not for fishing-related purposes.\n3. We also eliminate option C, the engine, because the rod is being used to fish, not to try and get the engine to work.\n4. Option D, your spine, is a human spine, not a rod, and option E, the sporting goods store, is used for sporting good products, not for rods for fishing.\n5. Therefore the answer is E: the sporting goods store.\nSo the final conclusion is A:sporting goods store\n\nInput: When something is bumpy, does it usually look jumpy? Choices:  a: yes b: no c: no d: yes e: sometimes\nOutput: 1: It is important to determine if it might be in the form of a question when asked. \"When something is bumpy\" is not in the form of a direct statement, so \"does it usually look jummy\" is in quotations.\n2. If the question includes \"looks\" or \"sound\", it is not meant to be taken literally, as in the literal meaning of the word. \"Something looks bumpy\" or \"something sounds bumpy\" is more figurative than literal. We will eliminate options (a) and (b) because they are a direct response to the question.\n3. \"Jumpy\" (c) means to be jumping around in a repetitive manner and so it stands to reason that when something is \"bumpy\", it won't look jumpy. \n4. We determine that (d) - yes and (e) sometimes are the correct response.\nSo the final solution is B:no\n\nInput: Where will I be safe if I have a rocket launcher?

{"text": "1) To determine which choice the statement refers to, we must first understand the statement's meaning. In this case, kids are finding fish in their backy-yards, meaning that the fish are in their yards, not the yard itself.\n2) To further decipher the choice, we eliminate those that do not match the statement's meaning:  B: boat. Kids cannot take fish from the boat to their backyard.\n3) Similarly, choice C: pond cannot be the right answer because no child could find fish in their backyard while standing in a pond. \n4) Choices D: end of line and E: ocean cannot be the right answer either as they are too similar to choice C.\n5) We are left with choice A: \"boat\", which is the single choice that matches the original statement.\nSo the final answered is A: boat\n\nInput: Where do telemarketers come from? Choices: \tA: advertising B: telephone C: phone call D: telemarketing E: advertising campaign\nOutput: 1: To understand the question, let's first understand what a 'telemarketer' is. A telemarketer is someone who sells products over the phone by calling potential customers.\n2: To determine which choice best matches the answer, we will start by eliminating choices that are either obviously incorrect or irrelevant. Choice A: \"advertising\" is clearly incorrect because advertisements are not people.  Choice B: \"telephone\" does not make sense because telemarketers do not come from the phone.  Choice C: \"phone call\" makes sense because telemarketing is performed over the phone, but this choice is essentially the same as the original statement since calling someone over the phone is the same as telemarketing.\n3: Choice D: \"telemarketing\" is a type of marketing performed over the phone, so this is slightly similar but still incorrect and therefore cannot be the answer. Finally, Choice E: \"advertising campaign\" is the only remaining choice. Advertising campaigns are performed in many different mediums, including newspapers, television, and telemarketing over phone calls.\n4: Thus, the answer is E: \"advertisement campaign\".\nSo the final answer would be B: phone call.", "answer": "C: pond"}
{"text": "1:  Let us start by understanding what the question means and what it is asking.\n2: We can eliminate three choices from the start: \"Intimacy\" (E), \"changed behavior\" (D), and \"dry mouth\" (C). They do not directly relate to improving communication by changing an individual's perception of their conversation partner. \n3: Next, we should eliminate the first choice which is, \"hurt feelings\" (B). Communicating with others does not automatically lead to feeling hurt or unhealed. In fact, communicating with an objective in mind could help others and oneself to be less hurt. \n4: \"Communicating with others\" (B), by itself, needs to be elaborated. A more direct option is to achieve a better understanding of the other person and achieve the goal of understanding the other person's true thoughts, feelings, and intentions. This is the type of communication that many people have in mind when we talk about changing another individual's perceptions. \n5: We can thus conclude that the correct answer to the question, \"What are you hoping to do when you're speaking with someone?\" is B: communicate with others.\nSo the final answers is B: communicate with people.\n\nInput: After waking up from sleep, what are you probably not thinking about? Choices: \tA: sleep B: breakfast C: your day D: money E: lunch \nOutput: After waking up, a person is typically not thinking about sleep.\n\nInput: How would you spend your time once you've completed this puzzle?

{"text": "1.\"If your watching television and you accomplish nothing, what have you done?\" The correct answer is \"wasted time.\" The question is not phrased correctly, but if someone watches television and accomplishes nothing, then they have wasted the time that they were watching television.\n2. \"Getting fat\" (A) and \"falling asleep\" (E) are not accomplishments. Falling asleep involves losing consciousness and does not involve doing anything. Similarly, \"getting fat\" is not an achievement, but instead, something bad that one can avoid by remaining active.\n3. \"Typing words\" (C) is accomplishing something, but we're not trying to find what one accomplishes while watching television. \"Wasting time\" is not accomplishing anything and is the correct answer.\n4. So therefore, the answer will always be \"wasted time\" because \"getting fat\", \"falling asleep\", and \"typing words\" are not accomplishments.\nSo the final answers is C: typing words", "answer": "E: wasted time"}
{"text": "1) We will start by eliminating the choices which are not actions. We can eliminate \"eat in restaurant\" (D), because someone who is hungry could eat in a restaurant during lunch, but not in the middle of the day. We can also eliminate \"have lunch\" (E), because to have lunch, the time needs to be specified (morning, noon, evening, after dinner) and lunch is usually after dinner.\n2) Now let's eliminate choices that are either not mid-day actions or cannot even be taken during one's free time. \"Make bread\" (C), while a nice and delicious hobby, is too complex an activity to perform if you are hungry somewhere in the middle of the work day.\n3) Now let's examine the remaining options. \"Cook dinner\" (A) does not sound realistic during the middle of the day, because in this hypothetical context, one is not hungry for dinner. \"Make Bread\" (B) is very time consuming, and one would likely not feel like baking their own bread during the middle of the workday. \n4) Now our answer is left between (B) and (A). If one does make bread, they are likely to eat it in the afternoon or evening, and thus will not be hungry in the middle of the afternoon.\n5) We conclude that the correct answer is (B): Make Bread.\nSo the final solution is B: bake bread\n\nInput: What's an excellent source of food? Choices:  C: stapled into cereal  A: apple  B: potatoes  E: meat  D: rice\nOutput: 1: Let's begin by thinking about why someone would be choosing something for food. When we choose something for food, we should choose healthy options, and a major part of healthy is nutrition.\n2: Now let's rule out some answers that are not nutritious options. \"Stapled into cereals\" (C) is a food additive, \"apples\" (A), \"potatoes\" (B), \"meat\" (E), and \"rice\" (D) are individual foods. \n3: \"Meat\" (E) is not an excellent source of food because it is not nutritional, even though it is", "answer": "D: have lunch"}
{"text": "1) \"Where can peanut putter be stored?\" (B) is the phrase used in the question. Since this contains the word \"butter\", this is probably not the correct answer because the phrase does not include the word \"peanut butter\", which is what the question is asking about. \n2) \"Container\" (A) is a structure or vessel used to hold something. It is possible to store peanut butter in a container if it is made of metal or glass. \n3) \"Supermarket\" (C) is a large store that sells various products, including groceries. Some people may store their peanut butter inside their refrigerator. This may be true for some of the products they buy, but it wasn't asked for in the question that was given, so it's not the correct answer.\n4) \"Pantry\" (D) can refer to a kitchen cabinet that is for storing food items, including peanut butter. This may be the case, but again, we're only asked about one specific location, not all possible environments that could contain peanut butter, so it's also not the correct answer. \n5) \"Jar\" (E) is the correct answer because the question was referring to \"peanut butters\". Jars are containers that usually hold one specific type of food item or recipe ingredient. Peanut butter may be purchased from the supermarket and then placed into jars for storage. This is the correct location where peanut butter may likely be stored because jars are known to be used for storing nut butter products. \nSo the final answer us 1) E: Jar\n\nInput: Where is a person unlikely to find the right book for their essay?

{"text": "1.\"Let's begin by eliminating the choices that don't fit the bill.\" 2. Option E: restaurant does not fulfill the criteria of the prompt. A restaurant would be an establishment where people eat food together rather than a specific event such as a wedding. 3. Option A: wedding is not the answer as this would be in opposition to the description of wanting to spend a quiet evening. 4. Option B: friend's home would not fit as this would involve more socializing with someone and also is not associated with a specific event. There may be a wedding at a friend's home, but this is not mentioned in the prompt. 5. Option D: Movie is not specified as a specific event. Movies can be watched anywhere and don't necessarily require a formal social setting as do events such as weddings and parties.6. That leaves us with option C: internet cafe. This is the correct choice as an internet cafe is an example for a group of people to gather without any specific event. Also, it is not associated with a friend or family gathering such as a dinner.\nSo the final and the final answer is C: internet cafe", "answer": "D: movie"}

They are the characters themselves. Characters are fictional characters, not people.\n5) Choice B: \"refusing\" - This doesn't make sense because people cannot refuse to be there. They must be there, as we are discussing all the charachters being full of people.\n6) Choice C: \"saving money\" - People are not saving money. They are using it. Perhaps if you asked \"The man wanted... but all the charachers were saving money\", this might be correct.\n7) Choice D: \"sit down\" - We could have used the word \"sit\" instead of \"sit down\", but this is an important distinction as the question is asking about all the charachters, so it isn't referring specifically to people sitting down.\n8) Choice E: \"go outdoors\" - This makes no sense at all because we are discussing people being in the charachters. It isn't people going out of the charachters or outdoors. If we are referring to a group of people rather than a collection of charachters, then the word \"outdoors\" might be correct.\n9) The final answer is \"E: go outdoors\".\nSo the final answer\n\nInput: Where should I go to find the answer to this riddle?

{"text": "1. Begin by understanding the context and limitations of the question: \"If done correctly grooming (nails) generally does not cause this?\" (The emphasis on \"generally\" implies that it can happen.) \n2. As the question doesn't provide more direct answers, let's look at what could go wrong when you're grooming. \"Training\" (A) is typically a positive experience, and something that one generally wouldn't want to end. Similarly, \"satisfaction\" (B) isn't typically a bad thing in grooming. \n3. Next, we look at \"injury\" (C). An injury would indicate a negative outcome rather than the answer the question is asking for. \n4. Let's consider \"beauty\" (D). This isn't relevant for this question since the task is to groom animal nails, not human nails (i.e., \"How to get long beautiful nails\" would be another question). \n5. Lastly, we examine \"late\" (E). If someone is late, they've done something wrong or negligent. However, this is only true in an extreme situation, so we can rule this out. \n6. After considering everything, the correct answer is \"C: Injury\", since grooming is done with care and attention and there shouldn't be any injury involved.\nSo the final  answer is: C: injury", "answer": "C: injury"}

Choice B, pleasure, is a good answer if the person eats breakfast without making a mess. However, it could also be a negative answer if they make a mess or it is otherwise unpleasant. \n4. Choice 10.4 C, happiness, may be true if the person enjoys making breakfast in bed. Otherwise, it could also be false if the food is messy and they find making breakfast a chore. \n5. Option 10.5 D, contentment, appears to generally make sense but could vary if the person feels that they aren't doing something enjoyable. \n6. Finally, Choice 10, E, is an accurate and complete answer because every option on our list could be true after eating breakfast in bed, if you don't make a mess. \n\n7. 11.

The Judge did not take job lightly, so he did not take the part of the job light.\n3. Incarceration is the judge's way of punishing the man.\n4. So, A was incorrect.\n5. Let's move on, and look to see if B stands out from the rest.\n6. Death will result in the man's sentence. Death is not mentioned in the passage, so it is not correct.\n7. If the judge was light in some way regarding his job, he may not sentenced death to the man, however, he must sentence him for his actions. Thus, the man must be sentenced to jail.\n8.

{"text": "1: While she was in the hospital, my friend was thinking about good memories, like the massage she had on vacation. \n2. Let' s begin by ruling out the incorrect responses:\n3. 1) The answer is not \"dream\", because while asleep one cannot \"remember good times,\" as good times can only be experienced and remembered while awake.\n4. 2) The answer is not  \"knowing.\" The word \"knowing\" implies that she has gained information, which would not apply because she is merely remembering a good time. \n5. 3) The answer is not\" depression\" because the memory of a good action or situation is \"pleasant\"; while a memory of a harmful action or feeling is negative and would likely be termed a feeling of \"depression.\" \n6. 4)  The correct answer is, in fact, \"Pleasure,\" as the definition of \"practical\" is \"concerning benefit or good; helpful; profitable.\"\n7. 5) The proper response is not  \"nostalgia\" because in this context of remembering a pleasant experience, \"nostalgia\" would not be the appropriate response. Nostalgia is a \"sad\" or \"melancholy\" sentiment of longing for long-gone times.\nSo the final  answer is B: Pleasure.\n\nInput: In the woods, how can someone best keep from getting a bug or a virus?

It can be helpful to eliminate the options that would be inappropriate contexts to play a game. \n2).

This is because a play room is a dedicated place for playing games, and a family room can be a place where games are played, but it does NOT imply a dedicated room in the same way. \n4). \"Toy Store\" (A) is clearly not the answer because \"Toy Store\" is a retail environment where \"Toys\" are being sold, not a place where the action of buying a toy or games occurs.\n5). That leaves us with \"Bar\" (B), which is an environment where some table games can be played. However, \"Bar\" (B) is not the only answer as we can exclude \"Game Room\" (G), which is a dedicated space used only for playing games.\n6). Overall, the best answer choice is \"Bar\" (B). We might also be able to make a strong claim for \"Game Room\" (E), but the context of \"Play a game\" is most clearly associated with a \"Bar/Nightclub\".", "answer": "E: family room"}

Considering the wording, it's clear that a cliff does not fit the prompt.\nAnd finally option \"A\" (A) is the correct answer. In plain language, a giant hole would be known as a canyon which indeed describes a giant hole in a plain.\nSo the final result is A: Canyon\n\nInput: A man had a dream about a bird.

Option A: Satisfaction: You may feel good about finishing a run, or you may feel satisfied with your performance.\nb. Option B: Flying: No one can really achieve flight after running, so this isn\u2019t the correct answer.\nc. Option C: Sweating: You may sweat during or after a run, but this isn\u2019t a feeling.\nd. Option D: Falling down: While running can make you want to take a short rest, this is not the sense being described.\ne. Option E: Trip: This is the answer because someone usually trip when they feel they are about to have a fall.\nSo the final answers is E: trip\n\nInput: What is the difference between a book and a library? Choices: 1. One is a place to keep books. 2. One is a place not to keep clothes. 3. One is a place where people read. 4. They are not the same thing. 5. Option E\nOutput: 100%\n1: One is a place to Keep Books. This is not the correct answer because a library can keep books.\n2: One is a place not To Keep Clothes. This is not the right answer because a library can contain various items such as books, clothes and even food.\n3: One is a place where People Read. This is not the exact answer because some people do not enjoy reading at all and might dislike libraries.\n4: They  are not the same thing: That is the right answer. A library is where books are kept. A book is a thing that is read.\nSo the final anser is E, They are not the same thign\n\nInput: What does the prefix \"hypo-\" mean?

{"text": "1.\"What will\" is an action verb, so we can eliminate the options that do not contain this action verb. For example, \"learning\" (B) doesn't involve doing because you can learn without doing anything. We also can remove \"thinking\" (D), as this does not involve doing because if you stop thinking, you aren't thinking anymore. You also cannot \"see artifacts\", so the phrase needs to describe \"deciding\" whether to see artifacts. For those reasons, learn the answer \"seeing artifacts\" (C).\n2. As for what the question is asking, this question is asking about how to decide whether to see something. The answer is \"seeing artifacts\", not other actions, such as \"learning\", \"thinking\", or \"experiencing pleasure\". \nSo the final answer it C: seeing artifacts\n\nInput: Would I know him if I saw him? Choices: 2005 Choices:  A. a friend B. a neighbor C. a co-worker D. a celebrity E. a classmate\nOutput: 1\"Would I\" is an expression, so we can eliminate answers that do not have this expression. For example, \"If I\" is a different part of speech than \"Would I\", so that is not a correct answer choice. Similarly, \"Know\" is a verb, and an action phrase doesn't have more than one verb, and the second is not \"know\"\n2. Therefore, \"Would I know him if I\" can only refer to something that the speaker knows, such as a friend, a neighbor, a classmate, or someone they work with.\n3. An additional question to ask is:\n4. \"Know, as used in the sentence, has only one or two options\", so\n5. the answer is A: Friend.\nSo the final answering is:\nFinal answer Answer: Friend.\n\nInput: What doesn't a human need to become a successful person?

{"text": "1: Let's examine each response carefully in order to eliminate the ones that do not apply to this type of suicide.\n2: option A: suffering. This is not a reason a person would commit suicide because, from a person's perspective, when they are suffering, it is too painful to live and so they may choose not to live any longer.\n3. option B: happy. This is also not a reason a person could chose to commit suicide because, as stated above, a person may believe that being in too much pain to live is reason enough to end their life.\n4. option C: Avoid Problems. This is not a sufficient cause to choose to commit suicide since this type of depression is not about the desire to escape problems, but about the desire to escape the pain they are experiencing.\n5. option D: Unhappy. This is not a cause, as a person's feeling is not directly related to the choice to commit suicide.\n6. The only remaining option is E: End Pain. This is the sole acceptable answer as it is the most direct relationship to a person's desire to end their suffering, which is why they would choose to end their life.

Choices:  What: A: take break B: focus harder C: avoid temptation D: turn off phone E: ignore\nOutput: 1:\"Ignore\" (E) is the answer because ignoring distractions is one way to resist them.\n2.\"Tell boss\" (A) isn't the answer because we would probably get in trouble for being distracted on company time.\n3.\"Take break\" (B) wouldn't work for a distraction in the middle of a task, like looking on your phone, so it isn't the answer.\n4.\"Ignore temptation\" (D) might help in some situations, but it typically fails when the temptation is very strong.\n5.\"Focus harder\" (C) might be successful, but it is too focused on the distraction and not on the main task.\nTherefore, the answer is E: ignore.\n\nInput:I can find paper at several places.

{"text": "1: All options exclude \"expect to die\", so we can start there.\n2: The other choices are fairly straightforward. There are plenty of movies about canned or grilled foods, so this is a possibility. Many people have watched movies about corn.\n3: The final option is \"to eat\" so we can move on and consider the other options.\n4: Option \"D\" (\"people like to stay in\") sounds reasonable also, but \"people\" can mean humanity in general, a group of people, an individual, etc.\n5: Option \"C\" (\"people like to grill\") can't be the answer because the food being eaten is described as people liking to eat, not to grill.\n6: The answer is most likely \"E\", because watching movies about food or eating the food themselves is not the same as staying in.\nSo the final\nAnswer is E: eat corn.\n\nInput:If a person goes too far, what will they do? Choices:  C: nothing B: turn D: go E: panic\nOutput: 1) \"What will they do?\" means \"what actions will they take\", so \"nothing\" doesn't make sense. Also, the choices aren't directly related to actions but are states of being that a person could enter. \n2) \"Turn\" (B) doesn't make much sense in the sentence, because what is being asked is not really what actions will a person do. It is also hard to turn too far if you keep going in the same direction, rather than turning too far. \n3)\"Go\" (D) does relate to taking actions, but the turn would be an action that a bicyclist or car might take. Even in this case, a bicycle can't just keep going without \"going\" again. This makes going not appropriate for the sentence. \n4)\"Panic\" (E) is similar to staying too far, where a person hasn't done anything but has entered a state of being with no actions. \n5) This leaves \"B\" with the only remaining choice as the answer.\nSo the final Answer is B: turn\n\nInput: What's it called when you walk and talk at the same time?

{"text": "1 Let's tackle this question by understanding the question. \"Where can the legs of stool be built? The key here is \"built\". The question is asking where the stool legs are built in the actual building process, not where they might be found afterwards. \n2. Options A, B, and E appear to be related to jail, internet cafe, and bar concepts. The concept of these questions, however, is that they require you to think of construction and assembly, not places people might hang out. \n3. Option D involves a blacksmith's shp. While it can be a professional environment to build objects, it's not associated with stool building in particular. \n4. Option C, however, involves a building. This is the correct response because when stool legs are built, it would be common to include that activity in a building, such as a workshop.\nSo the final answers is C: building.\n\nInput:  What is special about a book that is being read? Choices:  (A) It contains information (B) It has words on a page (C) It contains text (D) It is open (E) It contains nothing\nOutput: 1 The key to the answer is in \"read\". Options other than A or D are incorrect because even a book with no words or information can still be read.\n2. Option A, \"contains information\", makes sense, although it is not truly the only item needed for reading.\n3. Option B, \"has words on a page\", is close, but it is not needed to read the book.\n4. Option C \"contains text\" is close again, but the same rule applies.\n5.

{"text": "1.\"What are students trying to accomplish?\" The question is asking about the purposes or goals of students, so we can determine the purpose of the students by examining who, what, where, when and why. These questions can help us figure out the purpose or what the students are trying to accomplish.\n2. Let us eliminate the choices that are not directly related with students. It is unlikely that a student would try to study \"philosophy\" (B) or that they would do this \"to become an adult\" (C). We also cannot answer by determining that a student is \"trying to ask a question\" (D), because this is also an activity of a student, not a purpose of a student. This leaves us only with the choices \"to further their education\", (E), and \"to study together\" (A). Which of the choices is answering our original question?\n3. Students often study together by furthering their education (E). Studying together enables them to further their education (E) since that is the focus of what they are accomplishing together. Therefore, the answer that answers our original question, \"What are students trying to achieve?\" is (E): further their education. Thus, the correct answer choice is E: further your education\n\nInput:  What might be the purpose of buying a new set of books? Choices: 1. A: Save money 2. B: Earn points 3. C: Learn content 4.

The goal of these questions is to determine which choice answers the question \"Why is the writer asking what they are asking?\"\n6. The purpose of learning new material is to \"EARN MORE POINTS\" or \"EARN MORE KNOWLEDGE\", but the question is more specific and asks \"What might be THE PURPOSE of buying new books...\" As opposed to \"acquiring more knowledge\", the question asks for a more specific purpose.\n7. \"Save money\" is not the purpose of buying new books because one", "answer": "D: further education"}

{"text": "1 Let's examine each option individually. \n2. Option A: sheath. The term \"sheath\" refers to a protective housing that keeps a sword in a safe, portable size. Therefore, it would be incorrect as, by definition, the sheath wouldn't contain any swords.\n3. Option B: sword closet. The term \"closet\" is generally defined as a small space for holding personal belongings. That could include swords, but also dresses, shirts, coats, etc. The question does not explicitly say \"in your house\". \n4. Option C: collection. The term \"collection\" does not describe a house, but a collection of belongings. If the question was asking about a person's house and said collection, we could deduce they were a collector who has this house. \n5. Option D: container called'scabbard'. A \"scabbard\" is defined as a sheath. Therefore, this choice is the same as A, since the scabbard doesn't contain any slices. \n6. Option E: museum. In a museum, swords aren't necessarily stored, but displayed. Therefore, swords would not be stored in the sword closet but in the museum. Since the question is \"in your house\", the correct option is C, as a person wouldn't store their belongings in a museum.\nSo the final is D: container\n\nInput: What would you do at the end of the day?

The ESB is well above any other building in the state, making it a tall building.\n3. Answer Choice B: Underground. The Empire State Building does not operate underground. It is a tall, sky-high tower which is visible from most locations within the city. \n4. Answer Choice C: High. The Empire State Building is considered high for two reasons: firstly, at 1450 feet tall it is indeed high above the ground. Secondly, it is one of the last remaining skyscrapers in the downtown of New York. \n5. Answer Choice D: Huge. This is not the correct answer because the ESB is by no means huge, it is of average size for a skyscraper. Furthermore, the building is not considered huge in comparison to the rest of the New York city skyline. \n6. Answer Choice E: Tall. Tall is the correct answer because it is synonymous with building, and the ESB is not underground or small. The ESB is an architectural marvel that can be easily described as tall by height alone.\nSo the final answers are E: tall and ESB: tall\n\nInput: How are things like a hiking trail or a roller coaster not the same?

{"text": "1) The answer is that he is burning down his house.\n2) The key is that the smoke detector would go off when burning down the house. This implies burning down his house is happening, as there would be smoke involved.\n3) The first thing to eliminate is that he is not stuck because of a fire. The last line says \"false alarm\", implying that it was not a real fire and he was not stuck because of one.\n4) The same can be said for having the fire burn the house down. The smoke alarm going off implies something is on fire, and therefore the house is most likely burning.\n5) There is no other logical reason why smoke detectors might go off, so this is not the answer.\n6) Finally, the last line says it is a false alarm, making an actual snow storm impossible, so this is not a valid answer.\n7) Therefore, the final answer is E: burning down the house.\nSo the final conclusion:\n\nHe was very frightened when smoke detectors went off but it was just a drill!", "answer": "C: winter storm"}

This is the wrong answer since woodworking does not typically result in getting paid to complete it. \n5. Option D, make money, could potentially be the answer but consider that woodworking is often done as a hobby, not a job. \n6. E, money, is not the right answer because this can only be answered if we are assuming woodworking done as a job, which is not always the case. \n7. Lastly, let's examine the choice that is left.\n8. B, frustration. While frustration may happen when doing any activity, woodworking in particular can potentially lead to frustration due to its physical nature and the possibility of mistakes. \n9. This concludes our examination, and the answer is B, frustration.\nSo the final answers are B: frustration\n\nInput: Why would you not want to use a crane? Choices:  The crane is a very useful piece of equipment that is used for a wide range of purposes, but there are some instances where you should not use it.\nOutput: 1) Cranes can be helpful tools, but there are times when they are not suitable.\n\n2) Consider a few reasons why you might not want to use a Crane.\n\n3) Option \"A: the crane is being used for a dangerous operation. This is not the case with this problem.\n\n4) Option \"B:the crane is not being used to its full potential.

That is not the case here.\nThe correct answer is Option \"E: the job is too small and does not require the use of a crane.\"\n\nSo the final answer as correct answers to these questions.\n\nWe have used", "answer": "A: blisters"}
{"text": "15. The question is asking John to name certain things that Jill faced, and the correct answer is \"ignoring.\" \"She faced a lot of ______\" The blank indicates that the person in question is facing a lot of one thing, and ignoring is the correct form of facing. 2. We can eliminate the other options by examining how they are not facing. \"Being rude\" would not be facing the same thing as ignoring. 3. \"Disparagement\" would not be facing, as it would be the act of making things worse, which is not the same as just facing. 4. \"Contumely\" would not be facing anything because it does not indicate acting directly towards something. 5. \"Uncertainty\" would not fit because the question is asking for how many other people treated Jill, and it is not specific to other people. 6. Therefore, the correct answer is \"Ignoring.\"\nSo the final answer I got by myself is C: disparagement", "answer": "C: disparagement"}
{"text": "1.\"The gambler had won a lot, so he wisely decided to cash in his winnings.\" The answer is C: cash in. The gambler wisely cashed in his winnings because to maintain his winning streak, he would have had to keep betting and gambling. This would have been riskier than cashing out and using the money. \n2.\"The gambler wisely decided to... cash it in. The answer is C: \"Cash in\". Compare the sentence to the choices.\n3.\"The gambler decided to cash in\" is not a choice because it implies that a decision was made to cash in. So we should disregard \"The\" in favor of just \"Cash in\", which is not a choice. \n4.\"The gambler returned his winnings\" is not a choice, because people don't return what they win. Therefore, we should disregard the \"return\", because it is a part of the sentence rather than a choice related to the sentence.\n5.\"The gambler was cashing in\" is not a direct choice, because the sentence does not mention that the gambler is \"cashing in\". Therefore, we should disclude this option.\n2. C: Cash in is the most direct choice, because the gambler cashes in his winnings.\nSo the final ansr is C: cash\n\nInput:What do you call somebody with glasses and no shoes?

{"text": "1.\"Let Blood\" is a treatment that an old-time doctor might have tried with leeches, not an accomplishment. It is possible the doctor might choose that as a treatment, but it is not a treatment that would have an accomplishment.\n2. \"Distance himself\" is unclear, but we have to eliminate some choices. If he \"distance himself\" from a patient (with leeches on them) then the doctor would not be able to try and accomplish anything. If the doctor \"distance himself\" from his patient and left the room, he could theoretically accomplish other things such as study, perform surgery, or allow the leeches to do their work - which would be an accomplishment.\n3.\"Perform surgery\" - this is an accomplishment if the doctor were performing surgery, but not if he performed surgery on himself or another person to allow the leeches do their work.\n4.\"Allow Blood\" is similar to \"let blood\" which is not an accomplishment. \n5. Therefore we must answer C. \"Study medicine\" would be an accomplishment if it meant the old-time doctor studied medicine. It could also be an accomplishment if the leeches were being used by the doctor as learning. For example, he might have leaches and he might have them biting him so he could get more info on diseases that they caused.\nSo the final letter is C: Study\n\nInput: Where does a person eat while standing? Choices: \tA: car B: bench C: chair D: bus E: office\nOutput: 1.) Let's first eliminate some of the choices because they are not reasonable places for the person to eat. \"Office\" is probably not a logical option even if the person were standing up and doing desk work. A desk is not the place a person would stand and eat food.\n2) \"Bus\" would not seem like a place to eat for standing because it does not usually have a place to sit. We could conceivably be talking about some sort of self-service vehicle where the person bought something to eat and it didn't come wrapped then they just ate it on the bus, but it's not probable.\n3) The person is likely not eating on a \"Chair.\" If they were eating on a chair, it simply is not a standing environment. \n4) \"", "answer": "E: let blood"}
{"text": "1. The options are:  A: bouncing the ball; B: competing; C: having fun, D: racing; and E: scoring points. \n2. There must be an option for bouncing the ball because one would do that as preparation for competing.\n3. There must be an obvious option for competing. Anyone who can read would assume competing.\n4. There must be an unambiguous option for having fun. Some people don't like competition or want to be serious. \n5. There should be an option that does not require a ball. Some people play sports competitively without a ball.  \n6. There must be an appropriate option for scoring points.\n7. In conclusion, competing, racing, and scoring points are all reasonable answers. However, having fun is too vague, and bouncing the ball isn't as meaningful without competition or to score points. Therefore, the winner is Competition \nSo the final answer will be Competition\n\nInput: What comes after the fourth letter of the word \"nurse\"? Choices:  A. G B. S\nC. H D.

The most significant option for getting maximum return is a quarter. This is the option that takes the least effort to achieve. The other options would take more effort: penny, 5 cents, and buck.   \n3. Buck takes 1 full day to finish.  \n4. 5 Cents takes 8 hours.  \n5. Quarter takes 1 hour.\n6. Therefore, the answer should be a quarter.\nSo the finals answer is D: quarter.\n\nInput: In the last paragraph, who are we talking about? Choices: 1. The president\n2. The congressional aides\n3. The White House staff\n4. The bureaucrats working for various agencies\nOutput: 1,", "answer": "E: score points"}

{"text": "1.\"The answer might be that James lives in a different place than that of a tower?\" - No. James can only live atop the top of the tower and he does not have the option to move to an additional location.\n2.\"The answer might be a castle that is a very tall building.\" - No. James could not simply live atop a castle that is a tall building because he would not be atop the top of a tall building.\n3.\"He lives atop the top of his tower. The \"top\" portion of the question indicates that James lives atop the top and not atop something on the ground.\" - The answer would be the tower, but the words the author uses \"atop the top\" does not limit James to living only atop the top of that top. James could in theory be living atop a top located on some random object on the ground.\n4.\"James could not be living in radio station, because they don't have a top, and also because he doesn't work at the radio station.\" - James could in theory be working at the radio station.\n5. \"A city has a lot of towers, so the answer could be a city.\" - Cities can have a lot of towers and they certainly did in the Medieval times that this story takes place. James is not living in a large metropolis by any means, so the answer of \"city\" could very well be correct.\n6. \"A medieval castle could have tons of towers, so that could be the answer because James lives in a castle.\" - Again, it could be a castle, but if so, it would not have to be a traditional Medieval castle. James might live in a castle that was rebuilt or resembles the original Medieval castle.\n7. \"James could be living atop a tall object, or atop a tall building.\" - Possibly, but it would have to be a building tall enough and also have a top.\n8. \"The answer might be 'tall tower, but the question doesn't say that James lived in a tall tower, only on a tall tower.\" - Yes. The answer must be a tall tower. That is the answer. It is not the author's intent to confuse the reader by leaving off the word \"tall\" in the final sentence.

{"text": "1) This is a short question so the answer is the only possible answer.\n2) No other answers fit the sentence.\n3) The word 'write' means making with a writing tool; writing on a page. In the first line, the sentence is written in capital letters to emphasize the importance of what is being said. The next sentence has the same idea, but the use of 'check' is to specify where the clerk put the check.\n4) The clerk is putting the check where the person writing the check is at that same time. This is to do with communication and being able to return to the original place they were written together with the clerk.\n5) The word clerk was chosen by the writer to make clear who is being referred to through the use of different terms and a few adverbs.\n6) The word 'clerks' is to make clear that the person doing this to one person, does the same thing again with the next.\n7) The phrase 'throws money away' was chosen by the writer because of the idea of losing something and not knowing where it goes. The phrase'stupid and lazy' emphasizes not knowing where it goes but also not caring even though it is such an important thing that it is being done by the clerk.\n8) This question has two parts: the first is about where a person writes a check and the second is where they put them. The first part says the check is written and put in place by clerk. The final part says that if one doesn't know the answer to their question, they will never get anywhere because they could be very busy not knowing anything.\n9) So this sentence means that if one wants to be successful in business then it is important to learn about these things quickly.

This choice implies that the musician is shopping for music instruments or getting some type of assistance with playing music instruments.\n3. Group B: Orchestra/Music Ensemble. This group implies that the musician performing the concerto is part of a group, such as a symphony orchestra, and is performing a pre-arranged piece, such as a concerto.\n4. Group C: Jazz Band/Music Ensemble. The choice of \"Jazz Band\" implies that the musical performance will have a more improvisational element, which may be characteristic of Jazz music.\n5. Group D: Rock Band/Music Ensemble, implying that the musical performance would be more fast-paced and may include Rock elements.\n6. Group E: Music Studios/Music Instruments/Music Ensemble.  This implies that the performance may involve a mix of instruments or a studio recording with various instruments.\n7. Therefore, the question ultimately revolves around the choice between \"Orchestra\" and \"Rock Band\".\n8. Choice \"Rock Band\" is a very specialized performance that would likely be reserved for more established musicians that are performing at a prominent local venue. Choice \"Orchestra\" would be appropriate for many kinds of musical talent and are more likely to perform a conerto for clarinet in a concert hall or auditorium.\n9. Thus, the final answer is A.

{"text": "1.\"Which word are you expecting for the cat?\" If you are expecting a cat to say any of these words, you would expect it to be \"hello\"(C), \"drink water\"(D), or \"meow\"(E). To give the opposite side of the argument, you would expect the cat to say \"see king\"(B), but it's unlikely, considering that you have not previously seen a cat say that.\n2.Next, let's compare the definitions of cat and meow. \"Cat\" is the name of a certain animal, while \"meow\" is a certain sound made by that animal. Since the definition of a meow is tied to the definition of a cat, there is a good chance that a cat will choose to say meow.\n3.Finally, if you are expecting anything else, the most logical answer is \"live many years\" (E), since this is typically the case for cats.\n4.Therefore, the answer is E: live many years. \nSo the final answer  is E:live many years\n\nInput: Where are you more likely to see a blue bird?

We can't use the clock face with no hands to set time to any specific time. We're only allowed to use the dial on the face to set the hour. 3. Watch: \"3: watch\" The watch needs to be worn to tell the time. We can find the time on a digital watch, but there is no way to view the time on a watch without hands, so the answer is watch. 4. Wall: \"", "answer": "E: rain forest"}

{"text": "1. The question asks what is likely to happen to one's speech, not what can happen.\n2. Options A and B are impossible because people don't express regret when they are drunk, nor do they express themselves through automobile accidents.\n3. Option C is eliminated because drinking and driving is likely to happen to a person who is drunk, not to the speech of that person.\n4. Similarly, option D is also not likely because talking nonsense is not the only thing that can result from drunkenness; there are also many other potential consequences as well. \n5. That leaves us with two choices that may not happen but are likely, especially if alcohol is consumed in large amounts: option E, \"talking intelligently,\" where people may get too drunk to continue having intelligent, coherent conversations, and option F, \"lose control.\"\n6.

{"text": "1 and 2: The first option is obviously not applicable, as this person is not only listening to music, they're wearing headphones. Therefore, the choices can be narrowed down to A, B, C, and D. \n3. There are plenty of good reasons why someone would wear headphones but not listen to any music. For example, if someone were trying to block the background noise they would need to hear, as well as ensure that anyone nearby them could not hear what they are listening to. \n4. Let's eliminate choices D and E, since they are contradictory. \"C\" states deafness, and this person is clearly listening to music. \n5. Let's eliminate \"C\", because it is also related to music. \n6. Since \"C\" cannot be the answer, only \"A\" and \"B\" remain. \n7. \"A\" states the person might fall asleep, but if they are wearing headphones, the amount of background noise that gets around them is increased, making it near impossible for them to fall asleep in the first place. \n8.

{"text": "1. Begin by eliminating all options that answer the question differently than expected. \"Believing in a god\" (B) is something that everyone can do, so it doesn't answer the question specifically. The same can be said for \"Eating meat\" (C). \"Sun themselves\" (D) makes no sense here. \"Eating plants\" (E) likewise does not answer the question. \n2. That leaves us with the options with a relation to vegetarianism. The idea is that a vegetarian will have more time to eat plants than meat because their diet doesn't include meat. This is reflected in both \"gain wealth\" (E) and \"eat plants\" (E) that all have a relation to vegetarian diets and time management.\n3. Comparing them, we can see that \"eat plants\" is closely related to a vegetarian diet, while \"gain wealth\" is simply a generalization that isn't directly tied to a food choice. \n4. Thus, the answer to this question is E: Eat Plants.", "answer": "E: eat plants"}
{"text": "1. Start by understanding the question. The question implies that humans reproduce intentionally, unlike a bear's reproduction, which happens by accident. Also, a bear may sit down while having sex just as a human would.\n2. Eliminate options that aren't directly related to reproduction, such as having sex (C). \n3. Let us consider the remaining options carefully. Eating ice cream (B) does not need to involve intentionally desiring to reproduce. As such, this option is not relevant. \n4. We can eliminate the option of hearing sounds (E) because hearing sounds is not the only way humans reproduce. We can also hear sounds while making mistakes (D), so the option of hearing sounds in its own is not necessarily required for reproduction.\n5. Finally, we are left with three remaining options (sit down, make mistakes, eat ice cream). We can eliminate sitting down (D) because humans must physically stand up and walk around in a standing position to walk to a woman and start reproducing.\n6. We also can eliminate eating ice cream (E) because sitting down and making mistakes are not exclusively ways humans reproduce. Eating ice creams can also occur while neither sitting down nor making mistakes.\n7. Lastly, we can eliminate the option of making mistakes (D) because humans do not exclusively reproduce when they make mistakes. Therefore, it's possible to reproduce without making mistakes. In other words, humans reproduce in other ways in addition to making mistakes.\n8. Therefore, the answer must be \"Sit down\". We reproduce primarily when we sit down, and it would be absurd to sit down in order to reproduce otherwise.\nSo the final choice is D: Sit down\n\nInput: When I want to eat, what do I do when there are too many options to choose from?

Monkeys are known for their natural environment, which is dense, tropical forests in places like Asia and Africa. \n3) While monkeys live in rainforests, there are no trees to top as that is specifically an area above the treeline, so we can eliminate option B: tree tops (E).\n4) It is unlikely that a monkey would be found in zoological gardens (C), as this has much less of a jungle feel than they are used to being found in, and not particularly common.\n5) An animal wouldn\u2019t naturally spend time in the great outdoors (D), but that would be an odd situation, so we will leave it.\n6) It is very typical for monkeys to be found in zoos (E). Zoos use a lot of trees, which is like their native habitat. Additionally, zookeepers will feed monkeys and interact with them, as they do in the wild.\n7) Although there are zoos worldwide, the first zoological gardens had their origins in France, so we can eliminate (C).\n8) That leaves us with 2 answers: (B) rainforest and (E) zoo.\n9) So the final answer is E: zoo\n\n#!/bin/bash \n\n[[ \"$1\" = \"help\" ]] && \nusage=\"Usage:./answer.sh [<question number>\"\nif [[ \"true\" = \"$1\" ]]; then \necho \"$usage\"\nexit 1\nfi", "answer": "A: tree tops"}

The cause (what causes people to drive recklessly) must be answered prior to answering the question. \n2. \u201cDriving recklessly\u201d can have several effects. The main ones include injury, fatigue, traffic jams, and accidents. \n3. Traffic jams are caused by people driving recklessly. Traffic jams would not occur if people were not driving recklessly, so this is not the answer.\n4. Fatigue is another effect of reckless driving and is unlikely to be the cause. It is difficult to determine whether fatigue is caused by reckless driving or vice versa, as fatigued drivers may drive recklessly. Moreover, fatigued drivers and reckless drivers share many other causes.\n5. Accidents are sometimes caused by reckless driving. However, other causes can lead to accidents, including weather conditions, a broken down vehicle, bad road, or animals, and reckless driving can also lead to accidents, depending on the circumstances. In conclusion, \u201cReckless driving leads to accidents\u201d.\nSo the final answer will be Accidents\n\nInput: Why do some countries have large farms?

Choices B, C, and E are not sufficient. \"Countertop\" or \"Counter\" (C) are both possible locations for a teakettle, but they are not unique to this option. \"Cupboard\" (B) can also be used for storing a teakettle. And, it isn't exclusively a British term like \"England\" (E) suggests.\n3. So how about \"Hardware Department\"? Well, teakettles do indeed sometimes reside in hardware departments. However, not all hardware departments are teakettle stores, so the correct answer isn't simply hardware store.\n4. But, what about \"Water\"? A teakettle could indeed be stored at or next to a body of water, but this is not the answer because the question asks for the location as a physical object, not an abstract location.\n5. For our last answer, we'll start by eliminating those that don't fit. \"England\" (D) fits the prompt because it asks for the location, but it isn't necessary because the teakettle is an object being stored and not the location of the object.\n6.

The most likely option is this, because electricity may be involved in the company, and that could be related to the connection. \n5) Option D: Wall. This is unlikely, because electrical connections are found in wires that run through walls, so there's a chance there may be a connection.\n6) Option E: Airport.

{"text": "1: The sentence \"We were having a can drive\" implies a community event, such as a food drive. Therefore, option B, the cellar, which implies at a residence is incorrect as canned food is usually consumed by the public. \"Can drive\" can also be taken to mean the vehicle through which the food is brought to the drive, so that leaves us with options A (shelf), C (refrigerator), and D (cupboard).\n2. The sentence \"I needed to pick up some canned food contributions\" implies someone who is making a canned food donation. From here we can eliminate B (cupboard). The cupboard is for storing food and doesn't contribute canned food to the drive. After that, we can eliminate C (refrigerater), as the refrigerator wouldn't be used to pick up the food, but to store it. Lastly, we can eliminate D (grocery store) as the grocery store is the location through which the food is typically purchased and not picked up.

An effective method could be shouting louder. However, this requires an adult person, as it is a loud, obnoxious, and intimidating action.

Envy is not an expectation because there is no reason for spectators to envy a sport.\n2) B. Resentment is the correct answer because if the teams are evenly matched, then the competition will be too close for comfort. The outcome could be either win or not even score.\n\nSo the final answer will be B. resentment", "answer": "C: winning or losing"}
{"text": "1.\"Thrown together\" is the phrase to understand here. It means the various places he could look that are not near America. This implies a multitude of places. \n2.

B: \"Hawaiian waters\" or \"Gulf of Mexico\" could be fish markets that are specific regions, but this information is being left out. \n5. C: \"Tropical sea\" is a fish market, but it doesn't mention the specific location. \n6. D: \"South Pacific Ocean\" is too general and does not pinpoint any particular fish market.\n7. Lastly, we have \"Johnny was looking for...\" which tells us we're searching for a fish market in a place near it. \n8. Evaluating the answers again, this leaves us with \"Tropical sea.\" The answer choice is specific enough to determine it's the correct answer.

{"text": "1) Let's go through all of the choices for this question, starting with the ones that would not work. A: mobile phone - Smartphones are commonly used by people to calculate, and have become the standard, but in the past a tiny calculator wasn't found in mobile phones. B: wristwatch - A wristwatch can be very helpful, but calculators cannot be used on a wristwatch. C: briefcase - a briefcase is great for transporting documents, books, and many objects, but it is not good for carrying around a calculator. D: office - An office is a place to work, and a person would likely need to leave their desk in order to use a calculator. Therefore, a person would likely not be able to use a calculator in their office. E: desktop - A desk is a similar situation to an office, in that it is a location to work where a calculator is unlikely to be used, but a desk is slightly better, as a user can easily step away from their desk for a moment to use a calculator, whereas they may have trouble leaving their office for long periods of time to do the same. \n2) The three remaining choices then can all be eliminated, as none of them is the correct answer. While smartphones came about much later than calculators, the idea of having calculators in a smartphone was first brought by Apple in 1984.\n3) Therefore, the answer to this question is D: office.\nSo the final answers are D: office\n\nInput:\"What Is A Bird Call?\" This is a difficult question.

However, this option implies someone who lives close to them.\n3. Option B: This seems obvious to meet a friend at a bus station. However, this choice implies someone who lives close by and is meeting them on foot.\n4. Option C: It is easy to see how someone would meet at a social atmosphere such as a cafe, bar, or club. It would not be necessary to go on foot and the distance is generally short enough for public transportation.\n5. Option D: This is the best answer because going to a neighbor's house to meet someone can lead to a short walk, and the distance is generally too far for public transportation. \n6. Therefore, the answer would be D: Neighbor's house.\n\nInput: Which of the following is not possible to build with a brick and mortar? Choices:  a: cathedral b: church c: temple d: store house e: house\nOutput: 1: Let's analyze each answer individually.\n2. The first answer is \"a Cathedral\", which is a large building specifically built for the worship of a deity or deities and is not possible to build from brick and mortar.\n3. The second answer is \"b Church\", which is a space to conduct Christian services and is also not possible to build from bricks and mortar.\n4. Similarly, \"c Temple\", which is a holy building connected to a specific religion, is not possible to build using bricks and mortar either.\n5. The fourth answer is \"d Store House\", which sounds like it could potentially be a possible building, but we can see that it clearly refers to a brick walled building that would not be made from brick and mortar material.\n6. The final answer is \"e House\", which is a human dwelling made primarily out of bricks. Given that bricks and mortar are the same material, it is obvious that a house could be built using this material.", "answer": "D: neighbor's house"}

It can be found anywhere or any place inside the apartment.\n3.) In the kitchen, it's most likely that dishes would not be stored on books (as opposed to other stuff). \n4.) In the living room, it's certainly possible to find books or newspapers or other reading materials, but there is rarely books or any other reading materials in the kitchen and dishes are definitely stored there. \n5.) Inside the apartment, books may or may not be stored but dishes are definitely stored. \n6.) Inside the pantry, it's certainly true that books and dishes are stored; but, it's easier to store dishes there than it is to store books there. \n7.) Books can be found on the shelf.\n8.)

{"text": "1- Begin by reading the question and deciding what the answer could be. In the question, the parents are yelling, which is clearly not a sign they are doing any of those things for the children. They are instead trying to make the children listen to them, which is similar to controlling. However, it is not controlling in the sense that they are trying to control the children with force or authority. Instead, they are trying to guide the kids to do the right thing and obey their parents. Therefore, the correct choice is B: guide children.\n\nInput: I know many people with a love for learning. What is that love rooted in? Choices: 1. A: wanting to increase knowledge 2. B: enjoyment of learning 3. C: ability to have time 4.D: to make money 5. E: ability to be happy\nOutput: 1) When we answer a question, it is helpful to think of what the question is asking rather than the choices that are being proposed. For example, here the question is asking what is \"love rooted in\". Let us consider each choice. 2) \"Wanting to increase knowledge\" is not a motivation to learn, it is a state that can be present when one knows a lot. For example, you could know a lot about a subject from studying it and then want to increase your knowledge in that subject further. In conclusion, choice 2. is incorrect. 3) \"Enjoying to learn\" is not \"rooted in\". Enjoying learning is an emotion that can be present as you learn but it does not explain \"what love is rooted in\", which is why choice 3. is also incorrect. 4) The question states that people love learning which would make it likely that they have \"time to learn\", as learning has to occur at some point. However, \"having time\" is not the only motivation someone can have to learn something. Choice 4. is therefore incorrect. 5) This is similar to one's ability to be happy. Having the ability to be happy while learning does not explain what is rooting love for learning. Therefore, choice 5. is also incorrect. The correct choice is 1. \"Wanting to have knowledge\" because that is what is rooting the love of learning.\nSo the final question 1) I know many people witha", "answer": "C: control children"}
{"text": "1) First let's eliminate options that are not related to a beauty salon: \"City\" (B), \"Strip mall\" (C), \"Neighborhood\" (D)\n2) Next, let's look closer at the remaining choices. \n3) To better understand, let's use an online reference for information. Here is the definition of a beauty salon from Wikipedia.org: 4) \"A beauty salon or beauty parlor (beauty parlour), or sometimes beauty shop, is an establishment dealing with cosmetic treatments for men and women.\" 5) This definition excludes \"Clerk\" (D) since, when given the context of the question, one would not reasonably equate \"clerk\" with \"salon\" (as per the definition above). \n6) Now we examine \"Rooster\" (E) to see if it fits the context of the question. A rooster is a type of bird, and the beauty salon context suggests that the answer should be a human being that performs services for human beings.\n7) Therefore, the answer is \"Beauty parlor/salon employees\".\nSo the final answer  is C: beauty salon employees\n\nInput: How do many of us go to a store? Choices: A: on the street B: by car C: by bicycle D: with a friend E: at home\nOutput: 1: \"On the street\" refers to walking to something.\n2: \"By car\" is how people travel long distances/far, but not how they go to a store.\n3: \"By bicycle\", while used to travel short distances and for exercise, is not how most people get to a store.\n4: \"With a friend\", while often the case, is not necessarily how people go to a store and wouldn't be specifically answered in a question that focuses on how people go to a \"store\".\n5: \"At home\", is not something that would be answered in a question about going to a store.\n6: The only correct answer as per the given information is \"BY FOOT\".\nSo the final statement is: \"You can go to the store by foot\"\n\nInput: What animal is an armadillo?

{"text": "1 Let's look at each answer choice closely to determine the correct answer.\n2. Option A: While complications could be a feeling that could cause one to institute civil action, it's not the most direct feeling that could cause this.\n3. Option B: Similarly, the answer cannot be tiredness because that would cause a decrease in willingness to institute civil action and not an increase.\n4. Option C: The answer cannot be anger because anger is an emotion felt in response to some provocation and would not necessarily cause one to institute action (although it could).\n5. Option D: \"Trials\" is the next closest choice as a trial could indeed be an outcome after instituting civil action.\n6. The final option is choice E: \"Court cases\". This is the correct answer as court cases can be the outcome of civil action, which propels individuals take action in the first place.\nSo the final answers is E: Court case\n\nInput: What is an appropriate place to find the best possible answer to a question?\nChoices: A: homework B: study C: classroom D: examination\nOutput: Let's examine each potential answer choice to determine the best one.\n1. Option A: \"Homework\" indicates the right answer should be found in the context of doing homework or an assignment. \"Homework\" cannot be a potential answer because homework assignments usually don't have answers. They have questions or exercises to complete.\n2. Option B: \"Study\" is similar to homework but doesn't have a clear answer.\n3. Option C: While a classroom might be a place to complete homework, it would not necessarily be the place to find the best answer if it exists.\n4. Finally, we examine Option D: \"An Examination\". This is the most direct answer choice as examinations test someone's knowledge and a student would likely refer to a previous examination for the best answer.\n5. Therefore Option D, an examination, is the correct answer. \nSo the final answer the final answer is D Examination.\n\n### Input: Answers the following short answer question. \nInput: Why does my computer keep acting up?

Option E: India is in the north east but would not be the answer because while associated with temples, they would not be known to everyone in the world as the Middle East temple would be. \n7. Given that none of the options are exactly what the question wants, we will have to combine them to arrive at the correct answer.\n8) Jerusalem is in the Middle East, so we'll combine A and B.\n9) Thus, the answer is B: Texas.\nSo the final answers would be Texas", "answer": "A: jerusalem"}

The helm is not the thing that moves the masts, rather, it controls that. Therefore, we need to decide on a correct answer. \n3. Option A: is not correct as a sailing vessel does not have a helm. This is obvious based on the question wording. \n4. Options B and C: do have a helm, but B is not a paddleboat, even though it has propulsion by hand paddles, and not C which is a ship. \n5. Option D: is clearly a motorboat, in which case the helm is where the person controls steering through a motor and helm is not the object. \n6. Option E: is a tugboat which has a steering system and not the masts, so it is not the helm. \n7. Therefore, the answer we arrive at is option D: motorboat.\nSo the final  answer is D: motorboat\n\nInput: What happens after the word, \"surely!\"? Choices: 1. A:  Yes sure 2. B: Of course you do 3. C: Do you think so? 4. D: You should know 5. E: That's quite sure\nOutput: 1: This is an example of antonyms, meaning that the choices are the exact opposite of one another. For clarity, we can separate out the answers by which one is positive and which one is negative, making them 1 and 2 respectively.\n2: We must be careful when evaluating our options to decide if they are positive or negative, since there is a 2 in a negative answer, though one of the negative answers is also positive.\n3: We use the word \"so\", which should help you decide which choice is true. 4: Similarly to 3, we use the word \"quite\" to decide the answer. 5: Finally we use the word \"surely\", which can be both positive and negative.\n\nWe can now begin answering the choices:\n1.

Therefore, neither of these answer choices are correct.\n4.\"Humming\" is the sound that the mosquitoes make.\n5.\"Humming\" and flying insects both describe the insects, so neither of the answer choices are correct. \n6.\"Humming\" refers to the sound the insects make, not to the quality shown by them.\n7. Thus, flying insects cannot be their own quality shown, and flying insects cannot be humming, because humming refers to a quality shown by those insects.\n8.\"Happy\" is not a quality of the flying insects, as it would be unlikely for mosquitoes to be happy.\n9. Thus, the flying insects are making humming sounds, which is the correct answer.\n\nSo the final answer by correct answer: flying insects are making the humming sounds.", "answer": "B: buzz"}

To understand the ways the family could be playing cards, let's take a look at each answer choice. \n3. Choice A: It could be that the family is playing cards for amusement. This possibility is eliminated because this type of activity does not require the family to be related. \n4. Choice B: It could be that they are playing cards to lose money. If they were playing cards that way, it would not make much sense to have a family. \n5.Choice C: It could be that charmed by cards. The family could be so enamoured by the activity of playing cards that they decide to play for a short time and then go do something else. \n6. Choice D: It could be that family is having fun playing cards. This makes the most sense of all the answer choices because we can infer that the families goal in playing cards is to have fun, which makes sense if they are related enough to be in the same family. \n7. Choice E: family members might be playing to win money. However, that can be accomplished in a number of other ways, such as by playing a sport. \n8. Comparing all of this, answer choice E, winning money, stands out as the most viable option.\nSo the final  answer is E: win money\n\nInput: What is a group of mice?

Next, let's compare each answer choice.\n3. Choices C: cheese and D: cheedle both refer to food items. They can't be the answer because a group of mice doesn't necessarily include mice's favorite foods. \n4. A family, as mentioned above, refers to a group, so that's not an option.\n5.

The same is true for \"Binder\" (C), which refers to an office supply. \n4. The same is true as for the term \"Living Room\" (D). This is not the kind of divider they are asking about. \n5. The same goes for \"Office Suit\" (E).\n6. Therefore, \"Office Suite\" (E) is the correct answer because it is an office type of divider as indicated by the context of the question, where they are referring to educational and office settings.\nSo the final answe is E: office suite\n\nInput: There are many things people are used to when they reach a certain age. Choices:  A> Cake B> Marriage C> Job D> Babies E> Maturity\nOutput:1.We need to dissect the choices to arrive at the correct answer.\n2.\"People are used to things when they reach a certain point in their lives.\" Here we see that there are many things that one can be \"used to\" when they reach a certain stage in life. \n3. Option A: \"Cake\". This is not a choice. Option A is the key to the entire question. It is referring to one specific thing \u2013 cake \u2013 that is associated with getting older.\n4. Option B: \"Marriage\". While people are used to marriage by the time they are older, the option refers to marriage and other specific things that people encounter when they are older, as opposed to being the key answer to the entire puzzle.\n5. Option C: \"Job\". This choice is also incorrect as it is not associated with an age range; instead, it is part of daily routine.\n6. Option D: \"Babies\". Although people are used to babies when they are older, they are not necessarily used to all babies; this answer refers to babies in general, as opposed to being an answer to the entire puzzling", "answer": "B: binder"}

Choices: \tA: people B: birds C: animals D: deaf people E: dogs\nOutput: Begin by eliminating choices with a sense of smell. People (B) have a sense of smellers dogs (E), do as well so the first choice to strike from the question.\nNow consider the remaining alternatives. \"Birds\" cannot have a sense of smells since they cannot communicate through scents.. Animals (D) and deaf people (C) both don't have a sense of smelles, so we have eliminated all of our possible answers that contain a sense of smell..\nOption D: animals do have a sense of smolle and deaf people do not have a sense of olfaction, so the last option to rule out is E: dogs.\n\nInput:Who amoung three people is the shortest? Choices: 1: A: person from Texas\t2: B: person from China\t3: C: person from Alabama\t4: D: person from Minnesota\t5: E: person from Wisconsin\nOutput: This is a simple math question. The person from the state with the lowest population would be the shortest,so the answer is B: person from China.\n\nInput: Which state has the third highest population?Choices:  A: Arizona \tB: Texas \tC: Kansas \tD: Wyoming \tE: Hawaii \tF: Florida \tG: Virginia \tH: North Dakota\nOutput: This is also an easy math Question.

To operate the car.\n2. To start the car.\n3. To accelerate the car.\n4. To decelerate the car.\n5. To slow down the car.\nOutput: 1: The car battery is used to start the car, to operate the car, and to slow down the car. It does not accelerate the car nor does it decelerate the car, as these operations occur through the use of the electric motor. \n2: You can only start a car that has a battery, so the car battery is also used to start the car. \n3: The car battery is not used to accelerate the car. However, the electric motor helps accelerate the car. \n4: The car uses the electric motor to slow down the car, hence the car battery is also needed for this function. \n5: A common misconception. The car battery is not needed to decelerate the car because we can still stop the car even if the car battery is dead. \n\nSo the final answer does not match any of these answers\n\nInput: How could one have a strong back? Choices: 3: Gym.\n3: Do regular exercise. \n2: Have a strong personality. \n1: Hard work. \n4: Have a strong person.\n1: Regular exercise is the best way to get strong as it can target the body area you are interested in for example if you want strong abs go do crunches. The gym is another good way of getting strong as you can target different areas in your body as well. \n2: Strong personality is a very subjective term. Someone who is strong personality can be a good or bad person. The other answers however are accurate. Gym(1) are good because you need to lift weights to gain more muscle. Do regular exercise(2) makes you get more healthier as well. Have a strong person(4) refers to your personality and not necessarily your body. \n\nSo, the final answer is: 1", "answer": "A: new experiences"}
{"text": "1.\"Show\" (B) is not the answer. A \"show\" at this context is not related to sporting events.\n2. \"Theatre\" (C) is also not an answer because it is a theater and not a sports event. \n3. \"Movies\" (D) is the only word in the answer choices not contained in the question. However, movies may be loud at times depending on when and where they are being played. Further, \"movies\" encompasses a variety of things such as comedy, documentaries, horror and more, which means it doesn't necessarily have to be loud. In fact, movies tend to be relatively calm and quiet, unless specifically designed for theater experiences like the Roverman Production show or the Rocky Horror Picture Show. \n4. This leaves us with \"Hockey Game\" (E). A hockey game is a form of sport and it is the loudest. \n5. Therefore, Hockey is the answer.\n\nInput: On a map, where is California located? Choices: 1:A: South of California \n2:B: North of California \n3:C: South America \n4:D: Northeast \n5: West\nOutput: 1 The correct answer is \"A: South of California.\" The states surrounding California are all listed in the question and it is clear that California is the southernmost state in this group. 2. The answer is \"B: North of California\" The north-south directions are not the same as top-bottom directions so California is south of \"North America\" (because you are \"above\" or \"below\" an area instead of \"left or right\" of it) 3. The correct answer is \"C: South America.\" This would be correct if California was located south of South America. 4. The option is \"D: Northeast.\" This is because the question refers to \"NE\" and \"California is in the south of California.\" Therefore, it must be south of it. 5. The final answer is \"West\". This is because West is directly below North. California is directly above North, which means it is directly below West\n\nInput: Which of these answers is most important in making a decision? Choices:  \"A: You can consider it this way \"  \"B: I will always follow the law", "answer": "C: hockey game"}
{"text": "1 Let's examine each of the answer choices individually. \n2. \"Country\" (B) is not correct because the government seeks to lead their people in the correct direction and the country will be over all the people. \n3. \"Trouble\" (C) is also not correct because the government is seeking a solution to trouble, not trouble itself, but also the government will be over all the citizens and the country. \n4. \"Sun\" (E) is also not correct. The sun is something that the government \"seeks\" but the answer doesn't mention seeking the sun. \n5. \"Control\" (D) may be the answer here. \"Control\" is what the government seeks over the people in the following ways: \n1. Over the country, not the citizens.\n2. Over people, not the sun.\n\nSo the final answer should be D\n\nInput: How does one know if they are qualified for an application? Choices:  C: the application D: a phone call\nOutput:\n1. Firstly, it seems that \"qualified\" has an extremely specific meaning in this context.\n\n2. For one, this is not the time to be qualified. Applications occur online, and it doesn't make any sense that one would be qualified over the phone as if they were applying.\n3. \"Qualified\" would need to match the question. As a result, an application is the one who is qualified.\n\n4. Therefore, the answer should be B: the application.\n\nInput: What did that person buy yesterday? Choices:  G: milk B: a house D: a dog E: a pig\nOutput:\n1 - This question is posed with two sentences.\n2 - The first sentence is 'G' 'bought''milk'.\n3 - The second sentence is 'D' or 'a dog' or 'E' and 'a pig'.\n4 - The final result is a phrase. Either 'G bought milk' or 'D bought a dog/pig'.\n5 - Therefore, the answer is:\n\nG: bought milk\n1. To begin, let's find out what the other choices are.\n2. From here, we can eliminate all the choices that don't include 'a dog' and 'a pug.'\n3. 'B", "answer": "E: control"}
{"text": "1.\"The people wanted to take a scenic route, they took the highway to [place of beauty].\"\n2. Begin by examining the options one by one. \n3. Choice A: \"Countryside\". While the countryside may be beautiful, it is not what the people are looking for.\n4. Choices B and C: \"United States\" and \"Beach\". The people aren't referring specifically to the United States or beach.\n5. Choice D: Atlas. While an atlas is made up of maps of various locations and may show the beautiful places around the world, they would not fulfill the requirement for a scenic route.\n6. Choice E: \"Developed Land\". The people may be thinking that the highway cut through developed land but it is too literal an answer. A highway does not cut through the developed land. The people wanted a scenic route through the countryside and the beautiful places, not through developed regions.\n7. The best answer is Choice \"E: Developed Land\".\nSo the final answer it E: Developed Land\n\nInput: What would a person have if they had a stomach ache? Choices: 10\n1. Output: A person would have a stomach ailment, which would be the pain in the abdomen. They also have nausea and perhaps other symptoms.\n2. Answer: The one that has stomach aches is A: person and nothing else because an item is not a person.\n3. Option B: Patience has nothing related to it.\n4. If we have B and A, then this question is an absolute.\n5. Option C: Hope has nothing related to it, so eliminate it.\n6. For the relative choice, think how these choices relate to person.

{"text": "1) E. \"Food poisoning\" and \"gas\" are the correct answers. It is said that people enjoyed the hamburgers they had before riding the next ride. If that is the case, then they must not have had any food poisoning and not have gotten gas.\n2) The answers may confuse you because they contain opposing words. Let's look at the sentence it is from. \"They took a break from riding all the rides to eat hamburgers.\" The only people who are eating hamburgers are the people taking a break and they are not on rides. The \"they\" the authors are referring to are on rides.\n3) Option D is not the answer because that would only occur if people were not riding. \n4) Option B is not the answer because it does not contain the words \"having\" or \"fun\" that were spoken in the sentence. It also does not say that people enjoyed the rides.\n5) Option A is not the answer because according to the sentence when the people were in the lines for the ride they would not be able to have lunch.\n6) Option C is not the answer because they have already discussed having lunch and enjoying the ride they are about to get on. They will now talk about what they are going to do on the next ride.\n7) Option E is the correct answer because it states that when people enjoyed their lunch they discussed going on the next ride and how they were going to do that and that if they enjoyed the hamburgurge then that must mean they didn't have food poisoning or get gas when they are on the ride because that is what they discussed.\n\nInput: The children couldn't believe that the teacher had eaten a hotdog and that they were getting a hot dog for lunch too.

In other words, Sarah took something. \n2. \"She found it in the cupboard\" implies that Sarah was searching for something in the \"cupboard\". \"Thought that it was what?\" gives us information about what Sarah thought the substance was. \n3. We are given two hints \"junk food\" and \" antidote\" which can also be written as \"poison\"\n4. \"What she thought it was\" is poison.\n5. This shows us that Sarah took something accidentally but thought that it was poison.\n6.

Choisese:A: a flock of ostrichs B: an elephant C: a wolf D: a deer E: a squirrel\nOutput: 1 If you are trying to find an acorn, you need to begin in a place that has acorns.\n2. If you are trying to hide something, you need to begin someplace that is concealed. \n3. You might begin in one of these places and then find what you are looking for.\n4. Start by eliminating non-acorns like ostriches. \n5. Elephants are large and would be more likely to find an acornd while an acre of acorns would be hard to find in an elephant. \n6. Start with the wolf and the deer who are both animals that could eat or carry an acorn.\n7. \"A squirrel\" implies that a squirrel could be the answer, but it implies that an acorn could be found anywhere and we are only looking for the place to start and are not concerned with where they end up with the acorn.\n8.

{"text": "1.\"Where could there be a connection to another place?\" This would imply a connection such as a wifi network, cell phone tower, or cell phone service.\n2. Since the internet and cell phones are commonly both found indoors, eliminating option D: wall can be our first step. When indoors, the place where a connection would be found would be a building or room or apartment.\n3. The next step in the process is to eliminate the other choice options. \nOption C: Computer network. This is a logical candidate because it could be a private network (if the indoor place is home) or a school network.\nOption E: Freeway. This can be an outdoor connection.\n4. Eliminating all choices but the logical answer (C), option C: Computer network is the correct answer to the question \"Where would there be a connections to go to another place?\"\nSo the final answer in this case is: C: Computer network or (D) internet\n\nInput: Where else could you find a computer, if not in a restaurant? Choices:  a) school c) home d) grocery store b) backpack e) office\nOutput: 1: The question is asking \"where else could you find a... computer if not in...\" a restaurant.\n2: We can eliminate some obvious answer choices, which are not in a restaurant. \nOption a) School is not in a restaurant, option c) home is not in a restaurant.\n3: Let's eliminate the logical answer choices. Grocery store (b) is a location where a computer could be found. A computer could also be found in an office.

Similarly, her name is not Moore because Moore was also mentioned in the question.\n6. Her name is not Jones because Jones was also mentioned in the previous question.\n7. To sum up, there are four names(Smith, Anderson, Moore, Jones) in the question which were mentioned by the sentence\"A famous actress died recently\".\n8.

This implies finding manufacturing facilities or equipment, which does not sound like something you would expect to find at a school or a grocery store.\n2. Eliminate the options that don't seem logical. \"Factory\" (A) would be a logical place to find manufacturing operations, but is not the answer because it doesn't have its expected context. \n3. \"Grocery store\" (B) has manufacturing operations for food handling and processing. While not a direct association with production, it is a place for goods that are used in the manufacturing process. \n4. \"Band\" (C) is a group of musical instruments, but not directly related to production. \"Aircraft\" (E) includes many manufacturing operations due to parts, assembly, and control equipment. However, it would be unlikely to find people using the manufacturing operations directly.

The remaining three answer choices are either specific dogs or dog breeds that may or may not be present in a given home. However, as the question only asks for a \"stray dog,\" we can cross off the ones that are not strays. \n3. These two eliminated options are \"the Labrador\" (E) and \"the Chihuahua\" (C). After eliminating these two, we are left with two options: \"Dachshund\" (B) and \"Golden Retriever\" (A). \n4.

Choices: A: tools B: money C: pants D: family E: computer\nOutput:1. Since each answer has to start with the prefix \"what,\" this sets the question up as asking about something that isn't present at a junk dealer's home. We can eliminate \"tools\" (B), \"Money\" (C), \"pants\" (D) and\n2. \"Computer\" (E) as all of these things are at least somewhat likely to be found at a junk dealers' home. \"Family\" (E) can be eliminated because it isn't something one would encounter, but as it's an answer choice that could possibly \n3. be found elsewhere, we can't eliminate it. As we begin to eliminate options, we should keep in mind that we are seeking the answer that starts with what, not what is actually present. \n4. \"Computer\" is the only answer that matches this description, and the answer is \"computer.\"\nSo the final answer  is C: Computer\n\nInput: What could you never play a trick on a person who's playing a trick?

Option D: Shopping Malls have parking lots, but are generally not frequented by people carrying shopping bags.\n4. Option C: Train Station parking lots usually don't contain shopping bags, which gives us Choice B: Urban Area.\n5.

This has to do with how they move (on two legs), not where they can be found.\n3) Option C (bomber) means something related to flight. James shot at something with the cannon.  No flying object was mentioned, so this is incorrect.\n4) Option E (animal) means something living (with \"life\" or \"souls\" being implied). James doesn't kill or have control over animals, he just shot at the cannon.  Again, this is not relevant.\n5) Option A (body armor) has to do with personal defenses. James shoots at lunch, not bullets or bombs.\n6) Option D (kill people) is something related to humans and has to do with murdering someone in a deadly way (not just wounding them or something like a punch in the face). Again, James shoots at lamb.\n7) Only \"something\" is relevant to James shooting \"while seeking something\".  The next part (lunch) is also relevant. \"It was overkill\" is meant to demonstrate that the shooting was too much.  However, \"overkill\" is not a person, so this option is eliminated.\n8) The only option left is A (body armor), in which James shot while seeking lunch.\nSo the final answered is B: something\n\nInput: What is the most likely item to find in a gym that is not found in a locker room?

Something is possible if the conditions are met, and so it does not imply a strong likelihood or chance.

To analyze each option, let's look at each individually. \"Fingernails\" (B) can refer to manicured fingernails, but the context indicates that dirt is not relevant to that. \n3. \"Outside corner\" (B) means the corner of an outdoor space or garden. However, the context doesn't indicate any relevant connection to \"dirt\". \n4. The choice of \"Corner\" (D) could refer to both inside and outside, but the context means \"inside\" is unlikely and \"outside\" is less important to the question. \n5. \"Computer\" (E) can refer to either the computer case itself or the computer screen, but neither are directly relevant to the question. 6. The choice of \"Closet\" (A) is one of the most logical choices because a closet is a space to keep things, and one of the items that can be kept there is dirt. \n7. Therefore, the answer to this question is the correct wording, which is A: Closet. So the final answer is A.\n\nInput:What object would a person use to wake up?

If I'm more knowledgeable, I can know more things about someone else, but I wouldn't be learning anything new. I already know the person. \n3) Option B: gain knowledge. Let's assume that we're expanding our knowledge to include information that we already know to some degree (i.e. not learning something new). If I know something to a moderate degree and I'm learning more, is what I'm learning new knowledge? It isn't, because this is just adding more knowledge of the same information I already know.\n4) Option C: intelligence. This option is similar to Option B because the additional learning will only be adding to what I already know.\n5) Option D: education. If a person is gaining knowledge, what happens as a result? Would they necessarily become more educated? Not without a formal education or without a degree program. Furthermore, if a person completes their degree program, can they be said to retain their education? Not really because they've graduated and stopped participating in it.\n6) Option E: gaining knowledge. The answer choice that seems the most likely to be gaining knowledge is this choice. When someone gains more knowledge, they are becoming more knowledgeable, which ultimately leads to becoming more educated. It would also be reasonable to say that someone who is educated to a certain degree would become more educated because they would be furthering their own education. \n7) Comparing the definitions to the answer choices, \"gaining knowledge\" is the best answer choice.\nSo the final answers is E: gaining knowledge", "answer": "C: intelligence"}

This is incorrect because an authentic certificate does not make the bag authentic.\n5: Choice D: logical. This is incorrect because the certificate doesn't prove that the item is logical.\n6: Let's compare all the answers again. \n7: Illegitimate designer bags won't have a certificate of logical, authentic, legal, or action (certificate of anything, really). \n8: This leaves us with \"certificate of legitimate\" as the answer.

Now let's eliminate the options \"Home\" or \"Utah\" which are not relevant to the question.\n4. Since there is no steakhouse in Mexico, we can eliminate the choice for Mexico.\n5. \"New York\" is not a location that might have corn fields below it. \"Nebraska\" and \"Home\" are not relevant.\n6.

There would be many options of cars from a salesman. There was no internet access to the inventory, and the salesman was required to show you all the available vehicles with their flaws and positives and give you more information to take with you for later comparison.\nFortunately, buying a used car has become much easier within the past few years. The salesman doesn't have to walk you around the lot anymore, as buying a used car requires more specific criteria than just any used car. Now, you can do the entire process online.

It is asking about what will happen if a person ends their standing in a pigeon. This is not the context we are trying to answer, either. \n5.\"Ending their standing\". We are trying to find the activity that a person can ending their standing. This is asking about the verb form of the word \"standing\", which is a noun.\n6.\"How can a person stopping standing in a puddl\".

While this is a part of American history that occurred in the capital (Washington DC), that isn't the answer because it's a location rather than a name.\n3.) It's important to separate out each country when evaluating \"Each country\" (F) as an option. In that scenario, it must refer to all countries.

If we evaluate \"Each state\" (F) as a possibility, we find that this cannot be the most obvious choice due to the existence of the \"State of union\" speech.\n5.) \"Europe\" (E) is a continent, not a country, so it cannot be capital. When we say the biggest speech in the \"capital\", we're referring to a specific city or town rather than a region the size of the continent. \n6.)

{"text": "1: To answer this question, one must understand the concept of abandonment, which refers to the process of being left alone permanently. In this context, abandonment could refer to a divorcing couple.\n2. When a divorcing couple finally gets divorced, they are no longer legally married. The wife may feel grief over being abandoned by her ex-husband, while the husband may feel sadness over being abandoned by his ex-wife.\n3. Isolation (C) is too vague of an answer since a person is likely still living around people, just not their ex-spouse. Happiness (E) is inappropriate because it would not normally be associated with divorce. For example, the only person who will typically experience happiness in a divorce setting is the lawyer. \n4. Based on these answers, it is likely that the divorcing individual in question will feel sadness or grief due to abandonment.\n5. Therefore the correct answer is B: solo.\nSo the final ans is D: solo\n\nInput:What type of people will you find at a party that is happening at night?\nChoices: A: party animals B: wildlife C: nightcrawlers D: day people E: night people\nOutput:\n\nFirst, we should define the concept of a party. A party is generally understood to refer to an event where people gather in a social setting to celebrate a special occasion or simply to have fun. Parties are usually not held during the daytime and will take place at night or in the evening.\n\nNext, we should define the term night people, who are the night-time version of what is referred to as day people during the daytime. \n\nFinally, we should define the phrase night party, which must take place during the more appropriate time of the evening.\n\nLet us now examine the provided answer choices for a more refined answer.\n\nChoice A states that party animals will be at the party. Party animals are typically depicted as lively and energetic individuals who know how to enjoy themselves.\n\nChoice B describes the wildlife that will be present at the party. Wildlife is a broad term used to refer to any type of animal that lives in a natural setting and behaves in a natural way.\n\nChoice C states that nightcrawlers will be present at the event. Nightcrawlers are", "answer": "C: isolation"}
{"text": "1: Let's examine each option first.\n2. Choice B: talent. This is not the correct answer to the question because it refers to an ability to be skilled. It does not refer to something entertaining.\n3. Choices A, C, and E are all synonyms for a person or skill being \"talented\" which includes \"talking well\", \"making friends\", and \"knowing well.\" So they are not the answer either.\n4. Choices B and E do not refer to talents for entertaining.\n5. Thus, Choice D: talent is the correct answer because it refers to an aptitude for being excellent in something.\nSo the final choice is D: talent\n\nInput: What might you need to wear while running the Boston Marathon? Choices:  E: Shorts A: tank top B: pants C: raincoat D: sweatsuit\nOutput: 1) Let's begin by understanding what the question wants you to understand.\n\n2) The question is specifically asking what kind of clothing you wear to run. Therefore, the most important thing to know is that the clothing has to be specifically running-related and that \"Biking\" (D), \"Shoes\" (C), and \"Sports\" (A) do not help because they are not specific to running.\n\n3) Clothing \"Shorts\" (E) seem to be a strong possibility. However, this clothing item can be worn to all sorts of activities. Clothes \"Pants\" (B), \"Raincoat\" (C), and Clothes \"Sweatsuit\" (D) do not seem relevant to a running event.\n\n4) Therefore, the correct answer is Clothing \"Shorts.\"\n\nSo the final answer choice is E: Shorts\n\nInput: What are some places that contain a river? Choices:  B: Ocean D: Sea A: Lake F: Canal G: Pond E: Brooke\nOutput: 1). The key to determining the correct answer is to understand which location matches with the question. The question asks where a river can be found, while the options are locations.\n\n2). The next step is to eliminate all options that do not fit with the question. We first eliminate the options that are either too big or too small and do not contain", "answer": "B: talent"}

The answer is not a closet because Dave can get to the closet but not off the floor.\n5. Dave didn't say anything about the shelf, so we'll leave it as an option.\n6. The right answer is E: soccer game.\n7. Dave wants to be able to grab his beer from the soccer game.\n8. The only options with the closet A or B. The game would be inside a closet at the game.\n9. From the closet, I could get to the game, refrigerator or shelf.\n10. The refrigerator is not an option, because we know Dave's beer is not in the refrigerator in the story.\n11. The shelf is also an option, because I could get to the shelf from the closet. \n12. But there was no mention of the shelf.\n13. Therefore, only the soccer game is the answer.\nSo the finals answer is E: soccers game\n\nInput: The number of 7's in a string has no effect on how it is read when the letter R and the letter P are alternated.\nWhat is true about the given string?

{"text": "1.'If you're known..' suggests that someone might have a reputation for giving presents. We have to take into consideration who might give you presents.\n2. Let us eliminate the options that are irrelevant. 'Go shopping' (B) refers to buying presents as a form of personal enrichment, but it doesn't account for when you purchase it for others. There is a sense of self-gain to this option. 'Generous' (C) can be a description of someone who gives presents. We'll use the question as a starting point to examine the answer in context. If she was known to give to others, how would this define someone? One might also be known to earn money, have money, or be a gift buyer, but the more relevant options are 'generous' (C) and 'gift buyer' (E).\n3. So is the answer choice 'gift buyer'(E)? Or is it the other option 'generous' (B)?\n4. We begin by determining which answer's description best fits the question. This means we consider the following two descriptions: Known to give to others, referred to as gift buyer (E) and known to be generous (B). The options should be examined in a comparative manner, with each answer standing on its own.\n5. The context of 'giving to others' (E) implies that the person is being referred to as a 'gift buyer'. So the answer is E: gift buyer.\nSo the final choice is E: gift buying", "answer": "B: generous"}

The question is asking what types of people a project leader would want.\n2) Let's investigate each answer choice in turn. \n3) Answer Choice A: Greedy people. This does not seem to be a likely answer because project leaders typically manage a team of employees and, as such, would likely not want greedy people who would try to take advantage of their position for personal gain.\n4) Answer Choice B: Worry people. This does not appear to be the correct answer because project leaders should not be looking for people who are stressed and worry a lot.\n5) Answer Choice C: Knowledgeable people. This answer makes more sense because project managers often look for people who have a high level of qualifications and training to ensure that their project is successful.\n6) Answer Choice D: Take charge. This is the correct choice because project managers often want to have an employee who is self-motivated and confident to be able to take charge of their responsibilities.\n7) Answer Choice E: Boss. This is not a satisfactory answer choice because it does not make sense to look for someone who already has a managerial position elsewhere, rather than one currently in charge of their own project.\n\nSo the final answer A: knowledgable\n\nInput: In some cultures, how many can eat at a table? Choices: 2 - 3, or 4 - 5 persons? Choices: 4 persons, or 6 persons\nOutput: 1.) Begin by understanding what the problem is asking. The prompt asks how many persons in certain cultures can eat at a table. It does not explicitly state how many persons they are referring to, which is why 2-3, or 4-5 must be the correct answers.\n2.) Let's analyze each answer choice in turn to determine which is correct.\n3.) The first answer will contain the number of people who can eat at the table in a single culture. The second answer will contain the number for a different culture. \n4.) For answer A: 2-3, it is clearly incorrect since the question doesn't specify the amount of people in the culture nor states how many people they can eat at a time. \n5.) Answer B: Four persons is not correct as it does not follow the directions of how many persons", "answer": "C: have knowledge"}

If the spinning wheel was next to her, she could use it to process the wool, so it should be the answer.\n5. The \u201cshe\u201d in the question refers to herself, so the answer choice is \u201cher\u201d spinning wheel.\n6. Therefore, the correct answer is B: spinning wheel.\nSo the final answers is B: spinning wheels\n\nInput:What does \u201ca tiger by the tail on the table\u201d mean? Choices:  a) a dangerous thing, b) an animal,  c) a tail,  D) something that is hard, E) something that is on the table\nOutput: 1;The correct answer is \"D: something that is hard.\"\nThe phrase \"a tiger by the tale on the table\" means that something is hard to do or control in an unpleasant situation that you're not sure how to deal with.\n2; The definition of a tiger's tale is a long story, whereas the definition of \"by the tail\" means on or around the tail. So if we put the two definitions together, it means that an animal has a long story around its tail,\n3; Option c) is irrelevant in this case; a tiger isn't an animal.\n4; Option b) is irrelevant in this context because we don't need to know what kind of animal it is. Instead, we need to know what the phrase \"by the tail\" and \"on the table\" mean \n5; Option d) is again irrelevant in this context because \"hard\" doesn't relate to \"by the tail\" or \"on the table\" and so it should not be considered in the answer space.\nSo the final choice is D: hard. Now how does this relate to \"a tiger on the table\"?\n6; \"Hard\" means difficult in a sentence. So if something is hard to do, it is more difficult to do than something easier to do.\n7; Option D's definition is easier because", "answer": "C: spinning wheel"}
{"text": "1.\"When going to sleep, what noise does a human usually make?\"\n2. This is asking what types of noises a human may make when going to sleep.\n3. \"Loss of consciousness\" (A) is not a noise, but a state that occurs before sleep.\n4. \"Relaxation\" (C) is also not a sound, but an activity.\n5. \"Snoring\" (D) is a vocalization, but we do this when sleeping. \"Dreaming\" (E) is a mental activity, but we can dream when awake or asleep.\n6. That leaves us with noises, and the most common sound we can make when going to sleep is \"talking\" (E).\n7. This can be a quiet or loud conversation with ourselves or someone else. We can talk to people through dreaming and in our heads when sleeping. \n8. Therefore, the answer choice is E: Talking.\nSo the final choice is E: talking", "answer": "C: snoring"}
{"text": "1 Let's examine the options individually.\n2. Choice (A) \"rural area\" means a region beyond a town or city. It can be an area where there are multiple villages, but it has multiple villagers. \n3. Since the word \"village\" means a small, tight-knit community of people, one of their primary functions is to support each other. The question asks \"What is the opposite of the village?\", which doesn't make sense with rural area.\n4. Choices (B), (C), and (E) all refer to places with a significant population, but their only similarity is that they're different from \"village\". They are not opposites of villagers either.\n5. Finally, we consider choice (D) \"big city\". This is a city with a large, dense population where a village does not make sense. There are no people living in villages to provide or rely on each other. Therefore, the only answer is \"big city\", the opposite of a village.", "answer": "D: big city"}

C: A lake in the area would possibly be enjoyed, but is not a specific area that locals would flock to.\n5) 4. D: This is not a choice as it is another activity, not a specific place in the region.\n6) 5. E: A children's pool would most likely be enjoyed but does not fit the criteria for the question.\n7) 6. That leaves us with A: Beach. Locals might find this place to be ideal because it has shallow water, but it's not in the ocean like the question indicates.\n8) Thus, the \"hot spot\" is the beach, but this isn't the ocean. However, this does meet the conditions of the question, so you can't find a place that meets all the conditions for the question.\n\nSo the final answer\n\n## is \n\nA: beach", "answer": "C: lake"}
{"text": "1) Begin by understanding the full question. \"What place would a person want to go to look at zombies?\".\n2) Note that this question is asking what place someone might go to see or look at zebras. The implication is that this is not a very frequent activity and the only place or situation that might lend itself to such an experience is a zoo. (the answer is \"A: zoo).\n3) In some cases, this might be called a zoo aquarium, as some zoos house both aquatic and ground animals.\n4) Now, let's take a second to eliminate the more common answers that don't make sense. \"Hospital\" (D) and\"Desk\" (E)\" don't work for this question because neither place could provide a visual to observe.\n5) \"Opera\" (E) is something that sometimes people refer to the zoo in jest. However, it is not a place where a person may go to observe zebras.\n6) Finally, \"Museum\" (B) and \"Zoo\" (A) are the only two remaining choices. \"Museuem\" (B) could potentially be a place to view zebras via photographs or taxidermy. However, this is not a place where one would go to see real zebra. Zoo (A), however, may fit the description. There are many zoos that contain zebras where people can view them. Some zoos contain very large cages for the animals to live in. As a result, some may have the ability to simply stand and observe, while others would need to look from a certain distance. This is because it is illegal to interfere with animals at a zoo.\n7) Therefore, the answer is \"A: Zoo\" - or a less common museum that contains zebra displays.\nSo the final answers are A: zoo", "answer": "A: zoo"}

This question looks like a riddle in that it has to do with how can I find air that was breathed by many people. We can eliminate the answers which would not make sense, such \"space shuttle\" (C) and \"a charming person\" (B).\n2.\"house\" (D). This is not the correct answer. This is the correct location of the air, but it was not the most recently breathed air. The room or house may not even have been visited very recently for it to still contain air from a few hours ago or a day, but not from several days ago.\n3. \"Train station\"(E) is not the answer because it would be the air that was breathed the most recently at the train station. However, this would not be the case at a random house or apartment, where air is constantly circulating.\n4. \"Surface of the earth\" (B). If you are standing outside waiting to board the spaceship, you will most likely breathe air from everyone else who has been outside recently. This makes the surface of earth the best choice for the most recent air.\n5. Finally, you'll recognize that we've come full circle back to the spaceship (C), which was the original choice.

Choice D: Front door, A front door has a window in it but does not contain lots of windows.\n6. Choice E: Tent, we know tents do not contain lots of windows, so this can also be eliminated.\n7. The only viable option that contains lots of windows is Choice B: Office.\n8. Therefore, the answer to the riddle is B: Office.\nSo, the answer is B: Office\n\nInput: What will people do every morning? Choices: \tA: exercise B: eat C: read D: sleep E: do their work\nOutput: Begin by understanding the question. The question is asking, what will people do every morning. \"Do their work\" cannot be the answer because people do their work more than once over the course of a day, not just in the morning. \n\"Read\" cannot be the answer either because reading does not happen only in the morning, it could happen over the course of the day. \n\"Exercise\" also does not fit the question because it can happen more than one day.\n\"Sleep\" also does not fit because someone can sleep at many times of the day.  \"Eat\" also does not fit, because someone can eat at many times of the year. \nTherefore, the only possible answer that fits every morning is \"get up and do\"\n\nInput: Why would a person come to this building in the mornings and evenings? Choices:  L: the library B: the bookstore D: the museum E: the school I: the city hall F: the parks\nOutput:\n1) Let's begin by eliminating options that do not pertain to the question. Options that the building is not used in the evening or morning include: \"the library\", \"the bookstore\", \"the museum\", \"the school\",", "answer": "B: office"}
{"text": "1.\"A person would carry a netted drawstring bags to an airport... or car... or jewelry store... or garbage can... or laundry room.\" In this case, we need to eliminate the locations in which a drawstring bag would not be considered appropriate.\n2. We can eliminate the car option,  because when is a person not thinking about carrying a drawstring bag? They are either currently at an airport or a garage, or thinking about going to an airport or a laundry room. Anything else would be unrelated. \n3. We can eliminate the jewelry store option because we are talking about the type of place someone would carry a drawstring bag to and a jewelry store would certainly not be on that list because it would be uncouth to walk about with a small bag full of drawstring bags. \n4. Lastly, we can eliminate the garbage can. The purpose for bringing a drawstring bag to a garbage can is to hold all the garbage bags and tie them up. The garbage can itself is not on the list of places where the bags will be carried to and we assume the bags will not go there. This leaves us with the airport and laundry room.\n5. Therefore the answer is A: airport and B: laundry room. \nSo the final answer has two options : A: airport and laundromat.\n\nInput:A child is playing hopscotch in which space is designated for a jump? Choices: 1. A: the last word 2. B: the last space 3. C: the first space 4. D: anywhere within 5. E: every single one\nOutput: 1)\"Where can I play hopscotch? Anywhere.\" The question above does not refer to the last word, but to wherever you choose within the hopscotch grid. \n2)\"Where can I play with a jump where the last word is designated? Anywhere.\" The first option we eliminate is B, because you cannot play hopscotch anywhere where the last word is the designated space. However, this leaves us with C and D as possible answers.\n3)\"Where can I play anywhere with a jump that is designated in the last space? Anywhere\" Eliminating options A and B, we are left with C as", "answer": "E: laundry room"}
{"text": "\"My house is very dry; therefore, it could be dry.\" \"Dry\" and \"dry\" are synonyms. \n2. \"Less water in the air\" can be interpreted as \"low humidity in the air\".  \n3. \"Less water on the floor\" can be interpreted as an \"increased chance of slipping and falling\".  \n4. All of these options must be combined to answer the question. \n5. To fix excessive dryness in the air, it is suggested to use a humidifier.\n6. The answer cannot be \"Ice cube\" because ice cubes do not have a surface to skate on. \n7. The answer cannot be 'Humidifier' because there is no skating rink to skate on.\n8. The answer cannot be any'surface of earth' because it does not have a surface to ice skate on the floor.\n9. The answer cannot be burn it to the ground because the burn can cause other problems such as ash, smoke, and fire, which will cause a lot of carbon dioxide.\n10. The humidifier works by misting water into the air, which provides more hydration to the house. In addition, it reduces the chances of a slip-and-fall accident.\nSo the final Answer is  C: humidifier\n\nInput:I have just made an oversight. What would be the opposite of what I did in this situation? Choices: \tA: overthought \tB: overconfidence \tC: overkill \tD: excess \tE: overwrought\nOutput: \"I have just made an overthought and I'm trying to avoid overkill.\" We will use each option to determine what the overthought was. \n2. Overconfidence: No one has confidence in excess so it could be interpreted as an \"underconfidence\".  \n3. Overkill: No one is too proud of killing someone and using too much of something that could kill others.\n4. Excess: Everything in moderation would be in the proper range and moderate things which can be related to not being in overkill.\n5. Overwrought: It is in the middle so it wouldn't be \"over\", but it could be the opposite of what was done.", "answer": "A: humidifier"}
{"text": "1) The question posed is, what did she feel? The answer is Love.\n2) She was applying for job and had no calls backs, which could mean that she did not get hired, but that she put in a lot of Hard work, so she feels love, not anything else.\n3) She felt Employment, Frustration, Stress and Working hard, nothing else.\n4) If she had felt employment then it would mean she got employed which would mean she got selected for job, which means she feels Love.\n5) Now let us look at the other options. She felt employment if and only if she gave it her best shot and she put in a lot hard work, hence she feels love, not employment, stress or any other of the options, hence the option A is the final answer\nSo the final answer would be A: Love\n\nInput: What will you find when all of your hair is removed? Choices: \nA: hair B: your body C: nothing D: a bald person E: people\nOutput: 1 & 2. The question asks, \"What will you find when all your hair is removed?\". The answer will be \"When my hair is removed, all of that will be found, nothing else is found.\"\n3) So, it would be impossible for your hair's body to be removed, hair body is not a valid choice.\n4) \"Nothing\" or \"people\" cannot be options because that's something to do with \"hair\" or \"bald\".\n5) \"Nothing\" can never be the answer because \"Something will be found\". If I remove the hair then I will find hair.\n6) \"People\" is also impossible because when your hair is removed, nothing will be found, there will be vacant space. When people are in a place, they are occupying that space, but if there is hair removal, people will not occupy vacant space, therefore people cannot be found there.\n7) There is no other option except when you remove the hair you will find hair. That means it must be the answer option D\nSo the final answer will be D: when hair is removed, you will find hair.\n\nInput: What is an example of a product that has a unique selling proposition?

{"text": "1) Let us begin by understanding what \"exercising\" means. It refers to engaging in some form of physical activity for the purpose of staying fit.\n2) There are a number of reasons why someone would want to exercise. They are: \n3) option A: fatigue. Someone is fatigued when they become tired after engaging in physical activity. In other words, engaging in physical activity can cause tiredness. Therefore, this cannot be the correct answer.\n4) option B: relaxation. This is a good answer. Exercising can have a relaxing effect, as it produces a calming environment and produces feel-good chemicals.\n5) Option C: tiredness also comes up when we start exercising, but at a later point of fatigue. This is not the correct answer.\n6) Option D: muscle weakening also occurs when we exercise, as we begin to develop more muscle strength and endurance. This is not the reason people exercise.\n7) Option E: losing weight seems like the right answer but this cannot be the correct option. \"Losing weight\" implies \"losing\" extra weight, which people don't want to happen when they exercise. \n8) Therefore, we can see that the correct answer is B: relaxation. \nSo the final answer in the multiple choice question is B: relaxation\n\nInput: I am not in the office, as I am with my friends who are at the home of someone. What am I doing? Choices:   A: attending an event B: chatting C: going to a lounge D: attending a party E: relaxing\nOutput: 1.) First let's take a look at what each answer choice means. \n2.) Option A: \"Attending an event\" means that you are attending an event or party, which is not a specific place. The same would be true if you were attending a lecture or class.\n3.) Option B: \"Chatting\" refers to conversing with someone. For this to be true, your friends and those you are with would have to be conversing with someone or you would be having a conversation with someone. Chatting would not refer to being at a party or an event in general. \n4.) Option C: \"Going to a lounge\" means to go to a specified", "answer": "E: losing weight"}
{"text": "1) The key to answer this question correctly is to understand what the shingles are. Shingles are commonly seen on the roofs of houses and they prevent water from reaching the house's interior. \n2) The first four choices are all describing what the wind feels like. They do not relate to shingles in any way. \n3) The last choice is the correct answer. The wind tore off the roof shingles and the wind is still blowing. Therefore, \"The wind was blowing hard\" is the answer.\nSo the final answers is A: dry hair, B: spreading, C: blowing hard,  D: change direction,  E: wave wheat and finally the answer is E: wave wheat.\n\n\n\ninput: Do not open the oven for long periods of time to check it on a regular basis. Explain why? Choices: 1.  You are running the risk of damaging your food 2.  You are being wasteful 3.  Your home smells like cook food 4.  You are putting the energy to cook food to waste\noutput: 1. The food cooked is being damaged 2. The food cooked will be damaging because the food cooking process takes time and the longer the time the cooked food is in the oven to cook, the more likely the food gets damaged and this happens because oven heats the food and in that process the food gets dried and the texture would not be the same as the texture before cooking.  To avoid this you are not supposed to open the oven for a long time\n2. You are being wasteful because opening the oven for checking the food for long time, the electric energy which is used to heat the stove when the oven is using it goes to waste and therefore is being wasted and in the long run could damage the electrical appliances\n3. The food cooked in this case would be damaged because checking the food for long while the food is in oven which is a process of cooking itself would take long and cooking food does take time\n4.

{"text": "1.\"Greatest\" (E) and \"body of water\" (B) are not related, so eliminate them.\n2.\"Aquarium\" (D) is similar to (E) because it is also a body of water. \n3.\"Lake superior\" (C) must be it. \"Ice fishing\" (A) is a reference to lakes, especially frozen ones in the winter. \"Greatest\" (D) must be a lake too.\n4.\"Ice fishing can't be done\" (A) on the smallest body of water because it's way too small to fish underneath the ice. The other options aren't the bodies of water we'll be fishing through, so they must be the biggest. \n5.\"Pond\" (B) is bigger than underwater, so it must be the answer.\nSo the final  answer is B: pond\n\nInput:What animal are you most likely to spot loping along with your dog? Choices:  a: elephant B: crane C: antelope D: lion E: wolf\nOutput: 1\"Wolf\" (E) is most likely the animal your dog would be following, so eliminate it. \n2We don't really follow elephants (A) very closely, so it can be eliminated.\n3The lion (D) will be too far and fast and is probably hunting. The rest of the choices are very unrealistic, so eliminate them. \n4\"Loping\" (A) can indicate that your dog may be following you, so it must be an uncommon animal.\n5Now we take a look at \"Antelope\" (C). This animal is similar to the loping of \"Antelope\" because it also follows the dog, but it's not that uncommon.\n6The solution is \"Antelope\"!\nSo the final  Answer is C: Antelope\n\nInput: \"Dumb\" is not a synonym of what word?

{"text": "1: Each choice will be assessed based on where it could be located and what the smell could be.\n2: \"Space shuttle\" (E) cannot possibly be the answer. A stale smell cannot come from the space shuttle, as there are no humans near the space shuttle and thus, no smells from the kitchen would travel this far (unless of course, the smell was a really unpleasant one).\n3: \"Surface of earth\" (E) would need to be assessed based on whether a stale smell could be detected on the surface of the Earth. However, as the Earth is a sphere, a smell near the equator would not be able to travel to the North Pole, as there is a complete absence of any open land at the North Pole. Additionally, since the Earth has a high gravity, it is unlikely for an object to rise above the ground without taking a rocket to reach space.\n4: \"Surface of moon\" (E) is the only choice with which this does not interfere. The surface of the moon is completely flat and lacks any presence of vegetation or water molecules, making it unlikely that a stale smell would travel this far.\n  Therefore, by elimination of the three options that do not satisfy the criteria, we can conclude that the answer is C: \"Cupboard\u201d.\n So, the final answer is C: cupboard\n\nInput: At the candy store, the owner is offering a discount.

However, the success of procreation comes after offspring are created, not during the period of procreation.\n6: Option \"Create Success\" (E) is the correct choice because it is an action that occurs while procreating. \"Create a success\" is synonymous with \"produce offspring\". \n7: Option \"Reproduce\" (E) is also the correct choice. The success of procreation is measured by the outcome, which occurs when the process is complete.\n8: Therefore, the answer is E: Reproduce and E: Create Success.\n9: We can summarize by stating that to procreate is to produce offspring and when procreation is successful, reproduction occurs.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Author: John\n# Date: 2019/3/7", "answer": "E: reproduce"}
{"text": "1.\"Listening vinyl\" (notice the lowercase \"v\") implies some type of medium that can be listened to. \n2. Considering the definitions of the words in the question, \"wallpaper\" (E) is not a correct answer. Wallpaper is a type of decoration usually put inside a home.\n3. Let's eliminate choices that would be incorrect based on the context of the question. \"Safeway\" (B) is not a place to purchase vinyl. \"Record store\" (C) would be an incorrect answer because the question says \"one is likely\" to purchase vinyl and not \"I would purchase vinyl\", which indicates a more active voice, and record stores are just a place rather than a likely option. \n4. \"Record albums\" (D) are a type of vinyl, but they are not listening vinyl specifically.\n5. Therefore the answer is A: Record album.\nSo the final answe is A: record album\n\nInput: What do you get when you take two people in love and put their names side to side? Choices:  a) Twix b) Mars bar c) Cadbury Dairy Milk bar d) Galaxy bar e) Toblerone \nOutput: 1.Let's start with elimination options. Galaxy bar (f) and Toblerone (g) are alliterative in their name, so they can be eliminated even though their contents are not exactly the same as the answer.\n2. Consider further what 'their names side-to-side' means. This does not mean that they have to be directly side by side, so as to be in the same row or column in a table.\n3. So the people need to be adjacent to get the result - e.g. one in the next row, or one in the next column.\n4. Now consider which type of chocolate bar best matches the meaning of the answer. Galaxy (f), Mars (b), and Twix (a) refer to confectionary (sweets) bars. Cadbury DairyMilk bar (c & d), however, is a bar-type of chocolate. All three answers contain either DairyMilk or chocolate, and are alliterative, which are possible factors in the answer.\n5. The best answer, therefore, is", "answer": "C: record store"}
{"text": "1) Let us eliminate choices that doesn't fit the requirements of the question. \"Speed up\" (E) is not correct because we are talking about a plane's cabin, not a plane in general. \"Carry people\" (D) is incorrect because it describes the plane, but a plane cabin is where people sit. Therefore we can cross it off as an invalid answer. \n2) There are two remaining valid choices left: \"Slow down\" (C) and \"Living\" (B). \n3) We can rule out \"Slow down\" because a cabin of a plane is not there to slow it down. A plane's purpose for slowing down would be in other parts of the aircraft where cabin passengers would be unable to see it. \n4) The other choice is \"Living\" (meaning the cabin is where people typically live), which is also not correct since a cabin of the airplane does not contain a house nor is it a permanent place of living.\nSo the final correct answer is  B: living", "answer": "D: carry people"}

Also \"Anything\" (C) is a general category of things, but it is not a collection of molecules. \n4. Now let's examine each remaining answer in more detail: Atoms \"are made up of a dense, positively charged nucleus surrounded by negatively charged electrons.\" Molecules are collections of atoms. As a result, \"molecules made up your hands\" cannot be the answer because \"your hands\" are made up of cells (a collection of millions of atoms, which are made up of molecules). Therefore, we rule out \"Hands\" (B). Similarly, \"Atom\" (A) cannot be the answer because atomic particles aren't molecules. \n5. Therefore, choosing \"Molecules\" (D) is the correct answer. Everything is made up of collections of molecules ranging from liquid, to gas, and even to solid.", "answer": "E: hands"}
{"text": "1) We start by eliminating any choices that clearly don't describe energy, i.e., \"Eat grass\" (A) would be a nonsensical energy option. Similarly, \"Kept in stables\" (D) and drinking coffee (E) could possibly provide energy but would not be answers to the question.\n\n2) We can eliminate B, as it does not describe any form of energy that horses have. \"Play\" (B) is more of an action (e.g., \"they run around playing\") rather than a type of energy (e.g., horse is \"playful\").\n3) \"Dominate\" (B) requires an inference that has not been given and may not be relevant to horses.\n\n4) \"Eat grass\" and \"Kept in stabes\" do not describe energy, nor does \"Play.\" Therefore, we have four potential choices, none of which describe energy. \"Kept in stabs also\" is a redundant phrase and can be eliminated.\n5) We can therefore eliminate all remaining choices.\n\n6) The only potential answer left that describes energy is A: They eat grass to get energy.\n\nSo the final answer in the horse riddle is A:They eat grass\n\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question in the picture below.\n\nI'm not sure what is the question is asking.

A motion might take place in a hotel reception area, or perhaps in a meeting room there that isn\u2019t being used right then.\n5. An office building is a place where people who work there might have a reception area. This means the people there are at work.\n6. There is no reception area outside of a work location.

If we substitute \"fun\" with \"bad\" in the sentence, the entire statement becomes true: \"Bad girl was bad, but she did tell people that\".\n4) The third choice is \"Excellence\" - this indicates someone who is performing at a high level. By substituting \"excellent\" for \"bad\" in the first line of the question, we obtain: \"Mary was an excellent girl, but she was a horrible person\".\n5) The fourth choice is \"Honest\" - this refers to being truthful with people. By substituting a different word such as \"excellent\" or \"fun\", the original statement does not fit with the rest of the sentence.\n6) The final choice is \"CHOICE\" - this is a way to express dislike or negativity towards something. By substituting the word \"choice\" for \"bad\", the sentence again becomes true: \"Mary was a good person with a poor choice in friends\".\n7) Therefore, the answer is \"Chose\".\nSo the final answer here is C: Honest\n\nInput: I think I'm going to like all of those _____.

Only a rat is the correct answer.\nSo the final answe is D:a rat\n\nInput: How many ways are there to build a 4 by 4 matrix? Choices: Choices:A: 2 B: (2 * 2) C: 8 D: 16 E: 64\nOutput: 1. There is only one way to build a 4*4 matrix since 4=2^2\n2.

{"text": "1) First, let's quickly reject options that are logically disqualified. For instance, answer option A \u201cMaps\u201d can not be the possible answer, since we can get a bus station map from various places other than bus stations. Similarly, answers B (\u201cStreet\u201d), C (\u201cCatch bus\u201d), and D (\u201cCity Centre\u201d) all contain places, rather than locations, which are also not what the question requires (a \u201cplace\u201d must be a single location that can be a room or structure that \u201chouses\u201d an activity). \n2) Now, consider answer option \u201cE\u201d, \u201cSchool.\u201d Schools have some convenient areas, such as playgrounds, or where they keep lockers, but again, a school is not a single location that houses a bus station, which can only be a room or structure in one place (a building) at a time. Therefore, the only remaining answer option is A (\u201cMaps\u201d) which is the only logical, consistent answer. The bus station map is something we can easily find in a bus station. Moreover, we don\u2019t need to travel to a city centre to find a bus station, making bus station maps convenient.\n3) Therefore, answer option A is a useful interpretation of the question.\n4) A \u201cbus station\u201d is a building that \u201chouses\u201d the \u201cbus station\u201d. It \u201chouses\u201d the station, not the activity. \u201cMaps\u201d of bus stations can be found at bus stations, but not every single place one might find a bus station.\n5) Therefore, a bus station is found in a building, and it typically has maps.\nSo the final conclusion is that answer option A is correct.\nSo the final explanation is that bus stations are usually found indoors, and they typically have maps available in their buildings.\n\nInput: What is an activity when you are not doing it? Choices: 1: A: resting B: sleeping C: thinking D: relaxing E: dreaming\nOutput: 1: We can safely eliminate all the choices other than B \u201csleeping\u201d. All of the others are things which you could do \u201cwhen you are not doing it.\u201d\n2: Thus, the only correct answer is \u201csleeping.\u201d\nSo resting when not doing it is sleeping is the final answer.\n\nInput:How can I get information on what a person is looking for", "answer": "D: city centre"}
{"text": "1: Begin analyzing the given options. \n2. \"Kept at accountant\" (B) implies that you can leave your book at your accountant's office, but this answer is not specific to leaving your place of residence. \n3. \"Purse\" (C) is an option but only refers to \"kept\", not leaving your place of residence, so we remove this option as well. \n4. \"Desk drawer\" (D) should also be removed since \"Desk\" would typically imply being in the office working, not being at your residence with your account book. \n5. Lastly, \"Bank\" (E) doesn't relate directly to leaving your residence and therefore can be disregarded. \n6. This leaves \"Keeping track of expenses\" (E) as the only remaining logical answer. By \"keeping track of expenses\", it implies that you can leave the book at your residence. \n7. Therefore, the answer would be \"Keeping track of Expenses\" (E).\nSo the final answer the given question is E: keeping track of Expenses\n\n\n#### 2006", "answer": "C: desk drawer"}

However, it is not where someone can go to buy a teddy bear as the shelf, as a place, does not allow you to buy anything.\n7) Option D: Home is where you can buy any toy. However, the only question asked was \"where someone can go buy a toy\".\n8) Option E: Toy store is an obvious answer for places where you can buy toy. But, unfortunately for people seeking an easy answer, it is not the answer to the question.\n9) Thus, the only option that can be given is Option A: The thrif store which is the only place from the first branch.", "answer": "E: toy store"}
{"text": "1.) To understand what the question is asking, we should first eliminate the choices that are not correct. \"Compact\" (E) is a type of room that is similar to a closet, but the question clearly states \"papers\" and not \"rooms.\" Additionally, \"Faithful\" (D) is a state, not an action, and \"Packaged\" (C) is a noun describing some already-packaged goods.\n2.) That leaves \"bound\" (B) and \"tighten\" (A) as the two correct answers. \"Bound\" implies an action such as \"wrap\" or \"seal\", whereas \"tighten\" is a noun that can be used to describe different things like squeezing a sandwich tighter or tightening a faucet.\n3.) Therefore, the correct answer is B: bound.\nSo the final answers are B: bound and A: tighten\n\ninput: Where do you get goggles? Choices: 1. A: at night 2. B: a store 3. C: at the pharmacy 4.

{"text": "1\"During the brainstoning session\" there was a lot of \"talking\". Talking is one type of communication that involves speech.\n2. \"Talking\" is not the same as \"conversation\". Conversation involves a two way verbal exchange rather than one person simply speaking. The goal is to exchange ideas, not simply \"talk\". \n3. \"Sharing information\" is talking but with a specific goal of sharing information. Thus, it is different than just \"talking\". \n4. \"Obtaining information\" is not the same thing as \"talking\" because there is no conversation involved. Gathering information is also a different thing from \"talking\" and is instead more related to acquiring information.\n5. Therefore the correct answer is B: exchange of ideas.\nSo the final answe is B: exchange of information\n\n\n# A1. Duration of the activity and the cost of the activity are what?\n\nInput:For what are these connected? Choices:  Money and the duration of purchases A: money B: purchases C: time D: price E: activity\nOutput: 1.\"Money and the duration of purchase\" is a phrase that is being used to compare purchases to how long they last.\n2. In this case they are asking comparing how much something costs in relation to how long you use it for. Purchases, then, are the things you buy. If the purchase lasts a reasonable amount of time, it would take longer to purchase, so its price would be higher relative to the duration it would be used. \n3. \"Time of the purchase\" is asking about the relationship between purchases and how long they take. One thing is comparing the price of the purchase in relation to the time it lasts. If the purchase lasted longer, it would have been cheaper. \n4. \"Cost of the activity\" is when you look at the cost of doing things during that period, which would be a different amount than the initial cost of buying (B) or the durations of the purchases (A), which are about the initial cost.\n5. \"Exchange of info\" has some overlap with A because it involves both discussing something and price, but the difference is that it doesn't include \"time\" or \"purchases\" in the answer.", "answer": "B: exchange of ideas"}

Choices:  a) It would be difficult to walk up them. B) They go up and down. C) It would be dangerous. D) It is difficult to climb. E: The question is asking, Why are stairs on a ship not recommended for walking on? a. Stairs do not make it difficult to walk up them, they make it easy to walk up them. b. They go up and down, this doesn't indicate that stairs are a recommendation for walking. c. They could be dangerous for walking because they are made out of certain materials such as wood, they could become slippery or fall apart when exposed to sea water. d. It is a difficulty to climb, not a recommendation to climb. e. We can understand them being dangerous through the previous option b. The answer must be either D or E. e) Stairs on a ship does not contain the word recommendation in it, so we can rule that out. Stairs are not recommend for walking on, this is incorrect.

{"text": "1.\"Like more\" (B) is not correct because \"like more\" implies a higher level of agreement than is necessary for \"agree(ing) with someone\".\n2.\"Nodding\" (C) is also not correct because it means to move one's head back and forth, which can mean different things depending on context. For example, you might nod in agreement or disagreement, which would depend on context.\n3.\"By wearing rings\" (D) is not correct because it can mean different things depending. For example, to indicate agreeing you don't need to necessarily be wearing a ring.\n4.\"Concordance\" (E) is also not correct. It's referring to the state of agreement, but not the act of agreeing.\n5.\"Shake hands\" (A) is the correct answer. To indicate agreeing, you can shake hands which is the most direct way possible.\nSo the final answers are A: agree and B: shake hands\n\nInput:What are pencils made out of? Choices: 1. wood or 2. graphite or 3. plastic or 4. paint or 5. oil or 6. rubber 7. crayon or 8. other\nOutput: 1\"wood\" (1) can be a material in many objects, including pencils. However, this refers more to natural wood rather than pencil specifically, so it's not the correct answer.\n2. \"graphite\" (2) is a very specific substance and a material that is used specifically for pencils. It's the correct answer.\n3. \"plastic\" (3) is actually a group of different materials, and this general term doesn't refer to a specific material that's used in pencils, so it can't be the answer. \n4. \"paint\" (4) is a type of object, so it specifically won't be used in pencils but this can be used on the surface of a pencil, which is fine for painters, for example. However, it's still not the correct answer to the question.\n5. \"oil\" (5) can also be used in various objects and substances (food, machinery, etc), and a wood pencil might be treated with this", "answer": "B: nodding"}
{"text": "1) Let's begin by eliminating 3 choices. \n2) \"Temperate climate\" (C) and \"Hedgerow\" (D) would not contain rose bushes because they're not specific features. \"In the ground\" (B) would not either because that includes many other features that would not contain rose bush features, such as sidewalks, fences, buildings, and more.\n3)  The two options that remain are \"Botanical gardens\" (E) and \"Park\" (A), which both could potentially contain rose bushes. A botanical garden is a large space that grows plants from all around the world, making it a more likely candidate.\n4)  Therefore, the answer is E: Botanical Gardens.\nSo the final  answer is E: Botanica Gardens\n\nInput: What is a feature that has the ability to hold something? Choices:  H: walls B: boxes C: chairs D: floors E: surfaces\nOutput: 1: The question gives us an option (F), which is a feature. 2: The question gives us multiple answers (H, B, C, D, and E). We must determine which are features and which are not. 3: Chairs (C) and Floors (D) are objects, not features because they are inanimate materials that are used to hold something. 4: Boxes (B) and Walls (H) are features which have the power to hold something inside them. 5: Surfaces (E) are the correct answer because they can be used to hold something.

Given a hypothetical animal called FishCat, where would FishCat be bigger, weight or length?\"\n2) Discard incorrect answers: If you can eliminate B through C, there should be only one category left to answer.\n3) Consider options on which only FishCat could be compared: There are 4 categories which only fishes can participate in, so you must eliminate D and E.\n4) Find answers which are not correct for the other categories: Length would be incorrect for weight, and weight would be incorrect for length. The remaining options, therefore, are height and personality.\n5) Select the answer which can be applicable to all the categories: Fishes would not be taller than cats, as cats are tetrapods. Neither is fish smell, as most cats are not fish, either.

{"text": "1.\"Where should I be sure to have the reception?\", the question is asking. 2.\"What is a reception?\" A reception is a formal party, typically for a social event that has an official purpose. This means a large social gathering in a grand setting or the equivalent. 3.\"Which choices are the best options for the reception?\" Let's examine each of the answers in greater detail. 4.\"Answer A: Grand casino\". This cannot be chosen because a grand casino is a large venue, but not likely for a reception. Gambling is more likely the intended purpose. 5.\"Answer B: Large room\". A large room could work for a reception, but one would need to find a larger room for that many guests. 6.\"Answer C: Restaurant\". A restaurant would be an excellent choice, but not as grand as a reception and the party would be largely centered around the food. It wouldn't meet the definition of \"grand party\". 7.\"Answer D: Country club\". This cannot be selected because a country club is for a smaller social group than a reception and does not reflect the official function of the party. 8.\"Answer E: Lobby\". A lobby is a common place to meet or have a gathering or party. However, this does not fulfill the requirement of a reception.

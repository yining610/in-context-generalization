The numbers do not follow a simple sequence, except for, 1 being a more common number in the dataset in terms of percentages.\nLook at the feature that you found in lab 3.3 and plot this feature in an overview of a few thousand data points, by getting a glimpse at the distribution of this feature, we can begin to see an idea of what may be causing such a wide variety of numerical values.\nUse the feature you identified in lab 3.4 to classify images into 4 digits that start with 2, find out what percentage of these images are 2's or a 9.\nYou may ask, \"why are there only 3 types of image?\" as there were a fourth type of image as well, which only a small percentage of images had.

Write a shell script to format the weather forecast from a weather.json file.  If the input file contains an error or is truncated, you script should still take the correct format for the weather input.  For example, if the file is called today.json and it contains \"the sky will be clear\", your script should still produce an output of \"Today: Sunny.\"  Your script should expect all the data as a series of JSON format input values, so it should expect \"Today:Sunny, Tomorrow:Cool\"  as the input.  You should output the forecast in a format that any human could interpret.\n\n\n### Bonus", "answer": "A: death"}

Every entry does not match any words. So, we did a simple elimination of dictionary words with the sum of words in the text equaling less than 70K.\n\nWe eliminated another 100 words from the dictionary which are not found in the text. We did a simple elimination: every word found is removed from dictionary and a word not found in the text will not change any search result.\n\nWe decided to print the output words without considering the frequency of output words in the text. We can make an advantage by printing more frequent words in the output and less frequent words in the output, but printing a word which is more frequent in text will also be an advantage.\n\nThen we changed the input text as following;\n\n> The input text is \"Billy called out to John, where did Billy went. Where did John came from.", "answer": "C: play piano"}

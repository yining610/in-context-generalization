I would make the assumption that there are multiple solutions. Since they are asking "Choices:  A: wall C: show"  It doesn't specify that you can't pick "a" or "c" or "show". In fact, if you look at the answers, every single one of them would pass, which means there are a couple of different solutions.<n><n>Answer: Here's my attempt:<n><n>Input: B<n><n>Here you are trying to find a place without water.<n>And since a person cannot be without water for too long, they need to have water,  that is not a place without water is a plumbing which is necessary for life.  So it's a "p" and then it's a plumbing which could be a wall or water pipes.. they are also a show,<n><n>but this doesn't make any sense, since the word 'plumbing' would not make sense and its not water, so i'm going to put in wall.<n><n>Comment: I have accepted your answer because it makes sense. Thank you very much!

I am just about ready to say the entire question is confusing. I was trying to think of a way to do it using string methods, but I really don't know what I am doing. What if it was plumbing? What if it was the bathroom?<n>![Alt text](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*YjVpJXQX7o3QVWpAe86m0w.png)<n>

Write a shell script to format the weather forecast from a weather.json file.  If the input file contains an error or is truncated, you script should still take the correct format for the weather input.  For example, if the file is called today.json and it contains "the sky will be clear", your script should still produce an output of "Today: Sunny."  Your script should expect all the data as a series of JSON format input values, so it should expect "Today:Sunny, Tomorrow:Cool"  as the input.  You should output the forecast in a format that any human could interpret.<n><n><n>### Bonus<n>

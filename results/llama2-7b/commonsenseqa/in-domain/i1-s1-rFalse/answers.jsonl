For instance, we should not walk in the streets while we are intoxicated. What do we do instead?\n\nAnswer: We should refrain from walking in the streets while we do not have enough control so we can behave like a normal human being and make the necessary stops to avoid accidents.\n\nI will argue that this is the right thing to do because, at least, it shows to society that we have dignity and honor by obeying the laws of our country. The laws are made to regulate behavior of the citizens and it is not right to get disobedient.\n\nFirst of all, a normal act of drunkenness is called a party, in fact, when we are enjoying ourselves during a party, we are normally intoxicated, the only difference is that when this is during the day the results are less visible.\n\nAnother example of a disorder called intoxication is called a drunk driving accident. Driving is a serious responsibility, and we have to be calm and vigilant at all times. When we are drunk the ability to stay vigilant will be affected and we will drive our vehicle like dumb animals.\n\nSome people do not have enough control on their own drinking. Some of them can only stop drinking when they are in bed, others only when they are very sick or even when they are dying.\n\nI support the idea that people are responsible for their own actions and that there are no excuses for not obeying some rules, either the laws made by societies or personal obligations such as promises and agreements.\n\nInput for your second part: If one were going to start a business what would be the", "answer": "C: say goodbye"}

White-space: \nThere is too much white space. You have to learn to create proper, readable, understandable code. It should not be just a list of instructions to the computer.\n\n2. Repeating code: \nI have moved the variable to a function just like you did to me (with no reason). \nThere is no reason to have function called **\"Find a location\"** when it does such a broad range of things, and I should repeat it so the same code is in two different situations.\n3. Conditional statements: \n\nThe else and the if statements should be nested under the if.\nConditional statements should follow the same format every time.\nThere is no need to write something like **if (question == \"home\").**\n\n4.", "answer": "B: high school"}

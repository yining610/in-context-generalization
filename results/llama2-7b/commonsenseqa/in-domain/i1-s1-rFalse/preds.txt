In both cases average is less than 0 and hence we reject the point (x, y) for any real x and y.<n><n>Let us consider (x,y) is such that x - y = 0, then x = y, so (x,y) are integers, so reject this point.<n><n>Lets consider (x,y), where y = 0 then again x = 0, we get (0,0), so (0,0) is a special case, it does not affect our problem.<n><n>When we reject the above sets, we can choose x > 0 and y > 0. We can find a unique pair (2,1) whose average comes to 1/2 not a number.<n><n>### Dummy Answer<n>

For instance, we should not walk in the streets while we are intoxicated. What do we do instead?<n><n>Answer: We should refrain from walking in the streets while we do not have enough control so we can behave like a normal human being and make the necessary stops to avoid accidents.<n><n>I will argue that this is the right thing to do because, at least, it shows to society that we have dignity and honor by obeying the laws of our country. The laws are made to regulate behavior of the citizens and it is not right to get disobedient.<n><n>First of all, a normal act of drunkenness is called a party, in fact, when we are enjoying ourselves during a party, we are normally intoxicated, the only difference is that when this is during the day the results are less visible.<n><n>Another example of a disorder called intoxication is called a drunk driving accident. Driving is a serious responsibility, and we have to be calm and vigilant at all times. When we are drunk the ability to stay vigilant will be affected and we will drive our vehicle like dumb animals.<n><n>Some people do not have enough control on their own drinking. Some of them can only stop drinking when they are in bed, others only when they are very sick or even when they are dying.<n><n>I support the idea that people are responsible for their own actions and that there are no excuses for not obeying some rules, either the laws made by societies or personal obligations such as promises and agreements.<n><n>Input for your second part: If one were going to start a business what would be the

To get an exact count you would need to do a separate question for the each location.<n>

The statement after it is what should happen? What is followed by a noun (game) and then the question is asking "what kind of game needs more players?" so the answer choices are (A) which does not make sense because if there is a need for more players than not having more players does it mean you dont need it? no, so it cannot be answer A, (B) needs one player so it cannot the answer, (C) which I believe is tug of war meaning (D) which is the correct answer that needs more than one player because tug of war needs more players then what I will say is "what other kind of game needs more then one player" but then I will say "that doesn't matter" so in the question that needs more than one players is sufficient.
